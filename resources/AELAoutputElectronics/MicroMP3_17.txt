{"text":"Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.\nAfter a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.\nI tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results.\nI emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.\nI tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version.\nI'm less than satisfied.\nIt seems like the software is just not responding.\nThe support has been less than impressive, considering the cost.\nThey responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my \"jukebox\" needed to be purged.\nI'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":346,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":340},{"endOffset":812,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":809},{"endOffset":812,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":809},{"endOffset":812,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":809},{"endOffset":849,"mention":"jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":842},{"endOffset":849,"mention":"jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":842},{"endOffset":849,"mention":"jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":842},{"endOffset":849,"mention":"jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":842},{"endOffset":849,"mention":"jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":842},{"endOffset":849,"mention":"jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":842}]}
