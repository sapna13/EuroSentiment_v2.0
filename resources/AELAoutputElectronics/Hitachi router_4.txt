{"text":"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.\nBut it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.\nI built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.\nAlso stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.\nHave to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.\nSo for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.\nHappy woodworking!!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":246,"mention":"tilt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_TyTN_II"],"startOffset":242},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":250}]}
