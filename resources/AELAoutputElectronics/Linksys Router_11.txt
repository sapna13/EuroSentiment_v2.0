{"text":"I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed.\nHowever, this product performed well below my expectation.\nThe Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.\nI use Apple iTunes to stream music to my stereo via the Linksys router.\nAlthough it will work for a few minutes, it will eventually hang.\nThis behavior (hanging) also occurs when I transfer large files between my PCs.\nAfter some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).\nIf you just use the router to surf the web, this router should serve your needs.\nAs I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.\nIn addition it is very easy to setup.\nI w!\nanted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.\nHowever, since it is not being able to perform its core function adequately, it doesn't deserve any higher.\nThe reader can find a better product with the competition and at a lower cost.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":235,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":230},{"endOffset":235,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":230},{"endOffset":235,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":230},{"endOffset":299,"mention":"Apple iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":287},{"endOffset":299,"mention":"Apple iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":287},{"endOffset":315,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":310},{"endOffset":497,"mention":"PCs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Personal_Computer"],"startOffset":494},{"endOffset":529,"mention":"Net","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/.NET_Framework"],"startOffset":526},{"endOffset":915,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":911},{"endOffset":915,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":911},{"endOffset":915,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":911},{"endOffset":1074,"mention":"reader","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Acrobat"],"startOffset":1068},{"endOffset":1074,"mention":"reader","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Acrobat"],"startOffset":1068}]}
