{"text":"this is a great camera for you !\nthe canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an \" auto \" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .\ni can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !\ni love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .\ni was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .\nwarning - i did read the manual !\nbut if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !\nonce i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .\nwith a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .\nthe manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .\nit does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !\nthis camera also has a great feel and weight to it .\nyou feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .\nthe more i work with it , the more i love it !\ni would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !\ni did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":383,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AppleWorks"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":383,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AppleWorks"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":383,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AppleWorks"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":952,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":946},{"endOffset":1535,"mention":"ease","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/At_Ease"],"startOffset":1531}]}
