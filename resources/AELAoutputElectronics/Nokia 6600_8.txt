{"text":"Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.\nI own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.\nBought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.\nHandsfree future is good, but not too exciting.\nCamera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.\nOnly thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":246,"mention":"Outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":239},{"endOffset":270,"mention":"movies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":264},{"endOffset":298,"mention":"movies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":292}]}
