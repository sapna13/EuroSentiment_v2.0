{"text":"I have an RCA cable modem with RCN as my ISP.\nA great service which I highly recommend.\nI recently bought the Linksys G-Router after getting my hp laptop needing to setup wireless at home.\nI got it to work with no problem but then I experienced bandwidth loss and constant connectivity issues.\nI wrongly thought that it was the router.\nFool that I was!\nAfter countless attempts at recycling the modem and WPA keys etc.\n,I finally figured out that the modem could not support the wireless router and it had a short, plus RCA no longer carried it and the thing was ugly, taking up space.\nI've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!!\nBe sure to call your ISP with the modem's MAC address to get online.\nYOU WON'T get connected otherwise.\nMy ISP had me up and running within 5 minutes.\nAlso some ISP's give you a discount if you supply your own modem.\n!\nCheck it out.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":742,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":739},{"endOffset":742,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":739},{"endOffset":742,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":739},{"endOffset":742,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":739}]}
