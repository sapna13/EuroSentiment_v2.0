{"text":"I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.\nIt doesn't bog down under load.\nCuts are easy and smooth.\nI use it on a router table, and it is works well.\nThe major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.\nI replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.\nTwo, the single wrench just doesn't work well.\nThe sliding latch is does not stay in place.\nIt is almost all you can do to change bits with two hands (you need three).\nI am trying to purchase a second wrench, and I think it will improve the function greatly.\nOther than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.\nI really liked the price...\n","annotations":[]}
