{"text":"I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.\nInitially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.\nSo on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.\nThe good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.\n2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.\n3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.\nNow the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.\n3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.\nThe battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.\n2) Phone is awfully slow.\nSometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.\n3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.\nLooks big in the display ads though.\n4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.\nThere will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.\n5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the \"Free picture and video messaging\" offered by service provider.\nSo my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.\nThe bottom line is \"Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones\".\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":30,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":20},{"endOffset":30,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":20},{"endOffset":30,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":20},{"endOffset":359,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":353},{"endOffset":592,"mention":"stuff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/StuffIt"],"startOffset":587},{"endOffset":750,"mention":"stuff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/StuffIt"],"startOffset":745},{"endOffset":998,"mention":"ads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Advantage_Database_Server"],"startOffset":995},{"endOffset":998,"mention":"ads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Advantage_Database_Server"],"startOffset":995},{"endOffset":1474,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":1470},{"endOffset":1474,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":1470},{"endOffset":1518,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1512},{"endOffset":1518,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1512}]}
