{"text":"i received this as a gift for christmas .\nmy first impression was positive .\nafter using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .\nfirst , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .\nat first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .\nit was just a problem with the player .\nsecond , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .\nthe toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .\nthe general button placement is not very user friendly .\nthis would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .\nthird , the poor design continues with the case .\nthe flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .\nit also covers over the power jack when closed .\nafter the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .\ni bought an ipod and am very happy with it .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":25,"mention":"gift","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GiFT"],"startOffset":21},{"endOffset":61,"mention":"impression","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/PhotoImpression"],"startOffset":51},{"endOffset":61,"mention":"impression","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/PhotoImpression"],"startOffset":51},{"endOffset":61,"mention":"impression","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/PhotoImpression"],"startOffset":51},{"endOffset":447,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":441},{"endOffset":606,"mention":"general","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Command_&_Conquer:_Generals"],"startOffset":599},{"endOffset":606,"mention":"general","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Command_&_Conquer:_Generals"],"startOffset":599},{"endOffset":845,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":839},{"endOffset":919,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":915},{"endOffset":919,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":915},{"endOffset":919,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":915}]}
