{"text":"It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.\nIf you have good networking knowledge, you'll abandon the wizard, use the 100-page online manual, and be fine.\nI know more about networking than 70% of the consumers out there, so I was able to puzzle my way through it, but only by second guessing the documentation at various stages.\nThe Wizard is particularly sinister.\nIt just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC.\nAfter asking for a password (Is it asking me to set a password or am I supposed to know from page 20 of the manual that the factory set password is \"admin\"?) it refused to go past step 8.\nThese are just some of the pathetic examples.\nThey!\nprovide no printed manual.\nI had downloaded the 112 page manual from the Linksys Website.\nStupid me.\nIt turns out to be copyright 2002 and much inferior to the 2005 manual included on the CD.\nBut can you decide to access the CD manual once you have started the Wizard?\nNo, of course not.\nYou have to completely exit the Wizard and re-start the CD in order to find the \"User Guide\" tab which loads the manual.\nThe box proudly displays \"SecureEasySetup (TM)\" \"Wireless Made Simple\" \"One Touch Setup Button\" \"Easy Start\" \"Easy Security\" \"Easy Everyday\"   Apparently Linksys\/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial.\nIt just doesn't follow through in any consumer-tested way.\nI don't know if Netgear, D-Link, etc are any better.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":59,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":53},{"endOffset":59,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":53},{"endOffset":59,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":53},{"endOffset":110,"mention":"networking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NetworKing"],"startOffset":100},{"endOffset":147,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":141},{"endOffset":147,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":141},{"endOffset":222,"mention":"networking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NetworKing"],"startOffset":212},{"endOffset":378,"mention":"Wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":372},{"endOffset":378,"mention":"Wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":372},{"endOffset":378,"mention":"Wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":372},{"endOffset":378,"mention":"Wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":372},{"endOffset":628,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":622},{"endOffset":1182,"mention":"Wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":1176},{"endOffset":1241,"mention":"Wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":1235},{"endOffset":1241,"mention":"Wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":1235},{"endOffset":1405,"mention":"Touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1400},{"endOffset":1405,"mention":"Touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1400},{"endOffset":1507,"mention":"ease","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/At_Ease"],"startOffset":1503}]}
