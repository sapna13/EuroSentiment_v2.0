{"text":"We used this diaper pail from the day we brought our son home, until about 13 months.\nThat's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!\nEven when empty!\nSo, I took it to the tub, scrub it down with disinfectant.\nIt still smelled.\nSo then I used straight bleach.\nThat seemed to work -- for about 3 days.\nThen it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.\nHowever, for the previous 13 months-this is what I encountered - PROS -\nUsing your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.\nThe height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.\nIts stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.\nCONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.\nAlso, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.\nDiapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first.\nMy toddler thought rotating the  top was fun-he always wanted to play with it\n(Being a diaper pail, I'd prefer he not be enticed by something so unsanitary.)\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":527,"mention":"reach","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Halo:_Reach"],"startOffset":522},{"endOffset":634,"mention":"CONS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":630},{"endOffset":634,"mention":"CONS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":630},{"endOffset":634,"mention":"CONS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":630},{"endOffset":634,"mention":"CONS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":630},{"endOffset":634,"mention":"CONS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":630},{"endOffset":700,"mention":"sharp","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/J_Sharp"],"startOffset":695},{"endOffset":700,"mention":"sharp","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/J_Sharp"],"startOffset":695},{"endOffset":700,"mention":"sharp","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/J_Sharp"],"startOffset":695},{"endOffset":700,"mention":"sharp","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/J_Sharp"],"startOffset":695},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":977}]}
