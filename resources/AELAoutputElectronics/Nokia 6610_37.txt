{"text":"the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .\nwhen i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .\nafter using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .\nit is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .\nthe ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .\nunfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .\nwhen i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .\nthe resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !\nthe phone has several color schemes you can choose from .\ni like the default blue .\nyou can also set a background wallpaper .\nthe ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?\nno more annoying series of beeps .\nthis phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .\nyou can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .\nthe massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .\nthe phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar \/ organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .\nthe gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .\nyou can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .\nthe service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .\none downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .\ntheir website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .\ni have been assured this will be fixed soon .\nnow , for the t-mobile service :\ni cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .\nif you have a question , they have the answer .\nand should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .\nevery phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .\nall my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .\ni 'd like to see my old carrier do that !\nthe rate plans are also very good , at least for me .\ndifferent people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .\nthe phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .\nthis phone is highly recommended otherwise
