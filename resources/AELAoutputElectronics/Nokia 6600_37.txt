{"text":"This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.\nI purchased this phone after researching many different phones, mostly Nokia's that were T-Mobile compatiable.\nAmong my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.\nThe 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.\nOne primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.\nIf you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.\nFor the linux users out there who are intrested in my setup: I'm running Debian (Knoppix 3.4) with a custom 2.6.7 kernel.\nOn a DELL Inspiron 8200 with a P4 2.0ghz system with 1gb RAM.\nThe KDE Bluez system for bluetooth support.\nI have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.\nAlthough the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.\nAnd the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3\/SMTP e-mail account.\nI will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.\nThe phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.\nWhich is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.\nYou can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.\nThe fact that you can assign ringtones to people and\/or groups is really cool.\nApparently some phones don't allow you to give an entire group a ringtone.\nI will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.\nSometimes, various applications crash.\nEspecially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.\nThis is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)\nI'm used to having to restart things.\nOn average, I prolly restart the phone every two days.\nI use this phone exculsivly with a Jabra Freespeak 250.\nI really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.\nThe only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.\nIt takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.\nHowever, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.\nSome people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name \"the bar of soap\" which, it really is.\nBut if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.\nAll in all, this is a great phone.\nEspecially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).\nIf you use linux and want GRPS and\/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device, and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":243,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":237},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":500},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":500},{"endOffset":597,"mention":"Linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux_kernel"],"startOffset":592},{"endOffset":597,"mention":"Linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux_kernel"],"startOffset":592},{"endOffset":645,"mention":"net","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/.NET_Framework"],"startOffset":642},{"endOffset":724,"mention":"linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":719},{"endOffset":790,"mention":"Debian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Debian"],"startOffset":784},{"endOffset":799,"mention":"Knoppix","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Knoppix"],"startOffset":792},{"endOffset":818,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":812},{"endOffset":831,"mention":"kernel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux_kernel"],"startOffset":825},{"endOffset":1365,"mention":"MIDI","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MIDI_Maze"],"startOffset":1361},{"endOffset":1463,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1458},{"endOffset":1471,"mention":"MIDI","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MIDI_Maze"],"startOffset":1467},{"endOffset":1471,"mention":"MIDI","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MIDI_Maze"],"startOffset":1467},{"endOffset":1498,"mention":"net","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/.NET_Framework"],"startOffset":1495},{"endOffset":1568,"mention":"linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":1563},{"endOffset":2117,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":2110},{"endOffset":2117,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":2110},{"endOffset":2117,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":2110},{"endOffset":2117,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":2110},{"endOffset":2667,"mention":"dos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/PTS-DOS"],"startOffset":2664},{"endOffset":2667,"mention":"dos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/PTS-DOS"],"startOffset":2664},{"endOffset":2667,"mention":"dos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/PTS-DOS"],"startOffset":2664},{"endOffset":2826,"mention":"bar","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle"],"startOffset":2823},{"endOffset":3104,"mention":"linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":3099},{"endOffset":3104,"mention":"linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":3099}]}
