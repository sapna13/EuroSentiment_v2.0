{"text":"summary :\nlots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .\npros :\nexcellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .\nthere was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .\ntransfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .\ni found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .\nhowever , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .\nyou have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .\nthis would have been much easier .\nthe nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .\ni found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .\nthis almost made it worth the price alone .\ni was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .\nhuge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .\n30gb is more than enough for most people .\nhaving usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .\nit only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .\nit took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .\ncons :\nnavigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .\nthis is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .\nit would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .\nyou can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .\nwhe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.\nfm receiver - it has none .\ni would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .\nthat way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .\ncheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .\nthe player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .\ni 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .\nas a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .\nthe top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .\ni could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .\nthis is not a player you can take jogging .\nthe songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .\nyou have to add them to the playing list .\ni can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .\nyou have to add all the songs to a play list .\nthere is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .\nsoftware - the software is crap .\ni use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .\notherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .\nlike most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .\neven after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .\ni would recommend replacing the existing software with the \" notmad explorer , \" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .\nno line out jack - as i said , there is none .\nthe headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .\nso you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .\nit sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .\ncontrols are a bit awkward .\nthe controls definately took some getting used to .\nit was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .\nwhen i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .\na sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .\ni want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .\ncrappy headphones .\nthe included earbuds were uncomfortable .\ni would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .\ndifficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say \" difficult , \" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .\nit is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .\ni think this is it 's biggest flaw .\ni would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .\nup , down , left , and right would have given me better control .\nif you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get \" stuck \" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .\ncase - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .\nit would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .\nthat way i could keep it in the case all the time .\nas it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .\nyou can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .\noverall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .\ni am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement
