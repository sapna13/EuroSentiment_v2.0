{"text":"I also reviewed Norton System Works 2004\/Professional.\nThis product has virtually all the same installation problems.\nFor purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.\nSomething happened with this release for Norton System Works (2004) and for \"Internet Security 2004\".\nThis is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.\nIt has saved my system on more than one occasion, and makes disc clean up a snap.\nThe antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.\nI think their antivirus software was one of, if not the best, on the\nWell, no more.\nThis version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.\nThey are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.\nThe biggest problem is the installation.\nAlso if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and\/or the process of updating Internet Security.\nI've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.\nWhy they brought this to market is beyond me.\nFirst, it serious, serious installation problems.\nBack in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.\nSince then, I have had one problem after another.\nTo say that it is \"buggy\" would be the world's most profound understatement.\nAlmost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.\nFirst, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.\nWhen I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.\nThe next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.\nWithout this important feature, both SystemWorks and Internet Security are all but useless.\nWithout updated virus definiations, your PC is also at serious risk!\nOnce installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).\nThese tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.\nBut this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.\nThe other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.\nWarning! The Windows \"remove program\" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.\nA lot of \"fragments\" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.\nTheir website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the \"Programs\" directory.\nIf you have an older version of \"Internet Security\" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.\nYou also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.\n(Intructions for doing so are on Symantecs website.)\nEven this, however, did not solve my problems.\nAs of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.\nI just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.\nOnce again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.\nThe best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.\nPersonally, I may never buy Symantect products again.\nAnd that's a shame.\nThey use to be so useful and neceesary.\nNo longer.\nAvoid this product at all costs.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":22,"mention":"Norton","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Norton_360"],"startOffset":16},{"endOffset":35,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":30},{"endOffset":333,"mention":"Norton","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Norton_360"],"startOffset":327},{"endOffset":346,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":341},{"endOffset":333,"mention":"Norton","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Norton_360"],"startOffset":327},{"endOffset":346,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":341},{"endOffset":606,"mention":"snap","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap"],"startOffset":602},{"endOffset":1064,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1059},{"endOffset":1064,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1059},{"endOffset":1064,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1059},{"endOffset":1613,"mention":"beginning","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Populous:_The_Beginning"],"startOffset":1604},{"endOffset":1912,"mention":"virus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virus:_The_Game"],"startOffset":1907},{"endOffset":2039,"mention":"virus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virus:_The_Game"],"startOffset":2034},{"endOffset":2567,"mention":"Norton","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Norton_360"],"startOffset":2561},{"endOffset":2626,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":2619},{"endOffset":2796,"mention":"Norton","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Norton_360"],"startOffset":2790}]}
