{"text":"I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.\nThe machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.\nAfter installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.\nI tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.\nI was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.\nOf course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.\nNow I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?\nAnd t!\nhis is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?\nI think I'll stick to CDs.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":262,"mention":"burning","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BurningMUD"],"startOffset":255},{"endOffset":262,"mention":"burning","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BurningMUD"],"startOffset":255},{"endOffset":472,"mention":"virus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Virus:_The_Game"],"startOffset":467},{"endOffset":1032,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":1029},{"endOffset":1039,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1033},{"endOffset":1066,"mention":"CDs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":1063}]}
