{"text":"the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .\ni bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .\nit does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .\nit did also seem to have a strong \" new electronics \" smell for some time .\nthe only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with \" canned air . \"\nthis problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .\nthe two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .\n( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )\nthe fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .\nthe remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .\ni especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .\nwhile it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .\ni also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .\nthe zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .\nhaving spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .\ni have not used the progressive scan feature .\nthis model has come down in price since i purchased mine .\nwhile it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .\nany possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .\nwhile i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":189,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":185},{"endOffset":197,"mention":"air","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime"],"startOffset":194},{"endOffset":347,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":341},{"endOffset":347,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":341},{"endOffset":452,"mention":"air","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime"],"startOffset":449},{"endOffset":538,"mention":"dust","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dust:_A_Tale_of_the_Wired_West"],"startOffset":534},{"endOffset":1015,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":1009},{"endOffset":1015,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":1009},{"endOffset":1015,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":1009},{"endOffset":1015,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":1009},{"endOffset":1139,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1135},{"endOffset":1363,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1357},{"endOffset":1546,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":1543},{"endOffset":1668,"mention":"gear","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gears_of_War"],"startOffset":1664},{"endOffset":1668,"mention":"gear","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gears_of_War"],"startOffset":1664},{"endOffset":1956,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1950}]}
