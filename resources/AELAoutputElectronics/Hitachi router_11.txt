{"text":"My first experience with this router was when I was working in a professional window and door shop.\nThe owner had three routers - all M12's.\nThis was my first real introduction to serious routing and I thought that the M12 was just a router.\nIn the last 8 years since then I have done a ton of routing and have messed around with a bunch of different machines.\nAfter getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.\nOn top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.\nI use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.\nThe only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.\nUnless you routinely use it like this (which I do to cut mortises on the woodrat) then you will never notice.\nIf it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":93,"mention":"door","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Door_Door"],"startOffset":89},{"endOffset":222,"mention":"M12","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Beretta_M12"],"startOffset":219},{"endOffset":390,"mention":"M12","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Beretta_M12"],"startOffset":387},{"endOffset":426,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":423},{"endOffset":426,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":423},{"endOffset":457,"mention":"ultra","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Ultra"],"startOffset":452}]}
