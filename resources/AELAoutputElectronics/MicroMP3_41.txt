{"text":"I must say, after tons of research, I have chosen the right Mp3 player.\nThis player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.\nThe sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.\nThe radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.\nThe software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!\nI'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!\nMine came with a wall adapter, but it charges when plugged into the computer anyways.\nThe blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.\nOverall I have no complaints, this is jus!\nt simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":70,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":64},{"endOffset":83,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":77},{"endOffset":83,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":77},{"endOffset":83,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":77},{"endOffset":83,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":77},{"endOffset":283,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":278},{"endOffset":287,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":284},{"endOffset":283,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":278},{"endOffset":287,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":284},{"endOffset":283,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":278},{"endOffset":287,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":284},{"endOffset":283,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":278},{"endOffset":287,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":284},{"endOffset":283,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":278},{"endOffset":287,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":284},{"endOffset":283,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":278},{"endOffset":287,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":284},{"endOffset":862,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":858},{"endOffset":862,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":858},{"endOffset":891,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":885},{"endOffset":1007,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1001}]}
