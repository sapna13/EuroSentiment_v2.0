{"text":"My daughter is now 2 and 1\/2, and I am still enjoying this product.\nWe purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.\nWe liked it because:\n1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.\n2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.\n3. It never smelled - at all.\nHere's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.\nI don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.\nI just know it really worked for us.\nThe container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.\nWe graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump.\n","annotations":[]}
