Not too small, and not too big.\nThe screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.\nAnd, other else,  the camera is still VGA.\nI must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.\nSometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.\nWhat's wrong with it?\nIs it really slow, or what?\nFew month ago, it's very popular among my community.\nIt's good.\nBut not good enough for me.\n:!
