{"text":"Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.\nI use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.\nGave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.\nSaw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.\nUNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.\nBoth the on\/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.\nIt is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.\nI use custom side clamps set up for 1\/4 and 1\/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).\nUnlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).\nLIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:\n1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.\nMine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).\nI have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.\nNot a killer problem, but not well done, either.\n2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1\/4 inch counterparts.\nHave read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.\nI do woodworking as a serious hobby.\nFor me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.\nCan recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":189,"mention":"Grizzly","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/M1_Abrams"],"startOffset":182},{"endOffset":575,"mention":"reach","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Halo:_Reach"],"startOffset":570},{"endOffset":710,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":704},{"endOffset":710,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":704},{"endOffset":990,"mention":"saw","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saw_II:_Flesh_&_Blood"],"startOffset":987},{"endOffset":990,"mention":"saw","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saw_II:_Flesh_&_Blood"],"startOffset":987},{"endOffset":1120,"mention":"spring","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Spring_Framework"],"startOffset":1114},{"endOffset":1756,"mention":"arena","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Quake_III_Arena"],"startOffset":1751},{"endOffset":1756,"mention":"arena","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Quake_III_Arena"],"startOffset":1751}]}
