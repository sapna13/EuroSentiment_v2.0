{"text":"after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .\nfor the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .\na 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .\ni think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .\nthe buttons and interface are very easy to use .\nsimple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .\nbut the major problem i had was with the software .\nyou are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .\nthe instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .\nthe quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .\ni tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .\ni tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .\nwell that was not a simple task .\ni ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .\ni think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .\nbuy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":37,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":34},{"endOffset":532,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":527},{"endOffset":532,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":527},{"endOffset":605,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":599},{"endOffset":1132,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1126},{"endOffset":1193,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1186},{"endOffset":1200,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1194},{"endOffset":1193,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1186},{"endOffset":1200,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1194},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1314,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1308},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1314,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1308},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1314,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1308},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1314,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1308},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1314,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1308}]}
