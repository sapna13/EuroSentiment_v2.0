{"text":"Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!\nWow... just less than 15 minutes and the back of it already has a scratch!\nSo dissapointing, however I am now just gonna assume it's gonna get pretty niceley scratched over the years and I'll just have to live with it... and i will buy a case for it tomorrow... I mean heck I intended to get the case tomorow anyway but now it feels like the thing might even scratch IN THE CASE.. Other than that I am super extied about this product... I will update the review later in a few days...\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":114,"mention":"scratch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Scratch:_The_Ultimate_DJ"],"startOffset":107}]}
