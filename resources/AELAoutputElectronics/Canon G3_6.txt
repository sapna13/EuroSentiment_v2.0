{"text":"the camera has a wonderful set of features .\nthe lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .\nyou can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .\nthe optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .\nthe highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .\ni have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .\nthe canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .\nthe only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .\nthe menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .\nit is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":59,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":53}]}
