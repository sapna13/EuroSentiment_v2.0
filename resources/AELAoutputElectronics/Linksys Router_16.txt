{"text":"I bought this in order to upgrade from an old 802.11b router to g technology, and I spent several hours trying to get it to work.\nThe installation software CD crashed repeatedly.\nThinking the CD was faulty, I went to the Linksys website, hoping to simply download the setup program, but it's not available.\nI then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.\nI'm returning this, as I'm not willing to waste more time trying to contact tech support, particularly in light of the comments of other reviewers who have done so.\nVery disappointing.\n","annotations":[]}
