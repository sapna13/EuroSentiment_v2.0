{"text":"I have had this little gem for four months now.\nIt has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.\nI had a regular Canon Elph (APS), as well as a JVC digital camera.\nI was looking for a blend of the two and so I bought this camera.\nI'll share some observations that may differ a bit from what other reviewers have noted.\n1) It is perhaps too small.\nI find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.\nIts size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).\n2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots.\nThis is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.\n3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card\n(I got a 64 meg card for $... and it holds 105 pics at 1600 x 1200 res).\n4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.\nIt is hot enough to be annoying.\nCanon says it's normal.\nI have found it gets less warm with the LCD off.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":26,"mention":"gem","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RubyGems"],"startOffset":23},{"endOffset":141,"mention":"advantage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Advantage_Database_Server"],"startOffset":132},{"endOffset":252,"mention":"blend","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Expression_Blend"],"startOffset":247}]}
