{"text":"I've been incredibly happy with this camera.\nThis camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.\nIt's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.\nExposure compensation in 1\/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1\/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).\nSlow-syncro flash, macro\/infinity mode, etc.\nThe zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.\nThe SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":172,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":167},{"endOffset":172,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":167},{"endOffset":172,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":167},{"endOffset":347,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":342}]}
