{"text":"and we still LOVE it!\nWe have been using the Diaper Genie for the past 17 months and are very happy with it.\nWe opted to purchase this diaper pail even though my SIL gave us her used diaper pail (the other popular pail. one that uses its own brand of bags) for free--and we are VERY glad we did.\nHere's what we love about this pail.\n*holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!\n(we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!\n*holds the odor in nicely!\n(every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.\nSpraying down the inside of the container (and letting it air out) periodically definitely helps.\nWe keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":57,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Genie_Backup_Manager"],"startOffset":52},{"endOffset":874,"mention":"air","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime"],"startOffset":871},{"endOffset":974,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":970},{"endOffset":974,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":970}]}
