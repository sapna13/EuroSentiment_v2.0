{"text":"I got this for my aunt who pretty much knows nothing about computers.\nIt took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems.\nMake sure you read the documentation CLEARLY if you dont know what you're doing.\nthere are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging\/stealing your bandwidth.\nAnd the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow.\nA very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years.\nI'd also recommend wireless products made by Belkin.\ni've had their wireless card for my laptop since 2000 and it has rarely given me problems.\n","annotations":[]}
