{"text":"After much research I decided that the Zen Micro was the best mp3 player for me.\nUnfortunately I was wrong.\nWithin one month, my player completely died.\n(It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.\nSo I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.\nFrustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!\nI had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling\/humming\/buzzing sound while music was played.\nI've tried different headphones, upgrading firmware, using different files and nothing helps.\nI sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.\nI've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.\nIt was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.\nIt's too bad, though, that !\nI don't want to keep testing my luck.\nThis time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":42,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":39},{"endOffset":65,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":62},{"endOffset":72,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":66},{"endOffset":135,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":129},{"endOffset":135,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":129},{"endOffset":135,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":129},{"endOffset":257,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":252},{"endOffset":264,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":258},{"endOffset":257,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":252},{"endOffset":264,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":258},{"endOffset":257,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":252},{"endOffset":264,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":258},{"endOffset":257,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":252},{"endOffset":264,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":258},{"endOffset":443,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":437},{"endOffset":443,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":437},{"endOffset":443,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":437},{"endOffset":580,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":575},{"endOffset":580,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":575},{"endOffset":580,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":575},{"endOffset":912,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":906},{"endOffset":1093,"mention":"iPod mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":1084}]}
