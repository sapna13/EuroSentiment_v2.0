{"text":"i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .\ni read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .\ndespite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .\nafter some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .\ni purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .\nfirst , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .\nit was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .\ncreative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .\nthe new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .\npoint the \" media sniffer \" to your music files and let it do the rest .\nyou can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .\nand with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .\nyou can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .\nthe sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .\ni thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .\nthey could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .\ni 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .\nthere are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .\nit ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .\nhowever , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .\nit happened to me once .\nso now i keep it in my pocket .\nalso , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .\nit would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .\nthat 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though
