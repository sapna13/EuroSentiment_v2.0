{"text":"I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.\nI use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.\n1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.\nThe Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience.\nThe light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.\nThe player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).\nIt feels tiny in the hand without it.\nThe stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk.\nThe belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot.\nThe blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read.\nThe touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.\nThe touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.\nReliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.\nThe hardcase they give with it must work well.\nIt feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.\nSound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.\nI have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.\nBest of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.\nUtility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.\nIts not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.\nThe songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.\nThe interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.\nSoftware The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well.\nCreating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.\nThere are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.\nSecond might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":20,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":14},{"endOffset":309,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mario_Party_3"],"startOffset":306},{"endOffset":352,"mention":"black","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Twisted_Metal:_Black"],"startOffset":347},{"endOffset":386,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":382},{"endOffset":928,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":923},{"endOffset":928,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":923},{"endOffset":1028,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1023},{"endOffset":1028,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1023},{"endOffset":1028,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1023},{"endOffset":1028,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1023},{"endOffset":1150,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1144},{"endOffset":1150,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1144},{"endOffset":1304,"mention":"carbon","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Need_for_Speed:_Carbon"],"startOffset":1298},{"endOffset":1373,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1367},{"endOffset":1373,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1367},{"endOffset":1473,"mention":"ipod mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":1464},{"endOffset":1738,"mention":"name","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BIND"],"startOffset":1734},{"endOffset":1780,"mention":"outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1773},{"endOffset":1801,"mention":"gem","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RubyGems"],"startOffset":1798},{"endOffset":2404,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2398},{"endOffset":2404,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2398},{"endOffset":2404,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2398},{"endOffset":2481,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":2474},{"endOffset":2570,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":2566}]}
