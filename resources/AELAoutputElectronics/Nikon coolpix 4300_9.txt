{"text":"after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .\ni currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .\nhowever , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .\nanyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .\nfocusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .\npictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .\npictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .\nthe store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .\nanyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .\ni 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .\nhowever , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":451,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":447},{"endOffset":529,"mention":"shade","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sonic_Chronicles:_The_Dark_Brotherhood"],"startOffset":524}]}
