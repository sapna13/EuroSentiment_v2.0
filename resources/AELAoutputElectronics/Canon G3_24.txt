{"text":"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .\nprior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .\nno one told me , but i wanted to tell you .\nthis is not the same thing as a film camera .\nand while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .\nthey have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .\nmost of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .\nbut once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :\nit sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .\ni am not talking milliseconds .\npicture this :\nyour child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .\nwhen it arrives , you press the shutter release .\nsplash !\nthe moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .\nperhaps there is a way around this delay .\nsome feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .\nyes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .\nyes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .\nbut after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .\ni own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .\nit focuses in a snap .\ndim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .\ncanon 's g3 does it consistently .\nit feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .\ni challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .\nand so i must ask , what are cameras for ?\nwhat task do they perform ?\ncameras capture moments .\nthey stop time .\nbecause once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .\nthe dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .\na 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .\nnot all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .\nlike i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .\nso buy the g3 .\nbuy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .\nbut do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .\nfrom a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .\nunfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":871,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":930,"mention":"splash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tetris_Splash"],"startOffset":924},{"endOffset":943,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":937},{"endOffset":943,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":937},{"endOffset":943,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":937},{"endOffset":943,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":937},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1244},{"endOffset":1433,"mention":"snap","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Snap"],"startOffset":1429},{"endOffset":1902,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1896},{"endOffset":1902,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1896},{"endOffset":1902,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1896},{"endOffset":2169,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2163},{"endOffset":2169,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2163},{"endOffset":2311,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2305},{"endOffset":2311,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2305},{"endOffset":2311,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2305},{"endOffset":2423,"mention":"iphoto","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPhoto"],"startOffset":2417},{"endOffset":2423,"mention":"iphoto","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPhoto"],"startOffset":2417},{"endOffset":2423,"mention":"iphoto","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPhoto"],"startOffset":2417},{"endOffset":2423,"mention":"iphoto","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPhoto"],"startOffset":2417},{"endOffset":2605,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":2602},{"endOffset":2617,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":2613},{"endOffset":2797,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2791}]}
