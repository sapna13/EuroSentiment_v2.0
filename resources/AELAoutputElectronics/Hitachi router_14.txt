{"text":"I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.\nIt is quiet and has plenty of power.\nI find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.\nThat said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.\nShortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.\nAfter repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.\nI no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.\nIf the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.\nIf the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.\n","annotations":[]}
