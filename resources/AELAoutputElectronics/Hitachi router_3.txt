{"text":"I looked at this router and bought a Makita.\nThe Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.\nI have hade such poor luck with other tools (a Bosch drill) made in Malasyia, that I could not see getting it.\nIf you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.\n","annotations":[]}
