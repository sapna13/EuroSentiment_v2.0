{"text":"Still not so sure about this one...\nFirst, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.\nSo far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.\nThis is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.\nIn addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.\nAgain, another hassle.\nTo be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.\nBut enought of the negativity.\nI have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.\nSound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).\nOther than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.\nSomeone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.\nI have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.\nAs for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.\nI haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that.\nAll in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.\nIn conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4\/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.\nIn the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money.\nDo your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":851,"mention":"source","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Counter-Strike:_Source"],"startOffset":845},{"endOffset":851,"mention":"source","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Counter-Strike:_Source"],"startOffset":845},{"endOffset":1120,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":1117},{"endOffset":1241,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1235},{"endOffset":1287,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1280},{"endOffset":1300,"mention":"Player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1294},{"endOffset":1318,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1315},{"endOffset":1325,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1319},{"endOffset":1318,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1315},{"endOffset":1325,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1319},{"endOffset":1682,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":1677}]}
