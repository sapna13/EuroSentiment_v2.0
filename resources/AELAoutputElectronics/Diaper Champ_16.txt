{"text":"I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!\nI used to work in a daycare and we had a diaper genie.\nIt was such a pain to use.\nWe all hated it.\nThe diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.\nAnd the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.\nIt takes regular trash bags.\nI generally put kitchen size bags in it, but you can use just about any size if you are in a pinch.\nAnd it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!\nIf you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":141,"mention":"genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AIR-2_Genie"],"startOffset":136},{"endOffset":516,"mention":"genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AIR-2_Genie"],"startOffset":511},{"endOffset":516,"mention":"genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AIR-2_Genie"],"startOffset":511},{"endOffset":516,"mention":"genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AIR-2_Genie"],"startOffset":511}]}
