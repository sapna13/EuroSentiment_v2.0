{"text":"Update 8\/11\/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.\nI bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.\nThe Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.\nI got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.\nPros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.\n- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.\nLimitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.\nI waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.\nI get occasional hiss while driving.\n- The battery life leaves a lot to be desired.\nThough rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.\nI downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.\n- The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. - ##Several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i'm starting to see why.\nI occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode).\nI wish they has a \"lock\" function like cell phones to prevent this.\n- Not compatible with Audible.com books.\nOverall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":199,"mention":"iPod mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":190},{"endOffset":389,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":386},{"endOffset":1017,"mention":"outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1010},{"endOffset":1017,"mention":"outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1010},{"endOffset":1017,"mention":"outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1010},{"endOffset":1302,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1299},{"endOffset":1302,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1299},{"endOffset":1302,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1299},{"endOffset":1497,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic_.NET"],"startOffset":1492},{"endOffset":1497,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic_.NET"],"startOffset":1492},{"endOffset":1497,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic_.NET"],"startOffset":1492},{"endOffset":1497,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic_.NET"],"startOffset":1492},{"endOffset":1549,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":1546},{"endOffset":1575,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1572},{"endOffset":1575,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1572},{"endOffset":1575,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1572},{"endOffset":1575,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1572}]}
