{"text":"I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.\nIt works great.\nI can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).\nI ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.\nIt's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.\nThe reviews were definitely right.\n","annotations":[]}
