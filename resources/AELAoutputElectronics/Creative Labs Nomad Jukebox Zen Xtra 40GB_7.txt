{"text":"one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .\nthe main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .\non my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .\ndespite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .\nthe interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .\nwith the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .\ni have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .\nthe player itself has all sorts of problems .\nthe face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .\nthe player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .\nthe scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .\ndepressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .\nthe scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .\non the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .\ni have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .\noverall , a very disappointing product .\nthe setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .\nthe player 's mechanics are also flawed .\nalthough the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":243,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":236},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":236},{"endOffset":258,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":255},{"endOffset":442,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":437},{"endOffset":442,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":437},{"endOffset":582,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":577},{"endOffset":832,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":826},{"endOffset":832,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":826},{"endOffset":1073,"mention":"bar","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle"],"startOffset":1070},{"endOffset":1184,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1178},{"endOffset":1184,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1178},{"endOffset":1184,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1178},{"endOffset":1184,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1178},{"endOffset":1184,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1178},{"endOffset":1286,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1280},{"endOffset":1332,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1327},{"endOffset":1332,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1327},{"endOffset":1332,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1327},{"endOffset":1467,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1462},{"endOffset":1467,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1462},{"endOffset":1467,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1462},{"endOffset":1467,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1462},{"endOffset":1518,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1512},{"endOffset":1518,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1512},{"endOffset":1518,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1512},{"endOffset":1666,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1660},{"endOffset":1666,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1660},{"endOffset":1666,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1660}]}
