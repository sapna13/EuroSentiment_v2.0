{"text":"being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .\nbut canon never fails to amaze .\nsome of the great gains over g2 --\n1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .\n2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .\n3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .\nlooks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .\n4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .\na big plus in my book .\n5 . the 1\/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .\nthe light auto-correction is awesome .\nyou could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .\n6 . the g2 's \" color effect \" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable \" effect func \" menu option available in all exposure modes .\nthere are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .\n7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .\ni can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .\n( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).\n8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .\nin english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .\n9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .\npersonally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .\noverall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .\nthere 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .\nshort of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .\nthis is quite simply the best you can ask for .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":346,"mention":"incredible","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Droid_Incredible"],"startOffset":336},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":499},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":499},{"endOffset":607,"mention":"picasa","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Picasa"],"startOffset":601},{"endOffset":607,"mention":"picasa","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Picasa"],"startOffset":601},{"endOffset":933,"mention":"filter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Filter"],"startOffset":927},{"endOffset":1067,"mention":"stone","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/9K720_Iskander"],"startOffset":1062},{"endOffset":1067,"mention":"stone","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/9K720_Iskander"],"startOffset":1062},{"endOffset":1424,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":1418}]}
