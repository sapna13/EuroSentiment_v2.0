{"text":"UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.\nRight out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use.\nI loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.\nSo, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.\nThen last week, my player just quit working, period.\nAfter consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).\nThey said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.\nWell, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!\nrvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.\nI loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them.\nThey obviously have quality and reliability problems.\nThey have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.\nORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!\nThis is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.\nI have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.\nI didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.\nMy PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!\nY!\nes, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.\nI love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.\nOnly slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.\nIt's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.\nMy other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.\nYes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.\nThe little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.\nIt barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.\nI threw it away.\nThose are minor complaints though.\nI love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.\nSoon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.\nAmazing.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":45,"mention":"Blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":41},{"endOffset":49,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":46},{"endOffset":45,"mention":"Blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":41},{"endOffset":49,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":46},{"endOffset":412,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":406},{"endOffset":412,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":406},{"endOffset":412,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":406},{"endOffset":412,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":406},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":888},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":888},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":888},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":888},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":888},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1053},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1053},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1053},{"endOffset":1548,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1545},{"endOffset":1548,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1545},{"endOffset":1603,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":1600},{"endOffset":1610,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1604},{"endOffset":1874,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1868},{"endOffset":1900,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1893},{"endOffset":1900,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1893},{"endOffset":1900,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1893},{"endOffset":2105,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":2099},{"endOffset":2105,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":2099},{"endOffset":2105,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":2099},{"endOffset":2135,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2130},{"endOffset":2690,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2684},{"endOffset":2690,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2684},{"endOffset":2818,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":2814},{"endOffset":2822,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":2819},{"endOffset":2818,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":2814},{"endOffset":2822,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":2819},{"endOffset":2818,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":2814},{"endOffset":2822,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":2819},{"endOffset":2818,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":2814},{"endOffset":2822,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":2819}]}
