{"text":"This is a GREAT product!\nI had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.\nNot only can they be a pain to install, but who needs one extra thing to watch a supply of?\nI mean, with babies it's already far too easy to run out of diapers or formula.\nI couldn't picture myself yelling to hubby, \"Honey, I know you have sixty other things to get...can you also pick up refills for the diaper pail?\"\nThe Champ works great.\nWe use regular kitchen sized garbage bags.\nWe've never experienced odor from the pail.\nIt was easy to assemble, and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion.\nI also love that you can flip the device with one hand...\nHighly recommended!!!\nMakes life easier and keeps baby's room smelling like baby, not dirty diapers!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":71,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Genie_Backup_Manager"],"startOffset":66},{"endOffset":71,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Genie_Backup_Manager"],"startOffset":66},{"endOffset":600,"mention":"nook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Barnes_&_Noble_Nook"],"startOffset":596},{"endOffset":770,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":766}]}
