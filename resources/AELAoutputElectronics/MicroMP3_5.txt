{"text":"I've been looking for a portable MP3 player for awhile now.\nWith so many choices it was a tough decision.\nMy first instinct was to go with an iPod.\nI visited quite a few forums and while the iPod is a great player I was concerned with the battery life and the inability to change them without breaking open the case.\nI started looking at the Creative Zen Micro and after reading numerous reviews from message boards and magazines I decided I'd give the Zen a try.\nAll I can say is what a wonderful choice!\nI ordered from Amazon and got the Limited Edition package that includes a free battery!\nUpon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player.\nI popped one of the batteries in and to my surprised it started right up.\nThe software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch.\nI did a quick test by selecting a few files and copying them over and they loaded right in.\nPressed play and I was off.\nThe touch pad does take a little getting used to.\nI'm still trying to manage the thing myself, but I've found that if you put the sensitivity to low it is fine.\nThe package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.\nOverall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch.\nIt's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges.\nFor the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.\nEnjoy!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":32,"mention":"portable","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Macintosh_Portable"],"startOffset":24},{"endOffset":36,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":33},{"endOffset":43,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":37},{"endOffset":123,"mention":"instinct","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M800"],"startOffset":115},{"endOffset":123,"mention":"instinct","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M800"],"startOffset":115},{"endOffset":123,"mention":"instinct","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M800"],"startOffset":115},{"endOffset":123,"mention":"instinct","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M800"],"startOffset":115},{"endOffset":354,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":351},{"endOffset":354,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":351},{"endOffset":354,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":351},{"endOffset":663,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":660},{"endOffset":670,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":664},{"endOffset":855,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":848},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"Player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":862},{"endOffset":855,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":848},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"Player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":862},{"endOffset":855,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":848},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"Player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":862},{"endOffset":890,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":883},{"endOffset":890,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":883},{"endOffset":913,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":908},{"endOffset":913,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":908},{"endOffset":913,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":908},{"endOffset":913,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":908},{"endOffset":945,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":942},{"endOffset":951,"mention":"Touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":946},{"endOffset":1057,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1053},{"endOffset":1082,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1077},{"endOffset":1086,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1083},{"endOffset":1082,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1077},{"endOffset":1086,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1083},{"endOffset":1404,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":1401},{"endOffset":1410,"mention":"Touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":1405},{"endOffset":1404,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":1401},{"endOffset":1410,"mention":"Touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":1405},{"endOffset":1463,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ZEN_Vision:M"],"startOffset":1460},{"endOffset":1469,"mention":"Touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Touch"],"startOffset":1464},{"endOffset":1513,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":1509},{"endOffset":1517,"mention":"LED","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/LEd"],"startOffset":1514},{"endOffset":1610,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1604}]}
