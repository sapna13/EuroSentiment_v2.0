{"text":"This router appeared in my wife's gold box a few weeks ago, and she knew I was looking to upgrade my Craftsman 1\/4\" fixed base router.\nShe told me to take a look at it, and after reading reviews here and at other sites, I told her to get it.\nWhat an upgrade!!!\nI have only used it with the 1\/4\" collet and a 1\/2\" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.\nThe depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.\nThe handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.\nCombine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.\nI'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!\nNow I need to get some 1\/2\" bits...\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":375,"mention":"torque","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Torque"],"startOffset":369},{"endOffset":375,"mention":"torque","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Torque"],"startOffset":369},{"endOffset":375,"mention":"torque","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Torque"],"startOffset":369},{"endOffset":375,"mention":"torque","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Torque"],"startOffset":369},{"endOffset":375,"mention":"torque","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Torque"],"startOffset":369}]}
