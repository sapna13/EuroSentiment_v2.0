{"text":"this is my first digital camera .\ni am very pleased with it so far .\ni wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .\nthis seemed like a really good compromise .\ni compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .\nbased on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .\nit is not perfect though .\nhere are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :\nit would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .\nyou can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .\n( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .\nthat would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .\nto save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .\nit seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?\ntrips .\n( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )\nfor those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .\nit is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .\ni have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .\ni am quite happy with the camera .\nit comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .\nyes , i recommend it over the competition .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":276,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":269},{"endOffset":846,"mention":"waste","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/WASTE"],"startOffset":841},{"endOffset":901,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":896},{"endOffset":901,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":896},{"endOffset":1090,"mention":"mac","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_OS"],"startOffset":1087},{"endOffset":1171,"mention":"photoshop","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Photoshop"],"startOffset":1162},{"endOffset":1212,"mention":"iphoto","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPhoto"],"startOffset":1206},{"endOffset":1212,"mention":"iphoto","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPhoto"],"startOffset":1206},{"endOffset":1212,"mention":"iphoto","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPhoto"],"startOffset":1206}]}
