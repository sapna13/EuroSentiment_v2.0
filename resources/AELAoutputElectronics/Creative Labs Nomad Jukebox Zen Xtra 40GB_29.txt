{"text":"summary\noverall i like the unit .\ni gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .\nif it were not for that i would have given it 4 .\npros :\n1 ) price \/ gb of storage\n2 ) storage capacity\n3 ) user replaceable battery\ncons :\n1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )\n2 ) scroll button \/ switch\n3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .\nfeatures that would have been nice :\n1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .\n2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .\nthey sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .\nbut who wants the wires involved .\na short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .\ni believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .\ndetails :\ndo n't drop this unit :\ni 've had the player for about a month now .\noverall i like it .\nas mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .\ni was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .\ni think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .\ni was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .\nif you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .\ni purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .\nupdating the unit 's firmware :\nwhen i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .\nthe upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .\ni would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .\nstorage :\nthe storage capacity is great .\ni do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .\ni currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .\ni 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .\nfor those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .\ntypically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.\nthe higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .\nif you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .\nyou should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .\nif you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).\nprice :\nthe price compared to the ipod is great .\nprice , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .\none word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .\ni discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .\nit using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .\ni have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .\nbut for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .\nscroll bar :\nthe scroll bar is a bit of a pain .\nsometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .\nit 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .\nsoftware :\ni 've had no problems with the software .\ni found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .\nthe software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .\nmy 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).\nthrough the software you can classify songs in genres .\nthis is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to \" easy listening \" rather than \" heavy metal \" - no problem .\nthe software comes with plenty of defaults genres .\nyou can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .\nyou can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .\nthis can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .\nin addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .\nthis is pretty cool .\nsound :\nthe sound from the player is ok .\ni was a little disappointed in the low end .\ni did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .\ni was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .\nthe sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .\nit 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":301,"mention":"cons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":297},{"endOffset":315,"mention":"fragile","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fragile_Dreams:_Farewell_Ruins_of_the_Moon"],"startOffset":308},{"endOffset":833,"mention":"napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":826},{"endOffset":837,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":834},{"endOffset":844,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":838},{"endOffset":918,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":912},{"endOffset":1000,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":994},{"endOffset":1050,"mention":"train","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/A-Train"],"startOffset":1045},{"endOffset":2120,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":2117},{"endOffset":2547,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2541},{"endOffset":2954,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2949},{"endOffset":2965,"mention":"word","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Word_Bible_Software"],"startOffset":2961},{"endOffset":3008,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":3003},{"endOffset":3020,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":3014},{"endOffset":3060,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":3054},{"endOffset":3060,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":3054},{"endOffset":3060,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":3054},{"endOffset":3078,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":3075},{"endOffset":3078,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":3075},{"endOffset":3092,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":3089},{"endOffset":3152,"mention":"trial","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Trials_HD"],"startOffset":3147},{"endOffset":3237,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":3232},{"endOffset":3310,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":3304},{"endOffset":3352,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3346},{"endOffset":3352,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3346},{"endOffset":3352,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3346},{"endOffset":3352,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3346},{"endOffset":3352,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3346},{"endOffset":3383,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":3377},{"endOffset":3396,"mention":"bar","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle"],"startOffset":3393},{"endOffset":3413,"mention":"bar","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle"],"startOffset":3410},{"endOffset":3832,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3826},{"endOffset":3832,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3826},{"endOffset":3832,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3826},{"endOffset":3912,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":3909},{"endOffset":3912,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":3909},{"endOffset":3912,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":3909},{"endOffset":3912,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":3909},{"endOffset":4380,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":4376},{"endOffset":4512,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":4508},{"endOffset":4595,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":4589},{"endOffset":4653,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":4647},{"endOffset":4828,"mention":"equalizer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GAU-12_Equalizer"],"startOffset":4819},{"endOffset":4828,"mention":"equalizer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GAU-12_Equalizer"],"startOffset":4819}]
