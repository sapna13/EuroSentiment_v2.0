{"text":"I had to revise my review today!... If you are still trying to decide Ipod or Zen Micro, Yahoo! has just closed the deal.\nThey now offer Yahoo Music Engine, wich is like Napster to Go, but at a fraction fo the price.\nIts $4.99 a month ($60 annually) to download as much music as you like.\nYou can fill it up with anything you like out of there 1 Million song library.\nAlso if you want to purchase music, its just .79cents per track ..... Here is my origianl review....\" My wife already had the Ipod Mini when I purchased this, and I must say seeing it in action, I had some reservations about getting a Zen.\nHowever after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior.\nI think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones.\nI thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on.\nWhen you don't feel like toting a PDA while out for the day (i.e. cycling, window shopping, etc,)simply download everything thru outlook.\nI've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now.\nMine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download.\nIts also smaller, and gets more looks.\nPeople are use to seeing so may Ipods, that when they see my Zen, they have to ask questions.\nAn extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook.\nThis is really a no brainer.\n[+][s] ##BUY THE ZEN!\"\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":81,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":78},{"endOffset":148,"mention":"Music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":143},{"endOffset":177,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":170},{"endOffset":177,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":170},{"endOffset":177,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":170},{"endOffset":177,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":170},{"endOffset":177,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":170},{"endOffset":275,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":270},{"endOffset":402,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":397},{"endOffset":503,"mention":"Ipod Mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":494},{"endOffset":606,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":603},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":678},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":678},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":678},{"endOffset":776,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":773},{"endOffset":1216,"mention":"outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1209},{"endOffset":1264,"mention":"bar","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle"],"startOffset":1261},{"endOffset":1264,"mention":"bar","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle"],"startOffset":1261},{"endOffset":1343,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":1339},{"endOffset":1478,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1475},{"endOffset":1528,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":1524},{"endOffset":1593,"mention":"Outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1586},{"endOffset":1644,"mention":"ZEN","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":1641},{"endOffset":1644,"mention":"ZEN","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":1641}]}
