{"text":"after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .\n( good going , amazon ).\ni am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .\nso far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .\ni have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .\ni do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .\nthe comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .\nso , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .\ni can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .\nbut , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .\nbottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":72,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":66},{"endOffset":441,"mention":"show","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MLB_08:_The_Show"],"startOffset":437},{"endOffset":441,"mention":"show","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MLB_08:_The_Show"],"startOffset":437},{"endOffset":859,"mention":"pal","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Physics_Abstraction_Layer"],"startOffset":856},{"endOffset":884,"mention":"movies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":878},{"endOffset":859,"mention":"pal","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Physics_Abstraction_Layer"],"startOffset":856},{"endOffset":884,"mention":"movies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":878},{"endOffset":918,"mention":"movie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":913},{"endOffset":918,"mention":"movie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":913},{"endOffset":1258,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":1254},{"endOffset":1356,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1350}]}
