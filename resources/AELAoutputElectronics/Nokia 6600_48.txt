{"text":"This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.\nSupporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.\nYou can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).\nMany of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.\nIt uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.\nIts nice look is also a plus.\nAnd also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.\nI am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":114,"mention":"Symbian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Symbian"],"startOffset":107},{"endOffset":279,"mention":"movie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":274},{"endOffset":286,"mention":"viewer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ViEWER"],"startOffset":280},{"endOffset":333,"mention":"GPS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNAT_Programming_Studio"],"startOffset":330},{"endOffset":377,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":371},{"endOffset":377,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":371},{"endOffset":377,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":371},{"endOffset":377,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":371}]}
