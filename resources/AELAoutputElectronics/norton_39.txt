{"text":"I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).\nThe program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --\nI was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.\nMy previous experience with multiple Symantec\/Norton products has been good.\nThe installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.\nHOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.\nIt feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.\nI tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.\nThere is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec\/Norton site.\nI am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.\nI purchased this even though I saw some disparaging reviews at the Amazon site, trusting PC Magazine to get it right.\nHowever, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.\n","annotations":[]}
