{"text":"the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .\nafter years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .\ni 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .\nhere 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of \" plastic-like \" ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .\nit has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !\ni spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .\nalso , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .\nthe headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !\nthe phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds \/ screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .\nthe colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .\nhowever , it serves its purpose .\nthe backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --\ni checked with nokia .\nthe buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .\nthe menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .\nmore downside to this phone ?\nthe volume .\noh my goodness --\ni have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .\nforget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !\non the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .\ni do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .\ni was surprised by t-mobile 's service .\ni assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .\nreason ?\nthey piggy-back on cingular 's service .\nalso , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 \/ mo. ) never works .\nsince i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work \" in 24 hours \" .\ni must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .\n24 hours ?\nby what time standards -- martian ?\napparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .\nalso , they 'd forgotten to add \" wap \" capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .\nin all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .\nbut they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a \" yes \" answer from you .\ni realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :\n\" when will my t-zones work ? \" , csr :\n\" i 'm not sure \" . ) .\numm , well , thanks for nothing .\nthis one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .\nthat was annoying .\nt-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .\nhowever , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .\nand no t-zones .\nso what 's the point ?\ni 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .\ni 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500\/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .\nguess all that glitters is not gold .\nit was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .\nhope someone else has better luck !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":34,"mention":"was","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_WebSphere_Application_Server"],"startOffset":31},{"endOffset":34,"mention":"was","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_WebSphere_Application_Server"],"startOffset":31},{"endOffset":57,"mention":"sprint","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sprint_2"],"startOffset":51},{"endOffset":200,"mention":"nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":195},{"endOffset":200,"mention":"nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":195},{"endOffset":200,"mention":"nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":195},{"endOffset":1151,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1145},{"endOffset":1151,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1145},{"endOffset":1151,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1145},{"endOffset":1151,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1145},{"endOffset":1151,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1145},{"endOffset":1391,"mention":"nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":1386},{"endOffset":1569,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1563},{"endOffset":1731,"mention":"eye","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Eye_of_GNOME"],"startOffset":1728},{"endOffset":3789,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":3785},{"endOffset":3856,"mention":"sprint","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sprint_2"],"startOffset":3850},{"endOffset":3856,"mention":"sprint","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sprint_2"],"startOffset":3850},{"endOffset":3856,"mention":"sprint","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sprint_2"],"startOffset":3850}]}
