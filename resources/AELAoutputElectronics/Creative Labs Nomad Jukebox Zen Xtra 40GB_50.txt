{"text":"i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .\nwhat made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .\nbased on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .\nbut because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .\nnow we come to the zen xtra .. .\nfirst i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .\nthe sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .\nwhat really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .\nnot just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .\nfirst of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .\nbookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .\nrather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .\nthis makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .\nthe dynamic playlists ( \" now playing \" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .\nwell , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .\ni 'll just say this .. .\nfor the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...\nbut for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product
