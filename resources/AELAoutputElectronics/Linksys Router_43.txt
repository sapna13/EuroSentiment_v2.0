{"text":"Absolutely no problems with this router.\nI downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.\nA call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.\nI have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.\nSpeed is not a problem.\nI bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!\nI can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!\nAfter upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.\nIf you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!\nAs far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":163,"mention":"live","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ableton_Live"],"startOffset":159}]}
