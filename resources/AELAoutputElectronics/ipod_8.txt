{"text":"There's got to be a better solution...\nI bought my IPOD roughly six months ago, and I've been pretty disappointed so far.\n*The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily.\nYou must buy some sort of protective case unless you want your ipod to look like some crazed animal with ten inch nails attacked it.\n*\tThe 20 GB version doesn't actually have 20 GB, but 18.5 GB, which makes a difference of roughly 300 songs. *\nThe Battery does not last 12 hours.\nLike I said, I've had my ipod for six short months and I'd estimate the battery life to be about four hours at the most.\nIt seems to deteriorate every time I use it.\nYou can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.\n*\tYou can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *\nMy ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of \"brick.\" *\nIf you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for \"abusing\" your ipod.\nThe user support service isn't too great either.\nBuyer beware!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":950,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":945},{"endOffset":950,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":945}]}
