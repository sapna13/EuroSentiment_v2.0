{"text":"if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .\nif your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .\nall the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .\nif you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .\nipod clearly has the most buzz .\ngreat design and looks cool .\nmost people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .\nit has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .\nsome of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .\neveryone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .\nipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .\nhowever , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about \" white noise \" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments \/ contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .\nsynchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .\nreviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .\nreviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery \/ pickup of item .\nafter that it seems like you 're on your own .\nipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it \" unnecessary \" and \" so 20th century \" .\ncreative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .\nconstruction quality is a difficult item .\nthe zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .\nwhat is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .\ndrop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .\nmany reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .\nfeedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .\nthe scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .\nthe creative software is awkward \/ difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .\nenough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .\nthe zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that \" creates \" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .\nreviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .\nthe zen has no stop button .\nveteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .\nthe rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .\nit seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .\nif you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .\nkarma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .\nusability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .\nrepair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist\n- you just have to buy a new player .\nperhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .\nlike the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .\nit only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .\nthe karma does have a stop button .\nthere are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .\nthose that have it like it .\nthe only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .\notherwise feedback seems to be good .\nno comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .\nno-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .\nnone of these are perfect .\nif you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .\naccept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .\nif that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .\nif you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":86,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":98,"mention":"rio
