{"text":"i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;\nit costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .\nwhat a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .\nnot only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .\nanyway , on with the review .\nso far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .\nit hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).\nsoftware : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .\nonce you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .\nfrom there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).\nmy only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .\nif you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .\noh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .\nthe player : it 's silver .\na little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .\npeople complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .\nit 's easy .\nthe buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .\nthe big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .\nmy favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .\nyou can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).\nits really cool .\nsound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .\nyou can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .\nbut the earbuds suck !\nbuy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .\nfor a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .\na remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .\noh ... one more thing .\ni forgot , the case does n't fit .\nmy case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .\nso far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .\nso all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .\nalso , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .\nhope i helped !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":349,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":342},{"endOffset":349,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":342},{"endOffset":349,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":342},{"endOffset":457,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":451},{"endOffset":469,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":462},{"endOffset":1052,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1049},{"endOffset":1059,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1053},{"endOffset":1052,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1049},{"endOffset":1059,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1053},{"endOffset":1209,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1206},{"endOffset":1209,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1206},{"endOffset":1209,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":1206},{"endOffset":1257,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":1254},{"endOffset":1270,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1263},{"endOffset":1402,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1396},{"endOffset":1417,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1411},{"endOffset":1807,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1802},{"endOffset":1922,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1916},{"endOffset":1922,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1916},{"endOffset":1922,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1916},{"endOffset":2320,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2314},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2369},{"endOffset":2589,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2583},{"endOffset":2589,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2583}]}
