{"text":"This router was a huge disapointment.\nThe depth adjustment was sloppy.\nThe speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.\nIt was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.\nMy son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.\nI did like the heft of the machine.\nIt felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)\nI sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.\nAll in all, not very good.\n","annotations":[]}
