{"text":"I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.\nA few things that I want to suggest for improvements:\n1) phone card calling feature.\nThis phone doesn't include Phone card calling.\nSo you have to dial your phone card access number, PIN card, and choose \"send touch tone\" and find your contact from the address book.\nThis process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway.\nFor phone card with PIN Free dialing setup, you are a little bit lucky.\nAll you need to do is to choose your \"phone card\" contact and then \"send touch tone\" and choose the contact.\nThis feature is very important to me as I make a lot of international calls.\nMy old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.\nAll I need to do is to choose the contact and in option select \"calling card call\".\n2) Low volume on regular answering.\nIn noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.\nYou have to use speaker or handsfree, to get larger volume.\nSpeaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":229,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":223},{"endOffset":401,"mention":"shift","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Need_for_Speed:_Shift"],"startOffset":396},{"endOffset":701,"mention":"Sony Ericsson T610","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sony_Ericsson_T610"],"startOffset":683}]}
