{"text":"I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.\nAfter using it for a week, I wish I had purchased the Ipod.\nThe Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want.\nThis is by far my biggest complaint.\nAnother problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging[-2] ##Also note that it doesn't seem to charge when connected to the PC, only when plugged into an AC socket even though they both connect to the single USB port on the player, so you have to charge the battery separately from downloading music.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":35,"mention":"Ipod Mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":26},{"endOffset":164,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":159},{"endOffset":529,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":526},{"endOffset":820,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":814},{"endOffset":820,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":814},{"endOffset":889,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":884}]}
