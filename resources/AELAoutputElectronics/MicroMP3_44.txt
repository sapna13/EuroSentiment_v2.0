{"text":"The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers.\nI absolutely didn't want to by an Ipod.\nNot because I wanted to go against the grain, but the idea of having to shell out another 100 bucks (after a year) in order to have Apple replace the non-removable battery just turned me off.\nThe Zen offered a great alternative.\nNow, there are many alternatives to the Ipod, but I wanted a nice design, also, and not some generic looking mp3 player.\nI wanted something that looked at least almost as good as an Ipod.\nI saw the Zen, and-BOOM-I bought one for me and one for a family member.\nWhat happens follows:       Let's start with the software.\nIt's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch.\nYou can compress the files for more storage space before you start the transfer.\nThe sonic detail at the highest compression rate(64 kbps WMA) is crazy.\nThe clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!\n00 song capacity of the disk without having to worry about the quality of your music (the Zen micro, actually starts off with about 4.7GB after loading the software).\nWhen mine died, I had 1,022 songs loaded, but only used a little over 2gb of space.\nOther mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either.\nCheck the Zen's S\/N ratio and DB rating.\nThey're better than the IPOD, plus, there are seven EQ settings (including custom).\nThe included headphones suck, so get your own.\nTransfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software.\nThe Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod.\nThe greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info.\nand labels it before you burn the CD into the Zen.\nTrack #, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen.\nThis feature wo!\nrks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well.\nJust check the menu on your Zen, and it's all there, and neatly stored.\nAt least, that is, while it's still alive.\nThe touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies.\nIt's a tad too sensitive for a first time user (my family member, however, had no problem with it), and it drove me nuts at first.\nA trick I used was to manually capitalize all the info.\ngoing into the Zen from my computer, so my stubby, clumsy fingers could cordinate better with my color blind, near, far and mid sighted eyes.\nOnce I did this, visions of burning my CDs-literally-dance around my head, and all was right in the world (of course, I would have backed my files up, silly).\nThe features this thing has are !\njust too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two.\nOh, and another is the cool \"halo\" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer.\nBut, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.\nOne: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs).\nIt's smaller, in most cases than the palm of your hand, and is ergonomically curved.\nI loved this thing.\nI've had Dell Pocket DJ owners, IPOD mini AND Shuffle owners marvel at this thing.\nIt cost less than, in most cases, $190.\nTwo: it has a removeable\/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!\nchargeable battery runs out; thereby, waiting 3 weeks to get it back, and possibly with all of your music erased.\nBut, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.\nWhy?\nbecause the \"engineers\" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack.\nIt's an admitted design flaw that the people at Creative have acknowledged (google it).\nThere are bulletin boards and customer reviews all over the web talking about it.\nIf you send in your Zen to have the flaw fixed, you lose all of the music you've been loading into the thing for 2-3 months, which came out to 1022 songs and 80 albums for me.\nAgain, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage.\nIt comes loose after 3 months-give or take-of careful use.\nUsing right angled jacks on your headphones, which minimizes the movement of the headphones while plugged in, won't alleviate the problem.\nI used them.\nAgain, this is a design flaw in the headphone!\njack that Creative has acknowledge.\nI know what you are thinking.\nYou once had a cheap CD player (or walkman) that had the same problem, and you just used miniture screwdrivers to push the left\/right prongs out.\nIf only only it was that simple.\nThe flaw is inside the Zen.\nYou can't see it by looking into the jacks where the prongs are.\nThe flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to.\nIn other words, you have to do almost the equivalent of open heart surgery in order just to see where the problem is.\nThere are do it yourself sites (with pictures)that show you how to repair it, but keep in mind that you will have to break the warranty seal, which means? ##Exactly, warranty voided.\nSo, if you don't won't to void your warranty, you will have to get in touch with Creative, they will send you a rma number, fix your Zen, but you lose all of your dogon music.\nThe Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer.\nDo your research; check !\nout the bulletin boards.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":16,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":16,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":51,"mention":"dream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Dream"],"startOffset":46},{"endOffset":51,"mention":"dream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Dream"],"startOffset":46},{"endOffset":51,"mention":"dream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Dream"],"startOffset":46},{"endOffset":73,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":70},{"endOffset":83,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":78},{"endOffset":269,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":264},{"endOffset":331,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":328},{"endOffset":461,"mention":"generic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/McAfee_VirusScan"],"startOffset":454},{"endOffset":473,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":470},{"endOffset":480,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":474},{"endOffset":562,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":559},{"endOffset":562,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":559},{"endOffset":562,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":559},{"endOffset":853,"mention":"sonic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SonicStage"],"startOffset":848},{"endOffset":1075,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1070},{"endOffset":1084,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1081},{"endOffset":1084,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1081},{"endOffset":1084,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1081},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1284,"mention":"sonic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SonicStage"],"startOffset":1279},{"endOffset":1303,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1300},{"endOffset":1500,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":1494},{"endOffset":1614,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1611},{"endOffset":1624,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":1621},{"endOffset":1638,"mention":"wave","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Geometry_Wars:_Waves"],"startOffset":1634},{"endOffset":1826,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1823},{"endOffset":1841,"mention":"name","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BIND"],"startOffset":1837},{"endOffset":1841,"mention":"name","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BIND"],"startOffset":1837},{"endOffset":1841,"mention":"name","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BIND"],"startOffset":1837},{"endOffset":1954,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1951},{"endOffset":2032,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2027},{"endOffset":2032,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2027},{"endOffset":2032,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2027},{"endOffset":2058,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2053},{"endOffset":2071,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rocks_Cluster_Distribution"],"startOffset":2067},{"endOffset":2071,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rocks_Cluster_Distribution"],"startOffset":2067},{"endOffset":2071,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rocks_Cluster_Distribution"],"startOffset":2067},{"endOffset":2223,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":2220},{"endOffset":2223,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":2220},{"endOffset":2316,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":2311},{"endOffset":2316,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":2311},{"endOffset":2404,"mention":"Zen","uri":["ht
