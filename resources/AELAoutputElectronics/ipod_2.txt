{"text":"Very Pleased.\nI'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.\nThe interface took a little getting used to.\nThe best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.\nThis one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual.\nI loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.\nThe sound is just fine.\nI'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds.\nI use it to listen to language tapes and to play \"Earl\" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.\nIt comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.\nI also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.\nNow, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.\nOne caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.\nI think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":34,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":31},{"endOffset":41,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":35},{"endOffset":34,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":31},{"endOffset":41,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":35},{"endOffset":211,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":206},{"endOffset":414,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":408},{"endOffset":414,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":408},{"endOffset":414,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":408},{"endOffset":414,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":408},{"endOffset":414,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":408}]}
