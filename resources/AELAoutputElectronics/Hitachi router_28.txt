{"text":"I have owned this router for nearly five years.\nUntil recently it was my only router.\nMost of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.\nIt it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.\nRecenly the variable speed control went out.\nIt would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.\nThe authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.\nI bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.\nI didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.\nThe only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.\nOverall it is a great value.\nFor the price I don't think you can beat it.\n","annotations":[]}
