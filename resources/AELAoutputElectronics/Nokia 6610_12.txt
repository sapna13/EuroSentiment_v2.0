{"text":"perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .\nafter having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .\ni replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .\nalthough the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .\nthe reception and sound quality are top-notch .\ni can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .\ni like the size and weight of this little critter .\ni am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .\nthe keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .\nthe fact that the \" 0 \" key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the \" # \" key instead .\nbut that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .\nthe screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .\nit receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .\nthere are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .\nthe menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .\nthumbs down on that one .\nthe vibrate setting is loud !\nso loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .\nbut , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .\nwhich was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...\nother things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .\ni 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...\npros :\n- light , compact design\n- solid , high-quality construction\n- well-backlit keypad\n- outstanding signal reception\n- excellent sound quality\n- bright , visible screen\n- speakerphone\n- very long-lasting battery life\ncons :\n- some features in the user interface\n- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking\n- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .\n- no propietary headset jack\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":296,"mention":"nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_OS"],"startOffset":291},{"endOffset":872,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":864},{"endOffset":872,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":864},{"endOffset":955,"mention":"key","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KeY"],"startOffset":952},{"endOffset":972,"mention":"key","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KeY"],"startOffset":969},{"endOffset":1041,"mention":"key","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KeY"],"startOffset":1038},{"endOffset":1041,"mention":"key","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KeY"],"startOffset":1038},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1375,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1369},{"endOffset":1375,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1369},{"endOffset":1739,"mention":"office","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KOffice"],"startOffset":1733},{"endOffset":1739,"mention":"office","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KOffice"],"startOffset":1733},{"endOffset":1852,"mention":"my phone","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/My_Phone"],"startOffset":1844},{"endOffset":1924,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":1916},{"endOffset":1944,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":1940},{"endOffset":2229,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":2223},{"endOffset":2282,"mention":"cons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":2278},{"endOffset":2282,"mention":"cons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":2278}]}
