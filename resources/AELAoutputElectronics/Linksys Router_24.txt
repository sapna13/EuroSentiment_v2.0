{"text":"This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year.\nIn my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.\nMy opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.\nIF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....\n","annotations":[]}
