{"text":"I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.\nUPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).\nI love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.\nPhotos are pretty darned good!\nDOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.\nMy last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.\nThe \"movies\" last about 5 seconds.\nI mean, they're short!\nWhy have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?\nI find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.\nAlso, when I dial an \"800\" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.\nThis is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.\nFinally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.\nIt would not hang up on calls.\nOnce it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.\nProbably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.\nBut beware of the bugs; they are major!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":418,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":413},{"endOffset":418,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":413},{"endOffset":418,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":413},{"endOffset":418,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":413},{"endOffset":418,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":413},{"endOffset":418,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":413},{"endOffset":418,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":413},{"endOffset":418,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Lifeblog"],"startOffset":413},{"endOffset":773,"mention":"airline","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Airline_Tycoon"],"startOffset":766},{"endOffset":975,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":969},{"endOffset":975,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":969},{"endOffset":975,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":969},{"endOffset":975,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":969}]}
