{"text":"First, let me set the stage by saying that I am not a network specialist, just a regular Joe who for convenience reasons wants a wireless network in his house. ##For the last couple of years I'd run the Linksys Wireless B router; it was rock solid, no issues whatsoever.\nHowever I realized the other day that I hadn't even secured it (yes, stupid me).\nAs I'd just purchased a new computer with a Wireless G adapter, I figured I'd upgrade the router as well and set it up as it's supposed to be.\nI first purchased the Wireless G with Speedbooster.\nThough admittedly I am a novice at networking, I am not an idiot and can read directions.\nQuite frankly though, I've never seen a worse setup process for a piece of hardware.\nThe documentation was just horrible.\nWhen you open the package the first thing you see is \"Run CD first\".\nSo I run the CD, and get all kinds of quirky error messages.\nSomehow the adap\nter finds the router anyway, but it's unsecured.\nI call tech support, which was clearly overseas, and I'm pretty sure he understood me about as well as I understood him.\nAfter 15 minutes on hold and 10 painful minutes with this guy, he basically tells me to download a file from their website which will walk me through.\nI did this and indeed the setup flowed much better.\nBut my question: How does this CD make it out the door if it's this bad?\nAnyway, after learning that the \"Speedboost\" feature only does anything for you if (1) you are also using a Speedboost adapter (which I was), and (2) if you are transferring large data files between computers (Note: it does NOT increase your speed on the Internet, but only between computers on the network), I opted to return the product and get the standard Wireless G (v.5).\nBest decision I've made in a long time.\nFirst, the router was on sale for $49 at Circuit City.\nSecond, the setup CD actually worked perfectly.\nI was able to use t!\nhe brower-based administrative screen with no problems.\nI still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router.\nThe performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4.\nEven the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with \"MAC settings\", etc.\nIf you follow the directions to the letter though then you should be OK on the setup.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":241,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rocks_Cluster_Distribution"],"startOffset":237},{"endOffset":592,"mention":"networking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NetworKing"],"startOffset":582},{"endOffset":1333,"mention":"door","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Door_Door"],"startOffset":1329},{"endOffset":1566,"mention":"Note","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Lotus_Notes"],"startOffset":1562},{"endOffset":1711,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":1703},{"endOffset":1931,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1925}]}
