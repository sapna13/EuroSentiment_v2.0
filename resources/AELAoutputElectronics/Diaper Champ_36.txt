{"text":"We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.\nIt sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).\nIt is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.\nAs the bag fills, you may need to flip twice to ensure that the weighted cylinder has completely pushed the diaper into the bag.\nFor the first 9 months or so, we only needed to empty this once a week.\nNow that our son's diapers are a little larger, they take up more space, and we empty twice a week.\nWe have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).\nIt is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!\nUpdate (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)\n","annotations":[]}
