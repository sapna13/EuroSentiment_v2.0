{"text":"I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP\nI have found however that you can just buy a card reader to solve this problem.\nThe new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.\nThe Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.\nBut it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":232,"mention":"reader","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Reader"],"startOffset":226},{"endOffset":232,"mention":"reader","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Reader"],"startOffset":226},{"endOffset":551,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":544},{"endOffset":551,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":544}]}
