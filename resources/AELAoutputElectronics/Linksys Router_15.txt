{"text":"I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.\nSee my other reviews for the details.\nI also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.\nThis is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.\nI am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers.\n","annotations":[]}
