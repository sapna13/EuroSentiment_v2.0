{"text":"I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.\nI find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.\nIt came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.\nAlso I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.\nI prefer things that are simple.\nI prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.\nI now  have it as a permenant fixture  in my router table.\nThe router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.\nI did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.\nIt will take 31\/2 inchers now.\nI also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.\nI added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.\nI also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.\nIts  not a perfect system but its a very good one.\nI need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":1175,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":1172}]}
