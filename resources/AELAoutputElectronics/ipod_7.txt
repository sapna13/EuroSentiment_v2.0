{"text":"i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.\nwhen i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out!\nsimply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!\nthe packing inside was in tatters.\ni didnt touch the product.\ni called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.\nthey initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.\nthen when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.\na week passed but it was never picked up.\nthe when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.\nbuyers BEWARE!\n","annotations":[]}
