{"text":"the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .\ni 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .\nwith canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .\ni love the eos based controls and easy menus .\ni do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .\nmany before me have done that already .\ni agree with the positive reviews .\nbut there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .\n1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .\nthough the instruction booklet says that the camera should display \" lens \" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .\ni 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .\nvery cheaply made .\n2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .\nthe g2 was better in this respect .\nit had a heavier and more sturdy casing .\ndespite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":603,"mention":"booklet","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Booklet_3G"],"startOffset":596},{"endOffset":603,"mention":"booklet","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Booklet_3G"],"startOffset":596}]}
