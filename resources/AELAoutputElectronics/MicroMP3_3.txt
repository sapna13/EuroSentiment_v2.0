{"text":"Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.\nWhy?\nSmaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.\nThe touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.\nI love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.\nCreative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.\nSound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.\nThis is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":25,"mention":"Ipod mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":16},{"endOffset":25,"mention":"Ipod mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":16},{"endOffset":80,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":77},{"endOffset":403,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SaGa_Frontier"],"startOffset":399},{"endOffset":494,"mention":"Source","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Counter-Strike:_Source"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":494,"mention":"Source","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Counter-Strike:_Source"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":494,"mention":"Source","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Counter-Strike:_Source"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":494,"mention":"Source","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Counter-Strike:_Source"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":494,"mention":"Source","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Counter-Strike:_Source"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":494,"mention":"Source","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Counter-Strike:_Source"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":654,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mario_Party_3"],"startOffset":651},{"endOffset":661,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":655}]}
