{"text":"i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .\nafter fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :\ntransfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .\nit would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .\nhaving 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .\nscroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .\nsize - bigger than the ipod\nsoftware - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .\nafter i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .\nsong transfers were not an issue .\ni transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .\nthe navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .\nthe ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .\nthe casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .\nsound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .\ni chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .\ngranted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .\nitunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":35,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":30},{"endOffset":39,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":36},{"endOffset":58,"mention":"portable","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Macintosh_Portable"],"startOffset":50},{"endOffset":62,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":59},{"endOffset":69,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":63},{"endOffset":229,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":226},{"endOffset":560,"mention":"jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dell_Digital_Jukebox"],"startOffset":553},{"endOffset":560,"mention":"jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dell_Digital_Jukebox"],"startOffset":553},{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"glove","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Velvet_Glove"],"startOffset":1076},{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"glove","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Velvet_Glove"],"startOffset":1076},{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"glove","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Velvet_Glove"],"startOffset":1076},{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"glove","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Velvet_Glove"],"startOffset":1076},{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"glove","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Velvet_Glove"],"startOffset":1076},{"endOffset":1181,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1178},{"endOffset":1181,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1178},{"endOffset":1348,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":1345},{"endOffset":1379,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1373}]}
