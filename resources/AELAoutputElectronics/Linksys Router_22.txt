{"text":"I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.\nAs far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.\nIf you want \"the newest gadget\" get the one with speedbooster.\nI like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.\nAll in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.\nExpect about 10MBps and not more though!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":179,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":173},{"endOffset":323,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":315},{"endOffset":323,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":315},{"endOffset":323,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":315},{"endOffset":384,"mention":"gadget","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gadget:_Invention,_Travel,_&_Adventure"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":384,"mention":"gadget","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gadget:_Invention,_Travel,_&_Adventure"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":479,"mention":"networking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NetworKing"],"startOffset":469}]}
