{"text":"She said her sister had the Diaper Champ and that it took regular garbage bags and worked just as well.\nPersonally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.\nIt is mindless to operate.\nIt takes garage bags that we use elsewhere in the abode.\nIt doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).\nAnd it is very easy to clean.\nI can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.\nI am SO thankful I got that advice when I did because I had the Diaper Genie on my registry aforementioned to her warning.\nI'd abhor having to drive all the way to a baby superstore to purchase bags her dirty diapers are just going to get thrown away in.\nI am very pleased with our choice.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":199,"mention":"garage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GarageBand"],"startOffset":193},{"endOffset":353,"mention":"cocoon","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Cocoon"],"startOffset":347},{"endOffset":550,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Genie_Backup_Manager"],"startOffset":545}]}
