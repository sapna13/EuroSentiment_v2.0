{"text":"I must have gotten a good one.\nI don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1\/4\" sleeve yet) .\nBefore buying this I read others reviews and of the complaints I read about....well I have not experienced any.\nI have 3 Bosch routers, 1 Porter Cable, and the large Freud.\nI have many others in the past.\nI would put the Hitachi up with the best!\nNo vibration!\nSmooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w\/ lubricant.\nIt is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.\nWhy do people spend all that money on accessories to \"raise and lower \" the router in a table??? A waste of money.\nIt is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.\nVery good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1\/4 hp models.\nThe soft start is nice.\nThe price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)\nThe total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !\nLess than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.\nI can't complain and Amazons' service was perfect!\nI think I'll go rout something...\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":621,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":616},{"endOffset":691,"mention":"waste","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/WASTE"],"startOffset":686},{"endOffset":700,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":695}]}
