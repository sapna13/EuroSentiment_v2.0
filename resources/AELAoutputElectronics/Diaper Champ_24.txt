{"text":"I love this pail!\nNo smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!\nI have heard that it will eventually become my sons favorite place to put his toys when he becomes a toddler, but I've got 2 years to worry about that and I'm sure I'll figure out preventative measures like any other mom.\n4 months later.\nOK.\nI still like it but don't think it rates the 5 stars I gave it but can't change that.\nOnce your child goes on to solid foods BEWARE!\nSolid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.\nI still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.\n","annotations":[]}
