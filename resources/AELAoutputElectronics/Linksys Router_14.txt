{"text":"I got it working fast enough.\nIt is a nice router in all ways but one.\nIt is not reliable.\nA couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.\nThat is, you cannot access the internet at all.\nAll lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.\nJust no internet.\nYou have to unplug the unit to get it to work again.\nVery annoying.\nI did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.\nMy mistake.\nI have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":140,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":134}]}
