{"text":"This router seems to have gotten mixed reviews for ease of installation and its compatability with 11b cards.\nMy experience with installation was quite good.\nI upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).\nThe card basically installed itself and the \"install wizard\" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).\nThe setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.\nThe whole process was probably about 10 minutes.\nSetting up the 2nd computer really was easy too -- basically hooking the computer to the router and!\nrunning the installation wizard again.\nI haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.\nThe documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.\nI like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the \"very good\" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.\nThe transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.\nI have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the \"mixed mode\" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":55,"mention":"ease","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/At_Ease"],"startOffset":51},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"VAIO","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Vaio"],"startOffset":249},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"VAIO","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Vaio"],"startOffset":249},{"endOffset":343,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":337},{"endOffset":343,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":337},{"endOffset":656,"mention":"DSL","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damn_Small_Linux"],"startOffset":653},{"endOffset":656,"mention":"DSL","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damn_Small_Linux"],"startOffset":653},{"endOffset":911,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":905},{"endOffset":911,"mention":"wizard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Wizard"],"startOffset":905},{"endOffset":1025,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic_.NET"],"startOffset":1020}]}
