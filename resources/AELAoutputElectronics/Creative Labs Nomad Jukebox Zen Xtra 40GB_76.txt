{"text":"i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .\nthe combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .\nthe biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .\nfact is , it could n't be easier to use .\nthese models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .\nassuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .\nsound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .\neven leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .\nthe menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .\nthe battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .\nconnect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !\nget those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .\nawesome feature .\nusb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .\nminor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .\nthat is , if a folder on your computer called \" mp3 \" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .\nthe zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .\nnot a big hassle as many would have you think .\n2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called \" unknown . \"\ni would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .\nwhen the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .\ntake the time to fill in those tags !\n3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .\nin fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .\nso what are you waiting for ?\nget one now !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":21,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":18},{"endOffset":185,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":179},{"endOffset":289,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":286},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":502},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":502},{"endOffset":569,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":563},{"endOffset":686,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":683},{"endOffset":849,"mention":"crystal","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crystal_Reports"],"startOffset":842},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1317,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1312},{"endOffset":1353,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":1350},{"endOffset":1353,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":1350},{"endOffset":1353,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":1350},{"endOffset":1353,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":1350},{"endOffset":1426,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1421},{"endOffset":1426,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1421},{"endOffset":1426,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1421},{"endOffset":1462,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1456},{"endOffset":1495,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1490},{"endOffset":1495,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1490},{"endOffset":1586,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":1583},{"endOffset":1586,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":1583},{"endOffset":1599,"mention":"slayer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Advanced_Dungeons_&_Dragons:_Slayer"],"startOffset":1593},{"endOffset":1653,"mention":"ice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Research_Image_Composite_Editor"],"startOffset":1650},{"endOffset":1658,"mention":"cube","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Power_Mac_G4_Cube"],"startOffset":1654},{"endOffset":1653,"mention":"ice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Research_Image_Composite_Editor"],"startOffset":1650},{"endOffset":1658,"mention":"cube","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Power_Mac_G4_Cube"],"startOffset":1654},{"endOffset":1790,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1787},{"endOffset":1790,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1787},{"endOffset":1833,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1827},{"endOffset":1833,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1827},{"endOffset":1833,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1827},{"endOffset":1859,"mention":"name","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BIND"],"startOffset":1855},{"endOffset":1955,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1950},{"endOffset":1955,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1950},{"endOffset":1955,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1950},{"endOffset":1955,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1950},{"endOffset":1955,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1950},{"endOffset":2154,"mention":"musicmatch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":2144},{"endOffset":2199,"mention":"musicmatch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":2189},{"endOffset":2257,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":2254},{"endOffset":2376,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2371},{"endOffset":2376,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2371}]}
