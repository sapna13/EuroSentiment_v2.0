{"text":"i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .\ni was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player \/ harddrive .\nfor an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .\ni refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is \" trendy \" to have that player .\nthis was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .\nafter receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .\ni will just say this :\ni will never go back to my archos again ! !\nso easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .\nstayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .\njust easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.\nnot only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .\nvery sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .\nthe leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .\nall the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .\nthe sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .\nlots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .\nnavigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .\nalso navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .\nit was impossible to do so before .\noh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^\nanother plus in my book , no file limits !\ni was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .\ni have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .\ni am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .\nnow i can transport files to friends house with ease .\nwhen plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .\nafter playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !\ni really have no complaints over this unit .\ni really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .\nin fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing
