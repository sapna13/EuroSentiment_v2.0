{"text":"The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.\nThe video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.\nThe voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.\nThe games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.\nBut you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.\nOverall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.\nIf your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.\nThe battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.\nThis phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":14,"mention":"nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":4},{"endOffset":346,"mention":"pac-man","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pac-Man"],"startOffset":339},{"endOffset":360,"mention":"mafia wars","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mafia_Wars"],"startOffset":350}]}
