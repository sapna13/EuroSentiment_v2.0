{"text":"this camera has a major design flaw .\nwhen you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .\ni called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .\nafter about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .\neverything else about the camera is great .\nif you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .\nhowever for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .\ni 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .\n","annotations":[]}
