{"text":"this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .\nthe pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .\nit is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .\nit is light enough to carry around all day without bother .\noperating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .\nthe manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .\nthe auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .\ncomes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .\ni bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .\ni enthusiastically recommend this camera .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":696,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":691}]}
