{"text":"This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.\nI was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.\nI was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)\nThe interface is simple to use.\nI saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.\nI have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.\nI did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.\nThe camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.\nOn the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).\nOutside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.\nAs I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.\nAlong the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.\nFor those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.\nOn occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.\nAnd Bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as I thought it would, I usually can go 1.5 days with Bluetooth on along with making calls before I need a full recharge.\nWith Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":27,"mention":"blend","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Expression_Blend"],"startOffset":22},{"endOffset":219,"mention":"Mac","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_OS"],"startOffset":216},{"endOffset":316,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":310},{"endOffset":316,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":310},{"endOffset":1430,"mention":"Mac","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_OS"],"startOffset":1427},{"endOffset":1430,"mention":"Mac","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_OS"],"startOffset":1427},{"endOffset":1430,"mention":"Mac","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_OS"],"startOffset":1427},{"endOffset":1457,"mention":"iSync","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ISync"],"startOffset":1452},{"endOffset":1463,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AppleWorks"],"startOffset":1458},{"endOffset":1457,"mention":"iSync","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ISync"],"startOffset":1452},{"endOffset":1463,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AppleWorks"],"startOffset":1458},{"endOffset":1457,"mention":"iSync","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ISync"],"startOffset":1452},{"endOffset":1463,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AppleWorks"],"startOffset":1458},{"endOffset":1536,"mention":"iSync","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ISync"],"startOffset":1531}]}
