Not a single one after 5 months.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":78,"mention":"near","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NearGlobal"],"startOffset":74},{"endOffset":466,"mention":"Silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":460},{"endOffset":549,"mention":"TFT","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Warcraft_III:_The_Frozen_Throne"],"startOffset":546},{"endOffset":556,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":550},{"endOffset":887,"mention":"Cons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":883}]}
