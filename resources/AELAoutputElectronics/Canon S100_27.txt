{"text":"Recently I was at dinner with some friends, and we were debating the merits of one digital camera vs. another.\nOne of my friends was going on and on about his camera and how fancy it was.\nWhile he was talking, I took my S100 out of the front pocket of my Levi's and took his picture.\nI said, can your fancy camera do that?\nNo, because he doesn't (can't) always carry his with him.\nEnd of story.\n","annotations":[]}
