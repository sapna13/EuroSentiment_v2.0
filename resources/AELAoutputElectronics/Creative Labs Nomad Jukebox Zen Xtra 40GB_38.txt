{"text":"i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .\nnaturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .\ncompared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .\n- price : see above .\n- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .\n- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .\nit took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .\n- uploading music is quick and easy .\nalthough the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .\ni have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )\nbtw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .\n- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .\nas often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .\nstructurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .\nthe screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .\nthere are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .\n- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .\nipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .\nalso , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .\n- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .\nthe case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .\nthe headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .\nconclusion :\nthis player is an ideal purchase .\nthere is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .\ni would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":168,"mention":".net","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/.NET_Framework"],"startOffset":164},{"endOffset":168,"mention":".net","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/.NET_Framework"],"startOffset":164},{"endOffset":243,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":240},{"endOffset":508,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":503},{"endOffset":508,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":503},{"endOffset":508,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":503},{"endOffset":508,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":503},{"endOffset":508,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":503},{"endOffset":734,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":731},{"endOffset":734,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":731},{"endOffset":734,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":731},{"endOffset":734,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":731},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1063},{"endOffset":1124,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1118},{"endOffset":1124,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1118},{"endOffset":1124,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1118},{"endOffset":1124,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1118},{"endOffset":1804,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1798},{"endOffset":1929,"mention":"ease","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/At_Ease"],"startOffset":1925},{"endOffset":1983,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1977}]}
