{"text":"Here is the big news to everyone; this is a consumer level product.\nThis is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment.\nYou will not be able to run 100's users using WPA and WPA2 encryption through this thing, just a handful of people on a cable modem or DSL line.\nPeople that complain about this product not standing up to hardcore use are fooling themselves.\nThey need to step up and buy an enterprise level piece of hardware for a lot more money.\nThat aside, this is not that bad of a product.\nI have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it.\nWith a little knowledge and tweaking, you can get this product to run encrypted wireless connections to about 10 people with little or no problem.\nIf you have users that use P2P, you will need to tweak this and all wireless routers.\nP2P is just harsh on networking equipment of!\nall kinds.\nOn the subject of Third Party firmware; Linksys WRT54G versions 1 through 4 run Linux.\nBecause of that, a bunch of really smart people sat down and figured out how to make the Linksys WRT54G run their own custom firmware.\nSo, if you type in \"Linksys firmware\" into Google or A9, you will get a list of websites that have custom firmware for various kinds of Linksys Routers (Linksys makes a few routers that run Linux).\nThe really neat thing about this is that the third party firmware are very powerful and add many more features to the WRT54G that are not there, but should be. ##However, the version of the WRT54G that Amazon.com and most other places sell is version 5.\nThe new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half.\nSimply put, the hardware is just too small to run Linux, which is a really bummer since I found it fun to play with my Linksys WRT54G's firmware.\nHowever, if you are not a tech person and!\njust want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it.\nJust make sure to get someone to help you configure the encryption if you can not do it yourself.\nDo not use this thing without Wireless Encryption.\nAll wireless routers need to be configured to use Wireless Encryption, so this is just not a problem with the WRT54G.\nIf you are a tech person and want to really play with your WRT54G, sorry, but you need to get the WRT54GS router.\nThey have the large amounts of RAM and still run Linux.\nI would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":143,"mention":"office","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Corel_WordPerfect_Office"],"startOffset":137},{"endOffset":308,"mention":"DSL","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damn_Small_Linux"],"startOffset":305},{"endOffset":313,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":309},{"endOffset":498,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":493},{"endOffset":1007,"mention":"Linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1133,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":1127},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"custom","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Kimber_Custom"],"startOffset":1243},{"endOffset":1339,"mention":"Linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":1334},{"endOffset":1639,"mention":"Linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":1634},{"endOffset":1766,"mention":"Linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":1761},{"endOffset":2435,"mention":"RAM","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile"],"startOffset":2432},{"endOffset":2435,"mention":"RAM","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile"],"startOffset":2432},{"endOffset":2435,"mention":"RAM","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile"],"startOffset":2432},{"endOffset":2455,"mention":"Linux","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Linux"],"startOffset":2450},{"endOffset":2583,"mention":"stuff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/StuffIt"],"startOffset":2578},{"endOffset":2583,"mention":"stuff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/StuffIt"],"startOffset":2578},{"endOffset":2583,"mention":"stuff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/StuffIt"],"startOffset":2578}]}
