{"text":"I bought this two months ago at a local retailer, after spending considerable time reading reviews here of this and other 5GB players.\nWhile they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player.\nAlso, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.\nI was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand\/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc).\nAnd so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro.\nIt's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc).\nJust in case, I bought a two-year extended warranty for about 15% of the purchase price of the player.\nI promptly gave the included earbuds to my wife, I'm using a pair of Sennheiser PXC250 noise-canceling headphones with the Zen Micro.\nThe Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface.\nWhat I like the most:  - Small and solid feel.\nThe Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid.\nThe blue backlight is pretty cool.\nThe screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.\n- Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones.\nI managed to fit about 700 tracks on the player, but many of those are 6-15 minute long classical tracks.\n- Integration with Media Player.\nThe first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.\n- Replaceable battery.\nA must for me, the fact that you can carry extra batteries is a big bonus.\n- The FM Radio.\nI find myself listening to the radio a lot.\nYou have to be in an area with good reception, but where I live I can get most of my favorite stations quite well.\n- Doubles as a removable disk drive.\nWith the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.\nI have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.\nThe only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most.\nPlus, from the Creative discussion forums it is clear that they have some problems with excessive battery drainage with the current firmware.\nThey seem to be working on a fix and will probably sort it out soon.\nFor me, I get through a typical day's listening just fine, and I could probably squeeze out two days, but it really is no big deal to just charge the Micro overnight.\nEven the \"shorter\" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way.\nIf you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":214,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":211},{"endOffset":239,"mention":"Ipod
