{"text":"i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .\nof course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .\nthe picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .\nit seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .\nalso , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .\nbut , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":574,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":568},{"endOffset":574,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":568}]}
