{"text":"I love the performance and features of this router.\nFor the money, I'm not sure you can do better.\nIt's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.\nI bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.\nI've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well.\nSmooth plunging mechanism.\nThe guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.\nThe only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits.\nIt's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.\nEven with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":65,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":60},{"endOffset":130,"mention":"universal","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Universal"],"startOffset":121},{"endOffset":130,"mention":"universal","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Universal"],"startOffset":121},{"endOffset":660,"mention":"chuck","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ChucK"],"startOffset":655},{"endOffset":660,"mention":"chuck","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ChucK"],"startOffset":655},{"endOffset":660,"mention":"chuck","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ChucK"],"startOffset":655}]}
