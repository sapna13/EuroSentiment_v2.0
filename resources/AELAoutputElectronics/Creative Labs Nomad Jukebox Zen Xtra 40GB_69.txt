{"text":"like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .\nthe price \/ performance looked just right .\nwhen i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .\nboy was i wrong .\nreading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .\nthat 's been my experience .\nif i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .\nbut i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .\nnow i know better .\ni 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .\na $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?\nso now i 've got to call their customer \" service \" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .\nfrom the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .\ni fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .\nnow let 's talk about the software .\nlike other reviewers , installation was hell .\nsubsequent behavior even worse .\nabout 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .\nafter i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .\nin fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .\nfinally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .\nto my amazement , even that process was error-prone .\nit took several days of attempts before things finally \" worked \" again and i have n't a clue why .\nthat does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .\ni did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .\nbut that 's a moot point now .\nmy gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .\nmy gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .\nwhich means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .\nbe forewarned .\ni would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .\nnow , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt
