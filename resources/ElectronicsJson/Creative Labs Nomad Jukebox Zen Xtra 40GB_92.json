{"Text":"the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .  those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .  the price is way below an ipod of the same size .  the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .  the sound quality is very good .  the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .  because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .  for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .  having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .  they fall in love with the product .  and then it breaks .  usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .  typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .  the nomad is sent back to creative labs .  they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .  in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .  like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .  if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .  i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .  the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .  the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .  the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .  even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .  and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .  this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .  so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .  you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .  you will have a very expensive paperweight .  there are not a lot of good options out there .  most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .  my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .  maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .  maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .  and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .  whatever you do , do n't buy this product .  you will be sorry if you do .","control":-2,"front cover":-2,"headphone jack":-2,"sound quality":2}
