{"Text":"this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .  now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !  i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .  the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !  it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .  i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .  i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .  the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .  one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .  my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .  they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .  whereas some folks have the \" ipod \" , i have the \" nomad jukebox zen xtra \" ( not to be confused with the \" nomad jukebox zen nx \" ) .  minor gripe .  i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .","software":-1,"navigation":2,"name":-2,"napster":2,"sound quality":3}
