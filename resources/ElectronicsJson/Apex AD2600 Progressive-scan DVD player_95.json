{"Text":"this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .  it goes nicely with my apex 27 \" in my bedroom .  the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .  i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .","price":3,"build quality":2}
