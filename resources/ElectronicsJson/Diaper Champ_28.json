{"smell":3,"Text":"My biggest concern was would this truly control the odor and yes it did.  dirty diapes and soaked diapers.  I only noticed an odor one time and that was because I did not close thelid when I changed out the bag.  No need for deodorizers.  I use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty.  even did while daughter sleep and no noise!  I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!  This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.","odor":3,"empty":3,"noise":3}
