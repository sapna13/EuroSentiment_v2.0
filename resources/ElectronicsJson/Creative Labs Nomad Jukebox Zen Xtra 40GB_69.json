{"installation":-3,"Text":"like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .  the price \/ performance looked just right .  when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .  boy was i wrong .  reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .  that 's been my experience .  if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .  but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .  now i know better .  i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .  a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?  so now i 've got to call their customer \" service \" ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .  from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .  i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .  now let 's talk about the software .  like other reviewers , installation was hell .  subsequent behavior even worse .  about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .  after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .  in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .  finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .  to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .  it took several days of attempts before things finally \" worked \" again and i have n't a clue why .  that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .  i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .  but that 's a moot point now .  my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .  my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .  which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .  be forewarned .  i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .  now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .","price":1,"online help":-2,"headphone jack":-2,"notmad software":2,"construction":-3,"nomad":-3}
