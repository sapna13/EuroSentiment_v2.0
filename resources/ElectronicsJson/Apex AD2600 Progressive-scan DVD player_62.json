{"Text":"i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .  set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .  lip- there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .  but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .  amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .  perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy \" off \" brands .","sync":-1,"set up":1,"video":-2,"amazon":3}
