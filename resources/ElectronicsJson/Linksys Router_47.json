{"Text":"router[-3][p]  We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.  slow[-2][u]  It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.  It's very frustrating to try to complete school work or work, only to lose it because I am dropped every couple of minutes.  The tech support is worthless too.","support":-3}
