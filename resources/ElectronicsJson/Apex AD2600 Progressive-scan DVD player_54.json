{"Text":"first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .  unlike some of the other people who received a \" lemon \" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .  as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .  what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .  for example , i tried playing my new \" pirates of the carribean \" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .  at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my \" alias \" dvds as well .  this player seems to work fine with everything else .  so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .  because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .","player":1,"dvd":-2,"read":-2,"design":2}
