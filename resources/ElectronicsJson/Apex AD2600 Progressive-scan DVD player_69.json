{"look":2,"Text":"the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .  i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .  after \" loading \" for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated \" no disk \" .  after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .  only one disk played through to completion successfully .  at $ 49 .  i guess you get what you pay for .  i 'd recommend against this unit .","dvd":-3,"disk":-2,"video":-2}
