{"Text":"if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .  these are the reasons i think it 's great :  1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .  2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .  3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .  4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .  5 for \" digital film \" it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .  6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .  7 picture quality is excellent .  8 battery life is excellent .  9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .  10 great price for all the features .  here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :  1 no direct firewire to the camera .  there is usb , though .  2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .  this does n't affect the picture , of course .  you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .  it 's no problem for me personally .  3 battery has to be removed to recharge .  4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .  5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .  most of these \" annoyances \" , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .","control":2,"battery life":2,"optical zoom":2,"price":2,"picture quality":2,"firewire":-1,"nikon support":1,"use":2,"feature":2,"viewfinder":-1}
