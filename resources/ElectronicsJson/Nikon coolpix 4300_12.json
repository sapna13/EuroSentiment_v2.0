{"picture":2,"Text":"after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .  it has many great features and very few bad ones .  it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .  if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .  the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .  downloads are a snap and quick .  controls easy yo use and easy to get to .  i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .","control":2,"camera":3,"lcd":-1,"download":2}
