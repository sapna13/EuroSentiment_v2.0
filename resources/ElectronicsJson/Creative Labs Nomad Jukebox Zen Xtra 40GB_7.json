{"Text":"one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .  the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .  on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .  despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .  the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .  with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .  i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .  the player itself has all sorts of problems .  the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .  the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .  the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .  depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .  the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .  on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .  i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .  overall , a very disappointing product .  the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .  the player 's mechanics are also flawed .  although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .","software":-2,"face plate":-1,"player":-2,"audio":2,"file transfer":-1,"scroll":-1,"sound":2,"setup":-3}
