{"iTunes":1,"Text":"Still not so sure about this one...  First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself.  So far, in the month that I have had it, I have had to take it in for service twice.  This is a hassle, of course, but I'm not sure if the problems are to blame on poor construction, cold weather, or misuse by yours truly.  In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.  Again, another hassle.  To be sure, I am not looking forwards to paying for the battery replacement, whenever that may come.  But enought of the negativity.  I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.  Sound quality is more dependant on the quality of the original source and of the unit used to broadcast (headphones, stereo, etc).  Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.  Someone wrote that they haven't been able to upload songs from burned cds; I have not found this to be so.  I have several hundred songs from burned albums, at they all worked fine.  As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough.  I haven't used it to purchase any files, so I don't know about that.  All in all, it does what it is supposed to do with minimal frustration.  In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4\/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.  In the end, I haven't used it long enough to say that it is worth the extra money.  Do your research before you buy it, and especially talk to other owners.","battery":-2,"quality":2,"interface":2,"iPod":2}
