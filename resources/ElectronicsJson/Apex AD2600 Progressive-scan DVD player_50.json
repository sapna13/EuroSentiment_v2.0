{"Text":"i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .  3\/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .  now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .  have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .  have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .  this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .  i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .","player":-2,"customer service":-3}
