{"Text":"i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .  i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .  now i need to buy myself another one !  have used it frequently and have had no problems .  i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .  i liked this one enough to buy another .  my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .  great quality picture and features .","player":1,"apex":2,"picture quality":2}
