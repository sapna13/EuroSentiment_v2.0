{"Text":"charged my battery .  plugged it in .  installed software .  started ripping and transferring .  if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .  i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .  working for 10 hours with it on \" shuffle \" totally rocks ! !  i love it ! !"}
