{"Text":"i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :  pros :  size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .  sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .  speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .  surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .  cons :  ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .  the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .  games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .","screen":-2,"speakerphone":2,"web":2,"ring tone":-2,"game":-2,"ringing tone":3,"size":3}
