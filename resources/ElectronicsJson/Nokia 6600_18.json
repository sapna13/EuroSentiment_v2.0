{"Text":"At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.  One minute with the salesman and I was sold.  This thing does everything but washes your dishes.  I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.  The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.  I could go on and on---but I won't!  Go see for yourself.  The ONLY bad thing?  I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.","carrier":-3,"ringtones":3}
