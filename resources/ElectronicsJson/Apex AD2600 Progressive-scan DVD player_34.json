{"Text":"this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .  i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .  for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.  this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .  80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .  having said that , this is what you do . \" add to cart \" !  \" check out \" !  \" enjoy \" !","player":3}
