{"Norton AntiSpam":-2,"product":2,"Text":"NIS is a package of several Norton products.  Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.  If you get NIS be sure you want ALL of them installed and running on your machine.  You can \"disable\" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.  Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.  Every time I start Eudora, a message from AntiSpam pops up telling me that COM automation needs to be turned on for it to run properly.  I guess the possibility that someone might not want it to run at all never occured to the designers.  Just to try to shut it up, I told it to go ahead and turn on COM automation.  This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.  But those 2 come up every time.  And this despite the fact that I'm not even using AntiSpam.  Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.  Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.  And you have to put up the 30 bucks to get them to decide.  Nice little racket they've got there.","charge":-2,"components":-1,"Norton":-2,"unstalling":-1}
