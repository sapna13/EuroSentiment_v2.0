{"reception":2,"Text":"i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .  we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .  the phones are awesome .  we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .  here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .  you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps \/ games .  the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .","phone":3,"sound quality":2,"pc suite":2}
