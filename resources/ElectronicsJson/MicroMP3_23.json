{"look":2,"Text":"player[+3][p]  This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price.  cost[+1] ##the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro.  features[+2][u]  It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately.  design[+3]  Creative did an awesome job with the design.  extra accessories[+2][u] ##The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one.  player[+2][p]  I have the black one and adore it.  background light[+3] ##It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black.  touchpad[-1][u]  The touch buttons do take a little getting used to and I don't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an \"enter\" key, but you get used to it and it isn't a big deal.  I take mine everywhere.","headphones":2,"storage":1}
