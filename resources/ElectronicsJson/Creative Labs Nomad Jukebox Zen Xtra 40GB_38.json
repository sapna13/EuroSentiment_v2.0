( it 's fast too ! )  btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .  - the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .  as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .  structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .  the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .  there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .  - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .  ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .  also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .  - equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .  the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .  the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .  conclusion :  this player is an ideal purchase .  there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .  i would recogmend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .","software":2,"battery life":2,"price":2,"button":2,"uploading":2,"battery":2,"value":3,"feature":1,"case":-1}
