{"Text":"I have two linksys routers, one wireless g, and the other cabled.  disconnecting[-2][u]  Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best.  When that happens i have to restart my pc or restart the linksys router.  Both routes take me a few minutes of precious time when i would be online doing something important.  junk[-3][p][s]  Stay away from this junk.  Do your research and buy something like netgear or dlink."}
