{"picture":2,"Text":"the camera 's a work of art \/ science -- that 's understood .  it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .  to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
