{"Text":"what the hell is wrong with this thing .  i bought this thing because it plays everything .  this is the third apex dvd i bought .  the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .  the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .  but heck it plays my alias dvds .  what the heck is up with the 2600 .  it suppose to play everything .  wrong !  by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .  i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .  you should too .  forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.","play":-2}
