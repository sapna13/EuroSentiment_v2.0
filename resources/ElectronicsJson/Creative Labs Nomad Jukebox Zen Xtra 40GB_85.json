{"Text":"i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .  the pros :  price !  almost half what an ipod would cost you !  i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .  sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .  yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .  i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song \/ playlist etc fast enough .  i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !  cons .  creative software stinks .  it 's horrible .  redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !  the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .","software":-3,"cover":-2,"price":2,"interface":2,"playlist":2,"sound quality":2,"earphone":-3}
