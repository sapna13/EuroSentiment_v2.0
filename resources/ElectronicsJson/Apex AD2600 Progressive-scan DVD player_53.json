{"smell":1,"look":2,"Text":"the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .  the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :  i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .  i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).  back to the 2600 :  1 .  it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .  2 .  without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .  3 .  excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .  4 .  remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .  anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .  i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :  with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .","picture quality":3,"remote":2}
