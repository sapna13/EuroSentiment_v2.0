{"Text":"and also , it 's priced very affordably .  with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .  a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .  having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .  having to copy \/ delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .  the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's \" notmad \" software because of some advanced features i wanted .  the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .  on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .  sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .  accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .  possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him \/ herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .  since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .  try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .  i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .  the ipod 's white plastic look \/ surface does n't suit me .  i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .  the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .  my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .","software":2,"price":2,"color":1,"sound":2,"battery":3,"value":2,"accessing file":1,"storage":2,"sound setting":1}
