{"Text":"I purchased two of these beauties.  For exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.  I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.  One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.  My routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.  The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy\/junk) routers I have previously purchased.  I have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.  They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.  I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.  The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.  I say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.  As I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.  I would however highly recommend the m12v router !","router":2,"setup":2,"collets":3,"money":2,"power":2}
