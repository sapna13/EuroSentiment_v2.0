{"Text":"before i decided to get this player , i did my research .  i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .  i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .  another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .  that takes up half the space of mp3 's .  that 's important because i have a lot of music .  the software is great .  you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .  transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .  even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .  only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .  i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .  they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .  can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .  get it , it 's woth every penny ! !","wma file":2,"software":2,"battery life":2,"deal":3,"accessory":-1,"remote":-2,"interface":2}
