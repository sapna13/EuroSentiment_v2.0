{"manual":-2,"Text":"this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .  zen good points :  1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .  2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .  the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .  flaws :  1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?  mediasource did not recognize my tags !  my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .  i do n't think so .  btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .  2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .  after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .  when i turned eax off the static disappeared .  when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .  creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .  is eax faulty ?  is my unit defective ?  was i just unlucky at that moment ?  was it a full moon that night ?  i have n't figured it out yet .  3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .  do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .  many reviewers refer to it as \" clunky \" or \" difficult \" - heed their warnings .  some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;  i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .  4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .  in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .  my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .  5 . the zen does not have a stop button !  you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the \" next track \" or \" previous track \" button .  but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .  to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .  6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .  if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .  7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .  it referred to a \" microsoft jet database engine \" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;  i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .  creative provided e-mail support ;  i followed their advice but that failed , too .  i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .  so it is probably \" just bad luck \" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .  however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .  third party software to the rescue  after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .  i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .  this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .  m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !  notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...  conclusion :  if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .  given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .  and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...  to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;  i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;  i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .  the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).","software":2,"mediasource":-2,"player":-3,"usb recharge":-1,"stoppage":1,"notmad":2,"folder structure":-2,"eax":-2,"stop button":-2,"storage":-2}
