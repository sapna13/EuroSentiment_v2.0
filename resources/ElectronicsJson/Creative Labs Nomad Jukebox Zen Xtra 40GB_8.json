{"Text":"i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .  when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .  if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .  this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .  i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .  one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .  other than that this thing is great ...  enjoy !","price":2,"scroll":-1,"this thing":3}
