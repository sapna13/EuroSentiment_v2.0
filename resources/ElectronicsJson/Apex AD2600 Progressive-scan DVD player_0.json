{"Text":"repost from january 13 , 2004 with a better fit title .  does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video ?  or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?  before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car , try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .  no picture :  hopefully you still have the remote control .  if you tossed it out the window , you need to fetch it .  using the remote control , press the i\/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .  the i\/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .  if this doesnt bring back the picture , try pressing this button without playing a dvd .  if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !  picture scrolling in b\/w :  you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .  press the p\/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .  the p\/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .  by pressing p\/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .  for other problems go to http:\/\/www.apexdigitalinc.com\/support.asp  i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .  i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .  im a more happier person after discovering the i\/p button !  the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .  but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !  it practically plays almost everything you give it .  i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .  for the price it is a well spent investment !  i would recommend buying one .","price":2,"player":2,"dvd player":2,"i\/p button":2}
