I have a ton of cds and I make a mess trying to organize them into things.  The I-Pod certainly helps me with my music and I can take it anywhere with me.  I can take it to Work, School, and even listen to it at my computer.  Also, a word of warning, hide the White Earbud headphones, because they are the most noticable earphones ever and your precious I-Pod could be stolen from you if you don't take steps to hide it from view of other people.  I hope you enjoy your I-Pod!","Breaks":-2,"Pod":2,"charger":1,"Hard drive":-1,"use":2,"Tunes":1}
