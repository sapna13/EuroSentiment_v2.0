{"Text":"i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !  there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .  i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .  canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .  i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .  needless to say , the canon won , hands down .  this camera performs like i can not believe !  i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !  it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .  this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !  another point of note : the battery life is incredible !  i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .  i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .  this camera will stay with me for years !","battery life":3,"camera":3}
