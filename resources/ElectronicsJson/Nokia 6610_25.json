{"color screen":1,"Text":"i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .  prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .  to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .  my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .  nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .  first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .  i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .  the phone is small , light , and very attractive .  the battery life is amazing .  the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .  i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .  i highly recommend this phone to anyone .  i 've yet to be dissappointed .","battery life":3,"phone":2,"weight":1,"nokia":2}
