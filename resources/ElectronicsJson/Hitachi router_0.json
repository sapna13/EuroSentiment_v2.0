{"Text":"I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.  Well, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.  The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.  I tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.  The collet for the 1\/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.  Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.  I never could get the panel bit to fit right.","adjustment":-1,"performed":2,"collet":-1,"use":-2}
