{"product":3,"Text":"i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .  i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .  always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .  tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .  i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the \" rigor \" of a business traveler .","durability":-3,"hard drive":-3}
