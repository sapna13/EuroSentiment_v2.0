{"Text":"It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.  But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.  I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.  Also stuck a couple of o-rings in the collet like a previous reviewer suggested & have never had a stuck bit.  Have to clean, buff & lube the plunge rods once in a while but I see that as a non issue because any router should be periodically cleaned anyway.  So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.  Happy woodworking!!","router":1,"track record":1}
