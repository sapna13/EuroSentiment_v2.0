{"Text":"WEP encryption[-1]  I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.  Ironically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.  connectivity[+2]  Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.  firmware update[+2]  New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration.  configuration[+2]  All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network.  router[+3][u]  Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.  installation[+2]  Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.  setting up[+3]  You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.  costlier[-1][u]  Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home\/consumer division of Cisco.  But I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.  Whatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !"}
