{"Text":"Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.  Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market.  Unless you have an enormous music\/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  At an average of 14 cuts per CD, that's over 350 CD's.  This version does not come with a dock, although it can be added later as an accessory.  Y  You can use it to listen to music or audio books, either downloaded via the internet or added to your music library using your CD drive.  Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer.  There's even an equalizer (under \"settings\") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, \"deep\", and electronic.  With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster.  The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so.  Both platforms work seamlessly with the iPod.  The box comes with iPod, ear buds, iTunes and iPod software, USB 2.0 and FireWire cables, and a home charger.  You  will need a computer with a six-pin FireWire or USB 2.0 port (USB 1.1  For Mac owners, you'll need Mac OS X 10.1.5 or later (10.3.4 or later is recommended) and your machine must have the appropriate ports built-in.  PC users must have a processor of 500 MHZ or faster, Windows 2000 with Service Pack 4 or later or Windows XP, with the ports either built-in or expanded with a card.  ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.  Since nothing is perfect, the iPod does have some disadvantages, such as its reliance on iTunes to download music (if you hate iTunes, don't buy an iPod!).  Because it is a hard drive, it has moving parts unlike other MP3 players, perhaps making it more prone to catastrophic damage.  Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.  All in all, this is a wonderful device.  About 1\/2 inch thick, with the face dimensions the size of a credit card, it can be slipped in a pocket or carried easily in the han!d.  The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel.  Highly recommended for people who like to listen to music or audio books on the go.","weight":-1,"wheel":2,"ITunes":2,"capacity":2,"reformatted":-2,"steel backing":-2,"accessories":1,"iPod":2,"design":2,"equalizer":2}
