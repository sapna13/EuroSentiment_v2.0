{"Text":"I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a \"customer priority ID number.\"  Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.  So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).  And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.  I may not be a computer expert but I am perfectly capable of following detailed instructions, and Norton just makes life way too hard.  Plus, when Norton provided online updates, there were so many unexplained categories (about 15 over and above virus definitions)  I was totally baffled.","support":-1,"priority ID":-1,"Norton":-3}
