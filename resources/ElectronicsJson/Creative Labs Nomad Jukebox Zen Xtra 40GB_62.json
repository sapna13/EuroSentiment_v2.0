{"Text":"i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .  but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .  i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .  two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .  i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .  it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .  moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .  ( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )  if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .  but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .  so i 'm screwed .  but you do n't have to be .  if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .  or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .  it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .","sound quality":2}
