{"Text":"i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !  it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .  one stopped working in february and the other in march .  amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .  i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .","dvd player":-3}
