{"picture":-2,"Text":"only used for 3 month before it 's down !  i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !  it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .  the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .  maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .","color":-2}
