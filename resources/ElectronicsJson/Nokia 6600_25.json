{"Text":"I bought this phone after having other phones that had less-than-consistant reception.  signal[+3][u][cc] UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).  I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.  Photos are pretty darned good!  DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.  speed[-3][u][cs] My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.  The \"movies\" last about 5 seconds.  I mean, they're short!  Why have the function if you can't film anything longer than e few seconds?  I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.  Also, when I dial an \"800\" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.  This is a MUST when you need to get flight times, connect to reservations, etc.  Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.  It would not hang up on calls.  Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.  Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.  But beware of the bugs; they are major!","screen":-3,"Photos":3,"phone":2,"Bluetooth":3,"navigatee":-3,"feature":-3}
