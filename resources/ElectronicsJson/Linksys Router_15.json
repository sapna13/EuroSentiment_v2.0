{"Text":"I replaced my D-link 802.11b router because it could not hold a connection continuously.  See my other reviews for the details.  Broadcom hardware[+2]  I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.  This is because the Lucent drivers use PIO whereas the Broadcom drivers use DMA.  I am not sure if this is still the case with lucent drivers."}
