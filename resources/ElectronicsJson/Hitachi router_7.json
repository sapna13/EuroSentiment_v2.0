{"guide":1,"Text":"I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.  The deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.  I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.  The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.  The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.  The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.  It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.  Those are the good points.  There are a few points of contention which I have.  The depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a \"ball park\" measure.  The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.  This entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.  The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.  Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.  I plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.  Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.","fit":-1,"price":2,"adjustment":1,"instructions":-1,"speed":2,"heavy":1,"plunge":-1}
