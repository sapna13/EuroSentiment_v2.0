{"Text":"i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .  had no problem with it .  now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .  so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .  it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .  i have a dvd burner .  apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r\/rw and dvd-r \/ rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r\/rw and another supports - r\/rw ) .  i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .  some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !  most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .  if you are skeptical about trying apex .  take my words and give it a try .  hopefully you wo n't regret .  goodluck !","apex":2,"run":3,"dvd player":3}
