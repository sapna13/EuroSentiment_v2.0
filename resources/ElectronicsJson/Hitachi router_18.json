{"Text":"This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.  It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.  I have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!  This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.  I use the router with a 3 1\/2in raised panel bit with no problems.  It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.  For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.  You just can't go wrong with this one!  Enjoy.","price":3,"start":1,"router":1,"power":1}
