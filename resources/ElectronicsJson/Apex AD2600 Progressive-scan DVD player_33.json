{"Text":"this dvd play is basicly junk .  it wo n't play all of my movies .  keeps coming up with no disk errors .  i tried called apex cust service , no help .  do n't waste your money .  mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .  this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .  you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .  each of the 4 lasted less than six months .  you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .  spend the money its well worth it .","player":-3,"customer service":-2}
