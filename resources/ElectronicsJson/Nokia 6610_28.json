{"Text":"after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .  i was immediately interested in the 6610 .  i have used this phone for two months now .  not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .  if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .  in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .  the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .  even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .  if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .  although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .  the keypad is a decent size , but the power on\/off key is small and difficult to press .  however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .  in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .  it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .  one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .  overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .  any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .  nokia does not disappoint in this model .  go for it !","battery life":1,"phone":2,"use":1,"radio":2,"voice dialing":-2,"headphone jack":-1,"phone book":2,"key":-2,"volume control":-3,"size":2}
