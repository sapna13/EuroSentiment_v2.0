{"picture":2,"Text":"i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .  it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .  basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .  so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .  the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .  again , though , it has only been used sparingly .  the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie \" extras \" on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .  it 's not a big deal for me .  i simply watched the extra features on another player .  had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .  as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .  it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .  but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .  i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .  there are a lot of things i like about it .  be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .","player":1,"usage":1,"read":-2,"size":1}
