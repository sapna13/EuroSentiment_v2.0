{"Text":"I have purchased two of these phones together from the Amazon market place.  [s] If you are purchasing this phone, then make sure you can handle the speed of this phone.  This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.  The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.  The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.  Its like having a 66Mhz computer with a webcam, fax, printer, blue tooth...etc...Just an example..  I bet most of the users of this phone would agree.  Sometimes,the phone gets stuck just like a computer and it doesnt store any incoming call numbers..etc..  [s] If you find a better phone, then I suggest you go for it."}
