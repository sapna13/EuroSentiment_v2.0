{"Text":"I really liked the firewall.  It can be a pain to configure, but I dealt with it.  THEN all of a sudden when I restarted my pc, I couldn't get to anything in IE.  I have gone to their site many times in the last two months looking for an answer.  I've tried lots of things they suggest.  My computer configuration is probably all screwed up at this point.  The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!  The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.  It's become tedious doing this.  Wish I hadn't renewed my subscription.  Buy ZONE Alarm.  Wish I had.","help":1,"Firewall":-1}
