{"Text":"Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.  It works easily with one hand, which is important.  Also, it takes any kitchen sized trash bag, so there is no special bag to stock.  While the perfect ordor free diaper pail has yet to be invented, the Diaper Champ is a good as it gets.","trash bag":2,"Diaper Champ":2,"works":2}
