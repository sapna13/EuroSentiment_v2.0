{"Text":"This is an excellent router for the money.  I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim.  The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.  I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.  Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.","money":3,"springs":-1,"plunge":-1}
