{"Text":"originally i wanted the ipod .  most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .  i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5 \" hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .  the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .  so what ?  i can do that myself .  longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .  the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .  i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .  however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .  i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .  it can get pretty lonely out there .","battery life":2,"zen":3}
