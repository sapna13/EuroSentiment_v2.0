{"Text":"i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .  i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .  because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .  however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .  the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - \/ + r 's .  it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .  i find this to be a great feature .  i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .  for the money apex machines have good features .  you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .  it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .  i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .","play":2,"feature":2,"design":2}
