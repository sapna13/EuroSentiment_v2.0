{"Text":"This camera is so easy to use!  I just took it out of the box, charged the battery, and started taking pictures.  All the features are incredibly intuitive, even for a novice like me.  I would recommend getting a larger Compact Flash card, because once you start taking pictures, you won't want to stop.  The pictures are beautiful, and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere.","features":3,"pictures":3}
