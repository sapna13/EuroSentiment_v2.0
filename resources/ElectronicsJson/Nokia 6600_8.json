{"Text":"Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.  bluetooth[+3] I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.  Bought a bluetooth headset and it works like a wonder.  Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.  Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.  Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.","transfer":3,"Camera":2,"Handsfree":2,"slow":-2}
