{"Text":"I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking.  Ended up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.  The cheap router I used to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the Linksys WRT54G.  But the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.  I was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.   router[+2]  I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.  You won't regret it.  setup[+3]  The setup was very easy.  instructions[+2]  Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.  anteanna[+1] ##The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.  No more connection!  signals[+3][u]  drops and strong signals even from the backyard.  The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.  Linksys[+2][u]  Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.  quality[+2]  The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.","security":3,"design":2}
