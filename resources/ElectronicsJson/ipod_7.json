{"Text":"i've had a beastly experience from trying to buy an ipod from circuit city.  when i got the ipod, i slid the box out of its sheath and the whole thing tumbled out!  simply put somebody had already opened the box earlier!  the packing inside was in tatters.  i didnt touch the product.  i called circuit city and complained that they had sent me an already opened box.  they initially told me that i would have to ship it back to them on my own cost.  then when i argued with them they told me that they would pick it up.  a week passed but it was never picked up.  the when i called they said they werent responsible for open packages because they couldnt verify it being open when i received it (why else would i want to return it if not for this? if the product was defective i would have complained so) and that if i returned it i would have to pay a 15% restocking fee!  i'm at my wits end with this company.  buyers BEWARE!"}
