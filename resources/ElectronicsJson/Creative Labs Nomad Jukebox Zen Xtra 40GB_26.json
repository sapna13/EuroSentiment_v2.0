{"firmware":-2,"control":-2,"transfer":3,"rename":-2,"earbud":2,"interface":-2,"scroll wheel":-3,"Text":"i received this as a gift .  i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .  however , the creative software is not real intuitive .  the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .  if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .  you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .  transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .  it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .  i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .  i love the storage in this thing .  i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .  i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .  this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .  now my dissapointments .  the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .  the warranty is 90 days .  this is ridiculous .  to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .  buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .  the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .  seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .  the interface used could be better designed .  it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .  i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .  and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .  it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .  the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .  the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .  there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .  despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .  however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .  i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .  the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .  also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .  left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .  could not stop it , could not get out of the \" now playing \" screen .  again had to remove the battery .  there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .  quite simply , the firmware and \/ or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .  there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the \" now playing \" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .  i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .  now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .  i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .  and we all know about the rush to market on new products .  i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .  while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .  i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year \" no questions asked \" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !","software":-2,"sound":2,"case":-3,"warranty":-3,"lock up":-2,"storage":3}
