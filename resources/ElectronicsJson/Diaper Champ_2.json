{"product":3,"Text":"We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.  We hated that thing!  The \"new\" design still needs lots of improvement!  The bags never fit right and then it never spun right.  And after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.  As she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.  We decided we had to have something so we started researching.  The Diaper Champ is the best we found!  There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!  We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.  There is also no trick to it.  No spinning it or anyhting!  Just flip the handle and the diaper is gone!  Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!  We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!  It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!","diaper":2,"smelling":-1,"bag":2,"Diaper Champ":3,"bags":2}
