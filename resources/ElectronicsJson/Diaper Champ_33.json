{"Text":"We have both a Diaper Champ and a Diaper Genie.  and we definitely prefer our Champ!  Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.  Only problem.  it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.  The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.","unit":-2,"cost effective":3,"pluger":-2}
