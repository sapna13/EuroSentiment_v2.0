{"install":-1,"Text":"I was begining to think I was computer-retarded after dealing with this program.  I was using this on my 2001 Dell laptop (which worked fine until I upgraded to this junk!)  I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!  I decided to give it one last chance... so I formatted my hard drive, reinstalled Windows XP (which also required a day & night download\/install of SP2 on dial-up) and put NIS2004 back onto the computer.  It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)  Blessedly, my DSL was installed just about this time and I set up a wireless network with my desktop.  So when I reformatted for the third time, downloading SP2 took no time at all and the new XP was kind enough to even suggest other antivirus programs to try (it also listed Norton and McAffee).  I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.  I can't recommend their programs enough.  And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!","Computer Associates EZ":1,"processor":-3,"Norton":-3}
