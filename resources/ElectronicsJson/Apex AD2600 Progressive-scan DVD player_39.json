{"picture":-2,"product":2,"manual":-1,"Text":"we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .  it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .  there was neither picture nor sound .  connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .  the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .  i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i\/p button on the remote control .  it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .  obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .  we are overall pleased with product .  i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual ."}
