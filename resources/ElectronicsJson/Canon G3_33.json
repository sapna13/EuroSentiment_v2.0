{"Text":"i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .  you can always spend more money to get a better one .  however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .  it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !  also , the display is \" hinged \" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .  excellent idea !  one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .  however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .  another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .","camera":3,"display":2,"design":2,"compactflash":-2,"noise":2}
