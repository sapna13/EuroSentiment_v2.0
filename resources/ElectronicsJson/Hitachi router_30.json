{"depths":-1,"Text":"I have purchased & used 2 of these routers in the past 3 years.  They last about 1 1\/2 years until the problems start.  My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.  First, I must say that I am a professional woodworker, so, this router was used every day.  Mainly using core box bits & bull nose bits as well as round over bits.  I use it on woods from the hardest of maples & osage to cedars.  When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.  But, the first one just stopped working while pushing through the workpiece.  Then, without warning, it took off again.  Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.  I use these routers under a table.  Outside of needing an extension for half inch bits, which is a problem for most machines of this type.  Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.  You must keep double checking depths.  But, for the money it is a good machine.  Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1\/2 years.  The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.  I am now waiting for this one to stop.  router[+1][u][s] For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.  equipment[+1][u][s] For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.  safety[-1][u][s] If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!","control":-1,"safety":-2,"router":2,"money":1,"depth":-1}
