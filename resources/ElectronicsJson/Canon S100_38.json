{"Text":"The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.  I would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.  I added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.  Now I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).  The optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.  This is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.  While this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.","controls":2,"zoom":1,"capacity":2}
