{"product":2,"look":2,"Text":"i purchased this player last week .  i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .  i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .  i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .  the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .  the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .  the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .  took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .  i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .  all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .  if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .  it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .  i would recommend this product to anyone .","software":2,"battery life":2,"player":2,"navigation":2,"headphone":-1}
