{"sawdust":-1,"Text":"Bought an expensive Dewalt router some three years ago and never became comfortable with it.  I use routers solely for hand work and relegate all table usage (including panels) to my Grizzly shaper.  Gave the Dewalt to a woodworking friend in gratitude for his help in moving tools to a new shop.  Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.  UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.  Both the on\/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.  heavy[+1][u][cc],router[+1][u][cc] It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.  I use custom side clamps set up for 1\/4 and 1\/2 inch bits in order to plough mortises easily (and with great accuracy).  Unlike my experience with the Dewalt, I now enjoy reaching for the Hitachi (and allow me to stress I am a fan of many other Dewalt tools -- especially their large table saw and famous miter saws).  LIKE other reviewers I can attest to the following:  1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.  Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).  I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.  Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.  2. Half-inch router bits provide more operating security and finish quality than do their 1\/4 inch counterparts.  Have read this on the web and can second the comparative preference.  I do woodworking as a serious hobby.  For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.  Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.","price":2,"operate":1,"use":1,"switch":1,"spring":-1}
