{"Text":"logging[-1]  (...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging.  And provides near zero-statistics.  SOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.  This is universal across every brand I've worked with.  If a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.  Very easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.  I'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).  Netgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.  BEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.  SSID are like filenames in Windows.  When your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.  If you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!  ID on their router.  MAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.  MAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.  You don't have to monkey with the PC config.  Easy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.  Best practice is learn how to setup encryption.  WEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldn't figure out how to break it.  WPA is best.  Problem is sometimes you can't get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption.  Getting Apple\/Macs was historically a pain, but they've all improved interoperability now.  Encryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing."}
