{"rip":2,"Text":"i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .  i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .  the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .  plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .  the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .  this is a powerful piece of equipment .  it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .  ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .  considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .  before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .","software":-2,"player":2,"battery":2,"use":2,"memory":2}
