{"Text":"i love this player .  its great .  all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .  i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .  the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .  i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .  it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .  anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .","software":2,"player":3}
