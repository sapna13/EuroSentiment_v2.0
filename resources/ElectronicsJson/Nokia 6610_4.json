{"Text":"i have had this phone for about 5 months .  i treat the battery well and it has lasted .  at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .  it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .  signal strength will affect the battery life .  frequent signal searches eat up battery power .  i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .  i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .  the volume level of the phone is not all that good .  some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .  the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .  the vibration is not top .  it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .  i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .  vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .  so it was no loss .  overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .  great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .  i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .  i am bored with the silver look .","ring":-1,"tone":-2,"phone":2,"battery life":2,"battery":2,"volume":-2,"vibration":-1}
