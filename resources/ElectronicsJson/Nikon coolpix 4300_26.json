{"Text":"i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .  this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .  i have not been disappointed with my purchase .  picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .  on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .  however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .  i am extremely satisfied with this camera .  i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .  buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .  do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .  you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .  i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :  read the directions !  the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .  the \" scene \" mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a \" regular \" setting .  i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .  however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .  buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .","scene mode":2,"picture quality":2,"camera":3,"optical setting":1,"indoor shot":-2}
