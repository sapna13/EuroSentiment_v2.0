{"Text":"i love my new nomad , its great !  now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .  look this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .  for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .  the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .  the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .  on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !  if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1\/3 of the music ) .  but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .  best electronic i 've bought since i was born .  flat out","software":3,"price":3,"deal":3,"case":2,"nomad":3,"headphone":-1}
