{"Text":"i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .  as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .  the entire unit was poorly crafted .  there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .  after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .  most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .  the dvd player just would't recognize them .  it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .  i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .","player":-2,"dvd":-2,"screw tip":-2,"no disc":-2}
