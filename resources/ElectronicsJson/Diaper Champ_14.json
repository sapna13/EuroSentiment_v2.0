{"Text":"For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.  I would not recommend buying that one.  My second child I didn't get any.  Now for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.  I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.  I did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.  I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.  It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.  I haven't noticed any seepage of smells.","replacement":2,"use":3}
