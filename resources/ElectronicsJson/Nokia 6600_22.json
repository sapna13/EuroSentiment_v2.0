{"Text":"I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.  Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.  So, do I recommend the 6600?  [s] Yes, certainly.  But if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.  The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.  The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.  Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.  In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.","camera":3,"keypad":3,"6600":2,"MMC slot":-2,"Multimedia functions":3}
