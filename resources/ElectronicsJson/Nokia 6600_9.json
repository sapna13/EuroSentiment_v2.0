{"looking":2,"Text":"This one has a good looking.  It's oval and... nice.  I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.  It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.  The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.  And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.  I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.  Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.  What's wrong with it?  Is it really slow, or what?  Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.  It's good.  But not good enough for me.  :! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.","screen":2,"color":3,"camera":-2,"use":3,"shape":2}
