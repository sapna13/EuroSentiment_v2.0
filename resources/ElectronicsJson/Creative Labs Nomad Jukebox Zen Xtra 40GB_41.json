{"look":3,"work":-1,"Text":"read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !  ( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .  and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .  eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )  i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .  transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .  it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .  usb 2. usb 2.0 - very fast  yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .  but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .  and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).  it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .  the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .  i am very pleased so far .  i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).  so far so good , no problems , no conversions .  very simple to use .  the reason it does not get 5 stars  1 ) a spare battery would have been great .  2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .  3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players  all in all suprisingly easy to use .","recharger":1,"software":2,"0":3,"scroll":1,"sound":3,"battery":-1,"use":3,"earbud":-3,"game":-1}
