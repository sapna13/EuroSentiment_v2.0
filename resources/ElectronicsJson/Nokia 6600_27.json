{"Text":"According to a survey, more customers are ordering their cell phone and service from AMAZON.COM  [s] But if you are one of the customers contributing to this, its a big mistake.  I have ordered 2 \"cell phone + service\"s from Amazon.  The first shipment took such a long time, I had to cancel it.  The second one is on hold for almost 2 weeks with a message that \"Can be delayed further\".  [s] So if you order one of the top 10 bestselling phones from Amazon now, it will take at least 3 weeks for your shipment to be delivered...guess Amazon is waiting for seconds to re-package,"}
