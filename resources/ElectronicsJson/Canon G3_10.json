{"Text":"this is a great camera for you !  the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an \" auto \" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .  i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !  i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .  i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .  warning - i did read the manual !  but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !  once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .  with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .  the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .  it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !  this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .  you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .  the more i work with it , the more i love it !  i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !  i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !","control":2,"feel":2,"camera":2,"dial":1,"manual mode":2,"photo":3}
