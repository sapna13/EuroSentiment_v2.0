{"Text":"i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .  i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .  that is where my satisfaction ends .  i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .  however , it has failed to deliver on quality .  it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .  on several different occasions it has displayed \" no disc \" with a disc inside .  after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .  i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .  i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .  i guess you get what you pay for .","jpeg":-2,"apex":-1,"quality":-2,"no disc":-2,"amazon":3}
