{"Text":"this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .  i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .  i did n't had any problem till now .  the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .  it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .  however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .  it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .  when talking the voice is not very clear .  but , i would definately recommend this phone .  go for it ...","phone":2,"weight":2,"voice":-2,"sound quality":-2,"design":2}
