{"installation":2,"scroll wheel":-1,"Text":"within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .  it 's a very intuitive program .  i had no problems following their installation instructions .  the menus are very easy to navigate .  the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .  the other controls are all very easy to use .  it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .  the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .  unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .  for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.  it also costs a lot less than the ipod .  the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .  they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .  this is a good deal for music and data storage .","control":3,"play option":1,"deal":2,"program":3,"menu":3,"earbud":1,"playlist":-1}
