{"gprs":-1,"Text":"the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .  when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .  after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .  it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .  the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .  unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .  when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .  the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !  the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .  i like the default blue .  you can also set a background wallpaper .  the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?  no more annoying series of beeps .  this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .  you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .  the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .  the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar \/ organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .  t- the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .  you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .  the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .  t- one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .  their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .  i have been assured this will be fixed soon .  now , for the t-mobile service :  i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .  if you have a question , they have the answer .  and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .  every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .  t- all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .  i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !  the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .  different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .  the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .  this phone is highly recommended otherwise .","screen":2,"ring":1,"phone":2,"rate plan":3,"voice dialing":-2,"ringtone":3,"resolution":2,"earpiece":2,"zone":-2,"size":2}
