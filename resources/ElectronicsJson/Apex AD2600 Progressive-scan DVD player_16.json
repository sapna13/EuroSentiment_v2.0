{"Text":"i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .  nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .  unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .  i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .  on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .  luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .  unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .","player":-2,"dvd":-2,"play":-2}
