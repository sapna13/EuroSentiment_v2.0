{"Picture":3,"N6600":2,"Text":"INCREDIBLE MEMORY!  Aside from a 6MB++ built-in phone memory, there's a 32MB MMC card that goes with it!  Picture quality's great for still and video with sound.  you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone.  you can't do that with a Sony T610 (which i traded for a 6600).  T610 supports only midi files.  N6600 supports midi, wav, amr, mp3 etc.  it has a handsfree loudspeaker, conference and transfer!  i'm having mine upgraded to capture endless video, which right now allows 10 secs.  I'll have to buy bigger MMC card of course.  I love this phone.","MMC card":3,"phone":3,"MEMORY":3,"ringtone":2}
