{"Text":"do n't let my five star rating fool you .  the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .  i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .  i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .  i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .  autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .  i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .  buy this camera and savour it .","autofocus":1,"picture quality":2,"camera":3}
