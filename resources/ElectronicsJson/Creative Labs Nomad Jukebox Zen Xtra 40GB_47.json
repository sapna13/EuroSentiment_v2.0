{"Text":"i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .  it is an extremely cool gizmo .  in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was \" the man \" and wo n't believe i returned it .  so what 's the problem ?  i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .  i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .  i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .  the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .  here 's why :  1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .  i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .  2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )  3 . it 's a hazard in the car .  the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .  ( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .  creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .  the bottom line :  if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd\/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .  sure it 's \" old school \" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .  one major complaint :  my only significant complaint is sound quality .  the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .  this did not give me enough control .  i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .  i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with \" bass boost . \"  the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .  one minor complaint :  the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .  gee ... thanks a lot creative .","navigation":2,"playlist":-2,"sound quality":-2,"eax":-2}
