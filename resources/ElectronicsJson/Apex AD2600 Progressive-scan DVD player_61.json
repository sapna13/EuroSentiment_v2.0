{"Text":"video output stopped workin .  this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .  i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .  i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .  what a disappointment !","video output":-3}
