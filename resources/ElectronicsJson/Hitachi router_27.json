{"Text":"I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.  It is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.  Because of this I have removed the handles.  I like the speed control.  It works well with the larger bits.  (I prefer 1\/2 inch bits).  It has plenty of power.  The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.  Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.  After getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.  The one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.  I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the \"sliding wrench\" which comes on the router.  All in all I am pleased with the router.  The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.","control":1,"adustment knob":-1,"Router Razier":-1,"router":1,"power":1,"wrench":-1}
