{"Text":"My daughter is now 2 and 1\/2, and I am still enjoying this product.  We purchased it based on the reviews, and it really lived up to our expectations.  We liked it because:  1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.  2. You can dump regular trash into it and not feel as though you've wasted plastic.  3. It never smelled - at all.  Here's the catch for us- our daughter never drank formula, which is what gives baby waste a foul smell, and when she was eating solids we followed the American Pediatric Association recommendation to flush solid products instead of disposing of them.  I don't know how this product would hold up to either of these situations.  I just know it really worked for us.  The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.  We graduated to real underwear last week in our house, and I'm passing this on instead of retiring it- it's too good to sit unused in the basement or dump.","container":2,"garbage bags":2}
