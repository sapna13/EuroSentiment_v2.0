{"Text":"i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .  i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .  the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .  navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .  many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .  i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .  i cannot recommend it enough ! !","software":2,"player":3,"navigation":2,"zen xtra":2}
