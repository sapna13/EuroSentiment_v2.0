{"Text":"purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .  the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on\/off button .  the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .  i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .  i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .  they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .  i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .  i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .  once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .  still no response .  i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .","on\/off button":-2,"customer service":-3}
