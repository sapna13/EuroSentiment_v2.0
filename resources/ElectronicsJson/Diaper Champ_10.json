{"Text":"My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.  The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.  I have no issues w\/ odor but baby poop doesn't start to smell really bad till they start on soilid so odor will not be a problem no matter what till then and that's many many months down the road.","fit":-2,"hole":-2}
