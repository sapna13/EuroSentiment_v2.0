{"Text":"summary  overall i like the unit .  i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .  if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .  pros :  1 ) price \/ gb of storage  2 ) storage capacity  3 ) user replaceable battery  cons :  1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )  2 ) scroll button \/ switch  3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .  features that would have been nice :  1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .  2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .  they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .  but who wants the wires involved .  a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .  i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .  details :  do n't drop this unit :  i 've had the player for about a month now .  overall i like it .  as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .  i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .  i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .  i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .  if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .  i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .  updating the unit 's firmware :  when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .  the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .  i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .  storage :  the storage capacity is great .  i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .  i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .  i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .  for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .  typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.  the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .  if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .  you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .  if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).  price :  the price compared to the ipod is great .  price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .  one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .  i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .  it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .  i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .  but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .  scroll bar :  the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .  sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .  it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .  software :  i 've had no problems with the software .  i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .  the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .  my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).  through the software you can classify songs in genres .  this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to \" easy listening \" rather than \" heavy metal \" - no problem .  the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .  you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .  you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .  this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .  in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .  this is pretty cool .  sound :  the sound from the player is ok .  i was a little disappointed in the low end .  i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .  i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .  the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .  it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).","unit":2,"itunes":-2,"software":2,"price":2,"scroll":-2,"sound":-2,"battery":2,"case":-2,"storage":2}
