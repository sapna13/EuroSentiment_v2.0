{"smell":3,"Text":"I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.  It works great.  I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).  I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.  It's much better than putting diapers in a downstairs trashcan.  The reviews were definitely right.","diaper champ":1,"works":2}
