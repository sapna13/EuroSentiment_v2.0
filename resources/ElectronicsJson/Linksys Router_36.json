{"Text":"I purchased the WRT54G about a week ago.  It is attached to my desktop a P4 at 2.6 Ghz running Win XP Home.  To be honest I got it just to link up my Xbox (attached to a WET11 wireless ethernet bridge)to my cable modem (ISP Comcast), so I could get rid of the 70 feet of ethernet cable that ran down the hall.  Even though the WET11 is a B standard I knew that this router would be compatiable and in the future I plan to link 2 other PC's too it .  setup[+3]  The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge.  set up[+3]  To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins.  Not once did I have to call tech support or the IT guy at my workplace.  Nor did I need any settings from my ISP.  setup software[+3]  The setup software did everything.  This is my first foray in!  to the wrld of wireless and it couldn't have gone better.  connection+3]  My Xbox connection seems as good as with a cable.  My Xbox is about 70ft and 3 walls away from the WRT54G.  router[+2]  In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router.  There is also a Panasonic cordless phone (2.4 Ghz) between the wap and the ethernet bridge but it never causes a problem.  Great items !"}
