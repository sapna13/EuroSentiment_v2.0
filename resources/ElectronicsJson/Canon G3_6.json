{"picture":3,"Text":"##the camera has a wonderful set of features .  the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .  you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .  the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .  the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .  i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .  the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .  the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .  the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .  it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .","software":2,"optical zoom":2,"menu":1,"camera":3,"lcd":2,"feature":2,"lens cap":-1}
