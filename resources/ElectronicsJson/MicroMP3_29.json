{"Text":"I bought this item in part due to the good reviews here on Amazon.  software[-3]  The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL.  player[-2]  After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out.  I tried everything to make it work - followed advice from Microsoft support, uninstalled and reinstalled the whole thing, rebooted every five minutes, ran a virus scan on my computer, checked my drives for errors, everything.  working[-2]  I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail.  customer support[-3]  Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless.  Now I have to wait another few days for them to get back to me again, probably with more worthless suggestions?  And t!  player[-3]  his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?  I think I'll stick to CDs."}
