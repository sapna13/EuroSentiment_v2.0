{"feel":-1,"control":-1,"transfer":2,"rip cd":2,"play":-2,"earbud":-2,"sound quality":3,"headphone":-3,"scroll wheel":-2,"Text":"summary :  lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .  pros :  excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .  there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .  transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .  i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .  however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .  you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .  this would have been much easier .  the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .  i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .  this almost made it worth the price alone .  i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .  huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .  30gb is more than enough for most people .  having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .  it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .  it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .  cons :  navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .  this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .  it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .  you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .  whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.  fm receiver - it has none .  i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .  that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .  cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .  the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .  i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .  as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .  the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .  i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .  this is not a player you can take jogging .  the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .  you have to add them to the playing list .  i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .  you have to add all the songs to a play list .  there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .  software - the software is crap .  i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .  otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .  like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .  even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .  i would recommend replacing the existing software with the \" notmad explorer , \" which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .  no line out jack - as i said , there is none .  the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .  so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .  it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .  controls are a bit awkward .  the controls definately took some getting used to .  it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .  when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .  a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .  i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .  crappy headphones .  the included earbuds were uncomfortable .  i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .  difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say \" difficult , \" but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .  it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .  i think this is it 's biggest flaw .  i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .  up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .  if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get \" stuck \" rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .  case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .  it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .  that way i could keep it in the case all the time .  as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .  you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .  overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .  i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .","software":-3,"navigation":-2,"sound":2,"line out jack":-1,"instruction":-1,"fm receiver":-2,"case":-3,"construction":-2,"storage":3}
