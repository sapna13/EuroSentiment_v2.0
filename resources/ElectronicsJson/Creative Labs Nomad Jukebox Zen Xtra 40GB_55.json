{"the unit":2,"Text":"i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .  i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .  the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .  as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !  the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !  i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .  overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .","unit":2,"software":3,"headphone":-3}
