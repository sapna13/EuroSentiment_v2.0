{"Text":"First, I must point out that any router installation is not for the faint of heart.  Networking computers is quite beyond the capabilities of those, who used to think you had to keep the TV on to record it from your VCR.  You have a chance if you're a good cookbook recipe follower.  Yes, that makes women capable of installing these, there's no heavy lifting involved, just some focused thought.  documentation[-1]  Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.  What is really needed with these are plug-ins, (ever present software controls) standard from the operating system, (OS) (Windows, Mac, Linux etc.  ) that use some type of connect standard where the OS does all the work.  It's not here yet!  Why own one of these things then, especially if you only have one computer.  The reason is simple, one word, and \"security\".  The average Windows based computer, can exist on an unprote!  cted Internet connection less than 20 minutes before someone will find its port address, and access it.  They then send in Trojans, Worms, (programs that extract, and run themselves in your computer) plus other nasties, to steal information, or take control.  In some cases, you can't even get your PC to the MS patch site to download XP security patch #2 before being hit.  It's no wonder many new PCs ship with full hard drive images on DVDs, so you can restore your system back to as-shipped condition.  Of course your data, and installed programs are gone if you do that.  You'll have to reinstall everything you put on, from the day you first turned it on.  Unless you backed up the documents, and other things you created, (data) that will be lost too.  What does a router, access point, do to help prevent this?  For one, it clones the Mac address on many systems.  A Mac address is a unique hardware identifier.  Many if not most cable \/ DSL systems are looking for the Mac address!  from the cable modem you are using.  Since you are connecting a router in-between the cable modem and the internet, the Mac address must be copied because its what's recognized by the your network service provider to identify you on their network.  In addition, your port address is now the router, not your computer.  Networks on the outside can't see your computer, and unless you install the security protocols incorrectly, all they see is the router, and what can't be seen can't be accessed.  Now to get you, they have to trick you into accessing them by sending E-mails, or otherwise enticing you into downloading their mal-ware.  This is what is commonly called a firewall.  You now set the software to allow what access you will allow.  Here is where many typical problems begin.  Windows security and most routers are not compatible on all levels.  You have to look to the Net, tech service help lines, and FAQ sites on your router, to find out how to solve most of the typical problems.  These generally range from not connecting at all, to hosting !  online games, or downloading files from sites with different security levels.  With wireless routers, you have another potential hole, \"the wireless connection\".  Someone next door may have a wireless system too, and could access your system if you forget to set these software firewalls.  Computer novices should have a computer savvy person install, and set-up their router.  You are really the ones that need this the most.  Your newness to the world of computing, and Internet surfing makes you a prime target of E-mail spoofers, identity thieves, and others who would attempt to take your private information.  Don't try to install this yourself unless you have some technical knowledge.  Ok, so what can we say about this particular network product?  Linksys[+3]  Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.  Linksys is made by Cisco, the networking giant who introduced the first routers for the Internet, and became a company that rivals Microsoft in size.  I'm tr!  reliability[+2]  ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  You typically find less horror stories detailing poor connections with this, and most Linksys models.  model[+2][p]  This model appears to be especially good.  Why the four-port wireless model you ask?  You may only have one computer.  True, you don't need more than an access point, and a wired one at that, to use as a protective firewall.  Still, if you think there may be more computers in the future, and there is a need for a multi-port network.  If that happens, you'll want to save money by sharing the Internet connection, rather than pay for two services or more, at multiple single-connect prices.  Moreover, the price of these is very low compared to most computer add-ons, so getting the added functionality is at little, and sometimes no cost.   What about the wireless capability, you ask.  Well, if your network has or will have, computers in other rooms, you may not want to wire your house for Ethernet.  This is especially true if you don't need the!  speed of a wired connection.  Don't worry though, the primary computer located by the Linksys, can be connected by wire, this makes for a solid, and fast connection to the Net.  My last topic concerns the security setup you do, or have done with your router.  Remember, you are working with two sets of security hardware boxes, your computer, and now your router.  As said before, you may get some conflicts.  The other issue is how secure do you want it.  You can prevent any, and all file transfers to your PC.  Even things like the downloaded files, and E-Mail attachments you do want to receive.  Another thing you may do are the many file transfers needed to playing network games.  Some settings allow you to play, but not host a game, others won't even let  you connect to play.  It may take several attempts, and reading a lot of FAQs or network help sites to fix some of these issues.  However many you open up, remember you are putting holes in your firewall, making your computer!  less secure.  You need to be careful not to just take down so much security that you allow the bad guys back in your system.  Let me give you a word about AOL, and other service providers.  They provide you with their network security as a part of the service, but for a price.  It is a good place for new users, who want to feel safe, and they do provide a good measure of safety, but they are not the total answer.  Often they restrict you from sites you want to visit, and you can still be reached by clever hackers who con you into opening or using their files or programs.   Let's put it this way, it's a big badge of honor in the hacking world if they can beat AOL, Microsoft, Earthlink, or another popular sites that provides Internet security.  The purchase of a router is one of the best things you can do to protect yourself these days."}
