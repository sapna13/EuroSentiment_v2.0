{"Text":"We received this diaper pail as a gift while expecting our second child.  and what a Godsend!  It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?  It also holds a lot more diapers.  look at the size of it!  Any diaper pail, if you leave it for long enough, is going to smell.  I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.  unlike the Diaper Genie!  I highly recommend this!","odor":-1,"diaper":3,"fill":2,"size":1}
