{"Text":"overall , a good buy for the price .  easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll \/ pushbutton .  my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .  there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !  at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .  i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .  no difference .  if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .  i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .  the good news is if you can 't get it to reset \/ reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .  that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .  the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .  at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .  pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery  cons :  battery life is about 1\/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive  note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .  this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .","battery life":-2,"price":2,"navigation":2,"battery":-2,"case":-2,"lock up":-2,"construction":-2,"storage":3}
