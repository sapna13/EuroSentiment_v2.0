{"Text":"i was prepared to love it .  i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .  now i have to return it and rip all my music again .  good thing i got a replacement plan .  wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .  reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .  i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .  maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .  kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .  software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .  i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .  i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .  makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .  looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .  i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .","software":-3,"wheel":-3,"player":-3,"headphone jack":-2}
