{"Text":"after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .  the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .  i 'm very glad i did .  the service from the supplier was exceptional .  the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .  having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .  recently , i attended a \" flyball \" competition  -- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .  by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .  the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .  in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .  about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .  this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .  but who cares ?  i always shoot using the lcd panel .  i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !","camera":3,"service":3,"viewfinder":-2,"automode":2,"photo":3}
