{"installation":-1,"Text":"i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !  i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .  this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .  i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .  if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .  ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .  i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .  just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !  being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .  i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .  when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !  the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .  actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .  finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .  i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .  the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .  i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .","screen":2,"software":3,"mediasource":2,"finding":2,"use":3,"playlist":2,"nomad":2,"sound quality":3,"playback quality":3}
