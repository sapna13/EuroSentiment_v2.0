{"Text":"I Love My iPod!  Although iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now.  I ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.  I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.  It DESERVES a perfect 5-stars.  The only problem is the battery life.  After about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.  After a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.  Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!  Amazing.  You pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed.  If you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.  Apple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.","battery":-2,"features":2}
