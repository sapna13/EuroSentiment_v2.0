{"Text":"i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .  i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .  it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .  in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .  the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .  the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .  the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .  the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .","battery life":3," feature":2,"manual mode":2,"macro mode":3,"auto mode":1}
