{"Text":"After much research I decided that the Zen Micro was the best mp3 player for me.  player[-2][u]  Unfortunately I was wrong.  player[-3]  Within one month, my player completely died.  buttons[-3]  (It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked.  working[-3][u]  So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.  Frustrated, I exchanged the player only to get another faulty one!  sound[-3]  I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling\/humming\/buzzing sound while music was played.  I've tried different headphones, upgrading firmware, using different files and nothing helps.  customer service[-3]  I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.  I've heard many good reviews of this product and I wonder if maybe I just had bad luck.  design[+2]  It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.  player[-3][p]  It's too bad, though, that !  I don't want to keep testing my luck.  This time I'm going to get something a little more reliable - an iPod mini."}
