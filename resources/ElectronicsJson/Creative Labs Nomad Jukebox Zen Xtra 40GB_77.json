{"Text":"i received this as a gift for christmas .  my first impression was positive .  after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .  first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .  at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .  it was just a problem with the player .  second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .  the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .  the general button placement is not very user friendly .  this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .  third , the poor design continues with the case .  the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .  it also covers over the power jack when closed .  after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .  i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .","menue":-3,"scroll":-2,"button":-2,"case":-3,"eax":-2}
