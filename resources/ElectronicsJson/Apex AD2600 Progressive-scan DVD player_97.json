{"work":3,"Text":"noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .  works great !  silverish color really adds a special touch .  who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?  it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )  if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !  apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .  if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .  however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .  either way , can 't go wrong with this price .","price":2,"color":2,"sound":1,"format":2}
