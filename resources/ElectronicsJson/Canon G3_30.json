{"manual":2,"Text":"this is my first digital camera .  i am very pleased with it so far .  i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .  this seemed like a really good compromise .  i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .  based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .  it is not perfect though .  here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :  it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .  you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .  ( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .  that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .  to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .  it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?  trips .  ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )  for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .  it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .  i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .  i am quite happy with the camera .  it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .  yes , i recommend it over the competition .","lag":-2,"camera":2,"import":2,"viewfinder":-2,"tiff format":-2}
