{"work":2,"Text":"Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.  pail.[+3] This one is really great.  I actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.  I just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.  Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!  We just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.  The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!  We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.  We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!  We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.  Would reccommend to anyone and everyone!!","change":2,"refills":3,"bags":3,"Champ":3}
