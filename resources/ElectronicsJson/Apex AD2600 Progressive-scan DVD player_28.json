{"Text":"i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .  the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3\/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .  loved the slim design .","aff":2,"format":2,"design":2}
