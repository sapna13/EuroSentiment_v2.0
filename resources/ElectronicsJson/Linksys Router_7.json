{"Text":"I had a Linksys wired 802.11B router and wireless access point which worked well, but decided to upgrade to an all-in-one 11G device.  The tough part was deciding whether or not I needed the \"Speedbooster\" version.  After asking around, I found out I didn't.  The out-of-the-box experience was a little frustrating.  CD[-2]  I tried the CD setup program without any luck.  Then I tried the do-it-yourself method of following the step-by-step instructions.  Nope.  That didn't work either.  A five minute call to the tech support people was all it took to get the router up and running.  No hold time.  1-800[+2][u]  Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem.  CD[-3]  Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.  I was told to connect my computer directly to the cable modem, then go to a Linksys webs!  ite:  www.linksys.com\/connect  I clicked on NetSet Assistant and let it do it's thing.  I followed the prompts to disconnect and reconnect Ethernet cables, and then rebooted.  Problem solved.  As far as WEP configuration... make your adjustments after you've set up the router using the default setup.  product[+2][p]  It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.  router[+2]  This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router."}
