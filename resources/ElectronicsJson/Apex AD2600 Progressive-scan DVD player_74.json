{"Text":"bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12\/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .  that was a mistake .  we tried the \" finding nemo \" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .  cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .  i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the \" finding nemo \" dvd works fine .  i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .  i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .  only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .","player":-2,"dvd":-2}
