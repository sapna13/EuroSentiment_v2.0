{"Look":3,"Text":"player[+3][p]  I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it.  I use it on an average 5 hours a day I hook it up to my Belkin FM transmitter in the car or to my Logitech 2.  Speakers[+2]  1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  Feel[+3] ##The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience.  The light pulsates when you are charging it almost as if it were breathing.  back[+3]  The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ).  feels[+2][p]  It feels tiny in the hand without it.  stand[+2]  The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk.  The belt clip however is not very useful if you move around a lot.  read[+2][u] ##The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read.  touch controls[-1]  The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel.  touch buttons[+3]  The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.  Build[+3]  Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing.  hardcase[+1]  The hardcase they give with it must work well.  solid[+2][p]  It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  sound[+3]  Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too.  sound[+3]  I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  sound[+3]  Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  features[+3]  Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list.  Its not convinient to enter name of course but synchronise it with outlook and it becomes a gem of a address book.  recorded[+3]  The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal.  The interface takes 2 secs after you press record to show up but its actually started recording at the moment you press record.  software[-1]  Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well.  playlists[+3]  Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  battery life[-2]  There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.  USB[-2]  Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.","looks":3}
