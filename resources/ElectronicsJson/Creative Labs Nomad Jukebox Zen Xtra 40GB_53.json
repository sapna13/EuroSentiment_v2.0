{"Text":"i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .  while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .  software :  a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .  first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .  the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .  the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .  second , the \" automatic \" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .  since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .  if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !  the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .  third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .  only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .  lastly , ipod \/ itunes will not play wma formatted songs .  if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .  itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .  for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .  player controls :  here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .  the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .  if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .  the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .  zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .  it also lets you remove songs from the play order .  if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .  you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .  lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .  while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.  none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .  again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .  i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .  win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .  with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .  if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .  its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.","software":1,"player":2,"creative":2,"remove":1,"sync":1,"scroll":1,"shuttle":3,"delete":1,"cd burner":-2}
