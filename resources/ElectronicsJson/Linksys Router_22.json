{"Text":"I have been using my router for some months now... I still cant wirelessly access the internet through my laptop but that's a laptop problem.  router[+2]  As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market.  If you want \"the newest gadget\" get the one with speedbooster.  features[-2]  I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.  router[+1][p]  All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one.  Expect about 10MBps and not more though!"}
