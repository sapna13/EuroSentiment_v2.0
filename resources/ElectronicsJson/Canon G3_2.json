{"Text":"i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .  a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .  following my research , i decided on the g3 .  in a word , \" awesome \" is how i would describe this camera .  i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .  with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .  and with the panoramic \" stitch \" mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .  i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .  do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .","speed":2,"camera":3,"auto setting":2}
