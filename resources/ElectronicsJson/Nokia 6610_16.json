{"color screen":2,"Text":"like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .  i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .  pros :  small size .  i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .  just make sure the keys are locked .  color screen is good .  it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .  the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .  navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .  battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .  cons :  not many .  the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .  pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?  please !  is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?","battery life":3,"pc cable":-2,"menu":3,"key":1,"size":1,"calendar":1,"volume key":-2}
