{"guide":-1,"Text":"I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.  I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.  It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.  Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.  I prefer things that are simple.  I prefer to use my mind  to figure out how I'm going to build something not how my tools work.  I now  have it as a permenant fixture  in my router table.  The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.  I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.  It will take 31\/2 inchers now.  I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.  I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.  I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.  Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.  I need it back as a hand held so I'm going to buy another one.","fence":1,"controls":1,"system":2,"router":2,"use":2,"power":2,"springs":-1,"wrench":-1,"adjustments":-1}
