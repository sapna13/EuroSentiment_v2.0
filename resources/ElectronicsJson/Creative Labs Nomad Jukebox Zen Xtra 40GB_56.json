{"Text":"i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .  here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :  flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost  mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .  the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .  that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .  tiny !  mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .  i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .  ( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )  hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .  cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .  that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .  just be aware of it .  this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .  a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .  it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller \/ lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .  that 's the first thing to understand .  so consider what you 're going to use the device for .  if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .  if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .  review of zen xtra - 40 gb  the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .  this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .  it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .  the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .  as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .  it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .  the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .  extremely convenient .  then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .  you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .  ( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )  the pros and cons of it :  great price .  the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .  i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .  the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .  it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .  it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .  for me , that was the only drawback .  i 'm really happy with this purchase .  also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .  if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .  after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .  so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .  if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .  i would have liked to have given it 4 1\/2 stars docking that 1\/2 star only for the size .","cover":-1,"software":2,"price":2,"scroll":-1,"case":2,"size":-1}
