{"Text":"T- Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.  It offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.  I almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.  The sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.  I like the size and shape.  It fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.  The only problem is the size of the keys.  My fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.  They really are awfully small.  Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.  It also works just fine for international calls.  It's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.  It's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.  T- I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.  Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.  I never get dropped calls.  T-   It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.  T-  I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.","battery life":-1,"customer service agents":3,"keys":-1,"sound":3,"Mobile":3,"features":2,"quality":3,"signal":3,"instant messaging":2,"calls":3,"size":3}
