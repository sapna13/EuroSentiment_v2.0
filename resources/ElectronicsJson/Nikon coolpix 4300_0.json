{"picture":3,"manual":2,"Text":"this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .  the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .  it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .  it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .  operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .  the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .  the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .  comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .  i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .  i enthusiastically recommend this camera .","auto focus":2,"camera":2,"rechargable battery":2}
