{"Text":"with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .  i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .  the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .  the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful \" scene \" mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach \/ snow , sunset etc. , are endless .  the movie mode is also working great .  the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .  a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on \" normal \" resolution .  i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .  even at the \" normal \" setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a \" digital \" .  the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .  i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of \" juice \" .  i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :  a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .  furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an \" outlet environment \" .  over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !","software":3,"battery life":1,"camera":3,"movie mode":2,"auto mode":2,"print":3}
