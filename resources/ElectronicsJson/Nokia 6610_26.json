{"Text":"nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .  i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .  it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .  you do take your chances with this phone .","sound":-2}
