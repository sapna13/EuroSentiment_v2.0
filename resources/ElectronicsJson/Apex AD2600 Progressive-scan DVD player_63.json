{"Text":"i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .  the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .  now i may buy two !  ( my orignal review is below : )  great feature list , poor reliability .  output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .  thankfully amazon has free return shipping !","feature":2,"output":-2}
