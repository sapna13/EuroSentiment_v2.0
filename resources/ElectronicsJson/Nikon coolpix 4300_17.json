{"Text":"i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .  this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .  it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .  i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .  my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !  one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .  i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .  battery life is ok .  i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .","macro":2,"autofocus":-2,"battery life":1,"picture quality":2,"camera":3}
