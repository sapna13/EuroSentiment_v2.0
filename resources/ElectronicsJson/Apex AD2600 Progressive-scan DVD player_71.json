{"Text":"what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .  in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .  and have returned both .  ad-  ad- the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .  my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .  i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .  it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .  amazon is awaesome !  they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .  what more could you ask for .","1600":-3,"amazon":3}
