{"Text":"wow !  simple to use and hook up .  comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .  the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .  i also own an \" apex ad 1201 \" dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1\/2 years ago .  one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .  and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .  friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .  i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .  consider it for a future gift too !","progressive scan":2}
