{"product":2,"Text":"So far so good.  I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.  I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.  I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.","pail":1}
