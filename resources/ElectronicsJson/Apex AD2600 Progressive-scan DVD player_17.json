{"work":2,"picture":-2,"Text":"i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .  we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .  even viewed cds full of jpgs .  we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .  but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .  we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .  though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .  they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .  i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .  do not buy this player .  who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .","jpeg":2,"apex":-3}
