{"Text":"I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.  The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.  I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.","diaper champ":3,"pail":-2}
