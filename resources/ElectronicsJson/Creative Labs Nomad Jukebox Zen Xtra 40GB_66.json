{"Text":"i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .  in a quick summation , here is what i found .  + the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .  i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !  it may have taken several years to fill this up .  + i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit  + screen was good , easy to read  + \/ - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .  - the software that came with it was tough to load .  i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .  - the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .  not good if you 're taking this traveling .  the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )  - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well  - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .  i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .  - this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .","screen":2,"software":-2,"cover":-2,"battery top":-2,"musicmatch software":2,"sound quality":2,"flywheel":-2,"top":-2}
