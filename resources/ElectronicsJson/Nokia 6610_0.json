{"t customer service":-2,"Text":"i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .  there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .  just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city \/ exchange you wanted .  at& after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !  i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .  i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .  my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .  the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .  the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .  the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .","phone":3,"infrared":2,"signal quality":3,"speaker phone":2}
