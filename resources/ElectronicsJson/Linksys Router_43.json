{"Text":"working[+2][u]  Absolutely no problems with this router.  instructions[+2]  I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions.  customer support[+2]  A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.  I have successfully used the additional Ethernet ports to add peripherals to my wireless networks.  Speed[+2]  Speed is not a problem.  I bought this to replace my Linksys BEFW11S4 - 802.11b wireless router (I gave the old router to a friend - it worked great) because I thought it would be a nice upgrade in speed and performance - WRONG!  I can't notice any difference - except it used to drop my connection several times an hour!  works[+2][u]  After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine.  If you currently own a wireless router (802.11b) don't rush to replace it!  Linksys[+2]  As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems."}
