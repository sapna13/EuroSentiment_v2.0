{"Text":"i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .  one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !  but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...  almost there .  i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .  i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .  this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .  that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .  it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .  what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .  so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .  but for now this will do .  oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .  great phone .. .  great features .. .","screen":-2,"battery life":2,"phone":3,"feature":3}
