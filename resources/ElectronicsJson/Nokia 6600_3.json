{"Text":"I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.  Before buying, I'd urge you to actually use one and not just handle it in the store.  On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.  As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.  And remember, this is a PHONE first and foremost which is where I have my biggest complaints...  When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.  You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.  I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.  It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.  I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.  Sorry, try something else or at least trying using one.  You'll see what I mean ... if you have a magnifying glass.","screen":-3,"phone":-3,"keys":-3,"dial":-3}
