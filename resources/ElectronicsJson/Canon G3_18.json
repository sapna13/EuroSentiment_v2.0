{"Text":"i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .  this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .  my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .  battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .  whoa .  manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .  i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .  not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .  if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .  or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .","battery life":1,"camera":3,"manual function":2,"viewfinder":-1}
