{"Text":"bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's .  can 't say whether i rec 'd an \" updated \" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .  dvd- it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .  i do n't have a dvd + r to try  so .  mixed bag i guess but the price was right .","price":2,"play":2,"read":-2}
