{"exposure":2,"Text":"Good quality and fun!  I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.  I'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.  In practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.  The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).","Elph s100":2}
