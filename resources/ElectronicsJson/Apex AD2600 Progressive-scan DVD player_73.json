{"Text":"i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .  i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly .  i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .  the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .  i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .  i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .  even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .","feature":1,"size":2}
