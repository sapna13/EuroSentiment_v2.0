{"product":1,"install":-1,"installation":-2,"Text":"I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.  If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!  It seems like Symantec did a lousy job on this version.  Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.  To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.  If you got stuck do what I did,search for any folder called symantec and delete it! then install that program(assuming you know what you are doing).  If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.  What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!  I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.  Next year when I purchase a 2005 FireWall version, I am buying the Zone Alarm or the sygate one.  I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!","support":-3,"version 2004":-2,"zone alarm":2,"installing":-2,"symantec":-3}
