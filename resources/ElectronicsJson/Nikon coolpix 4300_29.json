{"lense cap":1,"Text":"seriously ! i love it !  my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .  better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .  but this camera is great !  the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .  i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .  if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .  but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .  it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .  the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .  ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .","picture quality":3,"camera":2,"battery":2}
