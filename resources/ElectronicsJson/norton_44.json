{"Text":"I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.  Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.  Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.  Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.  Avoid at all costs  I just about lost it this morning with this software.  While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with \"alerts\" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.  But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.  I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.  I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required \"permissions\" and lacked proper administrator status.  On my own home computer.  Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.  Meanwhile, the damn alert is still popping up every 20 seconds.  Finally I ran msconfig and went into the \"services\" tab and unchecked every last Norton\/Symantec \"service,\" then ran uninstall again.  This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.  I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.","firewall":-3,"uninstall":-2,"alerts":-2,"Symantec":-3,"home network":-2,"Symantec customer service":-3,"network":-3,"uninstallation":-1}
