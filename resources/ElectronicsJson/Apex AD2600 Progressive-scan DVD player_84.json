{"Text":"i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .  after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .  it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .  both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .  one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .  these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .  the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .  there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .  all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .","player":-2,"speed":-3,"dvd":-2,"door":-2,"size":1}
