{"Text":"i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .  recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .  disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .  two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .  while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .  i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .","nokia":3,"phone performance":3}
