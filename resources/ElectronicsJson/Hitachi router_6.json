{"guide":3,"Text":"This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.  Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.  The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.  It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.  The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.  I used this router to plow out 3\" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.  This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.  The router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.  The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.  The only complaint I have is that the 1\/4\" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1\/4\" bits.  I purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.  The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.  However, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.  This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.  Wish I could give it 4 1\/2 stars.","adjustment":1,"start":2,"speed":1,"nimble":1,"collet":-1,"stability":1}
