This is a great device, but there are its pros and cons.  Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable.  Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2\"  Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.  12 hours is about average, and it has an AC adapter in the box, with quick charge (2 hours) at probably 80%... and 4 hours for a full charge.  FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.  Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus.  Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy  Games-- not really important, but existant  Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket.  Cons: No AM\/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing  3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.  No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable\/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient  . iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod.  No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.  Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.  A lot of people go for the iPod because of its reputation, but if you honestly shop around and check out the reviews on Cnet and things like that, you can find a better 20GB HD MP3 player.  This is definately worth the money to have, but certain aspects of it doesn't make it the best.","Voice Recorder":-2,"Radio Tuner":-2,"sound":2,"Battery":1,"Games":1,"Hard Drive":2}
