{"Text":"i just bought this player today and i already love it .  it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .  another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .  otherwise , this player is awesome !  it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .  the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .  overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .","screen":2,"player":3,"scroll":-2,"play":-1,"volume range":2}
