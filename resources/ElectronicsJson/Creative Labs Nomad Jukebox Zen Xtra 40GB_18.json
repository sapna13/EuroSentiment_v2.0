{"Text":"bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .  i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .  i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .  i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .  both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .  besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .  ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .  people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .  it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .  the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .  you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .  i just put it on \" shuffle \" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !  the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality \/ longevity of the buttons on the thing .  my \" fast forward \" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .  not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .  all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .  i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .  but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .  we 'll see if i need them to .  sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .  this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .  it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .  i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .  yes .  get better headphones .  rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .  bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .  i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )  basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .  i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .","transfer":2,"support":2,"weight":1,"price":3,"button":1,"case":2,"sound quality":2,"option":2,"size":-1}
