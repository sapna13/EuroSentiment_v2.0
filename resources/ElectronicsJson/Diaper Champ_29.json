{"diaper wipes":-2,"Text":"When my wife and I got the Diaper Champ, we thought that it would work perfectly.  We read the reviews on and saw that people liked it much better then the Diaper Genie, but I'm not 100% sure.  We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.  We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.  We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.  This eventually ruined the foam pad that is applied to the flip top to keep odors in.  I had to go and pull the crumpled foam out just so we could turn the lid.  But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.","top loader":-2,"Diaper Champ":-2}
