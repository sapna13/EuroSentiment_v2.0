{"darn diopter adjustment dial":-1,"Text":"i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .  the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .  i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .  i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .  the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )  i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .","camera":2,"photo quality":3}
