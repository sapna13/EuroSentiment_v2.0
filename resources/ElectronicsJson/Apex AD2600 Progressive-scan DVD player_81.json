{"picture":-3,"Text":"i bought this for my dad for christmas .  when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !  let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .  as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .  had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .  save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation ."}
