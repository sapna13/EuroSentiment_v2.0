{"Text":"If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one.  If you want colour screens, photos, videos etc, buy the latest (extremely expensive) model, I think the new 60GB has all the extras.  This 20GB just plays the songs, most people won't even use the 20GB space, I've got about 1500 songs on mine that adds up to nearly 13GB.  I would strongly recommend the iPod over rival mp3 players such as the Creative Zen and the creatively named iRiver.  Most importantly because the iPods warranty is far superior to both these, the Creative Zens is only 90 days, way too short.  The iRivers is also short, and lets face it, what is more likely to brake or go wrong, the Apple iPod or Creative Zen, iRiver.  Both from unspecialist makes, and in Creatives case a company that deals mostly in computer parts, and has not invested the money that Apple has.  So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.  As far as an actual player is concerned, the iPod is next to none.  The one advantage the iRiver has is it can play wma files aswell as mp3s, unlike the iPod.  But all you need to do is convert the files (besides mp3s are larger and better quality files than wmas) using a wide range of convertors, my favourite is the dBPowerAmp Music Coverter which also allows you to burn directly from cd to hardrive in mp3 format unlike Media Player.  It's well worth it, the mp3s do in fact sound better.  For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod.  The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player.  Quite simply, BUY THE IPOD, whatever size you wish.  I would go along the lines of any more than 2 thousands songs, get a larger size such as the 40GB, just to be on the safe side.","looks":2,"reliability":2,"package":2,"iPod":2}
