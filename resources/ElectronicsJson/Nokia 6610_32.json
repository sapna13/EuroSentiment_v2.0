{"Text":"i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .  nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .  it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .  now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !  people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .  service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .  now i can always be in contact .  this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .  a great deal in general !  i would not give up this phone for the world .  1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .  yes , the features are numerous .  the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .  people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .  the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .  the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .  i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .  nokia has definitely won me over with this one .","phone":2,"speakerphone":2,"service":1,"feature":2,"sound quality":2,"earpiece":3}
