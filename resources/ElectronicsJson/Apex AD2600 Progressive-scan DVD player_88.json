{"look":2,"Text":"this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .  the plus points are -  1 .  price  2 .  ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all  3 .  good looks  the downside -  1 .  the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel  2 .  remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .  if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .","remote button":-2,"quality":-3,"format":2,"dvd player":3}
