{"Text":"This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.  I am a total iPod addict.  The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.  I have less than 3 GB worth of music, and I don't have any more music in my collection.  I love my new iPod!","sound":3,"purchase":2}
