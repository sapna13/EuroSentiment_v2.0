{"customer support":-2,"Text":"the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .  i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .  on my main computer the software did not work right .  i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .  i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .  i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .  it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .  so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .","software":-2,"player":2}
