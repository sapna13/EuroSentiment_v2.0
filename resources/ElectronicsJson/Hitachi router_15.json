{"Text":"I love the performance and features of this router.  For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.  It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.  I bought this specifically for a router table I built, and it has performed flawlessly in that capacity.  I've done some hand-held routing with it and it works good for that as well.  Smooth plunging mechanism.  The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.  The only thing I hate (and this pretty much goes for any router I've used) is changing the bits.  It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.  Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.","fence":1,"adjustment":2,"performance":2,"router":2,"money":3,"plunging":1,"grip":-1}
