{"Text":"I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.  It is quiet and has plenty of power.  I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.  That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.  Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.  After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.  I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.  If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.  If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.","shafts":-1,"weight":1,"router":1,"power":2,"plunging":-2,"plunge":-1}
