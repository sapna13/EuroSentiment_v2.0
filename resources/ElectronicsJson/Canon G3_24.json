{"Text":"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .  prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .  no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .  this is not the same thing as a film camera .  and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .  they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .  most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .  but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :  it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .  i am not talking milliseconds .  picture this :  your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .  when it arrives , you press the shutter release .  splash !  the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .  perhaps there is a way around this delay .  some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .  yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .  yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .  but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .  i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .  it focuses in a snap .  dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .  canon 's g3 does it consistently .  it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .  i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .  and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?  what task do they perform ?  cameras capture moments .  they stop time .  because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .  the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .  a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .  not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .  like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .  so buy the g3 .  buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .  but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .  from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .  unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .","focus":-2,"unresponsiveness":-2,"g3":-2}
