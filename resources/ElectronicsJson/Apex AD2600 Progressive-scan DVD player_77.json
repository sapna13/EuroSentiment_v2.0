{"Text":"hi , many people are saying , \" you get what you pay for , i guess . \"  well that is not true .  you could have paid more and got a lot less .  i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !  you have to ask yourself , \" how much money is dissapointment worth ? \"  because , you will be dissapointed .  then you can say , \" my dissapointment only cost $ 39 . \"  i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !  so , without further adoo .  1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , \" dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! \"  2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .  3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .  4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !  5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .  i dare you to surf the net and find the code .  you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .  finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .  and then you will start to belive them .  if this is your fist dvd player .  save yourself some aggrivation .","freeze":-2,"universal remote control":-2,"remote":-2,"code":-2}
