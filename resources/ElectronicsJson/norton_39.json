{"installation":1,"Text":"I bought this product after reading the Editor's Choice article at PC Magazine and had a great experience with Amazon (as usual).  The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --  I was upgrading from a version of Norton Anti-virus that was about a year old in order to get spam and pop-up control.  My previous experience with multiple Symantec\/Norton products has been good.  set-   The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.  HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.  It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.  I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.  There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec\/Norton site.  I am going to uninstall this and stick with my old version until they offer a fix or until I can find a program from another vendor.  I purchased this even though I saw some disparaging reviews at the Amazon site, trusting PC Magazine to get it right.  However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.","program":2,"PRODUCT":-3,"symantec":-3,"symantec\/Norton site":-2}
