{"Text":"The nokia 6600 is a great phone, good games, good camera.  The video recorders a bit odd, sometimes I get 9 secs on my recordings, sometimes I get 17.  The voice recorders good, but you can't record songs off the radio for ring tones.  The games are decent, but u only get 2 to start off with.  But you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars.  Overall the phones fantastic, and I would have given it 5 stars, but its not perfect.  [s] If your looking for a phone thats mainly for calls and killing time this is the one you want.  The battery on mine lasts 2 days if I don't play games that much, and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat.  This phone has the best battery, it lasts longer then my old 3210","games":3,"phone":3,"voice recorders":2,"video recorders":-1,"battery":3,"phones":3}
