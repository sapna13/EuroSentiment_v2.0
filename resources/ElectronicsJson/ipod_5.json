{"Text":"Versatile and stylish.  I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.  The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').  The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  And it's easily connected to a Linux or FreeBSD machine for loading and unloading files, so I can also retire my ZIP drive.  The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.","Versatile":2,"controls":2,"battery":-1,"iPod":2,"design":2}
