Thinking the CD was faulty, I went to the Linksys website, hoping to simply download the setup program, but it's not available.  connection[-3]  I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.
