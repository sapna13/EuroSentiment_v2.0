{"Text":"this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .  first let me give you the bad things :  1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .  2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .  3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .  first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .  the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .  compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .  to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .","software":2,"player":3,"scroll":-2,"sound quality":3,"size":-1}
