{"Text":"i have no complaints with this mp3 player .  getting files onto it is quick and painless .  then sorting the files is easy as pie .  and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .  my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .  also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .  come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .  sheesh ! !  the battery is nice .  i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .  the lcd screen was very large and readable .  thank you !  my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .  a great buy .  compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .","screen":3,"player":3,"sound":3,"battery":2,"sorting":2}
