{"product":3,"Text":"I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.  I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.  I am no computer expert, and this is my first (and probably last) digital camera.  This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.","camera":3}
