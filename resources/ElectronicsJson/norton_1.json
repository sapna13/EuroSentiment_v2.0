{"product":-3,"Text":"I have used Norton products in the past and I am familiar with them.  I bought NIS 2004 recently to try it out.  After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.  I am thankful that I have Roxio GOBACK, I had to use it 3 of the 4 times.  During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.  The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK).  The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.  Norton[-3]  I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.  NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.  Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.  Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.  Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.","NIS 2003":2,"installed":-2,"Manual shutdown":-2,"Norton":-3,"Installation":-2,"NIS":-2}
