{"Text":"this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .  while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .  bang-for-the- it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .  like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .  the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .  further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .  this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .  when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .  yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .  yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .  for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .","screen":3,"affordability":3,"size":2}
