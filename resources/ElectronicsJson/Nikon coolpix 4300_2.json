{"Text":"i love photography .  i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .  i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .  i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .  you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.  this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .","camera":2}
