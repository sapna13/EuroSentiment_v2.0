( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .  and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.  3 .  the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .  4 .  with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .  5 .  if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .  you can also search for your song , which is good .  6 .  i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .  you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .  and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .  7 .  battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .  8 .  when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .  9 .  you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .  you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of \" now playing \" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .  there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .  there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .  10 .  the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .  11 .  the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .  cons :  1 .  the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .  the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .  5 hours max. i did it like this  eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours  2 .  the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .  3 .  you need the software to actually transfer files  4 .  the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .  also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .  ( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )  well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .","alarm":1,"software":3,"battery life":-3,"sound":2,"battery":2,"eax":2,"storage":3}
