{"Text":"i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .  what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .  based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .  but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .  now we come to the zen xtra .. .  first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .  the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .  what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .  not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .  first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .  bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .  rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .  this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .  the dynamic playlists ( \" now playing \" , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .  well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .  i 'll just say this .. .  for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...  but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .","software":-2,"bookmark":-2,"player hardware":2,"sound":3,"bookmakr":-2,"playlist":-3}
