{"Text":"i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .  it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .  it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .  i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .  i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .  i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .  8mb for a camera like this is a joke .  a card with more memory is a must .  a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .","weight":2,"8mb card":-2,"8mb":-2,"use":1,"continuous shot mode":3,"photo quality":3}
