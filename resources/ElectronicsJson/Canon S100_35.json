{"Text":"1- Small.  VERY smal.  You'll carry it with you every day.  I've been taking near 100 pictures per month since I got mine.  I've had a lot of cameras, but this one is ACTUALLY being used, and not stored in a desk: it's allways in my shist pocket.  2- Excellent picture quality and so simple to use!!!  Fool proof.  I started shooting even before reading the manual (not recommended at all).  3- USB kicks!  2 secs to download a 600KB 1600x1200 picture!  4- Looks great.  Silver metal case -NOT PLASTIC.  5- Excelent software package.  6- Small but very clear TFT screen.  Take shots at angles you thought you wouldn't.  Don't care about sunlight: it's TFT.  7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal.  8- Buttons are little, but If you have steady fingers and dealed with a casio wirst calculator watch, you can deal with almost anything.  Buttons size is OK for me, my wife, but not my grany.  9- Cons? Not a single one after 5 months.","software":3,"TFT screen":1,"smal":2,"picture quality":3,"panorama mode":2,"buttons":-1,"case":1,"TFT":1,"Small":1}
