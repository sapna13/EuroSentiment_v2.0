{"Text":"this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !  i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .  this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .  the downside though , may be a big one for you .  its quiet .  really quiet .  grandma in church quiet .  i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .  so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )","phone":2,"size":2}
