{"Text":"i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .  so far we have only hooked up one of them .  the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and soom not so good , but my feeling at this time is \" two thumbs up \" !  ( i guess only time will tell ? )  p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?","unit":3,"remote":-1}
