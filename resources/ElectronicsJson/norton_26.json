{"Text":"I had Norton Internet Security 2003 and it worked great...one of the features that I liked was the user interface as well as the ad\/pop-up blocking feature along w\/the logs on internet usage.  I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.  In January of 2004, I renewed my subscription service for NIS 2003 but on Jan 7, everything changed.  There was a Verisign problem that conflicted w\/Word and Excel and was posted on the Symantec site that affected computers.  The Symantec site said it didn't affect NIS but I believe it did.  I also believe that when I renewed my subscription service that Symantec uploaded the NIS 2004 patch.  All of a sudden everything that reviewers were writing about NIS 2004 was happening to my computer.  Booting up my computer took forever!!!  Then, my ad\/pop-up blocking was completely gone.  My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.  After extensive researching on the Symantec site I broke down and called Symantec.  Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.  I had to pay $29.95 just to go any further.  After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...  They sent me a link to their website to follow instructions on ridding my registry of all Symantec products so I could get a clean re-install.  They didn't know what the problem could be.  They said to call back if it still didn't work after the complete uninstall.  I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.  I gave up.  Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.","blocking":-3,"NIS 04":-3,"Tech":-3,"tech":-2,"booting":-3,"Tech Line":-2}
