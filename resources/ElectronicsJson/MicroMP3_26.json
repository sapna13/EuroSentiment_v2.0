{" sound quality":2,"Text":"UPDATE March 3rd, 2005: I bought my Dark Blue Zen Micro back in November, when they first came out.  features[+][cc],  music source support[+2] ##Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use.  I loaded my whole CD collection on it and took it everywhere, even at work.  player[+3][p]  So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all.  Then last week, my player just quit working, period.  warranty[-1]   After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty).  They said the repair could take weeks, and being impatient, I decided to just order another one, 1 day delivered from Amazon, and then I could have two, one for at work and one for at home.  working[-2]  Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!  rvice, they said I should send it in for repairs.  I loved the Zen Micro, and thus it pains me to say this, but I have a hard time recommending something, when I've had two of them break on me in such a short time of owning them.  reliability[-2] ##They obviously have quality and reliability problems.  player[-][s]  They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  player[+2][p]  ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great!  player[+2][p]  This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  rip[+2] ##I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  I didn't experience any problems with the software or getting my computer to recognize the player.  My PC is running Windows 98 though....maybe having old outdated things is a good thing for once!  Y!  interface[-1]  es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  organization[+2][u]  I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  WAV format[-3]  Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  It's supposed to support that format, but I keep getting a file transfer failure no matter what I try.  case[-2]  My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  belt clip[-1]  Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  bag[-3]  The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  bag[-2]  It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  I threw it away.  Those are minor complaints though.  player[+][s]  I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  Soon I will have every CD song I care about from my collection to carry around with me.  Amazing.","sound":3,"quality":-2}
