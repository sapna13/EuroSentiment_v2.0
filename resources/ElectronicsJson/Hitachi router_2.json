{"Text":"I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.  But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.  At first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.  The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)  bigger[-1][u][cc],heavier[-1][u][cc], However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).  Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.  The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.  Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.","price":2,"power":1,"use":-1,"plunge":1}
