{"folder":-2,"Text":"i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .  the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .  the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .  fact is , it could n't be easier to use .  these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .  assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .  sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .  even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .  the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .  the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .  connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !  get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .  awesome feature .  usb 2. usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .  minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .  that is , if a folder on your computer called \" mp3 \" has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .  the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .  not a big hassle as many would have you think .  2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called \" unknown . \"  i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .  when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .  take the time to fill in those tags !  3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .  in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .  so what are you waiting for ?  get one now !","software":3,"0":3,"player":2,"menu":2,"battery":2,"nomad explorer":-1,"id3 tag":-2,"sound quality":3}
