{"Text":"This is a great diaper pail.  There is no odor and it is very easy to use.  (You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).  And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.","diaper pail":3,"use":3,"refills":3}
