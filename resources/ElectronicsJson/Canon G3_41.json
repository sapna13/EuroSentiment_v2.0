( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )  no- the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .  and the body \/ construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .  i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .  i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .  i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :  i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .  at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .  if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !  and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .  the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .  but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .  added 2-24 .  i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .  i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .  it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .  if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .  i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .  especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .  i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .  very easy to use .  i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .  very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .","hot shoe flash":1,"battery":2,"off button":-2}
