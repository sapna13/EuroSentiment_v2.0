{"Text":"my number one criteria for a new phone was iSync compaibility via bluetooth.  all the other features are gravy.  i checked the iSync compatibility page and it was listed--they even had a photo of the 6600 shown in the graphic.  so, right out of the box i had issue.  namely, it wouldnt sync.  after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem.  there are lengthy hacks offered requiring root access and edits via terminal.  i may have been up for this 10 years ago, but i just want a phone that works at this point.  i guess its my own fault for not researching more before buying the thing.  but, i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment.  if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with iSync, i say stick with a sonyericsson.  i'd rather have a little more phone than the t610 offers.  but, that's the only SE t-mobile offers right now.  this nokia is going back to china or wherever it came from.  if there was a zero-star rating i would give it.","nokia":-3,"sync":-3,"sonyericsson":1}
