{"Text":"sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .  but with a low price , comes lower quality .  our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .  the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .  it lasted about 1 1\/2 weeks .  i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .  i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .  so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said , \" if the product seems broken , we cannot help , \" or something to that effect .  wow .  do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .  if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .  if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .  i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .","quality":-2,"headphone jack":-2,"sound quality":2}
