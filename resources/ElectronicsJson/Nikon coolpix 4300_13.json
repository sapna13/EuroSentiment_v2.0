{"picture":2,"Text":"really happy with this little camera .  it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .  got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .  settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .  i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .  did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .  i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .  still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !","zoomed image":2,"camera":2}
