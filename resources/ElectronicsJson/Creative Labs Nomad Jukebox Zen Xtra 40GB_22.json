{"Text":"just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .  nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .  all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .  the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .  i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .  dislikes  - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .  the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .  the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical  - included creative software is pretty poor .  red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .  note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it  likes  - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price  - best in class sound  - large easy readable screen","control":-2,"screen":2,"software":-2,"fly wheel":-3,"price":2,"player":-1,"button":-2,"sound":3,"sound quality":2,"eax":1,"size":1}
