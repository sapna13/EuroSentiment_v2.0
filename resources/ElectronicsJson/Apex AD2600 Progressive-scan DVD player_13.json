{"Text":"if i could give this a negative rating , i would .  i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .  wo n't play a lot of discs .  i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !  some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .  it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .  tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .  amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !  there should have been a recall on this product .  fair warning - do not buy .  i repeat - do n't wast your money .","play":-2,"tech support":-3}
