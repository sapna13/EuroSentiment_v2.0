{"Text":"i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .  the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .  the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .  the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .  so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .  i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .  is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?  i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .  thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !","player":3,"style":1,"sound":2}
