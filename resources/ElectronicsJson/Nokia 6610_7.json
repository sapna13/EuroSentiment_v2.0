{"message":-2,"Text":"i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .  when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :  it defaulted to unchangeable email .  so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .  i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .  he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .  so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .  while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .  negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .  poor visibility on the keys .  you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them ."," button":-2,"sound quality":2,"key":-2}
