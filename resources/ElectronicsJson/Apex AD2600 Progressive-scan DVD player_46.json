{"Text":"i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .  when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .  easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .  very happy !","use":2}
