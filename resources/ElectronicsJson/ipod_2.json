{"photos":2,"Text":"Very Pleased.  I'd never had an MP3 player before, so this was a new one on me.  The interface took a little getting used to.  The best thing for anyone to do who has not used one is to ask the store clerk at apple or a teenager for advice on how to operate it.  This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual.  I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous.  The sound is just fine.  I'm not a big audiophile, but I have no objections to how it sounds.  I use it to listen to language tapes and to play \"Earl\" by the Dixie Chicks incessantly.  It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  I also have been using it as a USB device, which just tickles me no end.  Now, I can back up what little I  keep on my computer quickly and without a fuss.  One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.  I think its the 21st century version of the wallet with little photos.","sound":1,"display":2,"interface":-1,"adapter":1,"photo quality":-1}
