{"product":3,"Text":"The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.  No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.  I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).  I have XP with 256MB RAM, 40GB memory.  This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).  5 stars all the way!","antivirus":3}
