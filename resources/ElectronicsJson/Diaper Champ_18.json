{"Text":"Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!  It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!  It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).  It's also easy to empty out.  Just unlock the top, and remove the plastic bag.  And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!  Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!","empty":3,"use":3,"diaper pail":3,"holds":3,"garbage bags":3,"Diaper Champ":3}
