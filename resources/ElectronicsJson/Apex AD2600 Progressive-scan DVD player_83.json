{"Text":"granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .  first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .  when i hit \" menu \" it told me , \" playback only . \"  i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .  this is extemely lame .  the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .  in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .  the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .  it also has an optical out , which it should .  i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .","dvd":2,"menu":-2,"remote":-1,"dvd player":-3}
