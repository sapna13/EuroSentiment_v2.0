{"Text":"this thing does its job .  i 've compared and compared and compared .  it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .  i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.  the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .  replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .  cons :  the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .  i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .  it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .  headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .  the software sucks .  it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .  also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .  you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .","cover":-3,"software":-3,"shuffle":2,"battery":2,"feature":-2,"headphone":-3}
