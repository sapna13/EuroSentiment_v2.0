{"Text":"It was a PAIN.  Everytime I tried to unload it the sausage links(as I call them) would unravel and I think the odor control was only so so.  it wasn't much different than putting the diaper in a shopping back and putting it in the regular trash.  THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.  For even better odor control we would put a plug ins in the outlet closest to it.  I had no problem with stuck diapers and if I did it wasn't often but I can see how it would happen.","ITEM":3}
