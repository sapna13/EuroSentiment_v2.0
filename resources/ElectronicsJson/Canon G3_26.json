{"picture":2,"Text":"the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .  i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .  with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .  i love the eos based controls and easy menus .  i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .  many before me have done that already .  i agree with the positive reviews .  but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .  1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .  though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display \" lens \" when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .  i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .  very cheaply made .  2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .  the g2 was better in this respect .  it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .  despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .","control":2,"body":-2,"casing":-2,"4mp camera":2,"lens cap":-2}
