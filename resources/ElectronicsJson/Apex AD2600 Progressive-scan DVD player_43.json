{"Text":"good :  progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .  seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .  also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .  output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .  bad :  i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .  it would just spin up and stop , and display \" no disc \" .  my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .  for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter \/ play button .  you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .  s- also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 \" tv ).","button":-3,"dvd":2,"progressive scan player":2,"read":2,"no disc":-2,"remote":-3,"output":3,"video":-2,"disc":-1}
