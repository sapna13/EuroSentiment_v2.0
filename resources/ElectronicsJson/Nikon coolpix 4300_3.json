{"Text":"i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .  reason for two ?  it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .  the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .  i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .  with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;  1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .  i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .  card reader is included .  2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .  3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .  i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .  be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .","transfer":-2,"picture quality":1}
