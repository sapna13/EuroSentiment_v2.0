{"scroll wheel":-2,"folder":-2,"Text":"if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .  if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .  all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .  if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .  ipod clearly has the most buzz .  great design and looks cool .  most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .  it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .  some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .  everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .  ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .  however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about \" white noise \" in random feedback mode that comes from appointments \/ contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .  synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .  reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .  reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery \/ pickup of item .  after that it seems like you 're on your own .  ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it \" unnecessary \" and \" so 20th century \" .  creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .  construction quality is a difficult item .  the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .  what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .  drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .  many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .  feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .  the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .  the creative software is awkward \/ difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .  enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .  the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that \" creates \" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .  reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .  the zen has no stop button .  veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .  the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .  it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .  if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .  karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .  usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .  repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist  - you just have to buy a new player .  perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .  like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .  it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .  the karma does have a stop button .  there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .  those that have it like it .  the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .  otherwise feedback seems to be good .  no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .  no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .  none of these are perfect .  if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .  accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .  if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .  if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .","software":-3,"support":-3,"headphone jack":-2,"build":-2,"construction":-2,"sound quality":2}
