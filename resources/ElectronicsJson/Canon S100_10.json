{"Text":"I've been incredibly happy with this camera.  This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.  It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.  Exposure compensation in 1\/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1\/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).  Slow-syncro flash, macro\/infinity mode, etc.  The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.  The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.","flash":2,"body":2,"Exposure":1,"camera":3,"zoom range":-1}
