{"Text":"you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .  although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .  after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .  i called them twice and both times they said it is \" about to ship \" .  one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said , \" actually we do n't ship on saturdays \" .  so why lie about it ?  so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .  although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .  they said it is in stock , but they are \" too busy \" .  they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !  although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .  i cancelled the order .  hope to get my refund in a timely manner .  thanks for nothing , amazon !"}
