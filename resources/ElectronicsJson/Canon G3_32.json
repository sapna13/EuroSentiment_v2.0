{"picture":2,"Text":"i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .  first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .  save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .  duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .  no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .  crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .  the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .  a great new use for that underutilized computer .  a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .  poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .  this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .  my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .  and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .  get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .  in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .  i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .  unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .","camera":2}
