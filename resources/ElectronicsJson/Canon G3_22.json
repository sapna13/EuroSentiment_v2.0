{"Text":"when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .  yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .  not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .  her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .  the nikon 's are great cameras .  + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .  - the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .  olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .  + takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .  - i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .  photos had some artifacts and noise .  my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .  we also looked at the fuji fps602 .  nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .  fiance did n't like the feel .  the canon g3 .  4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )  a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .  the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his \/ her own .  i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .  always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !","photo":3}
