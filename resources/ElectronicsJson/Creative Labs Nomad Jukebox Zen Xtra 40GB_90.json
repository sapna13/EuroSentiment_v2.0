{"Text":"ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .  honestly , i love this player .  one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .  once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .  ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .  however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .  therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .  if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .  if it does , ill give up .  basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .  thats it .  i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .  the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .  basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .  you know why ?  because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .  now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .  i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .  honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .  this is all i have to say .","break":3,"player":3,"sound":3,"hard drive":-3}
