{"look":3,"Text":"you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .  i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?  because this camera is beautiful .  the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .  the g3 looks like a work of art !  its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .  the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .","finish":3,"camera":3}
