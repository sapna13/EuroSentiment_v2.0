{"Text":"within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .  it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .  i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .  worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !  they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !  it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .","camera":2,"menu dial knob":-2,"servicing":-2}
