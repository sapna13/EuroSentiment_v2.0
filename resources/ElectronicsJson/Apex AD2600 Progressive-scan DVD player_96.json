{"product":3,"Text":"hooray !  think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?  well , not with this one .  it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .  i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .  i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .  there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .  so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !  only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .  otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !","direction":3,"format":1,"dvd player":2}
