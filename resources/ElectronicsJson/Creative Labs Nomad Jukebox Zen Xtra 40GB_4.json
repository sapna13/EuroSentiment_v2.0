{"scroll wheel":2,"Text":"this thing kicks mighty apple butt !  i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .  it 's worth it .  i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .  after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .  my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .  this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .  the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !  the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .  you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.  the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !  the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .  it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .  the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .  it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .  ( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )  the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .  other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .  ( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )  i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver \/ metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .  since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .  overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !  ( batteries last longer too ! )","control":2,"screen":-1,"leather pouch":3,"battery life":2,"sound":2,"firewire":-1,"battery":2,"size":-1}
