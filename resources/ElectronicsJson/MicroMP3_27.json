{"Text":"I'm a new to mp3 players.  For years I've downloaded songs and burned CDs, but I decided to simplify my life and get an mp3 player.  After reading reviews and talking to a few friends, I decided on the Zen.  player[-2]  It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  features[+2]  The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  The removable disk isn't really explained in the product literature but basically it allows you to partition a portion of the drive for data.  You can then hook up the Zen via USB to any Win2K or later computer and use that partition to store data files.  Any audio files in this area can't be played by the player.  I primarily got the Zen to use for band practice, so I use the removable disk to store lyrics and sheet music.  look[2]  The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.  The slow throbbing glow that it emits during charging is cool too.  interface[-1]  On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !  software[-2][p]  is not as intuitive as I would like.  earbuds[-1]  Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  I haven't used the Organizer feature (apparantly you can sync with Outlook).  You can also record with the built in mic and record FM broadcasts, I haven't tried those either.  player[+2][p]  Overall, I am very pleased with it.  player[+2][p]  The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it."}
