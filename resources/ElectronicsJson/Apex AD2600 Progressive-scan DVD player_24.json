{"Text":"this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr \/ cdrw \/ dvdr \/ dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .  now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .  but for $ 49.99 go get one !  features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .","progressive scan":2}
