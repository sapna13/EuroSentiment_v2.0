{"Text":"At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.  I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.  I bought it!  I have 5 routers, I use them all!  I make furniture and cabinetry.  I cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.  Maple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.  The M12V has been great.  The height adjustment works well- not perfect.  The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.  The true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.  What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.  Good luck and cut wood!!!!","workload":1,"adjustment":1,"bog":1}
