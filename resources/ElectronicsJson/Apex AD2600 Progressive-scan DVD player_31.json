{"Text":"after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .  ( good going , amazon ).  i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .  so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .  i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .  i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .  the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .  so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .  i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .  but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .  bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .","player":3}
