{"Text":"I have owned this router for nearly five years.  Until recently it was my only router.  Most of the time I use it mounted in a table, but obviously I also used it for hand held work.  It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.  Recenly the variable speed control went out.  It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.  The authorized Hitachi service center said they didn't know what was wrong as they hardly ever get these things in for service.  I bypassed the speed control, which was easy to do, now it works again, but with no speed control.  I didn't use the speed control that often so that is not a big deal.  The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.  Overall it is a great value.  For the price I don't think you can beat it.","control":-1,"price":3,"plunge":-1}
