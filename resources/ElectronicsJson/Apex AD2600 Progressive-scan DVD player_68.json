{"Text":"we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well .  the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .  the second one is up and running .  it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .  i am returning the broken one today .  i will not be ordering another one to replace it .  update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !","player":-3}
