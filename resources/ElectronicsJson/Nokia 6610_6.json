{"Text":"this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .  nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .  we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .  i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .","phone":-2}
