{"Text":"I got a 1GB MMC upgrade for this phone and now I can:  1. Record around 1 hour of video with Phillips Camcorder Pro.  2. Take around 10,000 640x480 pictures.  3. Play Java games on it.  4. Play N-Gage games on it.  5. Check traffic411.com for LA traffic on the 405.  6. Play Gameboy Color games on it with GoBoy.  7. Have a good chunk of my small MP3 to listen through the speaker phone.  8. Connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company VPN at 56k speed via bluetooth.  Clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people!!!  As for bluetooth, no problems at all.  I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.  Very simple and painless.","games":3,"bluetooth":2,"pictures":3,"call logs":1,"internet":3,"video":3,"MMC":3,"speaker phone":2}
