{"product":2,"Text":"well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .  so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .  so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .  well i decided to get this one .  well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .  well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .  well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .  enjoy .","program":-2}
