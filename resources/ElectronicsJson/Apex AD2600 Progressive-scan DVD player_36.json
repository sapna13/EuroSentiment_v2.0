{"panel":2,"Text":"i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .  well , this apex dvd player turned out great !  it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !  i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs \/ dvds .  it 's almost like having a media player \/ file manager built into the dvd player .  i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .  what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?  i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !  hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .  and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !  one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .  finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !","remote control":-2,"shipping":2,"player":2,"user interface":2,"dvd player":2}
