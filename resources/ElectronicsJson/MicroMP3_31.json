{"Text":"Alot of people seem to compare any music player to an Ipod.  Comments such as \"it's stylish\" or \"it looks cool\" or \"everyone has it\" don't nesseseraly make something good.  About the Ipod: it has it's downfalls as well.  touch sensitivity[-2]  As for the Zen Micro:\\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front.  durability[-2]  Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to \"unhold\" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player.  durability[-2]  After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself).  price[-2]  Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this.  $190 or $200 or less would have been much more reasonable (price compareble to 20gb mp3 players).  As for the warrenty, i havent seen it yet, but i fear for a short on!  e again.  color[+2] ##Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too.  They are bold colors, not the (personally) irratating toned down 'light' Ipod colors.  features[+2]  It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  battery[+1]  The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).  storage[-1][u]  Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game.  player[+][s]  If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  Closing: For everyone who is shallow and buys the Ipod only becouse of it's looks (i'm not saying it's necissarily bad), here's a joke: What did the Pencil Sharpener say to t!  he Pencil?  Stopping going in circles and get to the point.  Why go in circles to find something you want? (  :)  )","design":2}
