{"Text":"i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .  i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .  unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .  i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .  i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .","support":-3,"dvd":-3}
