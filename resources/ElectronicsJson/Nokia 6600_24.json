{"Text":"I've been using this phone for 3 days now, and while I admit that seems doesn't seem like very long -- I should also point out that I've been using it almost non-stop.  Frankly, I think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware I've ever used.  It is slow to initially start up, but once it's turned on, I've never had any complaints about the speed.  Over the past three days, I've only had to turn the phone off twice, so I rarely have to deal with the delay in initially booting the phone.  Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.  I've synched it with my PC over bluetooth.  I've synched it with my Jabra 250 bluetooth headset.  I've been on the phone, while browsing the net over a GPRS connection, while sending a text message.  All at the same time, and all without a hitch.  I think the interface is great.  I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).  In short, I don't have a single negative thing to say.  I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.  If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.","phone":3,"speed":2,"features":3,"interface":3}
