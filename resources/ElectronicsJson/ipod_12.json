{"Text":"Battery non-issue.  The iPod batteries can go through a full recharge cycle 400 times.  If you listen to the iPod four hours per day and you get 10 hours per recharge cycle (not the full twelve specified by Apple) then the iPod will give you over 2.5 years of daily listening.  Apple provides a good discussion of the battery technology at www.apple.com\/batteries (and this web address is noted in the iPod manual)  My earlier generation (15Gb) iPod lasted two years, shortened by my own inattention to the simple maintainence asked by Apple (go through at least one charging cycle per month, and don't store the iPod in a car on a summer day because high temp. is harmful to the battery's life).  Finally, if your battery gives out, you can use any number of reputable iPod services to swap it out for <$50 and you're good to go for another 2.5 years (or longer if battery technology improves.)  Ask yourself how often you've seen battery covers break on consumer electronics.  They wear out pretty easily when you're changing batteries every week or so.  Given that, I find the iPod solution reasonable: keep the case sealed and let the battery be changed by a technician once every 2-3 years.  No big deal.  You might change the battery once before the iPod is superceded by something a lot better and less expensive.  In fact you may get a newer-better-cheaper device before you get to that point.  Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost\/Gb, and also consider ease of use.  The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.","Battery":2,"iPod":2}
