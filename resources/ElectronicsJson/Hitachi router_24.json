{"Text":"I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.  If one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.  The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.  I recently had to run a 3\/4\" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.  I could take 1\/2\" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.  As much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.  I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.  Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.  I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.  It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.","router":3}
