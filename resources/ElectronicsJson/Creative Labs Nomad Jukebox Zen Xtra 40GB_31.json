{"Text":"i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .  it was not my first choice .  i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .  one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .  for the price and features it is really good .  one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist \/ album and answer was yes .  sure enough there is no such ability .  not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .  in any case , navigation by artist \/ album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .  you even can not navigate by genre \/ artist \/ album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .  creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .  the software , which comes with player is not good at all .  i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .  after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .  notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .  transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .  often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .  artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .  after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .  the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .","software":-2,"price":3,"navigation":-2,"nomad explorer":-2,"storage":2}
