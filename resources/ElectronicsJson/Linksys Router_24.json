{"Text":"product[+3]  This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year.  In my opinion a year is a good service time for a device, I dont expect this router or any other to work great for more than a year.  connection[+2][u] ##My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now.  works[+3]  IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER....
