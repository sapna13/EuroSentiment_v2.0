{"Text":"Product Of The Decade  What was the biggest must-have item of 2004?  Yep, the iPod.  Sales of Apple's mini-phenomenon currently stand at around 20 million worldwide, and this number is set to triple over the next couple of years.  That's a lot of money Apple are making from a very powerful, influential and trendy product.  But is it worth all the hype?  Well reviewing a product like this is definitely complicated, because do I rate my personal connotation on it?  Or simply rate its performance in relation to other products?  There's no two ways about it, I have been less than impressed with my own iPod 20 GB when it arrived two weeks ago.  However, having said that, this could just be because I haven't really had enough time to experience it in its entirety.  I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, \"I WANT THAT ONE!\" I was willing to shell out","iPod":2}
