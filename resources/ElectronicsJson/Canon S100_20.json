{"Text":"My last digital camera was an Apple QuickTake 200, which shot 640x480 pixel images.  The Apple was actually better in two repects: it turned-on quickly and it showed you what you just shot right after you shot it.  The  ELPH will do the latter but you must hold down the shutter button to view  it.  But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.","battery":2}
