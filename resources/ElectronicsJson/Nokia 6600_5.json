{"Text":"Don't get me wrong.  I love gadgets, technology and whatever electronic equipment you throw my way.  I've gone from almost every Nokia phone since they were only known and operational in Europe.  In those days I've gone from Oki, Motorolla and progressed (actually regressed) to Sony Ericsson's T610.  Now I'm back to Nokia to try their 6600 model."}
