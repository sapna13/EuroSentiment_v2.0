{"Text":"i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .  i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc .  the player kept displaying \" no disc \" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !  it worked .  i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .  the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .  the other company is currently \" out of stock \" so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .  hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .  if not i will avoid apex products in the future .  besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !  it plays everything , even vcd 's .  if only it played stand alone avi files .  if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating .  if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .","player":2}
