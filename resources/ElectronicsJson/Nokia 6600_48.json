{"look":2,"Text":"This phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones.  Supporting an operating system, Symbian OS, you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone.  You can turn this phone into a gaming machine, a camcorder or a digital camera, an mp3-player, a movie viewer, a voice recorder, a personal secretary, a GPS map browser, a book, a multifunction remote controller, practically everything that you can do with the computer, plus it is a phone(!!) and also you can carry it in your pocket :).  Many of these programs are shareware, some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks.  It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.  Its nice look is also a plus.  SIM- And also, since it is tri band and since it uses SIM-card, you can just use it in Europe and many other parts of the world, wherever GSM exists.  I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.","phone":3,"OS":2,"card":2,"MMC memory":3}
