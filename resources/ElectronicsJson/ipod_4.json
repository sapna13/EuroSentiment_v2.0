{"Text":"Get an ARCHOS Gmini400 instead\t If you are doing your research and thinking whether iPod is right for you...      give the ARCHOS Gmini400 a look.  I returned my 20G iPod 7 months ago and got a Gmini instead.  A sound decision and a happy customer right here!  I look at iPod owners today and quietly feel sorry for them. :) They just didn't know about the ARCHOS gmini400.  The Gmini is like an iPod VIDEO, PHOTO, GAME, MUSIC, all into ONE and it is exactly the same size as the iPod...      and you can play any MP3 directly and fresh from the NET...     oh yeah, even audio books, anything!  It's a plug n play device, recognized as MASS STORAGE DEVICE on any windows xp computer.  No need to install the iTunes."}
