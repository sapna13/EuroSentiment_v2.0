{"Text":"Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.  I have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like \"Just go buy an Ipod!\"  Apple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.  It is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.  What is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?  Apple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.  creative[+3]  I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  Of course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.  player[+3][p]  The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  battery life[+2][cc]  It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  audio quality[+][cc]  Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  It may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties."}
