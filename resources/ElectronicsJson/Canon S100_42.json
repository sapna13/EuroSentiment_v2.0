{"Text":"I've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures.  The size is tiny, which I love.  We bought extra memory and a backup battery (so we can use one while the other is charging).  Sometimes the pictures are onthe dark side, but I'm able to fix that using the Photoshop 6.0 \"adjust levels\" function ... not sure how a person would do that without Photoshop, though.","pictures":-1,"size":3}
