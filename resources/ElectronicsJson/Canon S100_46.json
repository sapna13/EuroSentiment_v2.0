{"Text":"I've struggled for years with supposedly high-quality point and shoot 35mm cameras delivering astonishingly inconsistent results.  The Canon S100 destroys this problem.  I've had this camera for roughly 3 weeks now and I've taken approximately 250 pictures.  The results are superb...  both in print and over the computer."}
