{"Text":"i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).  unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .  the batteries would not charge .  so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .  in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .  it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .  so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !  it always pays off .  hope i 've been of some help .","hard drive":-2}
