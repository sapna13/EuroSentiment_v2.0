{"Text":"ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .  i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .  i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .  lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .  looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .  things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !  and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !","remote":-3,"auto fit":2}
