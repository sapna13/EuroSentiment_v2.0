{"Text":"just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .  takes excellent photos .  night mode is clear as day .  i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .  the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .  however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .  overall it is the best camera on the market .  i give it 10 stars !","night mode":2,"camera":3,"feature":2,"viewfinder":-1,"photo":2}
