{"installation":2,"Text":"I originally bought McAfee VirusScan 7 from Amazon.  About a month ago, it had an error that I could not fix and the program would not update.  Even though I had 6+ months left on the McAfee subscription, I decided to move on and buy Norton Internet Security 2004 (NIS).  I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.  I did remove all remnants of McAfee before installing and confirmed the Windows XP firewall was off.  It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).  I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open\/close scanning that it does with every program.  Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?  I'm not sure how it would have been compromised by a virus.","scan":-1,"size":-2}
