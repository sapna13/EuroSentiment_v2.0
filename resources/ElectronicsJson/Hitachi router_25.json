{"Text":"I reciently purchased this when a 1 1\/2hp plunge router (different name brand) couldn't hack it.  The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.  I couldn't believe what I had been missing.  If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.  I'll be getting a second one for my router table!","starts":2,"router":3}
