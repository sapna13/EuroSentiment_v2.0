{"Text":"functioning[+1]  Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright.  auto load[-2]  After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player.  I tried to figure out another way to load the songs and attempted another upgrade with no results.  I emailed the company and after 2 days was told to read their Q&A site and then download again.  I tried the help menu that referenced GUI buttons that don't exist on my version.  I'm less than satisfied.  software[-3]  It seems like the software is just not responding.  support[-3]  The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost.  They responded -after I told them I have a Zen Micro and suggested that my \"jukebox\" needed to be purged.  support[-3][u]  I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating."}
