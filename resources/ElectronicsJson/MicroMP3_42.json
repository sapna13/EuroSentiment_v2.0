{"look":3,"Text":"I've been using iTunes for about a year now with the intention of eventually buying an iPod.  That was before the Zen Micro came along.  player[+3][p]  I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  sound quality[+3][cc] ##it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  touchpad[+2] ##I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  I can't comment on the bundled software as I haven't even looked at it.  Media player compatibility[+3]  Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  As for the problem with locking up mentioned in a previous post, it only seems to happen if the USB cable is unplugged while WMP 10 is still running.  I just close the program down first, wait for the message to appear on the Micro, then unplug it.  This appears to prevent the lockup issue.  The battery life doesn't appear to be any!  battery life[-1][p]  where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  battery life[-1][p]  I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  This was probably the biggest reason I chose the Micro over an iPod.  storage[+2]  The extra Gb is just a bonus.  headphones[-1]  The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of \"ear buds\".  Plug in a decent set or hook it up to a stereo system and prepare to be impressed.  sound[+3]  If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.","interface":3}
