{"Text":"i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .  no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .  from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .  whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .  wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !","speakerphone":2,"radio":2,"feature":2}
