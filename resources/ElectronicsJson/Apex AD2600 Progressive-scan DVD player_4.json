{"Text":"for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .  then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .  new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .  i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .  there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !  this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .  i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .  i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .  apex does n't answer the phone .  * sigh .","player":-3,"dvd":-2,"case":2,"cd":-2}
