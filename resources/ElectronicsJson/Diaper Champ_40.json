{"product":2,"Text":"I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.  The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.  The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.  I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.  That would be my only complaint.","open":-2,"pull":-1}
