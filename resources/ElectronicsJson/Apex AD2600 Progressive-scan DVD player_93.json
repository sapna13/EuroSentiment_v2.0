{"Text":"i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .  no go on most formats .  it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .  however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .  i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd \/ svcd formats , but others say they can .  also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .  good quality video .","player":2,"video quality":2,"play":-2}
