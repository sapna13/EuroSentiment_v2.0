{"reception":3,"Text":"anything this phone does , it does perfectly .  the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .  the speakerphone :  this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .  as said before this works perfectly .  you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .  the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .  you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .  only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .  the radio :  this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .  this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .  tri-band :  feature one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .  i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .  t- the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .  anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .  if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .  sold in other parts of the world :  another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .  this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .  or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .  i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .  able to use service in another country :  if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .  you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .  size and weight :  when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .  this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .  battery life :  the battery life on this phone is surreal .  it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .  i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .  it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .  this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .  the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .  overall , i highly recommend this phone .  it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .","phone":3,"battery life":3,"bluetooth":-1,"speakerphone":-1,"battery":2,"volume":1,"radio":2,"mobile":-1,"size":2}
