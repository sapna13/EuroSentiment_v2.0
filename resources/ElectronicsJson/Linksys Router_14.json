{"Text":"working[+2]  I got it working fast enough.  router[+2][p]  It is a nice router in all ways but one.  reliable[-2]  It is not reliable.  access[-2][u]  A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet.  access[-2][u]  That is, you cannot access the internet at all.  All lights blink, and you can still access other computers on wired and wireless LAN.  Just no internet.  You have to unplug the unit to get it to work again.  router[-2][u]  Very annoying.  I did know about this from researching on the internet before purchasing it, but I bought it anyway.  My mistake.  I have returned it and have a cheaper, nicer Belkin."}
