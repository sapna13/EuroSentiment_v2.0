{"Text":"the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .  but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,  . this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .  would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .  . if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software \" nikon view \" which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .  so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to onceagain open them through their software to put the date ; time .  in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .  . even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image  . images taken indoor were n't so clear .  you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit  . lens cap is a really annoying  . go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .  else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately \" fine **\" picture quality  \" image size : 1600 .  . the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .  close- but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .  i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .","indoor image":-2,"camera":2,"image":-2,"movie":-2,"lens cap":-3,"auto mode":-2}
