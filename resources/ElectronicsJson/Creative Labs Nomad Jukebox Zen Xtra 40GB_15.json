{"scroll wheel":-2,"Text":"i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .  after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :  transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .  it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .  having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .  scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .  size - bigger than the ipod  software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .  after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .  song transfers were not an issue .  i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .  the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .  the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .  the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .  sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .  i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .  granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .  itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .","transfer":-2,"software":-1,"sound quality":1,"size":-1}
