{"Text":"I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.  This router does GREAT in hand held jobs and Router Tables.  I mounted mine in a home brew table and used a router lift.  The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.  Its well made and user friendly.  You'll love it!","operation":1}
