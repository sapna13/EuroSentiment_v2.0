{"picture":2,"Text":"received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .  the remote is a little hard to understand .  my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 \" screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 \" monitor .  so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .  prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !  i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .","dvd":1,"remote":-1,"jpeg picture":-1}
