{"Text":"i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .  the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .  the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .  my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .  i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .  i do n't really like bounce .  i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .  battery life is good for a phone of this size .  but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .  great screen and great sound .  ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?  the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .  the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .  the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .  my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .  nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .  this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .  ( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )  other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .  t- finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .  t- their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .  if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .","screen":2,"battery life":2,"phone":2,"voice quality":3,"button":-2,"voice dialing":1,"game":-2,"key":-2,"mobile":-2}
