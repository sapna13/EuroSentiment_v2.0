{"product":-3,"Text":"I had the best intentions when I bought this, I really did.  I followed the instructions to the letter.  But it caused more headaches than I could imagine.  Stay away from this product!  I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.  Apparently, they can't even fix the bugs that have overrun their own site.  The customer support is pathetic.","support":-3,"2004":-3}
