{"picture":-2,"sunset feature":3,"Text":"i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .  the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .  after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .  the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !  the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .  i love all of the features , and presets as well .  sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !  the software you get with this camera is perfect .  touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .  i definately recommend a large memory card .  i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .  very large pics take 8mb each !  battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .  all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .  making the step from film to digital has been a great move .  i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .  great camera , great investment !","software":3,"battery life":2,"touchup":2,"camera":3,"digital zoom":2,"feature":3}
