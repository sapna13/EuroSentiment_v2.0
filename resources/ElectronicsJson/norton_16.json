Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.  Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35\/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!  I am going to buy PC-cillium ASAP.  So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.","firewall":-3,"capacity":-3}
