{"canon":3,"picture":2,"Text":"being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .  but canon never fails to amaze .  some of the great gains over g2 --  1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .  2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .  3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .  looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .  4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .  a big plus in my book .  5 . the 1\/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .  the light auto-correction is awesome .  you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .  6 . the g2 's \" color effect \" exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable \" effect func \" menu option available in all exposure modes .  there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .  7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .  i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .  ( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).  8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .  in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .  9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .  personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .  overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .  there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .  short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .  this is quite simply the best you can ask for .","raw format":2,"battery life":1,"software":2,"light auto correction":2,"white offset":2,"shape":1,"g3":3}
