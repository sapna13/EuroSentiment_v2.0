{"Text":"this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .  the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .  100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .  i took the camera and just gave it to someone .  no instructions .  just point and shoot and the photos were great .  just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .  the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .  my pda becames a digital album .  i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .  if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .  go get it .  before they are sold out !","software":3,"camera":2,"photo":2,"memory card":2}
