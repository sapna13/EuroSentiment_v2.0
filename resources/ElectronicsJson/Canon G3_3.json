{"Text":"i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .  i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .  the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .  flaws ?  the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .  still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .  despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .","canon g3":3,"camera":2,"feature":2,"viewfinder":-1,"photo quality":2}
