{"scratch":-2,"iTunes":1,"Text":"Just don't drop it.  I had the 15G iPod of the previous incarnation.  Actually I had two: the first one stopped working within a month so I took it back, and they exchanged it (which is evidently pretty extraordinary - guess I lucked out.  I didn't tell them I had dropped it once).  Then I had the second one in my boyfriend's car, and his car got jacked.  Fortunately his insurance covered it (also extraordinary), and as luck would have it, this new gen of iPods came out the same week he got the check.  So I got a free 5G upgrade out of that misfortune.  I also got to see just how utterly addicted I am to my iPod in the few weeks I had to go without one.  The major change from the previous model, other than the extra 5G for the same price, is that this one is slightly smaller and lighter, and the already minimal buttons (menu, play\/pause, forward and back) have now been assigned to the four quarters of the click wheel, so that even less brain power is required to search through your 10,000 stolen mp3s.  Mac is really big on streamlining everything (maybe that's why you never get a decent manual with any of their products).  I like the click wheel OK, but actually the one problem I've had with this, my third, iPod is that occassionally the wheel gets \"stuck,\" meaning either it won't respond at all, or it \"jumps\" down playlists uncontrollably.  When this happens I have to toggle the lock switch on and off to get it to work properly.  I guess that's a pretty minor deal, but it can be annoying.  Needless to say, these are fragile machines.  Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.  I don't really intend to drop mine to find out.  The thing is, naturally you're going to use your iPod at the gym or whatever, and it can be a bit of a liability because you always feel like you have to protect it.  Not that anybody would revert back to their old-skool walkman just because you can knock it around more.  The thousands of songs at your fingertips thing, you just can't beat that with a stick.  But seriously though, how bout we work on the durability thing for the next gen.  We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party \"iSkin\" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.  The other thing is the earbuds.  First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.  These are nice ones, and you get great sound at first, but again, they break if you even think mean things about them.  With both pairs I had ceramic rattling in my ears by month two.  And I'm really not that rough with things!  These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.  Mac has at least cornered the mp3 player market across the board.  PC users have a lot of choices, but based on what I've heard and read, the iPod really is the best all-around, athough being a Mac product, it has the usual streamlined and comparatively less customizable software.  And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.  Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything.","alternative":-1,"iPod":2,"design":-2}
