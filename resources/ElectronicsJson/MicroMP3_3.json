{"Text":"Zen Micro[+2]  Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.  Why?  Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  touchpad[-1]  The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.  small[+3]  I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  file transfers[+3] ##Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  recorder[+2] ##Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  player[+2]  This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.","Sound":2,"size":2,"Media Source":2}
