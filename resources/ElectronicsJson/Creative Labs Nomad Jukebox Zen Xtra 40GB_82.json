{"Text":"i bought the player this week and i like it by far .  this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .  here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .  pro : 1 .  removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .  my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .  his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .  2 .  value : comparing data storage with price .  3 .  size and style :  the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .  the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )  4 .  easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this  con :  the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .  a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .  in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .  however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .  i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .  ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )  now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and \" explorer \/ my computer \/ grab files from disk c or d into the player \" to replace the mediasource .  in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software","software":-2,"appearance":1,"mediasource":-2,"player":2,"battery":2,"value":2,"use":1,"size":1}
