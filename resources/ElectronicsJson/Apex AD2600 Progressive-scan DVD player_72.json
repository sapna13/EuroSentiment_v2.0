{"Text":"for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .  the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .  it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .  and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .  recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .","dvd":1,"door":-1,"format":3,"dvd player":2}
