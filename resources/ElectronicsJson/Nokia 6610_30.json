{"Text":"i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .  i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .  i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .  they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .  with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .  i have had no problems with the phone .  friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .  i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .  great phone , i 'd buy another .","phone":2,"size":1}
