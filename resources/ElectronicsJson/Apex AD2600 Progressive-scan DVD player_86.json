{"look":2,"Text":"i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .  i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .  there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .  still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !  so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .  i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !  ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .  nothing !  i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !  i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !  my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .  upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .  i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .  the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .  i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .  guess where this unit is headed ?  yup , right back for a refund !","player":1,"freeze":-2,"noise":-1}
