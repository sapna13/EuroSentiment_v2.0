{"Text":"I bought this phone a few months ago and I have been using it since then.  I never had a single problem.  It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.  High quality video and pictures rock!  3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.  Bottom line great phone for the time being.","phone":3,"band":3,"menu":3,"video":3}
