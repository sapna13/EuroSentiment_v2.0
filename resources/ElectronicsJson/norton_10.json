{"update":2,"visual backtracking":3,"Text":"I originally had bought Norton Internet Security for my laptop after the preinstalled Norton Antivirus trial had finished.  The hardest part was the run around with what software suite to buy.  This package contains BOTH Norton Antivirus and Firewall.  The only reason I'd buy them separately in the combo package is for two liecenses.  If you want integrated Antivirus and Firewall this is what I'd suggest.  Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.  It usually only takes 5-10 MB's of system memory.  I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.  Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.  You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.  The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.  An infected computer tried to launch an attack on mine and I was able to get a map and address of the server.","memory usage":2}
