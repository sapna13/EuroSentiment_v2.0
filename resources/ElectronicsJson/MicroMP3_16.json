{"look":2,"Text":"player[-2][p] ##This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  player[-][cc]  The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  storage[-][cc], format[-2][cc]  The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  look[+][cc], interface[-2]  The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  In fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.  The karma also has a very long battery life.  Having owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.  No comparison in my opinion."}
