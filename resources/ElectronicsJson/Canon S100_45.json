{"Text":"I've got a couple of digital cameras.  An Olympus 2500 and an Olympus 620.  Really like them,  they work well and the macro function of the 2500 really helps my Ebay biz.  BUT they are big cameras,  they have to reside in a large case,  they need all kinds of batteries,  in short they're a pain to lug around."}
