{"Text":"pros :  * price and capacity  * slick-looking design and improved interface  * removable battery  cons :  * protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .  had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .  how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?  * scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .  does n't always register push-button movement .  * eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .  i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .  * does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).  * software is absolutely terrible :  -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).  -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .  -- > too difficult to change genre \/ album \/ track information for large number of tracks .  -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .  if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .  final verdict :  a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .","software":-1,"transfer":-2,"price":2,"player":2,"scroll":-2,"recognition":-1,"change":-2,"battery":1,"volume":-2,"case":-3,"design":2,"eax":-2}
