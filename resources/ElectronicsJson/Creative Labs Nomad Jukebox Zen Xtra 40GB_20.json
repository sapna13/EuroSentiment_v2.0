{"Text":"i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .  my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..  just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .  the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .  so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .  setup[2], the setup and transfer process was cake for me .  i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .  i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .  the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .  it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .  that 's probably a bad thing .  the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .  it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .  now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .  the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .  i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .  the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .  the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .  the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .  all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .  i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .  highly recommended !","screen":2,"explorer":-1,"player":1,"eax mode":2," transfer":2,"mp3 player":3,"jog dial":-2}
