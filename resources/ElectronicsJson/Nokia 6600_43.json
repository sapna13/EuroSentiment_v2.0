{"Text":"I bought 2 of these Nokia 6600 phones recently, thru the amazon market place.  Initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone, web browser and ofcourse the built in camera.  So on the whole, let me summarize the good and bad things about this phone, instead of writing a long review.  The good:  1) Large LCD screen, colorful display, good resolution.  2) Nice features, like web browser, camera, video recorder, speaker phone (very usefully), clear voice reception.  3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.  Now the bad:  1) As usual, battery power not sufficient for daily usuage.  3) Joy stick for eazy navigation, 35Mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff.  The battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser.  2) Phone is awfully slow.  Sometimes when you press buttons, the menu appears after a second or two.  3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.  Looks big in the display ads though.  4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.  There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.  5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the \"Free picture and video messaging\" offered by service provider.  So my review should defintely give you an idea about this phone.  The bottom line is \"Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones\".","screen":2,"Phone":1,"Joy stick":2,"battery":-2,"features":3,"video recorder":-2,"size":1}
