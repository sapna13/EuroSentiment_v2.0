{"Text":"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .  it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .  sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .  i do n't think i was asking too much .  any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .  and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .  i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .  i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .  that meant even less light and just as much action .  sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .  the grain was terrible .  next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .  well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .  when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .  the camera was a marvel .  getting the printer to help output them was another tale .  overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .  for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .  you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .  then again a one time use camera may do just as well .  if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .  it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .  me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .  sure .  it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .","camera":1,"grain":-3,"flash photo":-3,"photo":3}
