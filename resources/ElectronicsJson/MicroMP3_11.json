{"look":3,"Text":"Update 8\/11\/05:  The latest release of the iPOD firmware fixes teh calender sync bug i noted below.  I bought this a couple of months ago after researching all the reviews comparing with the iPod mini.  price[+2]  The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less.  I got rid of my older PDA figuring that since the only function I used on it anyways was to manage my contacts and calender, I could now use my Zen Micro.  sound[+3]  Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set.  size[+3][u] ##- Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.  accessories[-2]  Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod.  I waited for Creative's FM transmitter for a month, finally bought a Belkin Tunecast II, which is not great.  I get occasional hiss while driving.  battery life[-2]  - The battery life leaves a lot to be desired.  Though rated at 12 hrs, I could barely manage 8 and I have two spares as well.  firmware[-3]  I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked.  outlook sync[-2]  - The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. -  Several people complained about the touchpad and frankly i'm starting to see why.  touchpad[-1]  I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode).  I wish they has a \"lock\" function like cell phones to prevent this.  audible.com book compatibility[-3][u]  - Not compatible with Audible.com books.  Zen Micro[-2]  Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion."}
