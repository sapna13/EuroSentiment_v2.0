{"Text":"i wish i could give negative stars !  i bought this dvd player in november .  i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .  i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .  what a mistake !  after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .  i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .  i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .  i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .  i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .  i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .  i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy .  that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .  do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !","no disc":-2}
