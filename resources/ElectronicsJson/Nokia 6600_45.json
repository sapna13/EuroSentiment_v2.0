{"Text":"went with T mobile Nokia 6600 replacing my Sony T610.  It is a multifunction phone, reception quality is better than the 610.  speaker phone quality is good, and poping in a 512mb MMC card, it rocks !  putting in MP3 player, lots of games and application to download.  DOwnside is the size of the phone, it is BIG for today's standard.  and the battery life is bad !  I could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days!  a bit dissapoitnd on that!  the GPRS web access is sloooooooooooooow!
