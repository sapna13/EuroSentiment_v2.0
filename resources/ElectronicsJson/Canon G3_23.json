{"Text":"the powershot g3 is a great camera .  why ?  because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !  4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .  it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .  make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !","camera":2,"feature":1,"photo":3}
