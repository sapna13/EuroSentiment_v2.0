{"picture":2,"Text":"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .  i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .  seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .  but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in \" auto \" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !  four megapixels is great .  i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .  if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .  if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .  if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .  it is a very amazing product .  i highly recommend it .","camera":3,"four megapixel":1}
