{"product":-3,"Text":"I read how the buyers of this product watched their computers turn into processing sloths, bought a copy and watched my 2.4 Gig XP Pro processor slow down below the level of my 750 Meg 2000Pro laptop!  At the same time I bought PC-Cillin for the laptop and what a slick product!  So now, when we type, half the time the XP Pro 2.4 Gig PC lags behind the input, sometime by 10 characters!  Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!  I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.  BEWARE!!!!","Symantec":-2}
