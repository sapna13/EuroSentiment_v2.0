{"Text":"we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .  the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .  it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !  we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .  the only drawbacks that i have noticed :  it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .  so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .  auto- it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .  i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .  it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .  for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .  it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .  i set the camera to the \" manual \" mode for one main reason :  in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .  in manual , you can set it to \" single af \" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .  in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !  it is easy to \" focus \" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .  it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .  for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .  they take excellent macro shots as well .  the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .","macro":2,"optical zoom":-1,"focus assist light":-1,"battery":-2,"camera":3,"menu":2,"nikon 4300":3}
