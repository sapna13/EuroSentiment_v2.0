{"work":-3,"update":-3,"Text":"I have always sworn by Norton Anti-Virus and SystemWorks products, and have used them both for years.  So I expected the same level of quality and ease of use with their Internet Security program.  I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!  After installing, the system froze trying to restart (this is a new computer with Windows XP Home).  After finally restarting, the \"automatic updates\" ran.  When all was said and done, I couldn't even use Microsoft Outlook.  Seems the \"program scan\" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!  It did find Outlook Express, but that's not what I use.  Before I managed to manually add the program file, I contacted Symantec support.  Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.  It was a Symantec error.  After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.  I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.  Again, I tried online email support.  They gave me a ridiculous set of steps which included emailing them screen prints as PDF files!  I use the program like most other people - in DISABLED mode.  Eventually I will uninstall this troublesome bug-filled program.  Maybe it's time to explore McAfee products again...","program scan":-1,"support":-3,"Symantec":-2}
