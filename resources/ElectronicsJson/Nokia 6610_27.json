{"message":1,"Text":"i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .  it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .  truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !  this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .  on an average , you would charge it once a week .  the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .  i simply love this feature .  in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .  the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .  if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .  the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .  no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .  just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .  additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )  the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .  the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .  the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .  if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .  however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .  i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .  i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .  i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .","phone":2,"battery life":2,"headset":3,"tone":1,"speakerphone":2,"mms":2,"radio":2,"pc sync":2}
