{"text":"My old Linksys router recently died after 2.5 years of service.\nWhile I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.\nThe new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process.\nI had to change the channel of the router, like the channel on a cordless phone, to get it to work with the Linksys Instant USB Wireless Adapter v2.6.\nI also had to do this with the old router.\nI used Linksys technical support several times.\nUnlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable.\nGranted, I am a professional technologist with years of experience.\nOverall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!\nat works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":894,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":889},{"endOffset":894,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":889}]}
