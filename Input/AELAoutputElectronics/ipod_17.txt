{"text":"Would be FIVE STARS, except for MAJOR FLAW\nLet me say first, that I have always been a hater of all things Apple.\nHowever, after holding an ipod at circuit city, I knew I had to have one.\nWhen I finally got it, I was amazed by how asthetically pleasing everything was, including the packaging.\nThe ipod itself is very pleasing to hold with its smooth surfaces.\nThe only thing that protrudes slightly is the \"hold\" switch.\nFor this reason, it is very easy to drop.\nOne of the other reviewers said get the neoprene case from marware, which is great advice.\nI have almost dropped the ipod several times, just because it is so smooth.\nEverything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.\nTo adjust the volume, you just sweep your finger lightly along the click  wheel.\nOrganizing music is a breeze too.\nYou can put songs in multiple categories, which is great.!\nFinding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.\nIt all sounds great too.\nAs with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears.\nI recommend Shures (shure.com).\nI have the e3c's, and man does everything on the ipod sound great.\nYou can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.\nI use a great free program called ipod agent to do this.\nThe outlook is a little clunky to use on the ipod, but it is functional.\nI LOVE THIS IPOD!  So why, you ask, did I give it only one star?\nBecause Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY.\nTo see a great little short film about this, go to ipodsdirtysecret.com  ##Basically, this is a disposable device, the idea being that when the battery goes out, you will buy the latest model of ipod.\nThis was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!\nIf you can get past this little flaw, give the ipod 5 stars, because everything else about it is pretty much perfect.\nHowever, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS.\nHence, the one star rating...\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":112,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":107},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":676},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":676},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":676},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":676},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":676},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":676},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":676},{"endOffset":681,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":676},{"endOffset":823,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":818},{"endOffset":848,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":843},{"endOffset":1059,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1054},{"endOffset":1142,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1137},{"endOffset":1149,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1143},{"endOffset":1444,"mention":"outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1437},{"endOffset":1444,"mention":"outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1437},{"endOffset":1502,"mention":"agent","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fort%C3%A9_Agent"],"startOffset":1497},{"endOffset":1502,"mention":"agent","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fort%C3%A9_Agent"],"startOffset":1497},{"endOffset":1526,"mention":"outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":1519},{"endOffset":1651,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":1647},{"endOffset":2319,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":2315}]}
