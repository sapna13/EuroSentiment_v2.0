{"text":"(...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging.\nAnd provides near zero-statistics.\nSOHO boxes don't give you a clue about who is one your network or what they are doing.\nThis is universal across every brand I've worked with.\nIf a PC asks & takes a DHCP address you'll have that record, but that's it.\nVery easy for visitors to be invisible on all home-marketed boxes.\nI'm disappoointed Linksys still doesn't allow mapping specific IP addressses in DHCP (what Windows Server people call Reservations).\nNetgear and Dell (which I think may be DLink rebranded) do.\nBEST SECURITY PRACTICES I RECOMMEND...  Pick a UNIQUE SSID.\nSSID are like filenames in Windows.\nWhen your laptop come home it must have a profile with the SID.\nIf you leave it as LINKSYS you will have to wipe out your config to connect to someone else's LNKSYS router cause they didn't change the default SS!\nID on their router.\nMAC filtering stops visitors from using your network but they can still spy on your traffic.\nMAC filtering isn't too hard and it is just a config change on the router.\nYou don't have to monkey with the PC config.\nEasy and a basic step, but if you have suspicious teenae computer geeks in the area, maybe not enough for privacy.\nBest practice is learn how to setup encryption.\nWEP encryption is weak but most computer people couldn't figure out how to break it.\nWPA is best.\nProblem is sometimes you can't get a visiting laptop to work with certain encryption.\nGetting Apple\/Macs was historically a pain, but they've all improved interoperability now.\nEncryption means people can't join OR read what you're doing.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":485,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":478},{"endOffset":674,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":667},{"endOffset":912,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":909},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1138,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic"],"startOffset":1133},{"endOffset":1138,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic"],"startOffset":1133},{"endOffset":1138,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic"],"startOffset":1133}]}
