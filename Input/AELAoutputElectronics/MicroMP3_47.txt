{"text":"Nobody has clearly articulated what exactly about the Ipod mini makes it better than this product.\nI have visited multiple websites, and for virtually EVERY new hard-drive-based mp3 player I find, there are always user reviews that smash the new player and say something like \"Just go buy an Ipod!\"\nApple apparently has built up a very nice following of brainwashed consumers.\nIt is unlikely that you will EVER get the best products just by sticking with one company.\nWhat is the conjunctive probability that each successive product release will be without flaws or that the company isn't having turnover in the R&D department (or making bad management decisions)?\nApple never was involved with a lot of audio products until the Ipod.\nI have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.\nOf course, some were better than others, and I probably could have gotten a better sound card from another company at some point.\nThe main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.\nIt beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.\nFurther, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.\nIt may be that the next Creative product is complete junk, but you should make product decisions based on product attributes NOW, not based on a halo effect of an idealized company (Apple) or other pointless loyalties.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":63,"mention":"Ipod mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":54},{"endOffset":252,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":246},{"endOffset":252,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":246},{"endOffset":304,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":299},{"endOffset":304,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":299},{"endOffset":304,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":299},{"endOffset":304,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":299},{"endOffset":670,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":665},{"endOffset":670,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":665},{"endOffset":670,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":665},{"endOffset":670,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":665},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1005,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1083,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1078},{"endOffset":1120,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":1115},{"endOffset":1463,"mention":"halo","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Halo:_Combat_Evolved"],"startOffset":1459},{"endOffset":1501,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1496}]}
