{"text":"I've had this camera for three years.\nprice[-1][u]I bought it new, when it was cutting edge and very expensive.\nI put a 128MB CF card in it.\nFirst, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.\nI've probably taken upwards of 5000 pictures with it, it's been all over the country.\nThe software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.\nThe camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.\nIf battery life were that big a deal, one could purchase a second battery and rotate.\nAll that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.\nThey are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.\nWhen taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.\nScratches, oil, freckles are magnified and come out looking horrific.\nIt requires extensive Photoshopping to fix the flaws.\nOther cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.\nI will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.\nBy the time the shot's taken, something (especially a squirmy child or a sports play) has invariably moved and it's not the exact picture you wanted.\nI'm going to buy a real Single-Lens Reflex (SLR) to take baby pictures, but I'll keep this as a travel camera.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":368,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":361},{"endOffset":747,"mention":"razor","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Maniac_Mansion"],"startOffset":742},{"endOffset":747,"mention":"razor","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Maniac_Mansion"],"startOffset":742},{"endOffset":798,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":793},{"endOffset":798,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":793},{"endOffset":798,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":793},{"endOffset":1142,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1136},{"endOffset":1363,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1359},{"endOffset":1363,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1359},{"endOffset":1363,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1359},{"endOffset":1363,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1359},{"endOffset":1363,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1359}]}
