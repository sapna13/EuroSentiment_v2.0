{"text":"I'm going to be moving soon.\nOne device, Tivo Series 1 DVR, is far enough away from my network router to need either a really long Ethernet cable, or a wireless connection.\nGot the Linksys after reading some reviews.\nWas a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac.\nBut everything worked out for the best.\nAfter pulling the Router out and connecting it, I hooked a Linksys WET11 Bridge onto the Tivo.\nReset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm.\nThe downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g.\nHowever since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.\nOverall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":263,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":256},{"endOffset":408,"mention":"Bridge","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Bridge"],"startOffset":402}]}
