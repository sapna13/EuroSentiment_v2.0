{"text":"My husband and I bought this instead of the Diaper Genie since we didn't want to be bothered with buying refills for the Genie.\nWell, I suppose this is better than an open pail, but to have a nursery in which there is no unpleasant smell is quite impossible no matter what you use.\nThe bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.\nPresto!\nDiaper falls into bag inside the Champ.\nBut, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.\n(I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.\nA couple of tips to having a clean-smelling nursery even with the Champ: Double bagging- Get those diaper sacks you would use to dispose of diapers if you're in a place where you don't want to dump a dirty diaper, like in your friend's wastebasket or kitchen garbage.\nBag the diaper in this small clean-smelling bag and then chuck it in the Champ.\nAnother tip is to wash out the Champ frequently and spray the inside and lid with Lysol after every full bag is removed.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":56,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AIR-2_Genie"],"startOffset":51},{"endOffset":126,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AIR-2_Genie"],"startOffset":121}]}
