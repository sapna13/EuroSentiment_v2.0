{"text":"i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .\nhere 's a basic run-down from what i learned :\nflash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost\nmp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .\nthe flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .\nthat 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .\ntiny !\nmp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .\ni am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .\n( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )\nhard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .\ncheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .\nthat said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .\njust be aware of it .\nthis explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .\na 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .\nit 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller \/ lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .\nthat 's the first thing to understand .\nso consider what you 're going to use the device for .\nif you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .\nif you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .\nreview of zen xtra - 40 gb\nthe device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .\nthis did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .\nit comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .\nthe front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .\nas some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .\nit did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .\nthe software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .\nextremely convenient .\nthen it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .\nyou can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .\n( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )\nthe pros and cons of it :\ngreat price .\nthe ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .\ni thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .\nthe scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .\nit also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .\nit is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .\nfor me , that was the only drawback .\ni 'm really happy with this purchase .\nalso , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .\nif you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .\nafter i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .\nso if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .\nif you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .\ni would have liked to have given it 4 1\/2 stars docking that 1\/2 star only for the size
