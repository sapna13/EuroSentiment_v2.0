{"text":"The diaper champ is the best!\nHaving used it with 2 children 13 months apart.\nI can honestly speak to its worth!\nI have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.\n1) The champ is easy to use.\nOne pail that I used was so difficult to change the bag and insert the dirty diaper.\nYou had to remove the entire lid and lay it on the floor (which led to my toddler running away with it which is gross) while trying to fit the bag correctly into the slot.\nFor diaper disposal, you had to push a button and the lid would or would not pop open.\nWith the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.\nIt was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.\nThe Champ also has hinges for you to place a new bag.\n2) The Champ uses regular store bags.\nYou do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.\nYou can save your bags from your shopping trip and insert them into the Champ.\nSpecial bags are expensive, hard to find, and you never have enough.\nThis will never be a problem with the Champ.\nDon't Caregivers need more simplicity in their lives?\nThe Champ gives you peace of mind and wallet.\n3)The Champ is Odor Free for at least 15 months.\nThe Champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year.\nI cannot speak to the accuracy of its odor containing capabilities due to it was working overtime with 2 childrens diapers.\nIf you have only one child the Champ may last you until the child is out of diapers.\nThe other pail I used started to smell after 2 weeks of use.\nRegardless to this fact, I believe the Champ is the best way to go.\nThe positives outway the negatives.\nThere probably isn't a pail out on the market that doesn't get smelly after a while.\nLet the Champ win you over!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":835,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":830},{"endOffset":835,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":830},{"endOffset":835,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":830},{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"lives","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/LiVES"],"startOffset":1131}]}
