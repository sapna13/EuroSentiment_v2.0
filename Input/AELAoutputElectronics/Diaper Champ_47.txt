{"text":"Let me just say this... After being a nanny for almost 10 years I have tried them all.\nThis one is really great.\nI actually took a friends word on it and went with this Champ when registering and I am glad I did.\nI just knew all along what products I would not use, but was undecided on the actual one I wanted.\nWell the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!\nWe just bought another for baby boy number two coming next month.\nThe thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!\nWe just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.\nWe just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!\nWe lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.\nWould reccommend to anyone and everyone!!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":143,"mention":"word","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Word_Bible_Software"],"startOffset":139}]}
