{"text":"great product with Limited Services\nI was quite happy after months of saving part of my pay-check to go to the store and finally get an iPod.\nIt was worth it, as I use it to this very day.\nThe thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.\nApple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.\nHowever, it fell into one of Apple's worst reputations.\nIt is very closed to services and programs outside of Apple's small (though luxiourious, admittedly) island.\nHowever, they close you off from exploring the continent that is other music providers.\nAfter hearing about the new Napster service for portable MP3 players, I was anxious to try it out.\nThis type of service is one that Microsoft is touting...  one where you pay a flat rate per month for unlimited music downloads.\nSo it was not any surprise that I could not try out this new type of service.\nApple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services.\nThis has been the case with all other competing music services and Napster.\nWhy would they let anything compete with them when they are making millions from song downloads by iPod owners who have no other choice?\nIf Apple makes no attempt to at least create an equivalent type of service, they are failing to compete with the market.\nAnd if they treat their customers like herding sheep, I see little reason to purchase another MP3 player with a bitten apple embroidered on it.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":252,"mention":"damage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damage_Incorporated"],"startOffset":246},{"endOffset":252,"mention":"damage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damage_Incorporated"],"startOffset":246},{"endOffset":292,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":287},{"endOffset":292,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":287},{"endOffset":292,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":287},{"endOffset":674,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":669},{"endOffset":721,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":714},{"endOffset":742,"mention":"portable","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Macintosh_Portable"],"startOffset":734},{"endOffset":746,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":743},{"endOffset":902,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":897},{"endOffset":902,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":897},{"endOffset":997,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":992},{"endOffset":1079,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":1072},{"endOffset":1195,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1190},{"endOffset":1216,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":1209},{"endOffset":1363,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":1358},{"endOffset":1573,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":1570},{"endOffset":1580,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1574},{"endOffset":1600,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":1595},{"endOffset":1600,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":1595}]}
