{"text":"I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.\nIt's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.\nYou hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.\nSame with the contacts list, recent call list and everything else.\nSecondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.\nThe number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.\nThe plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.\nThe camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.\nAll in all I would say wait for the cell phone companies to create a PDA\/cell hybrid that is efficient and easy to use as a phone.\n","annotations":[]}
