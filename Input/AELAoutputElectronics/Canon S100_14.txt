{"text":"I have used this camera for about 3 weeks so far, taking over 500 pictures.\nI have 2 batteries and a 128 mb card.\nHere are some useful facts:-\nOn a battery charge, the camera takes approximately 70 pictures, where the camera is opened and closed between pictures.\nA 64mb card stores approximately 100 pictures at default resolution (ie between 500k and 1.5mb per picture).\nThe viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.\nThe LCD should be used.\nHowever, in dark settings you must use the viewfinder.\nThe digital zoom is crap.\nTurn it off.\nIt fits in your pocket.\nThe closest competitor is the SONY DSC-P1 (3.3mp).\nBut that camera is a little larger and you defeat the whole purpose of having a truly portable camera.\nI take my camera everywhere.\nTamrac makes a tiny pouch that is best for the camera.\nThe front even has a zipper for an extra battery and your wallet stuff.\nThe panorama setting is unbelieveable !\nYou take around 12 pictures in a circle, stitch them together and voila; you have a perfect memory of where you were standing !\nThe pictures are a little dark sometimes.\nYou have the option to have the flash automatic or off.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":730,"mention":"portable","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Portable_Personal_Computer"],"startOffset":722},{"endOffset":893,"mention":"stuff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/StuffIt"],"startOffset":888},{"endOffset":907,"mention":"panorama","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Panorama_Tools"],"startOffset":899},{"endOffset":907,"mention":"panorama","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Panorama_Tools"],"startOffset":899},{"endOffset":907,"mention":"panorama","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Panorama_Tools"],"startOffset":899},{"endOffset":1142,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1137},{"endOffset":1142,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1137},{"endOffset":1142,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1137}]}
