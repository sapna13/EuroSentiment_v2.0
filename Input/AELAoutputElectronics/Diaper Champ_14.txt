{"text":"For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.\nI would not recommend buying that one.\nMy second child I didn't get any.\nNow for our third child I saw the Diaper Champ and figured why not register for it and try it out.\nI have to say that I am very happy with it so far.\nI did dump a little deoderizer tablet in it.\nI am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.\nIt's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.\nI haven't noticed any seepage of smells.\n","annotations":[]}
