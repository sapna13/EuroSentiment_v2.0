{"text":"the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .\nthose who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .\nthe price is way below an ipod of the same size .\nthe nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .\nthe sound quality is very good .\nthe controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .\nbecause of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .\nfor most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .\nhaving access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .\nthey fall in love with the product .\nand then it breaks .\nusually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .\ntypically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .\nthe nomad is sent back to creative labs .\nthey decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .\nin my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .\nlike many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .\nif my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .\ni 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .\nthe headphone jack seems to be a major problem .\nthe one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .\nthe headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .\neven if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .\nand most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .\nthis means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .\nso when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .\nyou will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .\nyou will have a very expensive paperweight .\nthere are not a lot of good options out there .\nmost people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .\nmy suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .\nmaybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .\nmaybe more competitors will bring out similar products .\nand maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .\nwhatever you do , do n't buy this product .\nyou will be sorry if you do .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":206,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":201},{"endOffset":312,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":307},{"endOffset":312,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":307},{"endOffset":312,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":307},{"endOffset":312,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":307},{"endOffset":312,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":307},{"endOffset":569,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":564},{"endOffset":569,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":564},{"endOffset":603,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":600},{"endOffset":603,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":600},{"endOffset":687,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":682},{"endOffset":714,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":708},{"endOffset":731,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":726},{"endOffset":731,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":726},{"endOffset":921,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":917},{"endOffset":966,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":961},{"endOffset":966,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":961},{"endOffset":966,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":961},{"endOffset":966,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":961},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"damage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damage_Incorporated"],"startOffset":1050},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"damage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damage_Incorporated"],"startOffset":1050},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"damage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damage_Incorporated"],"startOffset":1050},{"endOffset":1056,"mention":"damage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Damage_Incorporated"],"startOffset":1050},{"endOffset":1663,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":1659},{"endOffset":1663,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":1659},{"endOffset":1663,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":1659},{"endOffset":1746,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1741},{"endOffset":1746,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1741},{"endOffset":1806,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":1800},{"endOffset":1878,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":1874},{"endOffset":1878,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":1874},{"endOffset":1878,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":1874},{"endOffset":2188,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2183},{"endOffset":2188,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2183},{"endOffset":2188,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2183},{"endOffset":2188,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2183},{"endOffset":2223,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2218},{"endOffset":2223,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2218},{"endOffset":2375,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2370},{"endOffset":2435,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":2430},{"endOffset":2435,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":2430}]}
