{"text":"Have had the Nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with T-Mobile.\nIt offers way more features than I need but the ones I use work well.\nI almost always get a good strong signal, even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest.\nThe sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn't be easier to use.\nI like the size and shape.\nIt fits comfortably in my hand and pocket.\nThe only problem is the size of the keys.\nMy fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones.\nThey really are awfully small.\nAlso the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.\nIt also works just fine for international calls.\nIt's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in Europe are quite reasonable.\nIt's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch.\nI've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.\nTheir customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.\nI never get dropped calls.\nIt seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.\nI recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":23,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":227,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":221},{"endOffset":227,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":221},{"endOffset":523,"mention":"key","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KeY"],"startOffset":520},{"endOffset":523,"mention":"key","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KeY"],"startOffset":520},{"endOffset":938,"mention":"scratch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Scratch:_The_Ultimate_DJ"],"startOffset":931},{"endOffset":1215,"mention":"Quest","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Quest_64"],"startOffset":1210},{"endOffset":1265,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":1255}]}
