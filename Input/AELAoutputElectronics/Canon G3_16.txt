{"text":"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .\nit was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .\nsure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .\ni do n't think i was asking too much .\nany film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .\nand with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .\ni found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .\ni wanted it to shoot concerts as well .\nthat meant even less light and just as much action .\nsure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .\nthe grain was terrible .\nnext time i set it at 100 and used the flash .\nwell flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .\nwhen i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .\nthe camera was a marvel .\ngetting the printer to help output them was another tale .\noverall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .\nfor simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .\nyou do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .\nthen again a one time use camera may do just as well .\nif you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .\nit is versatile and seems to be one of the best .\nme , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .\nsure .\nit is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":584,"mention":"dust","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dust:_A_Tale_of_the_Wired_West"],"startOffset":580},{"endOffset":791,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":786},{"endOffset":804,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":799},{"endOffset":804,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":799},{"endOffset":804,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":799},{"endOffset":804,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":799},{"endOffset":804,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":799},{"endOffset":1341,"mention":"desire","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Desire"],"startOffset":1335}]}
