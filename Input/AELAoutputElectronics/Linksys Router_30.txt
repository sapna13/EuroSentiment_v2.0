{"text":"This concept seems to be unusual.\nCisco (let's be honest they own Linksys) has lowered the memory and processing power of the newer versions of this device.\nThey've gone from 16 MB of RAM in version 4 to 8 MB of RAM in version 5.\nThey also lowered flash memory from 4 to 2 MB at the same time.\nInterestingly, they upgraded from 200 MHz to 216 MHz processors from version 3.0 to 3.1 and then throttled back to 200 MHz at version 4.0.\nThere may be many theories as to why they've done this, but a logical argument is that with a faster processor and more memory, they Linksys device may compete a little to close to the Enterprise-Class Cisco devices.\nSomeone in Cisco should post a review here letting us know why this was done.\nIf it was a software comaptiblity issue or a component availability issue, explain it to us so we don't have to theorize on the motives.\nIn the mean time, I'll buy a different ro!\nuter like the Buffalo WZR-RS-G54 with 64 megabytes of RAM and 8 MB flash (plus an amazing built-in PPTP VPN server that supports client-to-LAN as well as LAN-to-LAN connections).\nMaybe you could consider the used WRT54G version 3.1 if you can find it?\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":187,"mention":"RAM","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile"],"startOffset":184},{"endOffset":215,"mention":"RAM","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile"],"startOffset":212},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":248},{"endOffset":929,"mention":"Buffalo","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Buffalo_network-attached_storage_series"],"startOffset":922},{"endOffset":965,"mention":"RAM","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile"],"startOffset":962},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":975},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":975}]}
