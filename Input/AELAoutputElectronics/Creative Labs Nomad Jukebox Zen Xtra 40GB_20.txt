{"text":"i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .\nmy brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..\njust before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .\nthe ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .\nso i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .\nthe setup and transfer process was cake for me .\ni just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .\ni did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .\nthe explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .\nit 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .\nthat 's probably a bad thing .\nthe unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .\nit was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .\nnow that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .\nthe screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .\ni have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .\nthe eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .\nthe little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .\nthe dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .\nall in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .\ni 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .\nhighly recommended
