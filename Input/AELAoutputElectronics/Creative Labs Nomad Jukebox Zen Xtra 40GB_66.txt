{"text":"i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .\nin a quick summation , here is what i found .\n+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .\ni had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !\nit may have taken several years to fill this up .\n+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit\n+ screen was good , easy to read\n+ \/ - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .\n- the software that came with it was tough to load .\ni got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .\n- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .\nnot good if you 're taking this traveling .\nthe top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )\n- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well\n- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .\ni was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .\n- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":196,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":192},{"endOffset":301,"mention":"musicmatch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":291},{"endOffset":301,"mention":"musicmatch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":291},{"endOffset":382,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":382,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":382,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":382,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":382,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":382,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":783,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":778},{"endOffset":859,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":856},{"endOffset":859,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":856},{"endOffset":859,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":856},{"endOffset":859,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":856},{"endOffset":859,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":856}]}
