{"text":"This router is 1 of 4 in my shop.\nIt is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.\nI have added the router raizer kit(simple installation) to it and cannot live without this setup!\nThis router has soft start and runs smooth and true.\nI use the router with a 3 1\/2in raised panel bit with no problems.\nIt has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.\nFor the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.\nYou just can't go wrong with this one!\nEnjoy.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":476,"mention":"blowout","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BlowOut"],"startOffset":469}]}
