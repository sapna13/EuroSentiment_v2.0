{"text":"This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.\nThe iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.\nThe karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.\nThe karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.\nIn fact, it's much better than the iPod in that regard.\nThe karma also has a very long battery life.\nHaving owned both the karma and other Creative Lab products (including Zen) I would have to say the Karma also sounds better.\nNo comparison in my opinion.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":81,"mention":"iPod mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Mini"],"startOffset":72},{"endOffset":158,"mention":"Rio Karma","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rio_Karma"],"startOffset":149},{"endOffset":279,"mention":"ogg","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ogg"],"startOffset":276},{"endOffset":536,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":533}]}
