{"text":"I have 6 routers, but have owned about 10 over the years.\nIf one fails or simply doesn't perform I know I'll let it sit on the shelf so I either sell it or give it away.\nThe ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.\nI recently had to run a 3\/4\" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.\nI could take 1\/2\" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.\nAs much as I like my other routers, I know their limitations because I've pushed them all to them.\nI've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.\nBottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.\nI've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.\nIt is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":398,"mention":"maple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MapleStory"],"startOffset":393},{"endOffset":398,"mention":"maple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MapleStory"],"startOffset":393},{"endOffset":531,"mention":"beat","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Jet_Set_Radio"],"startOffset":527},{"endOffset":815,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":811},{"endOffset":815,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":811},{"endOffset":815,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":811}]}
