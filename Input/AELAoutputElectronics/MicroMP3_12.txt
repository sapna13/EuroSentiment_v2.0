{"text":"I first signed up for Napster on line.\nLoved the service so much I decided to buy an MP3 player and upgrade from the basic Napster to Napster To Go.\nThey have a list of compatible players which I miss read.\nSo my first MP3 player purchase was incorrect.\nTo transfer songs requires you to pay 99 cents.\nThe player I first purchased was the Creative Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40 GB MP3 Player.\nThis player is not compatible with Napster To Go.\nThe player was large and bulky.\nThe buttons are located on the sides making it difficult to use.\nThe plus was the storage size but I didn't like hearing the hard drive spin.\nI also hated the packaging, with a passion.\nIt was one of those plastic glued containers that can take you thirty minutes to open.\nAccessories were cheap looking.\nThe player was not very appealing either.\nAll this before I found out the bad news.\nFinally I upgraded the firmware and log in to Napster.\nUpon logging in I received a notification that my player works with Napster but not Napster To Go.\nIt was time to exchange it for the other player the Creative Zen Micro 5 GB MP3 Player Black.\nIts a few bucks more and has only 5 GB's of storage but its well worth the trade off.\nThis is Creative's attempt to compete with the IPod mini.\nTo bad Napster software is not compatible with Apple IPod's.\nIts my first purchase choice.\nActually only three players are on the list for Napster To Go.\nDon't worry this player rocks.\nIt was also the most appealing.\nImmediately you could tell a very distinct difference between the two Creative MP3 players.\nFor the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.\nI keep boxes for all my equipment for storage and moving.\nIt has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.\nYou will find a small folder\/envelope on top along with the player.\nAccessories are in reusable bags unlike the Nomad which requires you to tear each back plastic store bag open.\nA distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.\nIt has Apple insipid written all over it.\nI do give create to Creative for their attractive design.\nCreative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices.\nCreative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.\nIt makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.\nEverything shines of quality.\nI was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.\nFirst I removed each piece and laid them out on my coffee table.\nI am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC\/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.\nNext I wanted to update the software, after a quick firmware upgrade the player was ready to go.\nI sync the player with Napster software and it downloaded the library I had already created.\nMy PC only supports USB 1.0 not the 2.0 which is blazing fast.\nSo the download was much slower.\nThe interface works great.\nI enjoy getting use to the touch pad.\nIn minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.\nWhat impressed me most was the sound.\nAt 128 the songs sound very good.\nMy hobby is home audio and home theater.\nThe Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.\nThe Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.\nCreative says that the software engine for this MP3 is the best hands down.\nI believe them.\nOverall this play is my introduction into the market.\nThe Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.\nIf you're an itunes person then no one could argue against an IPod.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":29,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":22},{"endOffset":37,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":33},{"endOffset":88,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":85},{"endOffset":95,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":89},{"endOffset":122,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BASIC"],"startOffset":117},{"endOffset":130,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":123},{"endOffset":141,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":134},{"endOffset":141,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":134},{"endOffset":141,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":134},{"endOffset":222,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":219},{"endOffset":229,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":223},{"endOffset":222,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":219},{"endOffset":229,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":223},{"endOffset":222,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":219},{"endOffset":229,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":223},{"endOffset":353,"mention":"Nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":348},{"endOffset":361,"mention":"Jukebox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":354},{"endOffset":365,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Bound"],"startOffset":362},{"endOffset":380,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":377},{"endOffset":387,"mention":"Player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":381},{"endOffset":400,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":394},{"endOffset":400,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":394},{"endOffset":400,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":394},{"endOffset":400,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":394},{"endOffset":431,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":424},{"endOffset":431,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":424},{"endOffset":431,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":424},{"endOffset":449,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":443},{"endOffset":449,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":443},{"endOffset":449,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":443},{"endOffset":449,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":443},{"endOffset":449,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":443},{"endOffset":786,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":786,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":786,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":786,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":786,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":786,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":913,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":906},{"endOffset":971,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":965},{"endOffset":971,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":965},{"endOffset":990,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":983},{"endOffset":990,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":983},{"endOffset":1006,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":999},{"endOffset":1006,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":999},{"endOffset":1006,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resou
