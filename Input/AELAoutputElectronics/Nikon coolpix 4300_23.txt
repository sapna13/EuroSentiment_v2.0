{"text":"first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .\nfor three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .\nand i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .\ni have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .\nthe daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .\nthe shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .\nuploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .\nthe only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .\nright now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .\n2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .\ni got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .\nan extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .\n3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .\ni 'll still use my photosuite for editing .\none more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .\njust for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .\nin summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .\n- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .\ni 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .\ni bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .\ni do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .\ni also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .\nthis provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .\ni leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .\nthis also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .\nthe downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":761,"mention":"frame","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_FrameMaker"],"startOffset":756},{"endOffset":906,"mention":"frame","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_FrameMaker"],"startOffset":901},{"endOffset":906,"mention":"frame","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_FrameMaker"],"startOffset":901},{"endOffset":906,"mention":"frame","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_FrameMaker"],"startOffset":901},{"endOffset":1020,"mention":"windows-based","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1007},{"endOffset":1020,"mention":"windows-based","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1007},{"endOffset":1020,"mention":"windows-based","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1007},{"endOffset":1020,"mention":"windows-based","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1007},{"endOffset":1020,"mention":"windows-based","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1007},{"endOffset":1020,"mention":"windows-based","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1007},{"endOffset":1984,"mention":"door","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Door_Door"],"startOffset":1980},{"endOffset":1984,"mention":"door","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Door_Door"],"startOffset":1980},{"endOffset":2351,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":2346},{"endOffset":2430,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":2425},{"endOffset":2541,"mention":"filter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Filter"],"startOffset":2535},{"endOffset":2541,"mention":"filter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Filter"],"startOffset":2535},{"endOffset":2664,"mention":"filter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Filter"],"startOffset":2658}]}
