{"text":"The controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use.\nI would recommend spending a little money and this will be the perfect digital camera.\nI added a second battery (about $69, recharges in about two hours) and a large (192Mb for less than $400) CF module.\nNow I can take over 300 1600 x 1280 shots (or for the webshot fanatic, 1,141 pictures at 640 x 480).\nThe optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom.\nThis is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory, for example.\nWhile this might seem pricy, I have been spending $27 for 25 APS images, with prints and a CD, so this camera will pay for itself in a year.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":127,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":122},{"endOffset":613,"mention":"APS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/American_Phytopathological_Society"],"startOffset":610},{"endOffset":613,"mention":"APS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/American_Phytopathological_Society"],"startOffset":610}]}
