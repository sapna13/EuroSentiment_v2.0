{"text":"i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .\ni have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .\nthe g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .\nflaws ?\nthe lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .\nstill i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .\ndespite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .\n","annotations":[]}
