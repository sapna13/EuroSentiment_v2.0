{"text":"I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.\nI can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.\nAnother great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.\nThis way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.\nThe only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.\nOther than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":328,"mention":"carrier","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Carrier_Command"],"startOffset":321}]}
