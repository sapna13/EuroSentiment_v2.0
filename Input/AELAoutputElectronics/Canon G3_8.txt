{"text":"i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !\nit gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .\ni began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .\nabsolutely breathtaking .\ni was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .\nthe olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .\ni would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .\ni bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":350,"mention":"chrome","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/XUL"],"startOffset":344},{"endOffset":547,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":540},{"endOffset":547,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":540},{"endOffset":547,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":540},{"endOffset":547,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":540},{"endOffset":547,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":540},{"endOffset":547,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":540},{"endOffset":676,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":669}]}
