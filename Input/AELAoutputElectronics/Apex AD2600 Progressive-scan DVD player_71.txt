{"text":"what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .\nin the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .\nand have returned both .\nthe ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .\nmy recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .\ni hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .\nit really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .\namazon is awaesome !\nthey refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .\nwhat more could you ask for .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":85,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":79},{"endOffset":85,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":79},{"endOffset":142,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":134},{"endOffset":221,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":215},{"endOffset":221,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":215},{"endOffset":221,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":215},{"endOffset":809,"mention":"season","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Sims_2:_Seasons"],"startOffset":803}]}
