{"text":"nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .\nwith all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .\nthe one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .\none of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a \" worldphone \" and can be used in europe , etc.\nyet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .\nthe internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .\ntherefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .\nafter spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .\nbottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .\nfind another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":5,"mention":"nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":277,"mention":"nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":272},{"endOffset":277,"mention":"nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":272},{"endOffset":1087,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":1083},{"endOffset":1087,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":1083}]}
