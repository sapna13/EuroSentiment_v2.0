{"text":"If you are like me who wants move to the next phase of portable audio from conventional portable CD players I hope you find this usefull.\nSpace : 5GB =2500 songs.\nIf you have a huge CD collection, 5GB can hold only a part of your CD collection.\nRemember mp3 format lets you store tons of songs.\nI have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.\nUser Interface: The software is simple and straight forward.\nHavent read the manual till now (remember I am good time computer user).\nPC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all.\nThe scrol bar agian takes some getting used to.\nYou can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).\nBattery : A Big Big plus.\nMost of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery.\nZen micro does.\nI have two spare batteries (brought on ebay for 28 bucks each).\nRemember this is a huge plus when travelling.\nEach battery lasts about 10-11 hours.\nIf one battery drains just snap the spare one and you are back in bussiness.\nAnother good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.\nFM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing.\nDont have to switch to another device for FM tuner.\nSince zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works.\nBuiltin microphone is great for recording short voice notes.\nI have heard in other players these have to be brought separately.\nSound: This is where I love Zen the most.\nExcellent sound I mean the player has juice.\nI dont use the headphones that come with it instead I use Bose Triport headphones.\nThe player has great potential (ur experiance may differ based on your headphones).\nThe bass treble the sound detail is awsome.\nI compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.\nLooks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool.\nIts compact and has rounded edges.\nFits well in hand in trouser pockets.\nFreebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful.\nI dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).\nInstead I use a cellphone cover with a belt clip and it works just fine.\nYou get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.\nWhat I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design.\nCreative has not lounched any silicon cover for the player like ipod's (I think belkin makes it for ipod).\nStuff you may need to buy: Wired remote from creative.\nThis is a must have.\nSpare batteries incase  you need some extra hours without charging.\nFM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod.\nTested with the same mp3 for benchmarking\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":33,"mention":"move","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/PlayStation_Move"],"startOffset":29},{"endOffset":63,"mention":"portable","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Portable_Personal_Computer"],"startOffset":55},{"endOffset":257,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":254},{"endOffset":257,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":254},{"endOffset":321,"mention":"CDs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":318},{"endOffset":321,"mention":"CDs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":318},{"endOffset":321,"mention":"CDs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":318},{"endOffset":321,"mention":"CDs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":318},{"endOffset":533,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":527},{"endOffset":533,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":527},{"endOffset":533,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":527},{"endOffset":533,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":527},{"endOffset":533,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":527},{"endOffset":561,"mention":"Tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":556},{"endOffset":599,"mention":"bar","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/M1918_Browning_Automatic_Rifle"],"startOffset":596},{"endOffset":656,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":650},{"endOffset":656,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":650},{"endOffset":815,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":812},{"endOffset":815,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":812},{"endOffset":1138,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1132},{"endOffset":1229,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1223},{"endOffset":1306,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1303},{"endOffset":1306,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1303},{"endOffset":1306,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1303},{"endOffset":1456,"mention":"notes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Lotus_Notes"],"startOffset":1451},{"endOffset":1600,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1594},{"endOffset":1705,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1699},{"endOffset":1932,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":1929},{"endOffset":1971,"mention":"black","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Twisted_Metal:_Black"],"startOffset":1966},{"endOffset":2040,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"],"startOffset":2036},{"endOffset":2040,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"],"startOffset":2036},{"endOffset":2040,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"],"startOffset":2036},{"endOffset":2040,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"],"startOffset":2036},{"endOffset":2290,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2284},{"endOffset":2290,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2284},{"endOffset":2617,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2611},{"endOffset":2705,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":2699},{"endOffset":2859,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":2856},{"endOffset":3032,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":3029},{"endOffset":3032,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":3029}]}
