{"text":"Don't listen to the bad reviews!\nThis is really a nice diaper pail.\nI recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.\nIn fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.\nOriginally with my son we had a Diaper Genie.\nWow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.\nI bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.\n1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!\nWe just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.\nWe don't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail!\n2.  It can be operated with one hand - Leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table.\nSo much safer than the others that require a two handed operation!\nWith them, you have to put your baby on the floor or someplace else safe just to put the diaper in the pail.\nThe Diaper Champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle.\nHe thinks it is magic when the diaper \"disappears\".\n3.  Bags are easy to change.\nPop the lid, fold it back on its hinge, pull the trash bag through the ring, and take out the dirty diapers.\nTo replace the bag simply open it up and feed the top of the bag through ring, fold it over the sides of the ring, and close.\nIt takes all of 2 minutes, if that.  4.\nIt keeps smells out of your nursery or toddler room!\nYes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.\nRemember, it does hold dirty diapers!\nTo eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.\nNow when you flip the handle you get the Stick Up smell instead.\nWorks great!!!!\n5.  The price is right.\nAt $30 we put one in the nursery and one in our toddler's room.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":244,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":240},{"endOffset":290,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AIR-2_Genie"],"startOffset":285},{"endOffset":1352,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":1349},{"endOffset":1516,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":1512},{"endOffset":1694,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":1690},{"endOffset":1792,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1787},{"endOffset":1792,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1787},{"endOffset":1792,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1787},{"endOffset":1792,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1787},{"endOffset":1792,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1787},{"endOffset":1792,"mention":"Works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Works"],"startOffset":1787},{"endOffset":1889,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":1885}]}
