{"text":"bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .\ni still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .\ni 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .\ni 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .\nboth are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .\nbesides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .\nripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .\npeople also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .\nit 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .\nthe sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .\nyou of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .\ni just put it on \" shuffle \" , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !\nthe only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality \/ longevity of the buttons on the thing .\nmy \" fast forward \" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .\nnot an urgent issue , as it still works .. .\nall other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .\ni 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .\nbut i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .\nwe 'll see if i need them to .\nsure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .\nthis is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .\nit still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .\ni use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .\nyes .\nget better headphones .\nrip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .\nbottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .\ni got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )\nbasic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .\ni got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":316,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":311},{"endOffset":316,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":311},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":570,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":565},{"endOffset":926,"mention":"stuff","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/StuffIt"],"startOffset":921},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":1040,"mention":"advantage","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Super_Advantage"],"startOffset":1031},{"endOffset":1263,"mention":"shuffle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Shuffle"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":1263,"mention":"shuffle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Shuffle"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":1263,"mention":"shuffle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Shuffle"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":1263,"mention":"shuffle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Shuffle"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":1263,"mention":"shuffle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Shuffle"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":1263,"mention":"shuffle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Shuffle"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":1263,"mention":"shuffle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Shuffle"],"startOffset":1256},{"endOffset":1329,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1324},{"endOffset":1329,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1324},{"endOffset":2007,"mention":"palm","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Palm_OS"],"startOffset":2003},{"endOffset":2069,"mention":"office","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office"],"startOffset":2063},{"endOffset":2069,"mention":"office","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office"],"startOffset":2063},{"endOffset":2219,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":2214},{"endOffset":2305,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":2300},{"endOffset":2305,"mention":"tunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":2300},{"endOffset":2332,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":2328},{"endOffset":2500,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BASIC"],"startOffset":2495}]}
