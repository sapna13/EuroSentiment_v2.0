{"text":"this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .\nbeats that sony f717 ; its archrival .\ni 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;\ni can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .\nplease go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .\nmy story is based on personal usage .\nyes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .\nmoving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .\nthe distortion is not a flaw .\nas with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .\ni 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .\nin terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !\nthe pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .\nin terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .\nbased on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .\ni also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .\nthe compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .\nanyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .\nit 's a winner .\ni 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .\nmy only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .\nthey got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .\nthat 's what i did and hopes this helps .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":517,"mention":"harm","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AGM-88_HARM"],"startOffset":513},{"endOffset":517,"mention":"harm","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AGM-88_HARM"],"startOffset":513},{"endOffset":562,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":556},{"endOffset":562,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":556},{"endOffset":562,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":556},{"endOffset":1643,"mention":"viking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BvS_10"],"startOffset":1637},{"endOffset":1657,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1652},{"endOffset":1711,"mention":"max","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne"],"startOffset":1708},{"endOffset":1952,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1947},{"endOffset":1952,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1947},{"endOffset":1952,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1947},{"endOffset":2240,"mention":"wind","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MSI_Wind_PC"],"startOffset":2236},{"endOffset":2445,"mention":"filter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Filter"],"startOffset":2439}]}
