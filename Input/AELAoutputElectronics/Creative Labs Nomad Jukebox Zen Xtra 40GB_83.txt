{"text":"alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .\nwell to say , i had a very bad history with players .\none broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .\nif you are planning to buy that player , do not !\nthat player is a complete piece of sh ***.\ni returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .\nnow getting back to this .\ni ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .\nnow as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .\ncons :\n1 .\nthe display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly\n2 .\nhuge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .\n( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .\nand those songs mostly are 320 kbps.\n3 .\nthe sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .\n4 .\nwith eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .\n5 .\nif you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .\nyou can also search for your song , which is good .\n6 .\ni dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .\nyou can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .\nand i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .\n7 .\nbattery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .\n8 .\nwhen you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .\n9 .\nyou can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .\nyou can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of \" now playing \" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .\nthere is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .\nthere is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .\n10 .\nthe player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .\n11 .\nthe music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .\ncons :\n1 .\nthe one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .\nthe product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .\n5 hours max. i did it like this\neax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours\n2 .\nthe panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .\n3 .\nyou need the software to actually transfer files\n4 .\nthe player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .\nalso , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .\n( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )\nwell thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt
