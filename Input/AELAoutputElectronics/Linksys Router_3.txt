{"text":"For an item that is not even available in Best Buy and the other major stores when I went to buy it, the fact that ... has these in and out of stock, and that I received it in only a couple of days is knowledge enough to make this a winning situation.\nWhat about hookup and use?\nAnother 5 star performance.\nHaving never hooked up a wireless network before, I took the advice of the quick start guide that came with the unit, and used their included CD.\nThey strongly recommended that you use the CD rather than manually configure, and they were right.\nHaving seen the problems that some others were having with setup, only to be resolved (some of them) by exactly following the directions, I decided to do it that way right out of the box.\nI'm glad I did.\nThis setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time.\nShutting off what they t!\nell you to shut off, and turning on what and when they tell you to turn things on, resulted in a delightful install.\nNot even one glitch.\nThe CD determined my internet connection, determined my system configuration, asked me a few questions, and bingo I was up and running.\nI bought the PC Card for laptops as well, and that was just as easy to install.\nWithin 10 minutes I was surfing the web from all over the house.\nNo Wires !\nPertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room.\nWhen I went into the living room, it went to very good instead of excellent, and gave me 37Mbps.\nLet's get a perspective here.\nA standard modem works at 56K tops.\nThis router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte.\nTheir are 1000 kilobytes in every megabyte.\nSo 54 Megabytes per second is about a thousand times faster than a standard modem.\nI hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!\nnd, and 100 to 150 upload speed.\nI know I am getting specific, but the point I am making is that it does not matter what the connection speed you are running at any given moment, based on how close the base unit is to the PC card.\nWhat is important is that your internet connection will never even approach the speed capabilities of this router, so don't hassle yourself with any concerns over varying connect speeds of the wireless network.\nBroadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies.\nAs soon as you click on a site, it appears on the screen.\nAnyhow, just for reference, I am using a Dell Inspiron Notebook, hooked up to the broadband cable modem that was supplied by Comcast.\nThe operating system is Windows XP.\nInstallation was as near automatic as can be.\nThey do supply instructions when using Windows ME, 98 etc, that includes one more step than XP.\nAll in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment.\nFollow the directions exactly.\nIt is easy.\nHope this helps.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":293,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":289},{"endOffset":841,"mention":"door","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Door_Door"],"startOffset":837},{"endOffset":1024,"mention":"glitch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metal_Arms:_Glitch_in_the_System"],"startOffset":1018},{"endOffset":1389,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":1385},{"endOffset":1423,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":1419},{"endOffset":1528,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":1520},{"endOffset":1540,"mention":"works","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/AppleWorks"],"startOffset":1535},{"endOffset":1731,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":1723},{"endOffset":2053,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2047},{"endOffset":2053,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2047},{"endOffset":2053,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":2047},{"endOffset":2424,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":2418},{"endOffset":2591,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":2584},{"endOffset":2620,"mention":"near","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NearGlobal"],"startOffset":2616},{"endOffset":2620,"mention":"near","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NearGlobal"],"startOffset":2616},{"endOffset":2620,"mention":"near","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NearGlobal"],"startOffset":2616},{"endOffset":2688,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":2681},{"endOffset":2765,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":2761}]}
