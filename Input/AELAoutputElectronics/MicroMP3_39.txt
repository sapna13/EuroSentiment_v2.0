{"text":"if not amazed, I won't go into the kind of detail many people have here, but I do want to say a few things about my experience so far (I've had it about two weeks) with the Zen Micro;\nthese are the things I was curious about when I was shopping around.\nOn the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.\nThe sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.\nThe device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.\nNo offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.\nNow the downside:  One of the features that factored into my choice of a Micro!\ninstead of an iPod (I know this is a tediously recurring theme in these reviews, but I want to get my two cents in) was the FM radio.\nI like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.\nImagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.\nIt seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.\nThe battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.\nHere's a quote from Creative's web site (hoping to sell additional batteries):   \"Carry an extra rechargeable battery for your Zen Micro for an additional 12 hours of nonstop music.\"\nTry an additional *six* hours, methinks.\nStill, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.\nHave not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.\nAs I said, I don't regret the purchase at all.\nTo use a bas!\neball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.\nRespectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":176,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":173},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1392,"mention":"tower","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SimTower"],"startOffset":1387},{"endOffset":1640,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":1637},{"endOffset":1690,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1685},{"endOffset":1690,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1685},{"endOffset":1956,"mention":"bas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BASIC"],"startOffset":1953},{"endOffset":2036,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":2033},{"endOffset":2036,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":2033},{"endOffset":2036,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":2033}]}
