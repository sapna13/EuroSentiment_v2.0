{"text":"i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .\ni received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .\nthat is where my satisfaction ends .\ni bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .\nhowever , it has failed to deliver on quality .\nit does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .\non several different occasions it has displayed \" no disc \" with a disc inside .\nafter reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .\ni read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .\ni am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .\ni guess you get what you pay for .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":280,"mention":"bang","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bang_Attack"],"startOffset":276},{"endOffset":440,"mention":"movies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":434}]}
