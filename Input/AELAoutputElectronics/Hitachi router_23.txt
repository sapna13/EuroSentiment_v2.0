{"text":"I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.\nI also have the very popular Bosch 1617EVSPK kit and had planned to use it on my cabinets, routing dados for shelves.\nUnfortunately, the Bosch fixed base has no flat edge to ride against a guide, and both bases have a sub-base that extends past the metal base to prevent using against any kind of guide.\nThe Hitachi, on the other hand has a beautiful large flat edge to run against a guide, and the sub-base is recessed so as not to interfere.\nThe power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.\nThe edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.\nThe only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.\nI do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":141,"mention":"kit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTML-Kit"],"startOffset":138},{"endOffset":141,"mention":"kit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTML-Kit"],"startOffset":138},{"endOffset":141,"mention":"kit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTML-Kit"],"startOffset":138},{"endOffset":141,"mention":"kit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTML-Kit"],"startOffset":138},{"endOffset":141,"mention":"kit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTML-Kit"],"startOffset":138}]}
