{"text":"i received this as a gift .\ni had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .\nhowever , the creative software is not real intuitive .\nthe software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .\nif you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .\nyou are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .\ntransfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .\nit is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .\ni must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .\ni love the storage in this thing .\ni have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .\ni doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .\nthis is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .\nnow my dissapointments .\nthe description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .\nthe warranty is 90 days .\nthis is ridiculous .\nto me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .\nbuy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .\nthe scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .\nseems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .\nthe interface used could be better designed .\nit is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .\ni am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .\nand the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .\nit is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .\nthe screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .\nthe cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .\nthere are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .\ndespite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .\nhowever the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .\ni have had it lock up after a transfer of music .\nthe files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .\nalso have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .\nleft it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .\ncould not stop it , could not get out of the \" now playing \" screen .\nagain had to remove the battery .\nthere have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .\nquite simply , the firmware and \/ or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .\nthere have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the \" now playing \" screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .\ni have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .\nnow i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .\ni would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .\nand we all know about the rush to market on new products .\ni have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .\nwhile i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .\ni know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year \" no questions asked \" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":25,"mention":"gift","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GiFT"],"startOffset":21},{"endOffset":459,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":453},{"endOffset":510,"mention":"2.0","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tron_2.0"],"startOffset":507},{"endOffset":964,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":961},{"endOffset":1812,"mention":"hell","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hell:_A_Cyberpunk_Thriller"],"startOffset":1808},{"endOffset":1812,"mention":"hell","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hell:_A_Cyberpunk_Thriller"],"startOffset":1808},{"endOffset":1812,"mention":"hell","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hell:_A_Cyberpunk_Thriller"],"startOffset":1808},{"endOffset":1812,"mention":"hell","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hell:_A_Cyberpunk_Thriller"],"startOffset":1808},{"endOffset":1812,"mention":"hell","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hell:_A_Cyberpunk_Thriller"],"startOffset":1808},{"endOffset":1812,"mention":"hell","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hell:_A_Cyberpunk_Thriller"],"startOffset":1808},{"endOffset":2012,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":2006},{"endOffset":2012,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":2006},{"endOffset":2012,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":2006},{"endOffset":2012,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":2006},{"endOffset":2012,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":2006},{"endOffset":2012,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":2006},{"endOffset":2647,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2642},{"endOffset":2705,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2699},{"endOffset":2705,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2699},{"endOffset":3048,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":3042},{"endOffset":3419,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":3413},{"endOffset":3547,"mention":"operator","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Operator_YAPO"],"startOffset":3539},{"endOffset":3586,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":3583},{"endOffset":3666,"mention":"gift","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GiFT"],"startOffset":3662},{"endOffset":3666,"mention":"gift","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GiFT"],"startOffset":3662},{"endOffset":3666,"mention":"gift","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GiFT"],"startOffset":3662},{"endOffset":3833,"mention":"rush","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/L.A._Rush"],"startOffset":3829},{"endOffset":3884,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":3878},{"endOffset":3937,"mention":"exchange","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Exchange_Server"],"startOffset":3929}]}
