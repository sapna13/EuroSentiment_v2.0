{"text":"this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .\nzen good points :\n1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .\n2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .\nthe zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .\nflaws :\n1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?\nmediasource did not recognize my tags !\nmy choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .\ni do n't think so .\nbtw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .\n2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .\nafter about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .\nwhen i turned eax off the static disappeared .\nwhen i turned eax back on the static was also not present .\ncreative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .\nis eax faulty ?\nis my unit defective ?\nwas i just unlucky at that moment ?\nwas it a full moon that night ?\ni have n't figured it out yet .\n3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .\ndo not underestimate this in your purchase decision .\nmany reviewers refer to it as \" clunky \" or \" difficult \" - heed their warnings .\nsome amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;\ni did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .\n4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .\nin other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .\nmy goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .\n5 . the zen does not have a stop button !\nyou can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the \" next track \" or \" previous track \" button .\nbut this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .\nto discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .\n6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .\nif you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .\n7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .\nit referred to a \" microsoft jet database engine \" error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;\ni did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .\ncreative provided e-mail support ;\ni followed their advice but that failed , too .\ni experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .\nso it is probably \" just bad luck \" on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .\nhowever , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .\nthird party software to the rescue\nafter much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .\ni am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .\nthis provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .\nm3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !\nnotmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...\nconclusion :\nif i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .\ngiven that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .\nand i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...\nto summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;\ni am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;\ni am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .\nthe only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":11,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":5},{"endOffset":258,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":255},{"endOffset":296,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BASIC"],"startOffset":291},{"endOffset":349,"mention":"portable","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Portable_Personal_Computer"],"startOffset":341},{"endOffset":374,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":370},{"endOffset":374,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":370},{"endOffset":374,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":370},{"endOffset":374,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":370},{"endOffset":403,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":400},{"endOffset":547,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":544},{"endOffset":707,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":702},{"endOffset":707,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":702},{"endOffset":748,"mention":"progress","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenEdge_Advanced_Business_Language"],"startOffset":740},{"endOffset":806,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":885,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":880},{"endOffset":918,"mention":"scratch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Scratch:_The_Ultimate_DJ"],"startOffset":911},{"endOffset":918,"mention":"scratch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Scratch:_The_Ultimate_DJ"],"startOffset":911},{"endOffset":942,"mention":"musicmatch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":942,"mention":"musicmatch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Musicmatch_Jukebox"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":956,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":953},{"endOffset":980,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":990,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":987},{"endOffset":1130,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1124},{"endOffset":1130,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1124},{"endOffset":1130,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1124},{"endOffset":1130,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1124},{"endOffset":1163,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1158},{"endOffset":1251,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":1248},{"endOffset":1289,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1284},{"endOffset":1331,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":1328},{"endOffset":1331,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":1328},{"endOffset":1331,"mention":"cds","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":1328},{"endOffset":1472,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1469},{"endOffset":1482,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1477},{"endOffset":1482,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1477},{"endOffset":1482,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1477},{"endOffset":1597,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1591},{"endOffset":1882,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1876},{"endOffset":1903,"mention":"moon","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Moon:_Remix_RPG_Adventure"],"startOffset":1899},{"endOffset":2206,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2201},{"endOffset":2310,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":2307},{"endOffset":2542,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":2539},{"endOffset":2542,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":2539},{"endOffset":2630,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"sta
