{"text":"i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .\nnikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .\nhere were my requirements in a digital camera :\n1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6 \" or 5x7 \" prints and i wanted some really great 8x10 \" photos once in a while .\n2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .\ni wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .\n3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .\n4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .\ndepending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .\nnikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .\ni should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .\nthe pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .\na few things that might make it even better :\n1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .\n2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .\n3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .\nall the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .\ntry to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .\nwhichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .\nand finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .\nhope this review has helped you in making up your mind .\ni have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .\ni am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":1225,"mention":"movie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":1220},{"endOffset":1275,"mention":"name","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BIND"],"startOffset":1271},{"endOffset":1830,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1825},{"endOffset":1909,"mention":"moment","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Samsung_SPH-M900"],"startOffset":1903},{"endOffset":2263,"mention":"reader","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sony_Reader"],"startOffset":2257},{"endOffset":2657,"mention":"vegas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Orange_Vegas"],"startOffset":2652}]}
