{"text":"This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it.\nIt was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up.\nBy no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do.\nIt works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is.\nThat only happens every so often, but its not that big of a drawback really, just a little slower than usual.\nIt really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house.\nThere are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it.\nI do not really know why some people are tearing this router !\napart on their reviews, they are talking about installation problems and what not.\nIts the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!\n","annotations":[]}
