{"text":"It did not take me that long to set this up, but it did require *not* following the instructions.\nI had an old wired Linksys router.\nThe new wireless router contained large warnings to run the CD first before trying to connect it.\nThere was a big sticker inside the box saying \"RUN CD FIRST - DO NOT DISCONNECT YOUR CURRENT ROUTER\".\nAnd the router itself had protective tape over the Ethernet inputs.\nSo I ran the CD, but doing that did not yield any results - my wired router was apparently too old, so the CD s\/w did not recognize it.\nThere were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.\nIf I did not know anything about networking whatsoever, I might be stumped at this point.\nBut since I do have a little experience, I simply disconnected my old router and put in the new one.\nI do know what wires go !\nto which inputs, I know what the lights mean, etc.\nSo then running the CD, everything worked out OK to connect my wired computers again.\nThe only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.\nThere was no obvious screen stating what should be done - the program simply said the router was secured.\nIf I did not know what to do, I'd have no idea how to connect wirelessly.\nBut knowing that the IP for my previous Linksys router was 192.162.1.1, I went there and found a drop down screen that had the information (the security key) I needed to connect my wireless laptop.\nThe router works fine for both wired and wireless.\nI can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.\nOverall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s\/w worked well to connect.\nBut if you did not know what to do, you might have to call Linksys.\nI would suggest for Linksys to include a hardcopy quickstart guide for those users with !\nlittle to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.\nI'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":1122,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1116},{"endOffset":1431,"mention":"key","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/KeY"],"startOffset":1428},{"endOffset":1625,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic"],"startOffset":1620},{"endOffset":1625,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic"],"startOffset":1620},{"endOffset":1625,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Visual_Basic"],"startOffset":1620},{"endOffset":1891,"mention":"networking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NetworKing"],"startOffset":1881},{"endOffset":1891,"mention":"networking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NetworKing"],"startOffset":1881},{"endOffset":1891,"mention":"networking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NetworKing"],"startOffset":1881}]}
