{"text":"This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.\nBuilt like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.\nThe soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.\nIt is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.\nThe edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.\nI used this router to plow out 3\" raised panels in oak without phasing the beast.\nThis was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.\nThe router is also equipped with an adapter that accepts PC guide bushings.\nThe height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.\nThe only complaint I have is that the 1\/4\" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1\/4\" bits.\nI purchased an aftermarket slotted collet that does the job.\nThe Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.\nHowever, now that the kit comes with the height adjustment knob, I'd say jump all over it.\nThis is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.\nWish I could give it 4 1\/2 stars.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":87,"mention":"tank","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/TNK_III"],"startOffset":83},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":335},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":335},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":335},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":335},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":335},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":335},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Pirates"],"startOffset":335},{"endOffset":458,"mention":"beast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Shadow_of_the_Beast"],"startOffset":453},{"endOffset":935,"mention":"kit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTML-Kit"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":935,"mention":"kit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTML-Kit"],"startOffset":932},{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"green","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gunstar_Heroes"],"startOffset":1076}]}
