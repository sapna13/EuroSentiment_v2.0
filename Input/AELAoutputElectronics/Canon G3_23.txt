{"text":"the powershot g3 is a great camera .\nwhy ?\nbecause it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !\n4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .\nit 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .\nmake sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !\n","annotations":[]}
