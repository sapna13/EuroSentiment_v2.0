{"text":"I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.\ni have a lot of files in wma so that was the biggest factor in my decision to purchase the zen.\nHOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.\nby broken i mean that it would no longer transmit sound.\nThe good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.\ni havent used it much yet so i dont know if i will have the same problem; obviously i hope not.\ni dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.\nin principle playlists, album names, artist names, etc would help you organize but this only works IF your tracks have all the necessary data; mine do not.\nand if you have 2500 songs, as you might very well, you will be reluctant to edit the clip properties of 2500 files.\nthe sound is quite good, in terms of volume.\nthe headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.\ni didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.\nyou just get used to it after a while.\ni didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.\nall-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":64,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":61},{"endOffset":64,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":61},{"endOffset":64,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":61},{"endOffset":64,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":61},{"endOffset":175,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":172},{"endOffset":223,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":219},{"endOffset":451,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":448},{"endOffset":581,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":576},{"endOffset":581,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":576},{"endOffset":581,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":576},{"endOffset":581,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":576},{"endOffset":705,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":698},{"endOffset":705,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":698},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1244},{"endOffset":1253,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1250},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1244},{"endOffset":1253,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1250},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1244},{"endOffset":1253,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1250},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1244},{"endOffset":1253,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1250},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"touch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPod_Touch"],"startOffset":1244},{"endOffset":1253,"mention":"pad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IPad"],"startOffset":1250},{"endOffset":1400,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1395},{"endOffset":1400,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1395},{"endOffset":1400,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1395},{"endOffset":1400,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1395},{"endOffset":1400,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1395}]}
