{"text":"after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .\ndespite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !\ni am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .\nfile transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .\nseveral people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .\nthis is possible ! !\nsince the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the \" duplicate name \" problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title \/ artist \/ album .\nsolution ?\nsimply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .\nusing this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .\neven if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .\nmy one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the \" year \" field .\nweird .\nhow does it sound ?\nto my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .\nno complaints there .\nthe eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .\nnavigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .\nat the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria
