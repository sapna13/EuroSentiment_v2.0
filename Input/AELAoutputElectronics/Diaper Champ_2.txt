{"text":"We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents do.\nWe hated that thing!\nThe \"new\" design still needs lots of improvement!\nThe bags never fit right and then it never spun right.\nAnd after about two months it just sat there in the corner of her room and was never used.\nAs she entered into toddlerhood we started having some bad diapers just becasue of her cutting teeth and diet changes.\nWe decided we had to have something so we started researching.\nThe Diaper Champ is the best we found!\nThere are no specail bags to deal with or buy!\nWe use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.\nThere is also no trick to it.\nNo spinning it or anyhting!\nJust flip the handle and the diaper is gone!\nNow it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!\nWe empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!\nIt is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":32,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Genie_Backup_Manager"],"startOffset":27},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":249},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":249},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":249},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":249},{"endOffset":253,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":249},{"endOffset":383,"mention":"diet","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/DIET"],"startOffset":379},{"endOffset":999,"mention":"Genie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Genie_Backup_Manager"],"startOffset":994}]}
