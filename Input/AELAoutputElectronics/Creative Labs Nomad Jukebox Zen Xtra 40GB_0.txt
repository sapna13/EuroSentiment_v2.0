{"text":"this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .\nwhile , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .\nit is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .\nlike it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .\nthe xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .\nfurther , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .\nthis is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .\nwhen compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .\nyes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .\nyes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .\nfor me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":277,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":271},{"endOffset":584,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":581},{"endOffset":627,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":621},{"endOffset":729,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Max_Payne_3"],"startOffset":726},{"endOffset":798,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":793},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":868,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":1105,"mention":"persona","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Revelations:_Persona"],"startOffset":1098},{"endOffset":1235,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1230},{"endOffset":1242,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1236}]}
