{"text":"What I have found useful to consider before purchasing a phone:  - decent battery life - good call quality - user-friendly interface - camera\/video functions - bluetooth - ability to sync contacts stored in the PC with the phone (no more manual entries!)\nWith one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.\nIve had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.\nThe only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.\nMotorola's phones are well engineered but have an user interface that reflects very poorly on what is otherwise an excellent engineering company.\nIts a real shame that T-Mo does not offer the newer Nokia models.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":356,"mention":"Microsoft Outlook","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Outlook"],"startOffset":339},{"endOffset":466,"mention":"Remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":460},{"endOffset":471,"mention":"ICQ","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ICQ"],"startOffset":468},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":495},{"endOffset":939,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":934}]}
