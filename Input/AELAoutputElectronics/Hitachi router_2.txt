{"text":"I have a small fixed base, single speed router that I use freehand.\nBut I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.\nAt first, I kicked myself for not buying one in the first place instead of my smaller router, but in retrospect I think this is the best compromise.\nThe Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)\nHowever, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).\nSince I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.\nThe Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.\nOtherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":413,"mention":"maple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MapleStory"],"startOffset":408}]}
