{"text":"I used to own a $20 after rebate cheapo wireless router that I thought would be adequate enough for a home wireless networking.\nEnded up returning to a Linksys router and giving the cheap router the boot.\nThe cheap router I used to own had very minimal feature in the configurations menu and less security options then the Linksys WRT54G.\nBut the biggest problem was the constant drop in connections and weak signals from time to time.\nI was fed up and turned to WRT54G because of its positive reviews, good past experience with wired routers and frequent firmware updates to correct any bugs.   router[+2] ##I'm happy to say that this router was exactly what I was looking for.\nYou won't regret it.\nThe setup was very easy.\nJust follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time.\nThe dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.\nNo more connection!\ndrops and strong signals even from the backyard.\nThe WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.\nEven though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys.\nThe quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":126,"mention":"networking","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/NetworKing"],"startOffset":116}]}
