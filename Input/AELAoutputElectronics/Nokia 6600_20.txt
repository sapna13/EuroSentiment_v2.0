{"text":"Most of thew reviews are high for this phone ......\nMy explanation is that most of the reviewers are americans that live in the states .....\nthe difference is : until recently there have been no GSM networks in a wide scale , so most cell network companies supplied consumers with cells , we in the middle east (for example) have stopped using years ago ....\nSo no wonder a lot of people find the 6600 such a miracle .\nI have purchased the 6600 when it was first released in The Middle East , almost a month before Europe , and reading the brochures and features , it really did sound like a true all-in-one functionality monster .\nUnfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .\n1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic\/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .\n2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .\n3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .\nAs soon as you copy video\/audio files and add some programs and games , it WILL hang at least 5-10 times a day.\nA firmware upgrade is irrelevant .\n4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the \"other than phone\" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .\n5- If you already have a girlfriend and\/or wife , you won't need Bluetooth lol .\nBasically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .\nI'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .\nI'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":120,"mention":"live","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office_Live"],"startOffset":116},{"endOffset":416,"mention":"miracle","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Miracle_Piano_Teaching_System"],"startOffset":409},{"endOffset":629,"mention":"monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Landkreuzer_P._1500_Monster"],"startOffset":622},{"endOffset":1644,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":1639},{"endOffset":1644,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":1639},{"endOffset":1988,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BASIC"],"startOffset":1983},{"endOffset":1988,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BASIC"],"startOffset":1983},{"endOffset":1988,"mention":"basic","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BASIC"],"startOffset":1983},{"endOffset":2068,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":2063},{"endOffset":2068,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":2063},{"endOffset":2151,"mention":"trial","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Trials_HD"],"startOffset":2146},{"endOffset":2151,"mention":"trial","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Trials_HD"],"startOffset":2146},{"endOffset":2262,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":2258},{"endOffset":2262,"mention":"star","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Xerox_Star"],"startOffset":2258},{"endOffset":2297,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":2292},{"endOffset":2445,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":2440},{"endOffset":2445,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":2440},{"endOffset":2445,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":2440},{"endOffset":2445,"mention":"Nokia","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Software_Updater"],"startOffset":2440}]}
