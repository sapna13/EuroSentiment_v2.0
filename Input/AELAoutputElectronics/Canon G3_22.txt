{"text":"when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .\nyes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .\nnot only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .\nher main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .\nthe nikon 's are great cameras .\n+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .\n- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .\nolympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .\n+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .\n- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .\nphotos had some artifacts and noise .\nmy fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .\nwe also looked at the fuji fps602 .\nnice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .\nfiance did n't like the feel .\nthe canon g3 .\n4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )\na lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .\nthe other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his \/ her own .\ni have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .\nalways remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":72,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":65},{"endOffset":401,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":396},{"endOffset":401,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":396},{"endOffset":701,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":695},{"endOffset":777,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":770},{"endOffset":952,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":946},{"endOffset":1172,"mention":"sharp","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/J_Sharp"],"startOffset":1167},{"endOffset":1172,"mention":"sharp","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/J_Sharp"],"startOffset":1167},{"endOffset":1441,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1435}]}
