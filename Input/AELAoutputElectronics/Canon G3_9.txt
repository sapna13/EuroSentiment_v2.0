{"text":"what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?\ni make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .\nat the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .\ni recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .\ni showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !\nthis camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .\nthe prints are beautiful !\nand you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .\ni tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .\nalthough canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .\n","annotations":[]}
