{"text":"I purchased two of these beauties.\nFor exclusive use in a double router table I have been building.\nI have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.\nOne cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.\nMy routers arrived promptly and I actually used one of them in the construction of the router table.\nThe design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy\/junk) routers I have previously purchased.\nI have since used them to cut all the stiles and rails for my first kitchen.\nThey were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.\nI have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.\nThe setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.\nI say this because I am not particulary fond of the hitachi compound miter saw.\nAs I find it inheritly inaccurate by design.\nI would however highly recommend the m12v router !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":167,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":162},{"endOffset":596,"mention":"rails","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ruby_on_Rails"],"startOffset":591},{"endOffset":725,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":720},{"endOffset":725,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":720}]}
