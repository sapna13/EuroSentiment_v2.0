{"text":"I use the Hitachi M12V in a router table.\nIt is a little large for my table (Rockler), but that isn't the fault of the router.\nBecause of this I have removed the handles.\nI like the speed control.\nIt works well with the larger bits.\n(I prefer 1\/2 inch bits).\nIt has plenty of power.\nThe fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.\nFinally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.\nAfter getting it installed (which wasn't an easy task), it makes fine adjustments easy.\nThe one wrench systems makes changing bits somewhat difficult.\nI am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the \"sliding wrench\" which comes on the router.\nAll in all I am pleased with the router.\nThe power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.\n","annotations":[]}
