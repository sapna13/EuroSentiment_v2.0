{"text":"after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .\nthe objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .\ni 'm very glad i did .\nthe service from the supplier was exceptional .\nthe camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .\nhaving used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .\nrecently , i attended a \" flyball \" competition\n-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .\nby cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .\nthe camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .\nin the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .\nabout the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .\nthis effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .\nbut who cares ?\ni always shoot using the lcd panel .\ni can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":838,"mention":"dream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Dream"],"startOffset":833},{"endOffset":838,"mention":"dream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Dream"],"startOffset":833},{"endOffset":838,"mention":"dream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/HTC_Dream"],"startOffset":833}]}
