{"text":"The world of MP3 players is blinding, and since most people don't understand the technology [myself included], user-friendliness is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT.\nUnfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset.\nAfter attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files.\nWhen most of us purchase these little devises, we do so because of their diminuitive size and extraordinary storage capacities.\nSO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.\nMost of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.\nI don't care what ELSE it can do.\nI just want MUSIC to eminate from it when I want, how I want.\nAll of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD.\nThe base was deeper and the highs were crisper.\nUnfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":16,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":16,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":16,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":16,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":16,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":13},{"endOffset":611,"mention":"MUSIC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":606},{"endOffset":627,"mention":"MUSIC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":622},{"endOffset":898,"mention":"MUSIC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":893},{"endOffset":898,"mention":"MUSIC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":893},{"endOffset":898,"mention":"MUSIC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":893}]}
