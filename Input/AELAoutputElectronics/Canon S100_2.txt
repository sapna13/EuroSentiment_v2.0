{"text":"I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.\nIt is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.\nI take it with me everywhere,literally,\nit is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.\nThere is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.\nThe picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!\nThe picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).\nHowever, I do have a few things to complain about...\nFirst off, the battery.\nThis camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.\nNot only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.\nThe longest I've had it work was about 1 hour and 45 minutes.\nThis isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.\nAnother problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.\nSuch a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!\nVery wrong.\nThe zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.\nEven just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.\nThe flash is very weak.\nReally dissapointing. If you are inside, you can't be any farther away then 10 feet in a lit room.\nThe last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.\nThe auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.\nTo make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.\nThe focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.\nThese are all the flaws I found in the camera,\nit's not my first choice in cameras,\nI have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.\nIf you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":1758,"mention":"start-up","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Start-Up"],"startOffset":1750},{"endOffset":1769,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1764},{"endOffset":1769,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1764},{"endOffset":1769,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1764},{"endOffset":1769,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1764},{"endOffset":1881,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":1877},{"endOffset":2110,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":2105},{"endOffset":2110,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":2105},{"endOffset":2110,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":2105},{"endOffset":2110,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":2105},{"endOffset":2110,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":2105},{"endOffset":2110,"mention":"focus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Helicon_Focus"],"startOffset":2105}]}
