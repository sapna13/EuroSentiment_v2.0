{"text":"and also , it 's priced very affordably .\nwith 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .\na similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .\nhaving my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .\nhaving to copy \/ delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .\nthe software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's \" notmad \" software because of some advanced features i wanted .\nthe sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .\non planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .\nsound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .\naccessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .\npossibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him \/ herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .\nsince batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .\ntry before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .\ni personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .\nthe ipod 's white plastic look \/ surface does n't suit me .\ni like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .\nthe mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .\nmy advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them
