{"text":"If you're considering an iPod mini or even an iPod, read this.\nI looked at the market extensively and took a lot of advice before making the big buy here.\nI wanted a player that had good capacity, construction that can stand up to exercise, good sound quality, good battery life, good looks, compatibility, and a fair price.\nTall order, eh?\nActually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.\nSound quality? Phenomenal.\nunarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.\nLooks?\nLet's just say it's no coincidence I put \"Foxy Lady\" on there.\nYour choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.\nCapacity?\nApple has tried to hide something from you: most people don't actually need more than a few gigs at most.\nFive gigabytes is plenty for my great albums.\n(Like I really wanted \"Hotel California\" anyway.\n)  Construction?\nTough as nails.\nNo skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.\n)  Compatibility?\nFlawless.\nThey've partnered with Napster to give you a! free month of the subscription service (read: all the music you want free for thirty days, when you can cancel with all your music safely hidden away.\n) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.\nThe voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player.\nGets nice sound too.\nThe FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.\nAnd the price?\nA bargain $200.\nDo NOT buy Apple.\nInferior quality at a higher price (and shoddy reliability) is not quite justified just because they have a better spokesperson.\nIn conclusion, this player is beautiful.\nPower for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate.\nBut it; you won't regret it.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":367,"mention":"Zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Pinball"],"startOffset":364},{"endOffset":610,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":605},{"endOffset":610,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":605},{"endOffset":610,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":605},{"endOffset":610,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":605},{"endOffset":785,"mention":"Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Dusk:_Room_215"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":785,"mention":"Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Dusk:_Room_215"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":785,"mention":"Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Dusk:_Room_215"],"startOffset":780},{"endOffset":973,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":966},{"endOffset":973,"mention":"Napster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Napster"],"startOffset":966},{"endOffset":1119,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1114},{"endOffset":1119,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1114},{"endOffset":1119,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1114},{"endOffset":1119,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1114},{"endOffset":1186,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1181},{"endOffset":1308,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1303},{"endOffset":1308,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1303},{"endOffset":1330,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":1325},{"endOffset":1330,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":1325},{"endOffset":1330,"mention":"money","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Money"],"startOffset":1325},{"endOffset":1378,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1372},{"endOffset":1454,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/CakePHP"],"startOffset":1450},{"endOffset":1503,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1498},{"endOffset":1660,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1654},{"endOffset":1660,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1654},{"endOffset":1660,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1654},{"endOffset":1705,"mention":"ease","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/At_Ease"],"startOffset":1701}]}
