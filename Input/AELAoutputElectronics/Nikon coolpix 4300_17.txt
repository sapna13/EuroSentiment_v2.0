{"text":"i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .\nthis is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .\nit is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .\ni particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .\nmy friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !\none downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .\ni assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .\nbattery life is ok .\ni plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .\n","annotations":[]}
