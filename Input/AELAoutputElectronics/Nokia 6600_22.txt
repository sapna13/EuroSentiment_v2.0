{"text":"I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.\nMultimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.\nSo, do I recommend the 6600?\nYes, certainly.\nBut if you are in the market for a new business capable phone, and don't want to deal with a stylus equipped PDA like device such as the P900, then the 6600 will probably suit you just fine.\nThe Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.\nThe phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.\nAmong its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.\nIn short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":18,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":8},{"endOffset":44,"mention":"TFT","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Warcraft_III:_The_Frozen_Throne"],"startOffset":41},{"endOffset":158,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":152},{"endOffset":307,"mention":"Gallery","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gallery_Project"],"startOffset":300},{"endOffset":307,"mention":"Gallery","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gallery_Project"],"startOffset":300},{"endOffset":628,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":618},{"endOffset":673,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":669},{"endOffset":882,"mention":"Nokia 6600","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_6600"],"startOffset":872}]}
