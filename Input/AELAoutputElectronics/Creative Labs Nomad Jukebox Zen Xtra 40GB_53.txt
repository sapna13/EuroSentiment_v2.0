{"text":"i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .\nwhile the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .\nsoftware :\na lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .\nfirst , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .\nthe ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .\nthe zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .\nsecond , the \" automatic \" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .\nsince the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .\nif the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !\nthe zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .\nthird , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .\nonly thing missing from creative is a cd burner .\nlastly , ipod \/ itunes will not play wma formatted songs .\nif you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .\nitunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .\nfor those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .\nplayer controls :\nhere 's where the ipod drives me nuts .\nthe player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .\nif you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .\nthe ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .\nzen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .\nit also lets you remove songs from the play order .\nif you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .\nyou have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .\nlastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .\nwhile you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.\nnone of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .\nagain , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .\ni think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .\nwin software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .\nwith apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .\nif i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .\nits ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":40,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":37},{"endOffset":127,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":124},{"endOffset":127,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":124},{"endOffset":127,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":124},{"endOffset":291,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":285},{"endOffset":309,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":306},{"endOffset":412,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":406},{"endOffset":422,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":419},{"endOffset":461,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":456},{"endOffset":599,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":593},{"endOffset":882,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":877},{"endOffset":882,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":877},{"endOffset":882,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":877},{"endOffset":1002,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":997},{"endOffset":1002,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":997},{"endOffset":1044,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1041},{"endOffset":1044,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":1041},{"endOffset":1091,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1085},{"endOffset":1150,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1143},{"endOffset":1150,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1143},{"endOffset":1150,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1143},{"endOffset":1150,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Windows"],"startOffset":1143},{"endOffset":1197,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1191},{"endOffset":1289,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1283},{"endOffset":1289,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1283},{"endOffset":1289,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1283},{"endOffset":1384,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":1381},{"endOffset":1393,"mention":"itunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1387},{"endOffset":1409,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1404},{"endOffset":1409,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1404},{"endOffset":1409,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1404},{"endOffset":1409,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1404},{"endOffset":1409,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":1404},{"endOffset":1568,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1562},{"endOffset":1568,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1562},{"endOffset":1568,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1562},{"endOffset":1568,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1562},{"endOffset":1630,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1624},{"endOffset":1630,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1624},{"endOffset":1630,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1624},{"endOffset":1630,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1624},{"endOffset":1630,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1624},{"endOffset":1630,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1624},{"endOffset":1630,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1624},{"endOffset":1840,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1834},{"endOffset":1846,"mention":"zen","uri":["htt
