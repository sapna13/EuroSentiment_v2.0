{"text":"this thing kicks mighty apple butt !\ni would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .\nit 's worth it .\ni personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .\nafter finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .\nmy two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .\nthis thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .\nthe zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !\nthe sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .\nyou wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.\nthe controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !\nthe scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .\nit could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .\nthe screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .\nit does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .\n( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )\nthe included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .\nother plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .\n( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )\ni probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver \/ metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .\nsince the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .\noverall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !\n( batteries last longer too ! )\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":29,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":24},{"endOffset":191,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":186},{"endOffset":362,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":359},{"endOffset":372,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":366},{"endOffset":593,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_of_Sudoku"],"startOffset":590},{"endOffset":1146,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1140},{"endOffset":1146,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1140},{"endOffset":1235,"mention":"blue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue"],"startOffset":1231},{"endOffset":1305,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1298},{"endOffset":1305,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1298},{"endOffset":1305,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1298},{"endOffset":1305,"mention":"windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1298},{"endOffset":1814,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_I"],"startOffset":1809},{"endOffset":1883,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1877},{"endOffset":1914,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1908},{"endOffset":1914,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1908},{"endOffset":1914,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1908},{"endOffset":1995,"mention":"mp3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mario_Party_3"],"startOffset":1992},{"endOffset":2002,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1996}]}
