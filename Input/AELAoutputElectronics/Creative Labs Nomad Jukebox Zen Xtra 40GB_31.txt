{"text":"i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .\nit was not my first choice .\ni have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .\none good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .\nfor the price and features it is really good .\none thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist \/ album and answer was yes .\nsure enough there is no such ability .\nnot sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .\nin any case , navigation by artist \/ album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .\nyou even can not navigate by genre \/ artist \/ album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .\ncreative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .\nthe software , which comes with player is not good at all .\ni did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .\nafter installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .\nnotmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .\ntransfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .\noften i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .\nartist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .\nafter all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .\nthe bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":12,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":9},{"endOffset":146,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":141},{"endOffset":150,"mention":"zen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zen_Cart"],"startOffset":147},{"endOffset":977,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":972},{"endOffset":977,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":972},{"endOffset":977,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":972},{"endOffset":1133,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1127},{"endOffset":1133,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1127},{"endOffset":1133,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1127},{"endOffset":1133,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1127},{"endOffset":1133,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1127},{"endOffset":1133,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1127},{"endOffset":1195,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1190},{"endOffset":1195,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1190},{"endOffset":1195,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1190},{"endOffset":1477,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":1472},{"endOffset":1718,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1712},{"endOffset":1718,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1712},{"endOffset":1718,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1712},{"endOffset":1899,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":1895},{"endOffset":1932,"mention":"progress","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenEdge_Advanced_Business_Language"],"startOffset":1924},{"endOffset":1987,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1981},{"endOffset":2012,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2007},{"endOffset":2012,"mention":"nomad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sega_Nomad"],"startOffset":2007}]}
