{"text":"we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .\nthe 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .\nit comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !\nwe got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .\nthe only drawbacks that i have noticed :\nit comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .\nso , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .\nit does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .\ni would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .\nit has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .\nfor more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .\nit does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .\ni set the camera to the \" manual \" mode for one main reason :\nin any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .\nin manual , you can set it to \" single af \" where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .\nin reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !\nit is easy to \" focus \" in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .\nit really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .\nfor work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .\nthey take excellent macro shots as well .\nthe menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":59,"mention":"office","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office"],"startOffset":53},{"endOffset":59,"mention":"office","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office"],"startOffset":53},{"endOffset":59,"mention":"office","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office"],"startOffset":53},{"endOffset":237,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":232},{"endOffset":1058,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":1055},{"endOffset":1922,"mention":"movies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":1916}]}
