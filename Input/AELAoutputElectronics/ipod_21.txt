{"text":"Buy the 20GB instead of the Mini\nA lot of the reviews I've read talk about IPODS in general.\nI'm writing about the 4G IPOD 20GB model.\nI ordered the mini from amazon, and while waiting for it to arrive I wandered into the Apple store.\nI'm glad I did.\nAfter talking to the salesman, I instead bought the 4G, 20GB (that stands for 4th generation; it looks like a mini - same features), and didn't know that a lot of the ipods out there for sell, including on amazon, are still 3G.\nThe player is great.\nI didn't think I would need more than the 5GB that the mini has, but... once I downloaded a few audio books on top of my CD's -- I'm GLAD I have the extra memory.\nHowever, the battery life isn't as good as I would like.\nThere is an attachment you can buy that allows you to use AA batteries in an emergency, but...I've never completely run out of juice; just dangerously low on long airline trips.\nFor about $5! 6 dollars, you can get an \"extended warranty\" and apple will replace the battery within 2 years if it dies.\nThink about that if you are worried about battery life.\nOverall, this product is AWESOME.\nAll the \"cool\" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":68,"mention":"talk","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Google_Talk"],"startOffset":64},{"endOffset":153,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":149},{"endOffset":227,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":222},{"endOffset":365,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":361},{"endOffset":489,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":483},{"endOffset":489,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":483},{"endOffset":489,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":483},{"endOffset":559,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":555},{"endOffset":559,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":555},{"endOffset":559,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":555},{"endOffset":559,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":555},{"endOffset":559,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":555},{"endOffset":614,"mention":"top","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tales_of_Phantasia"],"startOffset":611},{"endOffset":890,"mention":"airline","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Airline_Tycoon"],"startOffset":883},{"endOffset":967,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":962},{"endOffset":967,"mention":"apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":962},{"endOffset":1145,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":1141},{"endOffset":1145,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":1141},{"endOffset":1145,"mention":"mini","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mac_Mini"],"startOffset":1141}]}
