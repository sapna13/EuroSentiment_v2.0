{"text":"God Save Apple\t I have been an Apple person since 1984, when I got my first Mac.\nSince then, I have been a devotee of the elegant styling and functionality of all things Apple.\nThe Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company.\nLong live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!\nI have an ipod and it is a great buy.\nIt holds a ton of songs and looks cool in the palm of your hand.\nVery sturdy and strong.\nDoesn't have alot of good games on it.\nthe 20 gig because that holds 10,000 songs right there and that's alot of songs.\nbuy it.\niPod is brilliant, but service was awful\nWow iPod.\nHow did we listen to music before it?\nThis 20 gigabyte iPod by Apple Computer allows you to put up to 5000 songs onto it, in a choice of digital formats.  MP3, AAC, etc.\nThe software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod.\niTunes is a great piece of software, and you can also buy songs from the iTunes Store at 99 cents per download.\nThis new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.\nIt allows fast and easy navigation.\nThe backlit screen of the iPod is also easy to read.\nThe song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.\nThe back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches.\nIt is best to protect the iPod in a case of some kind.\nBattery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge.\nI use my iPod all the time.\nYou can also use it as an external hard drive to back-up documents, photographs, etc.\nThe problem with my iPod.\nThe first one I received skipped songs randomly.\nI had to send it in for repair, and it took six weeks to get a replacement back to me.\nI actually had to contact Apple's Vice-president, in order to get the situation resolved.\nHowever, he quickly helped me, and I have been enjoying my replacement 20 gigabyte click-wheel iPod for several months now.\nThank you Apple!  You make fabulous products.\nThe product I rate five stars,\nbut I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.\nHowever, you should still buy an iPod!\nThe chances of getting a flawed one is very small indeed.\nPlus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.\nI had ordered a customized one from Apple.com, so I couldn't exchange it.\niPod will change the way you enjoy music!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":36,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":31},{"endOffset":79,"mention":"Mac","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MAC-11"],"startOffset":76},{"endOffset":175,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":170},{"endOffset":275,"mention":"live","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office_Live"],"startOffset":271},{"endOffset":281,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":276},{"endOffset":275,"mention":"live","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office_Live"],"startOffset":271},{"endOffset":281,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":276},{"endOffset":292,"mention":"live","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office_Live"],"startOffset":288},{"endOffset":292,"mention":"live","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office_Live"],"startOffset":288},{"endOffset":292,"mention":"live","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office_Live"],"startOffset":288},{"endOffset":292,"mention":"live","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Office_Live"],"startOffset":288},{"endOffset":411,"mention":"palm","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Palm_OS"],"startOffset":407},{"endOffset":655,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":650},{"endOffset":697,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":692},{"endOffset":787,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Metroid_Prime_3:_Corruption"],"startOffset":784},{"endOffset":841,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":835},{"endOffset":877,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":872},{"endOffset":903,"mention":"CDs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Copernic_Desktop_Search"],"startOffset":900},{"endOffset":943,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":938},{"endOffset":981,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":975},{"endOffset":1101,"mention":"click","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apache_Click"],"startOffset":1096},{"endOffset":1287,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":1281},{"endOffset":1479,"mention":"chrome","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Google_Chrome_OS"],"startOffset":1473},{"endOffset":1479,"mention":"chrome","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Google_Chrome_OS"],"startOffset":1473},{"endOffset":1504,"mention":"surface","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Surface"],"startOffset":1497},{"endOffset":1504,"mention":"surface","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Surface"],"startOffset":1497},{"endOffset":1504,"mention":"surface","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Surface"],"startOffset":1497},{"endOffset":1680,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1676},{"endOffset":1680,"mention":"play","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Play"],"startOffset":1676},{"endOffset":2204,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":2199},{"endOffset":2570,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":2565},{"endOffset":2570,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_IIGS"],"startOffset":2565},{"endOffset":2643,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2638}]}
