{"text":"I bought this router a couple of months ago from Amazon and have used it a fair amount in that time.\nThe deal Amazon has going can't be beat and if you're considering buying this machine, do so from this site.\nI noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.\nThe speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.\nThe included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.\nThe plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.\nIt is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.\nThose are the good points.\nThere are a few points of contention which I have.\nThe depth scale is a joke and I wouldn't use it for anything but a \"ball park\" measure.\nThe plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.\nThis entails wiping the rods, blowing compressed air into the housings, and lightly lubricating the rods with silicone lubricant.\nThe instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.\nAlso, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.\nI plan to get a Porter-Cable for table mounted use but will be using this machine for most if not all of my hand held use.\nOverall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":881,"mention":"air","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Integrated_Runtime"],"startOffset":878},{"endOffset":1093,"mention":"fit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Fit"],"startOffset":1090},{"endOffset":1093,"mention":"fit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Fit"],"startOffset":1090},{"endOffset":1093,"mention":"fit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Fit"],"startOffset":1090},{"endOffset":1093,"mention":"fit","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Fit"],"startOffset":1090}]}
