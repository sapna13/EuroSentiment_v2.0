{"text":"At the last Anahiem WW Show I decided to get the M12V.\nI was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.\nI bought it!\nI have 5 routers, I use them all!\nI make furniture and cabinetry.\nI cut 30-50 raised panel doors a month using every specie of wood imaginable.\nMaple, Koa and Cherry giving us the hardest time with burning and splintering.\nThe M12V has been great.\nThe height adjustment works well- not perfect.\nThe wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.\nThe true test is its ability to be forgiving when coping a rail.\nWhat I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.\nGood luck and cut wood!!!!\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":318,"mention":"Maple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MapleStory"],"startOffset":313},{"endOffset":374,"mention":"burning","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BurningMUD"],"startOffset":367},{"endOffset":585,"mention":"rail","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ruby_on_Rails"],"startOffset":581}]}
