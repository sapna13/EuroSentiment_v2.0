{"text":"i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .\nafter a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .\nam i ever glad that i decided on this camera !\ni 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .\nforget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .\ni 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .\nvery intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .\ni charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .\nthe standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .\ni was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .\nthe optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .\none little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .\nas i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .\nthese things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .\nthe best 4 megapixel\/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .\nhighly recommended .\nfor more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":683,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":675},{"endOffset":683,"mention":"standard","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/RIM-66_Standard"],"startOffset":675},{"endOffset":891,"mention":"olympus","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Battle_of_Olympus"],"startOffset":884}]}
