{"text":"i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .\nit is an extremely cool gizmo .\nin fact , everyone who saw it thought i was \" the man \" and wo n't believe i returned it .\nso what 's the problem ?\ni made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .\ni initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .\ni quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .\nthe reasons below will be true for any product in this category .\nhere 's why :\n1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .\ni have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .\n2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )\n3 . it 's a hazard in the car .\nthe navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .\n( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .\ncreating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .\nthe bottom line :\nif i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd\/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .\nsure it 's \" old school \" to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .\none major complaint :\nmy only significant complaint is sound quality .\nthe eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .\nthis did not give me enough control .\ni wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .\ni was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with \" bass boost . \"\nthe sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .\none minor complaint :\nthe documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .\ngee ... thanks a lot creative
