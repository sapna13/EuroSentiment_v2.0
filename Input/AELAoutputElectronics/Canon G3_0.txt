( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .\na few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .\ni 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1\/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .\nensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .\nbottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense \/ filters choices .\ni 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .\ngreat job canon !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":791,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":786},{"endOffset":845,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":840},{"endOffset":911,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":906},{"endOffset":911,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":906},{"endOffset":961,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":957},{"endOffset":961,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":957},{"endOffset":961,"mention":"line","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Color_Lines"],"startOffset":957},{"endOffset":1077,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1072},{"endOffset":1077,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash"],"startOffset":1072},{"endOffset":1224,"mention":"ease","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/At_Ease"],"startOffset":1220}]}
