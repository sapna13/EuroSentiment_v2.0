{"text":"I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA.\nIronically, the latest firmware update addresses this very specific issue.... so now I have no problems what so ever.\nEven during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.\nNew firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration.\nAll you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network.\nAwesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.\nComes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router.\nYou need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.\nLinksys is more costlier than others and is a home\/consumer division of Cisco.\nBut I believe for stability, this extra price is worth spending.\nWhatever you do, please don't go for a Netgear. !\n","annotations":[]}
