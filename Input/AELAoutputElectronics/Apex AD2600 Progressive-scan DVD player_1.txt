{"text":"i 've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .\nthis is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .\nit 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .\nits fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .\nit plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .\nand amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?\ni 've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .\nstrengths are well listed by other reviewers .\nwhat got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .\nit sure does !\nthat 's a rare and valuable feature .\ni have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !\nanother nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .\nsaved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .\nat double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !\ni wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare \/ cool feature you will have to forgo .\nweaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1\/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .\nif you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .\nupdate : the finish is more \" mirror \" than silver -- and i like it !\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":760,"mention":"zillion","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zillion_II"],"startOffset":753},{"endOffset":760,"mention":"zillion","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Zillion_II"],"startOffset":753},{"endOffset":1292,"mention":"movies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":1286},{"endOffset":1292,"mention":"movies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Movies"],"startOffset":1286},{"endOffset":1412,"mention":"remote","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes_Remote"],"startOffset":1406},{"endOffset":1715,"mention":"hunter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/World_of_Warcraft"],"startOffset":1709},{"endOffset":1857,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1851},{"endOffset":1857,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1851},{"endOffset":1857,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1851},{"endOffset":1857,"mention":"silver","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pok%C3%A9mon_Gold_and_Silver"],"startOffset":1851}]}
