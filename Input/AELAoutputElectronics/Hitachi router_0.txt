{"text":"I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.\nWell, when I got it home and mounted it in my router table, the shortcomings started showing up.\nThe adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.\nI tried it with the springs in and with them out and did not notice any difference.\nThe collet for the 1\/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.\nThen the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.\nI never could get the panel bit to fit right.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":45,"mention":"show","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MLB_07:_The_Show"],"startOffset":41},{"endOffset":45,"mention":"show","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MLB_07:_The_Show"],"startOffset":41},{"endOffset":573,"mention":"Viper","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/FGR-17_Viper"],"startOffset":568}]}
