{"text":"the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .\ncanon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .\nsimply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .\nthe canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .\nfor me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .\nthe battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .\nthe only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .\neven with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":535,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":530},{"endOffset":535,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":530}]}
