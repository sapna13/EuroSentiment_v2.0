{"text":"Good quality and fun!\nI purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.\nI'm a professional photographer using pro digital equipment and I was looking for something to have around the house so that my wife could capture candid moments with my kids.\nIn practice, we've been VERY happy with the results.\nThe camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).\n","annotations":[]}
