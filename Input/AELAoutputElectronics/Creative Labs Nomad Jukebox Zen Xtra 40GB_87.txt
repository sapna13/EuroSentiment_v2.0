{"text":"this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .\nfor a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .\nhere are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :\nlook \/ design :\nthe system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .\nit 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1\/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .\nit 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .\ni find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .\nthe scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .\nthe screen 's large and easily read .\nthe only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .\nsound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .\nfrom what i 've heard it 's at least equal .\nlike others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .\nthere 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .\ninterface - practically seamless .\nsongs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .\nyet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .\nit 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .\nyou can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .\nplaylists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .\nthe only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .\nsoftware :\nas i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .\nit 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .\nthe in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .\nit was no problem for me to use their software .\nsome may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .\nthe software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .\noverall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .\nso far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .\nplease consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":27,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":21},{"endOffset":27,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":21},{"endOffset":27,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":21},{"endOffset":218,"mention":"monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Landkreuzer_P._1500_Monster"],"startOffset":211},{"endOffset":218,"mention":"monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Landkreuzer_P._1500_Monster"],"startOffset":211},{"endOffset":326,"mention":"cons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":322},{"endOffset":326,"mention":"cons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":322},{"endOffset":1608,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":1602},{"endOffset":1816,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1811},{"endOffset":2613,"mention":"portable","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Portable_Personal_Computer"],"startOffset":2605},{"endOffset":2619,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2614},{"endOffset":2626,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2620},{"endOffset":2613,"mention":"portable","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Portable_Personal_Computer"],"startOffset":2605},{"endOffset":2619,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2614},{"endOffset":2626,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2620},{"endOffset":2732,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":2727},{"endOffset":2893,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":2887},{"endOffset":2918,"mention":"room","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Silent_Hill_4:_The_Room"],"startOffset":2914},{"endOffset":2950,"mention":"jack","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit"],"startOffset":2946}]}
