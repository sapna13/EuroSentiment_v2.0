{"text":"bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .\nin general it is easy to use and well laid out .\nfor `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .\nit makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .\nthe g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro \/ pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .\nin the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program \/ auto mode .\nmy wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .\nthe photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !\nthis is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .\nnegative points :\nthe included memory card is too small .\ngo out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .\nit is made of plastic .\nfor those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .\nthis is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .\nthe zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .\nthis is not a handbag camera .\nwhile light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .\nthe function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .\nflash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .\nthe g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .\nthe strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .\nif you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .\ngood points :\nthe functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .\ncanon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .\nlearning how to use it will not take very long .\nthe image quality is excellent .\nmessing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .\nunless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .\nrange of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .\nplease note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .\na lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .\ni did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":983,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":983,"mention":"screen","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/GNU_Screen"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":1633,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1628},{"endOffset":1633,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1628},{"endOffset":1633,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1628},{"endOffset":1869,"mention":"flash","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Flash_Player"],"startOffset":1864},{"endOffset":1964,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":1958},{"endOffset":1964,"mention":"access","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Microsoft_Access"],"startOffset":1958},{"endOffset":2362,"mention":"photoshop","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Adobe_Photoshop_Elements"],"startOffset":2353},{"endOffset":2702,"mention":"note","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/IBM_Lotus_Notes"],"startOffset":2698}]}
