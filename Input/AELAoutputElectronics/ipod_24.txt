{"text":"I Love My iPod!\nAlthough iPods have been around for a few years, they didn't really get hot until now.\nI ended up (surprisingly) getting one for Christmas.\nI love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it.\nIt DESERVES a perfect 5-stars.\nThe only problem is the battery life.\nAfter about 3-4 months, you see your battery draining faster than it should.\nAfter a year, your battery is dead and you need to replace it with a new one.\nApple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100!\nAmazing.\nYou pay $300 for the iPod itself, then $100 to get the battery fixed.\nIf you look on Google or around the web's many search engines, you can find a site that will replace the battery at a cheaper price.\nApple needs to step it up and get better, longer lasting batteries.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":722,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":717},{"endOffset":722,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":717},{"endOffset":722,"mention":"Apple","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_III"],"startOffset":717}]}
