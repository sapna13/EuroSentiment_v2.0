{"text":"By far the best MP3 player I've ever used\nThis review will contain some comparisons to other MP3 players (mainly the Rio Nitrus) for interested consumers.\nIf you want to know exclusively about the iPod, you'll find that here too!  RIO VS. IPOD  For Christmas I was given a Rio Nitrus (1.5 GB) and was extremely pleased with it.\nHowever I looked up some consumer reviews online only to find out it had the shortest warranty of any MP3 player on the market, and was notorious for having poor customer service and completely breaking after 90 days (when the warranty expires, surprise, surprise).\nI still have my Nitrus and stand by it so far - a month has nearly passed and it's still working flawlessly.\nHowever after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority.\nFor a sleeker, smaller and more \"average\" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.\nIt \"feels\" much more professional and well built - the clickable scroller, for example, is a brilliant invention and I never feel as if I'm going to perhaps break it or snap it off (as I sometimes did with the Nitrus).\nTHE CONS OF THE IPOD  There are a few advantages to the Nitrus.\nYou can transfer music from one PC to the other.\nHowever, with the iPod you cannot.\nThe music MUST be on your computer.\nIf you plug your iPod into a PC and try to upload music\/etc. it won't work.\nSomeone told me that he had a 40 GB iPod, and after his computer crashed he lost his paid iTunes music files.\nThey were on his iPod, but the device would not let him upload the files onto his new computer; and after he tried, the iTunes software deleted the files from his iPod, assuming they were stolen (?).\nAlso, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT.\nConsidering the fact that just about any CD you purchase and \"rip\" to your hard drive will be formatted as a WMA file, iTunes version 4.5 (included with new iPod releases) contains an auto-converter that converts WMA to MP3 for iPod compatability.\nMy only nitpick with this is that it sometimes doesn't work on certain files and presents error messages.\nI had similar trouble with my Soundgarden CD - the ripped tracks continually failed to convert properly to MP3.\nSo, I downloaded another program (Switch freeware) and manually changed the WMA files to MP3, then downloaded them to the iPod.\nThe problem with this is that a) it takes a LOT of time if you have many files and b) audio quality is somewhat lost (if you're an audiophile, this will bother you - frankly, I can't tell the difference).\nAlso, I don't like how when I first set up my iPod, it took me about four hours to get everything going - the new iTunes software has an exploited flaw which is that if you do not connect your iPod to your PC during installation, it will not configure the iPod, and when you later plug it into your computer the PC will recognize it as an external device rather than an actual iPod, and you will not be able to use the iTunes software until you access your device manager and change the iPod \"hard drive\" to a new letter.\nIf this sounds confusing, just make sure you have your iPod plugged in when you install the iTunes software!\nThis seems obvious but the flaw lies herein: the instruction booklet tells users to charge their iPods 2 - 4 hours before initial use.\nIn the meantime, users will obviously begin to install their software - and since the charger takes up the underbelly of the iPod and USB connection to the computer, it's impossible to hook it up to your PC during installation without unplugging the charge adapter and actually turning the iPod on - which we're not supposed to do for 2 - 4 hours!\nConfused yet? Don't be.\nThis is really the only downside to the iPod - setting it up and downloading music.\nThe actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.\nTHE PROS  The bad ends here, because as far as I'm concerned the rest of...well...everything concering the iPod is an enormous PLUS!\nThe design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days).\nThe battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.\nThe list is endless.\nThe entire database is set up flawlessly and really works well.\nI love scrolling through the menus - that may sound strange but that's how FUN using the iPod actually is!\nThe!  sound quality is great.\nThe included earphones are pretty good - my advice?\nDon't apply the black cushioned protectors.\nFirst of all, no one does this and it will make you stand out and look \"uncool.\"\nJust kidding.\nBut really, EVERYONE I've seen with an iPod leaves them off.\nBut unlike most fashion statements (if this could indeed be seen as one?) this concept is a logical one - the black cushions often cover up the letters on the earbuds that designate whether they're for your left or right ear.\nI had to constantly peel mine off to see which was which, so I finally just got rid of the cushions and don't even notice the difference.\nThe ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.\nAs mentioned above, accessing songs is simultaneously easy and fun.\nWith the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive.\nThis is good for the businessmen who listen to music on their commute and can rely on the iPod to even carry around some of their word documents.\nI'm sure future generations of the iPod will be able to carry much more, probably even videos.\nAlso included in the \"games\" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs.\nThe game plays a segment of a song, and gives you a multiple-choice list wherein you have a short period of time to choose the title of the song from a list of others.\nWhat's great about this is that it's a game based on YOUR music.\nWhen I first saw \"music trivia quiz\" I thought it was some pre-programmed elitist thing - it's not.\nIt's a lot of fun and really tests your reflexes.\nIt's a good way to pass the time.\n20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a \"dock station\" and double storage space (10,000 songs).\nCons of the 40 GB: Much more expensive just for some extra space and a docking station, both of which you don't really need.\nThink about it for a minute - the 20 GB holds 5,000 songs: more than you're ever likely to need at any one time.\nIf you want to add more, just delete some that you haven't been listening to recently.\nI mean, for music buffs and archivists - use your PC as the archive, not the iPod!\nIt's just my personal advice but you're saving a lot of money and from personal experience the docking station is really sort of a rip-off - based on the sleek design of the iPod, it's very easy to simply lay it down without damaging it or anything.\nOverall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.\nAt $290 (the price I paid) it's quite a bargain.\nMy ONLY complaint thus far is the process of downloading tracks to the iPod itself - the iTunes software is really a hassle, above all else the whole concept of WMA and the faulty built-in converter\n.  But the iPod itself is totally flawless as far as I'm concerned, and the best MP3 player on the market.\nWhether you're on the go or just want to lounge around the house listening to music, you could definitely do much, much worse than purchasing this durable and reliable product from Apple.\n","annotations":[{"endOffset":96,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":93},{"endOffset":96,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":93},{"endOffset":433,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":430},{"endOffset":440,"mention":"player","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Player_Project"],"startOffset":434},{"endOffset":1169,"mention":"CONS","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/SCons"],"startOffset":1165},{"endOffset":1247,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1242},{"endOffset":1318,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1313},{"endOffset":1318,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1313},{"endOffset":1318,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1313},{"endOffset":1517,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1511},{"endOffset":1523,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1518},{"endOffset":1517,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1511},{"endOffset":1523,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":1518},{"endOffset":1657,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1651},{"endOffset":1657,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":1651},{"endOffset":1751,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":1748},{"endOffset":1751,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":1748},{"endOffset":1809,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1802},{"endOffset":1809,"mention":"Windows","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/OpenWindows"],"startOffset":1802},{"endOffset":2080,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":2077},{"endOffset":2321,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":2318},{"endOffset":2415,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":2412},{"endOffset":2415,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":2412},{"endOffset":2415,"mention":"MP3","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MP3_Rocket"],"startOffset":2412},{"endOffset":2776,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":2770},{"endOffset":3081,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":3075},{"endOffset":3276,"mention":"iTunes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/ITunes"],"startOffset":3270},{"endOffset":3355,"mention":"booklet","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nokia_Booklet_3G"],"startOffset":3348},{"endOffset":3876,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":3871},{"endOffset":4378,"mention":"music","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Wii_Music"],"startOffset":4373},{"endOffset":4485,"mention":"composer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mozilla_Composer"],"startOffset":4477},{"endOffset":4485,"mention":"composer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mozilla_Composer"],"startOffset":4477},{"endOffset":4485,"mention":"composer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mozilla_Composer"],"startOffset":4477},{"endOffset":4840,"mention":"black","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Twisted_Metal:_Black"],"startOffset":4835},{"endOffset":5134,"mention":"black","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Twisted_Metal:_Black"],"startOffset":5129},{"endOffset":5134,"mention":"black","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Twisted_Metal:_Black"],"startOffset":5129},{"endOffset":5134,"mention":"black","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Twisted_Metal:_Black"],"startOffset":5129},{"endOffset":5391,"mention":"ease","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/At_Ease"],"startOffset":5387},{"endOffset":5603,"mention":"Microsoft
