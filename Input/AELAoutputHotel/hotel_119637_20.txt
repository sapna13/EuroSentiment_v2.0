{"text":"*** Buyer Beware*** My husband and I brought my mom and dad to The Nob Hill Hotel because of the nice verbage and great pictures on their website. BUYER BEWARE- We showed up to what was supposed to be a  serene  neighborhood and well, far from it. Parking was a complete disaster as well as the hot moldy smell permeating throughout the hotel, our room was no joke 8' X 6' wide, dirty and smelly. We talked about it and decided that we did not want to spend the money to stay here. So we then spoke to the front desk and let her know that we were not satisfied. She said that she had no control and that we would have to talk to the  General Manager by phone who was extremely unprofessional and the only answer he had for our concerns were  people pay $500.00 a night to stay here and  you should have made reservations at the taj maha l he said he could not refund our money because we booked it through hotels.com and not through him and he had to pay a commission. Then we brought to his attention that my parents had booked directly throught the hotel and he then swayed his innitial comment and said  well, it's against hotel policy by giving refunds  and then hung up the phone without a simple upgrade or apology. We felt very mistreated by the manager and we highly recommend that you don't waste your time at the Nob Hill Hotel. Their are so many other affordable hotels around there with a better location and a more friendly staff. Good Luck :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":101,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":97}]}
