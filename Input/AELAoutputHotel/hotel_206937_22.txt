{"text":"Great 50th weekend! We stayed in Barcelona for 4 nights in January 2007 and would highly recommend the Crystal Palace. The staff were very helpful, the hotel was clean and well cared for, recently refurbished, and the rooms were ample in size and a great location for the underground system, tourist bus and La Ramblas.Some minor niggles about the hotel were that the room was so warm that you needed the window open all night, which was OK as there wasn't any significant street noise. If you like hot food for breakfast then there wasn't a great choice - frankfurter sausage, fatty bacon, sloppy scrambled eggs and half tomatoes with a bit of cheese on, however there were ample cereals; cakes; fruit; croissants; yoghurts etc. which more then made up for the poor hot food choices. Don't expect a great view if you have a room at the back of the hotel as 1st-8th floors look onto the back of a building. Poor amount of hanging space if you are going for longer than a few nights - just one small single wardrobe providing coat hangers that unclip from the rail, and x3 small drawers. Take a kettle if you like a cuppa first thing in the morning too as this hotel doesn't provide one.None of the above spoilt our holiday, as I said these were just minor niggles, overall this is a great hotel in a superb location - between the Pg de Gracia and Rbla de Catalunya, only about 5 mins walk to the Placa Catalunya where the tourist bus, ticket office is and where you can pick up both the blue and red line buses, also the top of La Rambla. There are 2 metro stations close to the hotel's street on Pg de Gracia + a tourist bus stop for the red line (which you need to visit the Segrada Familia)We had a wonderful time in Barcelona and found their transport system so refreshingly organised and easy to use. Looking forward to our next visit!
