{"text":"Great Hotel, Helpful Staff My friend and I (two 20 something girls from NYC) booked our trip for Labor Day weekend. We stayed for 4 nights. From the moment we arrived at the hotel, the staff was friendly and helpful. They suggested restaurants, shopping and booked our tours of the rainforest (El Yunque) and Old San Juan. The doormen were polite and always quick to ask if we needed a taxi. PROS: Beautiful hotel; stylish, modern rooms; refrigerator, cable tv, and safe in the room. Hotel spa with hot tub that I luxuriated in while awaiting my massage. Hotel shop with lots of candy, soda, etc. Great location; it's between Old San Juan and Condado; and behind the hotel is Escambron Beach. The beach is literally behind the hotel and to the left. (takes less than 2 min to walk; i walked there each day in my suit  flip flops; hotel has special exit at rear for the beach) So I don't know what the other reviewers are complaining about. There's a great beach nearby, the hotel just doesn't have it's own personal beach. It's also a 5 min. taxi ride to Old San Juan ($10) and close to a restarant on the beach (2 min walk) and the restaurants in the Hilton Hotel which is just next door.CONS: Most of the exercise equipment was broken. My friend got her eyebrows waxed in the spa and it looked terrible. The handle on the bathroom door and the shower lever fell of repeatedly. The hotel shop was ridiculously overpriced. A can of Sprite was $2.00! When they booked our tours, they told us they ended at 2:30PM when they really ended at 4:30PM, which pissed us off b\/c we wouldn't have taken more than one if we'd known they would take up our whole day. The 24\/hr hotel restaurant was super expensive and had a limited menu. We ordered room service, a $13 plate of shrimp appetizer...ended up costing $26.00 with tax, delivery fee, plus predetermined gratuity! And there were only 3 shrimp on the plate! What a rip off! And they don't even have ice cream in the hotel! ;-) Also of all the restaurants that are supposed to be in the hotel, only 1 of them were open the whole time we were there. And the worst part: the body pillow on our bed smelled like urine!!!!Overall: As much as I've complained, it was still a good experience. Our room was clean, for the most part and the staff was helpful. We also liked the location.
