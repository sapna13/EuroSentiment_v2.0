{"text":"Don't believe the publicity... If you read about this hotel on the Starwood website or any others for that matter, you will see their PR makes a great deal about the stunning architecture, interior and terrific location of this hotel.Firstly you would need to be a contortionist to appreciate the architecture of this hotel as it is shoehorned into a tacky side street a block away from Times Square from which the only sign that a hotel is on the site is the apologetic entrance at street level. From that entrance (20 yards from which you will se the delights of drunks sleeping on the sidewalk) you need to take an escalator to the lobby which is rather grey and unwelcoming. The rooms are fairly small but clean and bathrooms adequate. Views from the 40th floor are trumpeted as stunning but, as high as we were, I was unable to see anything of interest save for rooftops of adjacent hotels\/office blocks.Also - don't get carried away by the concept of having a 'club room'. The 'club' facilities were housed in a smallish room on the 8th floor where an inadequate breakfast and sparse evening canapes are served. Waste of money!As regards location, Times Square is local to most NY tourist attractions but don't spoil your vacation by staying there - it is very very unpleasant during the daytime and slightly threatening after dark. There are hundreds of hotels in NY that don't suffer the disadvantages of the Westin - book one of those instead. ","annotations":[]}
