{"text":"This place is AWESOME! Don't believe the bad reviews this place is awesome. We just returned from our honeymoon May 30- Jun 6, 2008. I wanted to write a review as soon as I got back.  We arrived on a Friday, when we got to the hotel check-in was a breeze. We booked a Platinum package(definately the way to go). The hotels website didn't have any platinum packages available, but we were able to book one on Bookit.com.  I am in the food business, so good food is important to me! The food here was good. It's not great and it's not San Francisco or New Orleans, but the food is good. Even finicky eaters will find something they like here. The ala carte restaurants were better than the buffet, generally, but the buffet was good as well. We also got married at the resort. It was a wonderful experience. The staff could not do enough for us! Even when it was raining the day we got married they moved us from the beach to the lobby and made everything great. I can't say enough about the staff at the Punta Cana Princess. One thing we did was take alot of 1's and 5's in US currency and tipped everybody. We were treated like kings. What most Americans don't understand is if you treat people with the respect they deserve in THEIR COUNTRY, they in turn will treat you with courtesy and respect. I have traveled all over the world and the Dominican people are some of the best we've ever encountered. If you want to have a great no stress vacation book the Punta Cana Princess!!!!!!!!!
