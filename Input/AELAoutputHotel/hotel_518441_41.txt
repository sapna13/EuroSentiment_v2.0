{"text":"Do not stay anywhere else. Paradise on earth! We stayed at the Chedi Club for 5 nights in May as part of our honeymoon. We had just spent a night at the 4 seasons - which is an absolutely spectacular place to stay - and at first were slightly disappointed by the quality of the buildings and felt that the resort was not quite as striking as the 4 seasons. However, our pool villa was beautiful, very modern, with beautiful furniture. The main pool is beautiful an has lovely views over the mountains and is perfect for proper swimming. Service is outstanding with non-stop treats: flower filled baths, free laundry, free limo service to Ubud, free yoga classes every morning, beautiful restaurant in the middle of the rice paddies. I could go on. This place is extremely special: it employs where possible people from the local community (the musicians come from the local 'music village'), their rice fields are organic, and there is just an incredibly warm athmosphere in the whole resort. Looking back, we would much rather stay there than the 4 seasons. This place has a wonderful soul to it, and we felt so at home. Would definitely stay there if we returned. One thing to note: our butler was absolutely lovely, but a little overbearing at first, wanting to organise everything for us, and checking on us far too many times a day. However, he sorted out scooter rental for us, it was wonderful being free to whizz around the Ubud area at our leisure; and was wonderfully kind and pleasant. We should have booked it for 10 rather than 5 nights! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":73,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":69}]}
