{"text":"Wonderful vacation We just returned Feb.4 after 2 beautiful weeks here. The landscaping is nice and tropical and very clean. The workers are constantly cleaning and trimming. We stayed in the centre, villa 15 and liked the location. Not far from the lobby or the beach. We never used the tram because it was so nice to walk. The food at the buffets were alright but I much preferred the alacartes. We went to the Mexican, Japanese, Garden Grill and French . They were all so good. We had lots of fun on the beach everyday especially with the big waves. I enjoyed the aerobics and dancing to the Bahia song. Im so glad I purchased the CD to bring home. The bartenders and waitresses are all lots of fun, whether your at the beach or the pools. They work very hard to please the people. We did enjoy the nightly shows. I think they are far better then what people are saying. They are very talented people. The Michael Jackson show is the best. Our maid was very sweet and always decorated the room with flowers or balloons. Always had plenty of towels and cold drinks in the room. We tipped her daily. We did the outback safari and had a great time with Papa Bill. He knew everything. Overall we all liked the resort. Of course the animation people make it fun for everyone. My favourite was Ricardo. Its the dominican people that make this country so nice to come back to. We will return again next year for our 4th visit to this wonderful country. ","annotations":[]}
