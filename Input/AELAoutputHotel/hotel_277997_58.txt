{"text":"Not for the business traveler I would not receommend this hotel for a business traveler. I stayed at this hotel for a business meeting that was to take place at the hotel. I stayed in the hotel part of the resort. First of all, there was no wireless internet. I found this a terrible inconvienance. The only internet connection was found at the desk which was in a different room than the bed. I prefer to work on the bed. Further, when I tried to connect to the internet, it did not work. After spending 20 minutes on hold with IT, I was told it was a hotel problem and nothing they could fix. There were no vending machines. I am supposing they wanted to encourage you to use the minibar. However, be careful with the minibar charges. I found out on my bill a week later (after looking at my ebill on the website) that I was charged for way more than the water that I took. It took several phone calls to rectify that situation. Another reviewer talked about room service but I could not find anywhere where there was room service. I was forced to eat at the worst mexican restaurant in history which was a restaurant choice at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel for people on vacation and people with families. There are pools and a variety of restaurants on the property that would make it very convienant for the vacation traveler. Of course I have to admit that the vacation traveler is what this hotel was intended for. However, they have many conference rooms and business rooms for meetings and I am sure they get plenty of complaints from business travelers. ","annotations":[]}
