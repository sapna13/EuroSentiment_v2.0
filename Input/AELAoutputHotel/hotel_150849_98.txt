{"text":"Fantastic Hotel  Just returned form a fantastic holiday at the Riu Bambu in Bavaro, Punta Cana. The reviews on this site lately have been very mixed but here is my experience as a 1st timer in Dom Rep.I was dreading the 9hr flight from Manchester UK but we flew with Thomson fly and the whole experience was great. We were well looked after on the plane, given 2 good meals and the usual drinks etc but the best part to keep everyone entertained was the seatback tv sets on which you could watch films, comedy and drama programmes etc. I actually didn't have time to read my book or magazine!.On arrival at punta cana airport we got our luggage within 20 minutes and the transfer to the hotel was only 30 minutes. All very smooth which is what you need after a long flight.When we arrived at the Riu Bambu we just thought WOW! It was absolutely amazing. The check in process was quick, friendly and we were given a welcome cocktail before the porter took our luggage to the room.The room had 2 double beds and a single, a clean well equipped bathroom and we were more than happy. It also had a fully stocked fridge with water, pepsi, beer and other soft drinks as well as full optics. The whole grounds are full of palm trees and tropical flowers and are just 2 minutes grom the glorious beach.When we 1st saw the beach it felt as though we were in paradise. The sand was white and fine like talcum powder and the sea a gorgeous blue and so clean. The beach was spotless and there was never any fight for sunbeds no matter what the time of day. There was always a lovely breeze and shade under the coconut palms if you needed it. There were free pedaloes, canoes and small sailing catamarans on the beach too.The pool area was equally impressive. The swim up bar always very popular! Lots of activities for all ages going on if you want to join in. The whole staff worked so hard and were always eager to please.We always ate in the colonnial buffet restaurant as I had read on this site that the a la carte restaurants were not worth getting up early to book. Here we found the buffet excellent every day. Spotlessly clean and a fantastic variety of dishes to suit every taste. Those who have can find any fault with the food must be very very fussy! The waiters were excellent always keeping your drinks topped up and clearing away dirty plates etc. They always greeted you with a smile and a 'Ola' or 'Buenos Dias' This applied to all the hotel staff from the manager to the bar tenders to the cleaning staff.The drinks were mainly local alcohol but if you wanted smirnoff or gordons for gin etc you just had to ask. If you gave the barman a 1 dollar bill you would find another refill before you had finished your drink! We thought it was nice being able to walk along the beach and call at the other Riu hotels for a drink or a swim, however we did think our hotel was the nicest. Carribbean Street is just a 10 min walk along the beach and has some lovely little souvenir shops and a pizzeria overlooking the sea which you can again eat and drink in for free as part of your all inclusive deal.All in all the weather was superb and we couldn't fault the hotel apart from the fact that the evening entertainment was a little 'cheesy' but lots of families with younger children seemed to enjoy that. We also didn't spend anything except a few dollars on tipping the maids and the barmen.Would definitely recommend the Bambu and this beautiful resort and hope to return again soon.Anyone thinking of booking - don't hesitate just do it - you won't be disappointed, and if you want to contact me with any questions please do so.
