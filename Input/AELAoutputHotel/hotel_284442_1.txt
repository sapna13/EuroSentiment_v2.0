{"text":"Perfect stay at a beautiful resort I also lived on Oahu many years ago in Waipahu and Ewa Beach so I had an idea of the area - and we wanted to visit friends  tour the island so the location suited us. I admit a little hesitance in staying at the Makaha Resort Golf Club after reading some of the reviews here - but the price was right and I didn't mind the additional driving. Have to say....our stay was FANTASTIC! The room was nice enough, comfortable and quiet....over in Q block. Great views and beautiful grounds. The staff were absolutely tops, very warm nice people all. The cleaning staff did a great job cleaning up after us (Thanks Christina - Linda says hi!). Yes, it is a little bit of a walk...through pleasant well-maintained landscaping...to the parking lot. I timed it and we were in the furthest corner...four minutes max....for oldies it may be a bit of hike...but the carts can get you there if you're not up to the walk. Yes we had a gecko or two in the room...but we don't mind....it is the tropics...I get them in the house here sometimes...Lots of birds at the resort too, the odd mongoose, etc...so some interesting things to see.We ate out all the time as we were on a bit of a budget with the AUD plummeting so no idea about the restaurant....no problems at all with the locals in the area either at the beaches, stores, or eateries...If anything they were very friendly to us...I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this resort. Great value...probably the best rates on the island! Looking forward to going there again - and I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else.
