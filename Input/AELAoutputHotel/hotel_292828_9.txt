{"text":"Wonderful stay in a great neigborhood! My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon before going on a Mediterranean cruise. What a great choice! First off, we were not looking for the goofy honeymoon suite with a silly lip- or heart-shaped tub - we were more into seeing and doing on our trip while relaxing in the evenings and sleeping in late. So, first off, all the staff in the hotel were very kind and helpful. Thierry helped us with our bags and was very helpful with some places to eat late night since we didn't arrive until about 10:30pm, but then again, that's normal dinner time for Barcelona, eh? The ask me service guy was awesome, too (sorry I can't remember his name right now - Stefan, maybe?), but he was truly great - provided many maps and options for getting around\/touring no matter what your tastes are. The hotel itself is in a great location - not very far from a dropoff point at Placa Catalunya from the airport shuttle. The location is close to a couple Gaudi apt. blocks - including Casa Batllo. There are great restaurants nearby, but we really liked eating in the Born district - cool part of town not too far away via either Metro or bus. The room was made out in a Mod style - very nicely done. Room was quiet, bed was nice and big and comfy which pleased us. It was also low in case that is a concern - it did not bother us (we liked it), but elderly folks might care about it. The room was spacious, had a nice view of the paseo and nice, mod bathroom with both a stand alone shower and a separate bathtub. I will agree with other posts that the lighting system is odd, but Thierry helped us out with it upon entry. It's nothing to be concerned with - it's just not the normal on\/off switch, but it actually works pretty well to suit your dimming\/lighting needs and to save energy.The breakfast options were AWESOME here and we loved the style of the hotel. We didn't think the lift (elevator) was loud at all and we didn't hear a peep from anyone else. In fact, I think we may have only seen 1 or 2 other guests while staying here. We had the best time, felt very comfortable, and the staff were very helpful and kind! Great place! We would definitely come back!Also, if you're not in command of your Spanish, not to worry, everyone there speaks very good English and I believe French as well. The pictures that have been submitted are quite accurate.Wonderful hotel with a great view, great staff, and great location at a great deal!
