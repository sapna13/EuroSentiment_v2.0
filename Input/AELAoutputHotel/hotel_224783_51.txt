{"text":"Excellent location in downtown Seattle, service uneven I just returned from a weekend away at the Grand Hyatt-Seattle. Here is my breakdown of the hotel.Pro's-1) Able to check in early, arrived at 12 pm and the front desk graciously let us check-in. She even had a smile on her face and was very professional2) Ruth's Chris has a tremendous happy hour menu and is attached to the lobby of the Hyatt. Great place and SO much better than the usual hotel restaurants3) The bathrooms are incredible. My room on the 20th floor had both a bathtub and walk in shower. 4) The 32 inch LG LCD tv was a plus5) The beds are very comfortable. (but not as great as the Marriot beds)6) The concierge Scott was a good guy and very helpful Con's1) Upon check-out, my friend asked the bell-hop to bring the bags out of the temporary storage to him. He brought the 3 bags to him while I was at the Concierge and it looked as if the bags were just dropped down in a reckless manner. Also, the porter didn't offer to help us with our bags to the cab and just went back to 'stand at attention'. The experience only affirms my belief that it's best to always handle your own bags at all times.2) There were two staff members 'standing at attention' in the lobby, but NOT opening doors or offering to help you with your bags in a gracious way. I was reminded of the Vegas 'tip for everything' mentality rather than feeling that the staff was genuinely eager to help. I tend to appreciate when people are a bit more pro-active.
