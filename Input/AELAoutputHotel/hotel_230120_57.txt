{"text":"Very disappointed in this Sofitel My wife and I usually love staying at Sofitels, however this one is worth skipping! Even though it has a prime location and is easy walking distance to many key attractions (including the red light district if you are interested in that sort of thing). The hotel itself leaves something to be desired. First of all, the parking situation: If you are driving, do not stay in this area AT ALL! It is very tricky to get around and they are doing a lot of road construction in the area. Once you do get to the parking area it is a ways down the street and it was not very enjoyable dragging our suit cases from the car. What I was most upset about was cost of the parking. We are not strangers to parking in European city centers, however, when we found the cost of parking was 40 euros we were a bit upset, especially since the website does not bother to mention the cost.Next, the rooms: The rooms were quite nice except for the noise and the lighting. We had every available light turned on and the room was still very dark, and that was during the day. We could also hear a lot of noise from our neighbors and from above us. We skipped breakfast for 2 reasons. First, we were tired of eating big breakfasts (this was our last night of a month long trip in Europe). Secondly, the price 22 Euros\/person. A steep ransom for eggs, cheese and cold cuts.Another turnoff for us was the surroundings. As soon as you step outside the hotel you are in the thick of what makes Amsterdam not-so-charming, the sex and drugs! We are not prudes, but we both feel that Amsterdam could be one of the Europe's most charming, attractive cities if they got rid of the red light area and the drugs. But because of these, there seems to be a layer of scum on the city that can't be scraped off and is always a distraction no matter where you go in Amsterdam. ","annotations":[]}
