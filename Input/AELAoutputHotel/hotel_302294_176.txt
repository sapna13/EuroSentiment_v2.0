{"text":"The Pan Pacific - Cool, Quite and Convenient and definately worth Consideration Due to the lack of double beds at the Mandarin Oriental, we decided to stay at he Pan Pacific and it was an excellent choice.We were in Singapore to celebrate my wife's 40th birthday and our 1st Wedding Anniversary.Check-in was quick and efficient and the Hotel kindly upgraded our room as it was my wife's birthday. They sent a delicious Cake and flowers to our room on the day of her birthday which was a nice touch.The Rooms are nice and airy with a huge comfortable bed. Floor to celing window means you can see Singapore out side and the views are great.All the rooms have wireless Internet access and you can use the Business floor if you need to but this can be a bit expensive.The hotel staff are excellent and polite. We didn't have to call anyone for anything the whole time we were there. Sit out in shaded comfort and have some food at Brunch on the 4th Floor, The pool is just around the corner, They do all-day breakfast for those that missed breakfast, which we did everyday!!!The Indian restaraunt Rang Mahal was closed for refurbishement, but all the food places were execellent as wellThe Atruim Bar can get very busy after 5.00pm but its a cool place to have a drinks and chill out and listen to the live musicThe hotel is in a really good location, right next to two malls, Marina Plaza and Suntec City Mall, the later being the bigger and having a superb selection of restaurants.We would definately stay here again and would have no hesitation in recommending this to any readers out thereThe City Hall MRT station is a short walk away and if you cut through the City Link Mall, you can get to it in air-conditioned comfort.Buy an EZ-Link Pass if you plan to use the MRT as it will save you money and if you hand it in after you finish with it you get 3SD back plus any money still left on the card.Things to do while in Singapore:Sentosa Island - Go by Cable car and wonder around the island. Go during the week to avoid the crowdsChinatown\/Little India - experience some of the culture and shoppingBukit Timah Nature Reserve Trek through the only tropical Rainforest in Singapore.Take lots of water and prepare to climb lots of stepsNight Safari Fun and well organised night out to see some of the animals that you dont normally get to see.
