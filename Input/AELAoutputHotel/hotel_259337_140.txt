{"text":"Don't waste your money!!! We have just returned from a trip at the Grand Palladium Bavaro Resort. We were a family of 7 in three jr. suites. The suites were mediocre. One of them had ants in the bathroom. They changed out sheets twice in 9 days. We never had enough towels to shower with. When you call the lobby, no one helps. They hardly speak English, and they seem annoyed if you ask for something.The staff was not friendly. The service at the restaurants leaves something to be desired. Only a couple of waitresses and waiters in the morning at the buffet were nice. We were told that we had 3 hotels to use and to choose meals from. When we went to book our appointments for dinner; we were informed that there were only 3 nights of a la carte. All the rest were buffet. So for 9 days, we had breakfast, lunch and dinner at buffet, except for the 3 dinners. The service at the a la carte was horrendous. They don't explain anything or speak to you. The food was horrible. We've travelled to lots of different places-Jamaica, Florida, Mexico, Bahamas. There was no comparison to any ot them. We must have walked an equivalent of 100 miles to try and get around the resort. Everything was so far away. We were told we would have ocean view. There is no ocean view. You can't even see the beach from the pool. The pool was dirty. There were tiles missing. There were leaves and dirt floating around, and they always had a hose in the pool. They left it in all day. Nothing is air conditioned except the room and the gift shop. There is no room service. The sports bar is a joke. There was junk food, no games to play, 1 pool table with 1 stick and not enough balls. Bring lots of bug repellent because you will be eaten by mosquitoes all night in your room. We were on an Apple Tour which was totally useless. Any time you went to the representative Julia, she said take it up with your travel agent. We arrived on Sunday July 14 and immediately made reservations for dinner. We were told they were almost all booked already, and could'nt get our first reservation until Wednesday. When we went to the 3 dinners, there were always plenty of empty tables. It was such a disappointment. We planned the trip 6 months in advance and spent a lot of money. The only nice thing were the grounds with the palm trees and flamingos. Even the weather was lousy. It rains every day, sometimes all day. I would never recommend this hotel or Punta Cana.
