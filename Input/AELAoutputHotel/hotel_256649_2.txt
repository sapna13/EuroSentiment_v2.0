{"text":"Great! Exceeded expectations We stayed for 4 nights in a 2 bedroom pyrmont view apartment. We arrived early (about 9.30am)  did not expect to be able to check in but our room was already available  we were promptly  efficiently checked in to our room. The porters at this hotel I have to say need a special mention they are courteous  very efficient, our luggage arrived to our room promptly. The 2 bedroom apartment was spacious  had 2 bathrooms a real bonus when you have 4 adults  an 18 month old staying. Plenty of room for my little daughter to run around  2 lcd tvs to watch, 1 in the lounge  1 in the master bedroom. The kitchen was spacious had a full sized fridge  plenty of crockery  utentsils. The pyrmont view I have to say was great, unless you really want a view of the harbour then the pyrmont view rooms are just as nice (good for plane watchers) Check out was just as efficient  when our taxi had not arrived the concierge was on the phone chasing it up without us even prompting, a very welcome service. The star city complex is huge with heaps of eating places of different standards  prices  the best part about star city is the access -light rail station right there which you can take into town  interchange with the monorail as required. Found this fantastic for getting around with a child also. Best value if you get on the light rail  get a 7 day metroconnect pass $28 gives you unlimited light rail  monorail travel for 7 days -even if you are staying less it is still a lot cheaper than the $15 day pass that you buy from the monorail. All in all I would highly recommend star city apartments to anyone wanting self contained accommodation in a great location of a very good standard. Add the good service on top of that as a bonus  I'm definately staying here next time I am in Sydney ","annotations":[]}
