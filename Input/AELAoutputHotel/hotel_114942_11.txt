{"text":"A terrific place to stay in Dallas. Whenever I go to Dallas on business, I stay here. I picked this hotel the first time because of the location (the downstairs lobby connects to my company's Dallas office, convenient to say the least). Now I stay there because I really like the rooms.First of all, this is an old and elegant hotel. The lobby pretty much tells you what you should expect from the rest of your stay.The rooms are large compared to many business hotels in NYC or Los Angeles, maybe everything is bigger in Texas after all. The decor is a little surprising when you enter because the rest of the hotel has that old elegance. The rooms have an incredibly light and warm design that makes you feel like you are in one of those resort hotels on the Gulf Coast of Florida with a lot of pastels.The amenities are what you would expect from a decent hotel but what really sold me on this hotel is the peace and quiet. I know I've stayed at this hotel in January and in September, but it never seems to be full. I almost never see any other guests, and I never, ever hear them. Talk about a place you can have a good night's sleep.The one advice I have is to avoid the pseudo-country casual bar downstairs. The food is wretched and the drinks are nothing to talk about. Take a few steps away from the hotel and there are tons of great places to go. ","annotations":[]}
