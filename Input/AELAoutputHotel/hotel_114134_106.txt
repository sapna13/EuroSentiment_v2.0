{"text":"Charming, immaculate and perfectly located. Stayed here on various occasion 6-7 years ago and I have to say the Hotel had not lost its genuine old world charm during this stay. Immaculate throughout from the small lobby, to the upmarket City bar and the ever so smart tall ceilined but expensive Azure restaurant where on this visit was a dissappointment which must have shown on my face as the appetizer was removed from the bill without me saying a word so maybe this was a one off. My corner room complete with fireplace was as always quite luxurious and spacious, generously furnished including sofa, upmarket radio with ipod connection, magnificent curtains. Other nice touches are free internet connection, extensive choice of TV channels, free daily water ration and high quality bathroom toiletries. The dim night light in the bathroom is something that others should adopt. No minibar which is fine by me, no coffee maker but the best Starbucks in town is literally across the road. Corner rooms all seem to be larger than non corners but not to worry as the hotel is E shaped. The hotel is also home to the pleasant small and lively Irish bar Solas. Great location just a 2 minute walk from Copley Square green line subway station, Newbury Street and dozens of restaurants. Car parking available next door in the underground Prudential complex although most folk seem to use the hotel valet service. Taxi to Logan is about $30-35 and 15-25 mins, subway is $2 and about 45 mins via green and blue lines. Downside is some of the rooms can suffer street noise and the daily emptying of the bins. Just squeezed a 5* rating. Shame no loyalty points.
