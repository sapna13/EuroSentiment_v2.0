{"text":"Ok Hotel Hotel is located on a very busy roads, we were on the 11th floor and were awoke by road noise each morning - early!! Not very nice when you are on holidays. Tried to use Marriott Uk Pound vouchers on check-in which the clerk stated they did not accept - strange as the vouchers state they are accepted at 2600 hotels. After pointing this out the clerk who referred this to the FO manager Barbara who said that they did not accept foreign currencies etc but would check with their accounts dept on Monday 2 days after my checkin and get back to me. An international hotel in downtown SFO not accepting foreign currancies strange - especially as they were vouchers issued by Marriott themselves. Eventually they were accepted but at a rip off rate of 1.79$ to 1√ä√£¬¢. Would not stay again due to location. Only stayed here as the SFO Marriott was undergoing a refurbishment and did not want to be woken by noise in the morning.Breakfast was ok and staff friendly in the restaurant. which only opened for breakfast. Very limited restuarant service for dinner in the bar area with very poor seating and tv's showing sports channels.Noticed parking very expensive( seems to be typical in SFO hotels) - try parking in local lots near the hotel which are just down the street and cheaper.Booked a suite which was basic but spacious. Was told it had been just refurbished - but had stains on the furniture and curtains. Bathroom was very basic for a suite.
