{"text":"One square block...... We arrived after a long flight from the UK really needing a bath - unfortunately, the baths in this hotel are little more than large shower trays. I was quite pleased with the smell of bleach in the bathroom and it was very clean. It wasn't until I stepped into the shower and fell heavily that I realised - the bleach was all in the bottom of the bath!Not really a good start but it did get better. The check in staff were pleasant and polite, there seems to be a constant police presence around the hotel, which makes you feel a bit safer as one block away in any direction is a bit dodgy - battling hobos and pickpockets. Stay around the hotel and the mall and take a cab if you want to travel at night.The rooms are huge, we had a vew of the hills and Hollywood sign. The beds are very comfortable and the air con works a treat!The hotel is connected to the Kodak Theatre where the Oscars are held. You will get an 'Elephant card' on arrival which entitles you to discounts at certain places in the Mall - I recommend taking the 2 for 1 theatre tour, it's worth the $15. Also, go and see a film at Graumans.We stayed on a 'Romance Package' which entitles you to free buffet breakfast and a chilled bottle of champagne on arrival - the breakfast is excellent. The chef will make omlettes and pancakes to order and the bacon and maple syrup is fab, as is the fresh fruit salad. The staff are attentive and remove plates and cutlery almost by magic, replacing them with new! The 'champagne' was a different matter - you have to call reception and they bring it up. It's not champagne, its very bad Spanish Cava. It's undrinkable, one sip burns all the way down. We went with friends and tipped their bottle away after all agreeing it was rubbish - we carried ours to the next hotel and gave it to a hobo in Beverly Hills on Thanksgiving - we only hope he traded it and didn't drink it!On the whole, a nice hotel, excellent position to do the Hollywood thing - 15 mins cab ride from Universal Studios and a 10 minute walk from the Hollywood Bowl. We would stay there again.
