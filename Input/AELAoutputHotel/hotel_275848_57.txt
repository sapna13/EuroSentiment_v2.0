{"text":"I was skeptical, but this is a really great hotel I stayed at the Hotel Globus at the end of July. Before the trip, I contacted the hotel because I read some reviews that mentioned the loud music from the dance club next door (I had booked the internet rate that does not allow you to cancel the hotel). The hotel quickly emailed me back and assured me that the dance club would be closed when I stayed there- which it was. I booked a double standard (same price as a smaller cancelable room). The room was small but what I expected for a European hotel in a big city. The room was very clean, quiet and had a view of San Lorenzo dome which was very beautiful. The air conditioning was fantastic and it felt great after a hot day of walking around in 100 degree heat! Friends that stayed in other hotels and did not have a\/c. The breakfast downstairs is really great and the location is close to the train station and all the landmarks. Other reviews mentioned that they felt the area was sketchy at night but I never had a problem - yes, the streets are narrow and dark but no one ever bothered me and I was out late several nights. Because you have to climb two flights of stairs before you get to the lobby and elevator, I would not recommend this hotel to people who might have difficulty carrying their baggage up stairs. Overall, I was very pleased with the hotel and staff.
