{"text":"Way above average service I just can't say enough about the level of service at this hotel - I've travelled extensively to some very expensive hotels and this is the best service I've encountered anywhere. They upgraded me free of charge to a beautiful canal view room which was tasteful a good size and spotless. If you're worried about noise, don't go for the canal view (could be why I got the room I guess being on the younger side of the guests staying there) - the noise on the street served as a great alarm clock in the morning. The location is great - not for charm but convenience - directly opposite the train station and very close to the bus station, also directly opposite the vaporetto, so perfect really. the ground floor which includes the breakfast area is tiny, really small and not as tastefully decorated as the rooms but it's fine. You can eat outside by the canal although it's pretty busy with people arriving with suitcases etc. although really not a problem either. The food is as good as any other hotel in Italy I've experienced, they could probably do more if they had more space. In short the crowning glory of this hotel is its staff from chamber maids, to waitress to manager, they are all genuine, cheerful but not overbearing - and the manager (I think he was the manager) could not have gone out of his way more for me or anyone else I saw him dealing with. As a woman travelling on her own I felt very safe and comfortable here. ","annotations":[]}
