{"text":"Great location but no insulation! Petite Auberge is small, quaint and decorated with a fading French flair. An older member of the Joie De Vivre group, the rooms are in dire need of redecorating. Nestled in the heart of the city, the location was perfect for me, my two teenagers and another family with kids with their active grandmother. The staff was friendly, helpful, and always available. It was good to know from the hotel reservations website that the cost of parking our rented car was included in our rate. Breakfast next door at the White Swann Inn (also included) was good enough.Buffet style fresh fruit, oatmeal, do-it-yourself toast, supermarket pastries, and surprisingly excellent coffee.Our rooms were cozy looking with their working gas fireplaces, but unfortunately freezing cold. My room on the 3rd floor turned out to be above the alley where the garbage trucks arrived at 5:45am. My friends room on the 5th floor was large and sunny (it reminded me of the top floor room at the Hotel Le Tourville in Paris), but I wish I had had a squeegee with me to clean the filthy windows. Free hot tea, coffee, cold bottles of water and sodas along with apples and cookies are always available in the inviting basement living room that serves as the hotel common area. I knew I would never return when I decided to pour some hot water for a late night tea from the carafe that the staff keeps filled. I flicked on the light in the small kitchen just off the living room to reheat the water in the microwave. Yuch, yuch, yuch. The kitchen was so dirty I was nauseated.
