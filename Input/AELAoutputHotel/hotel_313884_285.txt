{"text":"ideal for a relaxing holdiay RACHEL  JAY GREEN LIVERPOOL ENGLANDwhat can i say! This was the best holiday i have ever been on.Me and my Husband (age 24, 23) arrived here on 30 Aug 2006 For 2 weeks and loved it. Our hotel room was lovely and i could not believe the size of the bed it was massive!!! This hotel is so clean it is unbelievable i have never been to one like it before. The pool is also cleaned twice daily and was really nice, not to hot or cold just right. here is a little list on what we thought of this holidayFOOD-some people would have a moan about the food and i honestly dont know why. Breakfast was so good, you had so much to choose from it was my favorite time of the day.Lunchtime was the worst, the buffet selection for lunch was not good, me and mu Husband used to go to the beach bar for lunch which is part of the hotel and right on the beach. It serves burgers, pizza, chips stuff like that. Whilst on our stay we went to three of the restaurants which i must say werent great. Tex Mex was quite nice,the best out of the three. Chinese was apalling and Italian was worse.The buffett at night was quite good and that was were we eat most nights. The Spaghetti dishes in the Buffett put the Italian to shame.Night Life-this was virtually none existent at the PCP you had to go to the hotel next door for the show and the disco, this was no problem what so ever as the little bus(golf cart) comes every 15 mins and it takes 3 mins to get to the hotel. The shows were not our cup of tea as when the people on stage would talk to the audience it was in so many different languages you got really confused. When thay did speak English you could not understand a word that was said.the night club was ok, we went there 2 times and had a good little boogy. The beach bar in the PCP was our little local and it was really nice sitting there of a night time, the breeze was lovely and it was nice to just chill and have a few weeks.Overall-even tough some of the restaurants were not very nice it did not put us of our holiday, this is a lovely hotel and the staff are lovely too. Anyone one going to PCP will enjoy it and it is for all age groups, Me and my husband would deffinetly go back to Punta cana, and i would certainley recommend this hotel.
