{"text":"ESJ - No way! Traveled to ESJ Towers in August 2007 with 2 children, my sister, my niece (17 yrs old) and my Mom. I would absolutely return to Puerto Rico, but highly unlikely that I would return to ESJ Towers. Ok, first the good news: the towers are a 5 min trip to the airport...yet I barely heard any airport noise. The location of the towers is fantastic - very central and about a 40 min cheap bus ride straight to Old San Juan (a MUST VISIT - El Morro and the streets of Viejo San Juan - eat at El Jibarito - delicioso!) and some good restaurants nearby. You can also walk to a large grocery store (Pueblo) to do food shopping. The units have kitchens, so we had breakfast in the room and packed lunch to save us money. There is a SUPERB car rental place - Charlie's - they are local, extremely accomodating, will pick you up, clean, new cars - we were very pleased with them. Isla Verde beach is nice...I guess being of Puerto Rican decent, I am biased, but the waves were nice and it was mostly clean - just a nice, friendly vibe. Our room also had an excellent view of the beach and the sunset. We rented a car and drove to El Yunque rain forest (another must do) and the Caves of Rio Camuy (awesome).Now the bad news: AUGH - ESJ is the MOST dated and tacky place I have ever stayed. I am an easy going traveller, but c'mon, this place was screaming Scarface Miami 1970s. The lobby was awful - dark and dim, orange pleathery couches, stale smell, I didn't even want to hang out down there. The rumpus room for children looked like it was decorated by a clown on drugs - hurt my eyes to be in that room! The ping pong table was broken. The elevator to my floor never stopped if we pressed the down button, so we had to press the up button and then suffer the ride until we could go down. The carpet in my unit was always damp - especially around the A\/C closet. The bathroom badly needed a facelift. Everything was just dingy, dark, old. Getting to the beach and pool was a HUGE pain, especially with small children and an older person. Mom actually got stuck in the turnstyle - if you don't press the key code in quickly and push hard within 5 seconds - you will get stuck - thank god there were some nice guests who helped out my Mom. The grand entrance to the hotel is horrible - I thought I was actually being ushered in through the back door - not welcoming or pretty at all.Again...location is the best but a really outdated place - needs improvement.
