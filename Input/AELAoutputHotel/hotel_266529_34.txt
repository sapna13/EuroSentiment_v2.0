{"text":"Way to go, Hotel Europa! We just got back from our 1 week Portugal\/Spain trip. We stayed 3 nights at Hotel Europa, , # 404 (a triple room). Despite the unimpressive pictures on the website, I went ahead and booked this hotel. It exceeded my expectation and more. We got off from Callao station rather than Sol, so it was a bit of walk for us to get to the hotel, but it is actually only a few steps away from Sol station, so make sure you get off from Sol. Our room was very clean with wooden floor, beds made daily. Our room had 2 windows that opened to 2 balconies overseeing Calle de Carmen, where the city center is. Street noise was not an issue, however, there were loud door closing from inconsiderate neighbors. Right next to the hotel, there is a Tapas bar, the bartenders are hospitable. They did not treat us like tourist. My brother had the snails and I had a small beer. If you like arroz dishes, you should definitely try Restaurante La Barraca (Calle Reina, 29) or Restaurante de Reina (calle Reina,39), they are both on Calle de la Reina, 1 street over from and parallel to Gran Via. Try paella negro con gamgas, appetizers, sangria...I highly recommend them. Our bills came out to be less than 100 euros for 3 people for both places, it was with either wine or sangria, appetizers, soups, try Castilan Soup at La Barraca. Anyway, hotel Europa is central to everything you'd want to do in Madrid, including sight seeing, food, shopping..., everything is within walking distance in europe already but hotel eurorpa just makes everything that much more convenient and enjoyable. El Cote Inglesia (major department store) is 1 block over, Plaza Mayor only a few blocks away... you get the picture. Oh, we were able to see the bear statue from our balcony. If you need a taxi at an odd hour, have the hotel clerk call one for you.
