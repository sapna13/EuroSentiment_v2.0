{"text":"everything ship shape After reading so many horror stories on other San Juan hotels, I booked the Embassy Suites for the first few nights with the plan to check out some other (cheaper, closer to town) places after I landed. This Embassy Suites is right near the airport. I did not hear airplane noise. Everything here worked perfectly and was clean and ready for me. The hotel is beautiful and well maintained. There was horrific noise in the 8-story atrium most nights, either from the local band at the bar or the large banquet parties booked every night. BUT...the living room of the suite acted as a buffer, and when I went into the bedroom with the door shut, I couldn't hear a thing. The internet access was free, but when I logged on the first time it said I would be charged $10 per day. (I was not charged, just confused.)This neighborhood is listed as Carolina, but the locals call it Isla Verde after the great beach that is 2 blocks away. There is a bus (A5) that runs all the way down the coast into Old San Juan for 75 cents, but the service is slow and erratic. It goes through 2 housing projects, which might scare some people, but I felt safe. If you are not going to take the bus, taxis are expensive. Most people say you should rent a car in San Juan, but the drivers don't follow right-of-way rules, and I'm glad I did not. Parking in all of San Juan and Isla Verde is a nightmare, and the valet at the hotel was $20. If you just want to relax and go to the beach\/pool every day, this place would be great. The management pays attention to details here, so you can relax. It's far from cultural attractions and real local neighborhoods. ","annotations":[]}
