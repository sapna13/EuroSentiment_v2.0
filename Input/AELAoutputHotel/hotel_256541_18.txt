{"text":"Great Stay! This hotel was fantastic! My recent stay at Four Points brought back fond memories of a short stay at the Sheraton Mirage Port Douglas almost 15 years ago, where my family and I enjoyed hotel hospitality at its finest. On this recent trip to Sydney, I contacted Four Points after a terrible experience at the Saville (Bond St) and was immediately accomodated with a City side suite at a comparable rate (to the Saville) and was also offered a Habour view room. The lovely reservation operator was also conscientious enough to enrol me into their Starwood Preferred Guest program in order to accrue loyalty points.The following day I arrived at Four Points just after 12pm and was greeted by the polite and friendly concierge and doorman. My bags were immediately taken by the concierge who assured my the bags would be sent to my room once I was checked in. The bags were promptly taken to my room.At check in, I was amazed that despite the 3pm check in, my room on the 10th floor was actually ready so I was able to organise myself and settle in. The City side view was fine and the noise level was pretty low particularly at night.The two night stay was very comfortable and the 24-hour, well equipped gym made the hotel all the more accessible. The service was excellent and room quality was outstanding, despite the room being a little bit small.The staff were always attentive and ensured guest comfort. I will no doubt, return on my next trip to Sydney. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1419,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1412}]}
