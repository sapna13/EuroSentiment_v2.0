{"text":"Excellent Rooms My wife and I had a 3 night stay at the Best Western Atlantico (Room 708) and were (overall) very impressed by the hotel. The staff were all very friendly and helpful when required. The main downsides that we would make comment on are: 1. External Noise (we didn't realise Madrid was so busy, but noise is not the hotel's fault and the black-out shutters and double glazing do keep out the majority of the noise). and 2. The breakfast - although there is a good, wide choice we felt that the cooked parts (bacon, eggs etc) could be kept at a much higher temperature, as even early in the morning most of these were only luke-warm. Also, we felt that the bacon should be cooked much more as it was almost raw - this may be an British thing though!. We also understood that there would be in-room tea and coffee making facilities - which there were not. This would have been most welcome. One other point is that we felt the number of channels on the TV was limited and could perhaps provide more English channels. We did however feel that the 9th floor bar and terrace were excellent - although the weather had turned just as we arrived and we could not sit outside. I can imagine the terrace would be fantastic in good warm weather. The hotel was centrally situated and we used the Metro to get around - as well as walking many a mile. We highly recommend the Metro - cheap, very clean and easy to use - don't bother with taxis as it would be quicker to walk. So, the Hotel Atlantico comes highly recommended by us, and we would definitely stay there again if we went back to Madrid.
