{"text":"Very Nice for a Great Price After reading the reviews on this site I was a bit skeptical but I decided to give it a shot. I was very glad I did. Yes the hotel is in need of some work but they are remodeling the whole hotel and it will be finished by June 2008.When we arrived they allowed us to check out the room. It was large and clean on an upper floor. The carpet looked worn but all the rooms are due to get new carpet in the renovations. I had been in e-mail contact with the hotel before my trip and had told them that my wife's birthday was soon. The hotel manager arranged for a wonderful cake to be in our room upon arrival AT NO CHARGE. The hotel is right next to a large mall that you can enter from the second floor of the hotel. WIthin 1 block of the hotel are many places to eat including McDonald, Pizza Hut, and Subways. Remember that ifyou want to try local food, most people do not speak english and the menus are in Chinese. The concierge arranged a driver and english speaking tour guide for us. The guide was named Mary and she was great. We hired the two people for 4 days at $140\/day for both but this gave us exclusive use of both people and a private car.We did try the breakfast buffet once and it was unimpressive. Ths could have been because they were remodeling and had to use the main restaurant instead of the regular place.We arrived the last day of the Chinese New Year and our room had a great view of the fireworks, which lasted 5 hours.I would stay here again because of the service and location.
