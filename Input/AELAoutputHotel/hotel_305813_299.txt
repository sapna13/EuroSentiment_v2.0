{"text":"Simply the best place to stay in Hong Kong! Stayed at the Langham Place Hotel in Mongkok for five nights with my elderly parents on a business-cum-pleasure trip to Hong Kong. Thus I am able to testify that this is an excellent hotel to stay at, either for work or for play.Paid for a Kowloon room with triple accommodation, which consists of a giant King sized bed, and a single bed, both extremely comfortable. The pillow menu is a nice touch, but hardly neccessary, as there were already three types of pillow provided as standard.Bathroom is extremely well-stocked. For the triple room, you don't get the clear glass partition that others appear to get with doubles - which was good for us, as my parents are not exactly liberal!The extra I paid to get access to the facilities in the lounge on the 36th floor is a good investment. It is a good place to relax, and there seems to be a constant supply of snacks and drinks (including cocktails) on tap. My father loved the message chair, which afforded relief for sore feet while offering an amazing view of the HK skyline. It is also easier to arrange to settle the bill and check out via the reception desk there, as the one in the lobby can be busy.The services at the hotel is impeccable, and I agree with previous reviewers, that the lobby and concierge services are friendly, warm and extremely welcoming. We never had to wait very long for anything, as everything was delivered extremely quickly, efficiently and with a smile.We preferred breakfast on the ground floor (as opposed to the lounge) as there was greater variety. Selection was pretty standard for 5* hotels (multinational cuisine). Services of the serving staff there could be variable, depending on where you sit and how busy they are. The hotel appears to be popular with foreign toursts, and we (ethnically Chinese) appeared to be in the minority!The hotel is situated in the middle of Mongkok, supposedly one of the most densely populated area in the world. Nevertheless, this is exactly what we loved to do - mingle with the locals and sampling the hussle and bustle of everyday life - so don't pick this location if you like a peaceful and quiet stroll! Access to other parts of Hong Kong were also extremely easy by the MTR via the mall next door - got to a wedding reception in Central on time without any problems, during a typhoon number 8 alert!I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. The price may be on the top end, but I felt it was worth every single penny.
