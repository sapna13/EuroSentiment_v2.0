{"text":"Excellent trip for little kids The wife and I just returned from a late June one week stay. Kids are 3 and 5. Pool is great for kids that age and pool very nice, clean and accessible. No seaweed anywhere and I'm assuming that when it does accumulate it's after a storm and the hotel would clean it up promptly. Service was great except for the concierge and we had no problems with housekeeping. And yes we got the free upgrade but I think that was possible because there were available rooms and it was low season - I wouldn't count on it at different times of the year.We booked the trip through Costco - all very smooth and the breakfast special they get you is great. If you have kids go to El Morro in Old San Juan on a cloudy day and fly kites for a day - easiest kite flying conditions you'll ever have due to the wind -- and you can buy kites there for $3-$4. Also, the hotel based Avis lady gave me a great tip on where to eat near Luquillo Beach -- try the Kiosko #2 La Parilla if you like seafood ! That beach is about 45 minutes away and is beautiful to be sure but extremely hot hot hot and zero wave action.The hotel and facilities were great and I'd recommend the place to somebody with little kids but to help you manage your expectations I've listed some negatives below.Negatives:1) the 3 elevators servicing 16 floors were unreliable and kind of a pain but most of the guests took it well so it was a running joke.2) the concierge(s) were useless and actually gave bad information. For example, I told them that I'd be taking the kids to Old San Juan and asked them if it would be easy to find some simple food for them there -- like a pizza. They said there were no such choices and instead directed me to an Italian sit down restaurant and a Caribean themed restaurant. When I went anyway and went to the center of town - the Plaza de Armas - I found myself surrounded by familiar kids places - mcdonalds, wendy's, burger king, etc. This would lead me to conclude that the concierges get compensated for directing people to specific places. They also gave me misinformation about the trip to Culebra Island. The concierge you see in hotel website video must have retired or something.3) if you read reviews about the local, nearby restaurants be forewarned. The Mi Casita restaurant is close and may be good but it's always packed for dinner so don't expect to just walk over. Also, the Fast Food places near the hotel are the slowest I've ever experienced - the Burger King was stunning in it's tortoise pace, and we left after waiting for 15 minutes in a line that didn't move. The Wendy's was slightly faster. The workers were nice enough but totally inefficient. So dinners are a problem unless you drive elsewhere.Avoid:Rain forest excursion - It's 1 hour there, 1 hour back and then 90 minutes in a bus through the forest with a little 20 minutes walk. Total waste of time and I wish I had driven there myself and walked around on my own. I guess if you can't walk or are drunk from a cruise the excursion might make sense but otherwise it's a waste.
