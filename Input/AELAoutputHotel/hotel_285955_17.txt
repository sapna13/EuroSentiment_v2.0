{"text":"A lovely hotel with really serious problems The Staff: (4\/5) - friendly and helpful peopleThe Location: (2\/5) - One the bright side, Amstelzicht is is good proximity to much that is interesting in Amsterdam. It is an eight minute walk east of the Bloemenmarkt. The location is severely hampered by the combination of a very busy road (Amstel) and a great deal of loud foot traffic by noisy drunks. Both the traffic noise andthe louts can last into the wee hours.The Room: (4\/5) - featured excellent old wooden furniture. It was unusually spacious. A tiny refrigerator not intended for your actual use (holds the 3 euro soda). Had a decent bathroom with stand-up shower and average water pressure. The window blinds were dark enoughto allow a good sleep-in (valuable if the drunks keep you awake until3am)The Bed (2\/5) - for a hotel of this cost, one might expect at least an average bed. The mattress was unworthy of a shabby college dormitory. The frame was pretty, but I'd have preferred some straw ina stable.The Hotel (2\/5) - the pleasant interior of the hotel is nice to look at. But the hard floors and walls of the hallways are DREADFULLY loudwhen other guests are walking to their rooms. As it is, you'll hear every step and comment (BLAH! BLAH! BLAH! CLACK! CLACK! CLACK!!!...) of every guest as they chat merrily to their rooms after dinner. The Amenities (2\/5) - no food available except the overpriced snacks in the minifridge. But many small and decent restaurants are nearby. The 'free wifi' provided to the hotel is basically non-existent. When the signal appeared it was non-functional.Until the Hotel shells out a little money for sound-deadening hallwayfeatures (like carpet and thicker doors and windows), the Hotel Amstelzicht should be avoided. At a minimum, insist on exploring your room before check-in. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":623,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":619}]}
