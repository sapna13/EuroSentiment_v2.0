{"text":"The most horrifying stay of my life My husband and I treated guests to a Hong Kong trip and booked them at the Imperial Hotel. We could not be more embarassed when we arrived at the place. Upon entering the lobby and checking in, there was a bell boy loitering the area. He just looked at us with our suitcases, and did not even offer to assist us to our rooms. That's just the start.When we got to the 17th floor where our room was located, I was instantly dismayed to see that there were several rooms in the same floor which were under construction. There was no attempt to cover these up, as the rubble and construction mess was in plain view. Also, there was a garbage bag in the middle of the hallway. When we entered our room, we found that it was tiny. The bathroom was even tinier. One would have to be really skinny to use the toilet because there is not much space between the wall and the bathtub, where the toilet is located.The glasses provided in the bathroom were smudgy, as if they were not washed since the last occupant left.The bed cover was old and caused us to itch. When we removed the bed cover, the blanket was worn out and looked even more uncomfortable. Worst, when we removed the blanket, we found that the bedsheet had a stain which looked like blood.The towels were no better. Two out of three towels provided had stains. Bathroom amenities were terrible. The hotel was very stingy with shampoo, which was contained in sachets. This is the only hotel I've been to where the shampoo is provided in sachets. The toothpaste tasted like putty and did not produce foam. The bristles of the toothbrush came loose in my mouth as I was using it.Cleanliness is not a priority in Imperial Hotel. When the cleaning lady came to our room, she only changed the sheets (thank God!) and made up the bed, and nothing much else. She failed to clean a big mud spot in the middle of the bathroom which was impossible to miss.Forget about sleeping in, too, as you will be disturbed by staff who do not care much for peace and quiet. The cleaning lady knocked on our door asking if she could clean. When I replied Not yet, she came back two times more in a span of five minutes. On the day we were leaving, our 35 guests, plus luggage, were in the lobby waiting for the shuttle. The moment the shuttle came, the manager asked my husband if the group could leave already. My husband found this completely rude, and told the manager that if our group had to go, he would have to ask the other guests loitering in the lobby to leave too. It was only then that the manager backed off.We actually had arranged to stay for one more night at Imperial Hotel after our guests left. However, the never-ending horrors in this hotel led us to look for a room for our remaining night in another hotel. Guess what -- a room in Marco Polo Hong Kong Hotel cost only HKD100 more than booking an extra night in Imperial! Needless to say, we were out of there in a flash.After our stay in Imperial, Marco Polo Hong Kong hotel was heaven. But then again, it isn't difficult for most hotels to top the nightmare that is Imperial Hotel.
