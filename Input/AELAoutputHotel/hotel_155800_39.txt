{"text":"Great time... We had a great time at this hotel. Our room was very nice, clean and spacious. The staff was very accomodating.  We ate at Koco, the Italian restaurant and the pool bar. The Italian restaurant was ok but pricey. It's hard for me to judge Italian food b\/c I am from NY. The great thing about this restaurant is thet they are open late. We left the casino at about 2 and we were able to get a pizza to take upstairs. Koco was excellent. It is in an awkward location in the hotel (next to the casino but down a hallway). The decor, staff and foos was fantastic. The poolside bar was ok and also pricey. We stayed at the beach and the pool. Both places hard to get a waiter or waitress, I think it was harder at the beach. Some were more attentive than others. I have to say a big dissapointment for me was that they only had 9 umbrellas total for the guests at the hotel.  The casino was fun, again not like Vegas or AC but enjoyable. The waitress service there was slow and also disappointing. This hotel comes alive on Friday and Staurday nights. The lobby turns into a club and everyone is dancing everywhere. Tons of fun! The big big disappointment there which nobody can argue was the lobby bathrooms. Gross! Smelly, no toilet paper in stalls, garbage overflowing with paper towels.  Overall we had a great time at this hotel. There are a lot of spots that you really have to look for. My suggestions take a walk through of this hotel when you get there. My husband went to the gym on the top floor and stumbled across a restaurant up there. We would have had no idea had he not gone up there (we did not get a chance to eat up there). Koco's is a little hidden and the convenient store is at the very end of the Galleria. We did not know there was USA today until the second to last day. Also there is a Starbucks in the lobby with small things, but in the Galleria towards the end there is a larger Starbucks.
