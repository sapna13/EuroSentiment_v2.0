{"text":"Very Disappointing When I first arrived at the hotel, I was greeted by a receptionist that wasn't very friendly at all. Then the nightmare began. I had two rooms booked, my family's room was fine, however mine smelled so musty that I asked to have it changed. They only had a room available the following day, which would be located by the hotel they're building, which meant I would hear pounding from the construction every day. When I asked for an upgrade. perhaps an oceanview, after the inconvience of inhaling the musty odor, the receptionist said, I would have to pay an extra $35.00. That's a shame! The hotel is supposed to be a five-stars, but it was like a 2 1\/2 stars. The food was less than average, I even tried the buffet at the other hotels to see if the food was better. No, it wasn't, it was even worse. I only wish that someone would write to the hotel's headquarters to let them know, what is going on. The staff makes you feel like they are doing you a huge favor by serving you, some of them were nice, like two or three of them, but the majority of them need to take a refresher course in customer service.The positive thing about the hotel, is the bavaro train, which runs every 20 minutes to transport you to and from the other hotels.The casino was nice, especially the pond where tropical fish and flamingo's are located. The beach is fabulous, and the white, powdery sand was amazing , crowded with palm trees. I refused to believe about the one-star reviews, however I do now. I woild never go back to that hotel again. If the palace is supposed to be the best, I can't imagine the sisters.
