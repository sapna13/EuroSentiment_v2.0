{"text":"Excellence...not really Ever since my boyfriend and I met, we go away once a year, for about one week. We have always picked the best resorts in the Caribean and have never been dissapointed; however, this time we were. It was really unfortuante, but it's not what we expected. From the moment we arrived it was one let down after another. Our flight was delayed in New York, we were supposed to leave JFK at 8:55, but didn't actually leave until 11:45. We arrived at the airport in DR (which really resembled Gilligan's Island....the airport was composed of huts) we were exited on the runway and then charged $15.00 a person before being allowed into the baggage area (crazy) luggage took forever and then the bus ride to the hotel was an endless journey, it took over an hour and half, with no water and pot holes that looked liked craters. Usually, the buses that provide transportation to and from the resorts, provide beverages......not this one. The streets do not have traffic lights nor stop signs, everyone cuts everyone off, it didn't matter if you were riding a car or a bull...Upon arriving at the hotel...that's when the party really begins....NOT!Our room was dirty and sandy, the jacuzzi was stained (I didn't even want to ask from what) the shower stall was very dirty and had terrible stains, the overall smell in the room was a terrible funk....And still we were trying to make the best of it. We went to the front desk to what could be done, and all we were offered was the opportunity to upgrade our status to the Excellence club for $150.00 extra a night plus tax and gratuities (we were going to be there 7 nights). We of course declined and just asked for different room, they however could not accomodate us, what they did offer was a pillow top mattress.The food was not good, our first night there we went to a restaurant called Spice, it was supposed to be an Asian restaurant, it was far from edible, let alone asian. I ordered Sweet and sour pork, what they bought out was pepper steak sesame, my boyfriend ordered something with shrimp, he got, curried shrimp.....we were so confused. the following night we figured we would try the Lobster House....i mean who can mess up lobster....right..........wrong. First we waited to be seated for one hour, ( they don't accept reservations) when we were seated and ordered, we waited an hour and half for our lobster......because the chef had dissappeared. No one knew where he was. There was a lot of arguing, not only the patrons but also the staff. when the food finally came, it was nasty, my lobster was burnt and slimy........and looked alive, it still had all it's legs and it's eyes. The only restaruant that was descent was the mexican Agave this one we discovered two nights before we left. The hamburgers tasted like they had been dipped in the ocean....pure salt. Not everyone in the hotel was very nice, they tended to be a bit snoty, we asked for washcloths........they acted like they didn't know what they were. Staff requested tips at times (not often, but they did when they had a chance) and we were told that if we tipped them we would be taken care of, if not, then you know the rest. I hate to say this, but I hated it, we did not enjoy ourselves, everytime we tried, something would always go wrong. As for the beach...if the waves didn't attack you the beach vendors surely would. Did I forget to mention that the electricity went out twice daily......every single day...not just once or twice, every day, and it wasn't because of my blowdryer.......(it usually is, but not this time, because I left mine in NY) later we found out that it happened throughout the entire resort. It was an experience.......I can honestly say that I will never forget Punta Cana......and I will never go back.
