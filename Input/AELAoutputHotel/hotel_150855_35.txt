{"text":"terrible room Jan 4-10\/08 When we arrived at our room, our door was open which we found a little odd. BUT when you got in you knew why! It was so musty and moldy smelling it was hard to breathe. The beds were terrible, they sagged in the middle, the sheets were like sand paper, they smelled of mold, B.O. and urine. We took pictures of the mold on the beds. There was also mold on the backs of the curtains and in the shower. The drain in the sink was rusty. The shower head sprayed water every where. Taps dripped water all the time. When we arrived they should of had someone there to welcome you and show you the which restaurants you could eat at. There was hostess all dressed up in Domincan attire and she said we needed reservations to eat in the main restaurant. Went to main desk and asked they said we could eat there anytime with out reservations. The food was good that night ate and drank lots. We arrived there on Jan 4 there didn't seem to be too many vacationers there so the service was great. By Saturday night the food was all starting to taste the same, could not stomach anymore of it.  It seemed all the restaurants served the same food even the ones you had to make reservations for all buffet style. Some of the drinks had liquor in them and then the next drink came with no liquor it seemed you had to tip every drink. We did not appreciate the peddlars that came to the hotel to sell their goods, very pushy and snobby when you were not interested. Coming from Saskatchewan the beach was beautiful, the heat, the sun and the climate was great. It was our first beach holiday,we booked through Sunquest and complained to them about the terrible room and they were not receptive to it at all. We enjoyed our time away from home but will never stay there again. The room ruined our entire holiday. Steve and Teresa ","annotations":[]}
