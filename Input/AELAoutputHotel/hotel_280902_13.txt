{"text":"Enjoyable but Expensive To save wear  tear on your eyes, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l try to offer this review information as concisely as possible. After my 3-day stay at this Westin, here√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what I think... The Pros- Acceptably clean room (there was some garbage in the closet left behind by a previous occupant, and some small stains on the chairs, but everything else was fine).- Good size room (didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel cramped at all with two queen beds, a nightstand, a desk, an easy chair with footstool, and the combination TV cabinet  chest of drawers).- Had a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºuper shower√à√\u2020\u2022?with two heads that provided an excellent drenching (plenty of hot water too...and I do mean hot).- It was very quiet; didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hear the other guests at all.- Very comfortable bedding (lots of pillows and a down comforter).- The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âlimate control√à√\u2020\u2022?was adjustable and worked perfectly.- The Starbucks coffee maker was a nice perk.- Received a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°ree√à√\u2020\u2022?paper every morning.- Good view (one whole side of the room was a window looking onto downtown Dallas).- Wonderful light-blocking curtains (a real plus if you want to sleep late).- Concierge was knowledgeable and helpful when making dinner\/sightseeing arrangements.The Cons- Not much of a bargain (paid $228 w\/tax per night). I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe paid much less in other cities for a comparable room.- No internet access included in room price (must pay either $16\/day for a hard wired connection, or $10\/day for wireless). The Adam√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Mark hotel across the street at least provided free wireless internet in its lobby.- Hotel restaurant has a limited and somewhat pricey selection (plan on $30+ per person). However, there is a food court beside the hotel with more affordable selections (and there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a pretty ice rink there too).The Bottom LineThe pros definitely outweigh the cons in this hotel, which is within walking distance of several notable attractions (such as three museums and a symphony hall). You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l most likely have a pleasant visit, but your wallet\/purse surrender about $700 for a 3-day stay, and there aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ many amenities included in that price beyond the basics (like a coffee maker).
