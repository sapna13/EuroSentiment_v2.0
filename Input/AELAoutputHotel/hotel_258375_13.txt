{"text":"Average for a Four Star Hotel I stayed with my family in this hotel - four of us in a suite. The extra bed was a pull out couch and painfully uncomfortable. Even when my sister sat on it, one of the wooden beems fell out. The room looked nice upon entering, but the carpet was very dirty, and they never vacumed it while we were there. After our first night, they never put back on the beds the bed spreads. I believe this is so they have to clean them less. That left me with the feeling that they were being cheep. The bathroom was very big and clean. The breakfast was not great, even for Italian standards. The location was perfect. Just a few blocks from some of the main attractions. They had fantastic free high-speed internet acess which was helpful for my job, but also for looking at train schedules, etc. (I had a lap top with me). The staff were very friendly, but be careful of their recommendations on where to eat dinner. We took their recommendation, and it was a complete turist trap and over priced. And the waiter made it a point to explain that I should be sure to leave a tip - I live in Italy, and know that there is no tiping! I was absolutely shocked that he would have the nerve to tell me to leave a tip (by the way - the name of the restaurant was Bucca Mario). For the price and location, I would stay here again. I am not sure it is a top four star hotel, but it is a step above a three start hotel. ","annotations":[]}
