{"text":"Ready to go back again :) My husband wanted the best for our honeymoon and thats exactly what we got at ritz-carlton, bali.....its a beautiful hotel with excellent facilties and is a perfect destination for a romantic-getaway... cut off from rest of the island, on-top-of the cliff it provides a view to the indian ocean that makes u feel that u n ur beau are alone in this world.... we stayed in an ocean-view room , so the view stayed with us throughout the trip...getting down to the facilties there.... the ocean-view, sea-food restaurant is a must.... even if u r vegetarian, go down there for a drink and to enjoy the sun-set.... each of the pools are located in such a way that they seem to be gradully merging into the ocean... once u take a dip in them, u never feel like gettin out...the beach.... o my gawd the kobu beach ..... we went there early morning and it was almost like having ur own private beach... completely secluded.... small but clean and beautiful :)breakfast buffet is also made keeping in mind the diverse nationalities... a huge spread to satisfy all palates...spa is a must too ,..... it transends u to another world....i think a special mention should be made of the staff there..... they are always smiling, willing to help and make you feel special in all ways possible....... i can go on and on about the hotel.... but really that hotel should be experienced and not read about.....me and beau are ready to go back there next year....
