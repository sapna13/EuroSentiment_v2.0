{"text":"save money at the Lenox Hotel in Boston Anyone who has travelled to Boston knows that finding a hotel room is tough.Finding a good hotel room is tougher.And finding a good hotel room at a decent rate is nearly an impossible task!Here's my tip based on recent experience - when u enter Massachusetts stop at the first Cisitors center u find - we entered on the I-90 from NY state - and stopped at Lee Visitors Center.They have friendly personnel there who are glad to help u phone ahead for available accomodations.In addition there are flyers there for great hotels at amazing prices - we tried about 6-8 different hotels but all were fully booked.Finally we tried the Lenox which the visitor center flyer promised for a room rate of $205 +tax per night.When we called the hotel reservations said yes,they did have a room available and quoted us c $410 +tax for a room for three for one night.When I mentioned that I had a flyer with a $205 rate quoted the reservations clerk hesitated,put me on hold for a minute and then came back and agreed to book us a room at that rate provided we gave her a credit card on the spot,reservation was not canceable and we had to show the flyer upon check in.We did all that and we did get a spacious room with 2 double beds at the 100 year old Lenox.Only downside was that they would not let us stay on a second night when we requested.The hotel itself is grand,service is impeccable and location is very god - near the prudential center,newbury street etc.Parking for our rented car was a high $42 per day.But all in all a god experience.
