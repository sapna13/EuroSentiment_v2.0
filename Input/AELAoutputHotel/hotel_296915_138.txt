{"text":"A Strong Recomendation Dear Fellow Travellers:Greetings -- please see the letter below, which I wrote to the owner\/president of the Hotel Pulitzer and which describes a recent incident my girlfriend and I encountered on the road to Barcelona and how the people at this hotel made a very bad situation much better. We are frequent travellers but have never encountered a hotel quite like this one, which is why I am posting this letter for everyone's benefit (my first posting ever). Happy trails! G TaylorSeptember 25, 2007Dear Mr. Roig: Please forgive us for not speaking Spanish.On June 21 of this year, we were attacked by bandits on the interstate just outside of Barcelona . The thieves cut our tire, held us up, and stole my girlfriend√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ purse containing her passport, wallet, credit cards, cash, and irreplaceable personal items. One of the worst experiences of either of our lives.We quickly rushed to the nearby toll booth to call the police, but were told by the attendant to go to the police station in the city square. We parked the car close to the square and frantically ran into the Hotel Pulitzer to ask to use their phone to cancel our credit cards and to ask directions to the police station. As you could imagine, we were very shaken up and very emotional, especially as neither of us had ever been robbed before. Mr. Luis Carasa and Mr. Jose Sanchez calmly and professionally asked what had happened to us, and then allowed us to use the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ staff phones to cancel our credit cards, free of charge and undisturbed. They also brought us refreshments and helped us to calm down. Mr. Carasa and Mr. Sanchez then offered to allow us to stay in the hotel at a special rate (we learned later that this took some juggling). This was both of our first time to Barcelona, and the mugging is an isolated event, but the kind actions of your Mr. Carasa and Mr. Sanchez afterwards went a long way to make such a bad occurrence better. They both went out of their way to help us in our time of need. We are both very grateful to these two gentlemen and the Hotel Pulitzer for the kindness and exemplary service we were given during such a bad situation. Mr. Carasa and Mr. Sanchez are a shining example of the many good things about Barcelona , and because of their actions, we would gladly return to Barcelona and would gladly stay in your hotel again (but where else?).Sincerely,G Taylor and J Sander ","annotations":[{"endOffset":146,"mention":"Hotel Pulitzer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Pulitzer"],"startOffset":132},{"endOffset":935,"mention":"toll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_chip_cookie"],"startOffset":931},{"endOffset":935,"mention":"toll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_chip_cookie"],"startOffset":931},{"endOffset":1122,"mention":"Hotel Pulitzer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Pulitzer"],"startOffset":1108},{"endOffset":1122,"mention":"Hotel Pulitzer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Pulitzer"],"startOffset":1108},{"endOffset":1122,"mention":"Hotel Pulitzer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Pulitzer"],"startOffset":1108},{"endOffset":1122,"mention":"Hotel Pulitzer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Pulitzer"],"startOffset":1108},{"endOffset":2101,"mention":"Hotel Pulitzer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hotel_Pulitzer"],"startOffset":2087}]}
