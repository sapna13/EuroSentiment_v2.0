{"text":"Had a nice time, but might have gone elsewhere My husband and 2.5 year old daughter just came back from the Punta Cana Grand (Dec. 15-19). We had a nice vacation, but I had some problems with the hotel. I did plenty of online searching before I booked it, and based on all the reviews, decided to go with the Punta Cana Grand. We got a good deal, and overall, had a great vacation. But I would not go back.Pulling up to the hotel, I had a great feeling. The grounds looked nice and I was anxious to hit the pool and beach...and start relaxing. I was told that Building 7 was the best, so when I asked to be placed there they said it was an extra $50\/night. For that amount I knew I could have booked the whole trip at a different higher class resort, so I didn't upgrade. We were placed in bldg 3. I was NOT happy with the room. I didn't mind the furniture being older, but the room had a dank smell, and the bathroom was terribly below avergae. The tub plug wasn't working, not that I would have given my daughter a bath in it anyway, and the fixtures were all rusty. The fridge and TV weren't working. So I went to the front desk and tried to get us changed. No luck.I decided to be a sport, and just enjoy the other elements of the resort. The grounds were great and we loved the pool, beach, and facilities on the sand for the kids (trampoline, playgrounds...) By day 2, I was getting more frustrated with our room and couldn't relax. They fixed our fridge, but replaced the TV with a tiny one. The pillow cases were too small for the pillows and I couldn't shake the feeling that the sheets were not properly clean. The second night we awoke to some craziness at 2:30 in the morning. Two doors down, a French man was beating his girlfriend up!!! We got up to see what we could do, and after the whole issue was sorted out with security, and all the guests on the floor had gone back to their rooms, we decided it was all too much. Granted, the hotel is not responsible for the very unfortunate domestic violence, but it was the last straw for me. (PS: the hotel wouldn't call the police and the woman just wanted to go back to the room with her boyfirend. The next day, they were as in love as ever, holding hands with her head wound covered by a strategically placed scarf).The next morning, my husband went back to the front desk with our laundry list of complaints, and got us upgraded to Building 7. Alas, our vacation began. Bldg 7 is like being in a different hotel. The room was beautiful, and everything brand new. We were on the ground floor, so our porch was right off the second pool. It was gorgeous, and very relaxing. It honestly felt like we were in a different resort. I loved everything about it. We were even able to put our daughter down for a nap, and still enjoy the day by sitting on our porch and jumping into the pool while she was sleeping. I think if I would have seen the room in Bldg 7 when we first checked in, I would have paid the $50\/night without hesitation. As for some other elements of the resort: the staff was very nice and accomodating. However, the shopkeepers in the resort shops were very harassing, and turned rude as soon as you indicated that you weren't going to buy anything. The entertainment staff was great- they worked so hard and really seemed to want you to have a good time. I was very surprised by the quality of the nightly shows. The theater area is beautiful and the shows were entertaining. We didn't love the food, but didn't so long as we had a drink in hand, we were good to go. In summary- we had a great time on vacation and found the resort OK. For the extra $50\/night for Building 7, I would have selected a different resort, but it turned out OK for us.
