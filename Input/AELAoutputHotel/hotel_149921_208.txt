{"text":"Overall good My fiance and I recently went to San Juan looking for a place to stay when we return to get married this summer. The Caribe Hilton is near Old San Juan, has several restaurants, a sizeable private beach, a multilevel pool with swim-up bar, nice ocean views, and a cool inner courtyard. Overall, we were very happy with it. We were able to have some romantic moments around the property, while others enjoyed being there in family groups or for business meetings. It does a pretty good job overall of balancing the various desires of these often quite different groups.We stayed in a ground-level room in the Garden wing. It was a nice room, well-kept etc., but I would have liked to have had an outdoor patio, which the room didn't have. It was quiet and well-kept.The restaurant we really loved was Lemongrass. It has really good Asian-Fusion food and a cool decor right on the inner courtyard of the hotel - bubbling water, bug and frog sounds at night, etc. Other than that, the morning buffets were good. And we liked the swim-up bar - their drinks were good, and the music was also better than elsewhere in the pool area. The pool area casual food bar (I believe it was called Atlantic) was okay on the one time we ate there. Whatever you do, eat as much of the fresh fruit as you can - I didn't have any that wasn't really good!The pools themselves were nice, with an adequate amount of chairs situated throughout the pool and beach area, as well as a few hammocks. They even have a separated area for pool games, so those who want to play water volleyball aren't bonking others in the head with their volleys, which we appreciated. They also had a small side kiddie pool, which is nice for those with kids (we don't have any).A little warning about going into Old San Juan: the cabs are $10 across the board in Old San Juan - they go by zones. So although you may only be going from the very edge of Old San Juan back to the hotel, expect to pay $10 (plus gratuity). We had to just deal with that and remember that it's still cheaper than renting a car and parking it at the hotel parking garage! On some maps it looks like a very short walk into Old San Juan - it's probably about 2 1\/2 miles, though, not the 1\/2-3\/4 of a mile it looked like on one map we saw. Just a caution, so you know what the distance is.A tip for the pale ones among us: don't even THINK of going outside without sunscreen, even for a short time, even in the spring! I was outside for a whopping 20 minutes before I remembered to put on sunblock, and I got relatively burned (mild peeling on my shoulders).As far as expense, the hotel is a bit pricey, but it's mostly worth it for all the stuff to do right on the property and within easy reach of a short car trip. That makes it a good choice for those who are looking to just hang out at the hotel and relax, so you don't need to go searching for things to do or places to eat every day.Overall, I think the hotel does a good job of presenting something for everyone, and making it easy to relax and wind down at the hotel.
