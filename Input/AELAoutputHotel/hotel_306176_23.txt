{"text":"Excellent Value for money and outstanding service. I must say that on my stay at Grand Plaza Park Hotel City Hall I was a bit apprehensive that it would not really be up to standard and after checkin it seemed my fears where about to come true.To be fair I had checked in about 5 hours early, though this did not seem to be a problem - I was then given a room and to my dismay it had not been cleaned from the last guest. I went to reception and complained and within seconds they were on the phone to housekeeping and giving them the riot act. They also upgraded my straight away and where very apologetic and the reception manager had also become involved.I was then given a room of which my security card did not work and after trying for about 10mins decided to return to reception yet again. I actually found this quite amusing with reception looking very worried - they where ever so helpful in getting the problem sorted and also gave me free drink vouchers in their cafe\/bar.Once finally in my room - large, comfortable and clean though nothing outstanding I had no further problems with my stay, well except for falling asleep in the Spa having a massage after a long flight and 36 hours with no sleep.This place seems well frequented by regular business travellers and the bar and resturant downstairs where also quite popular with locals as well, always a good sign. The resturant is nothing to write home about, though the food was nice and fresh.I would happly recommend this place to anyone looking for a good, clean hotel with outstanding service. Better than a lot of 4\/5* places I've stayed at. Cant wait to see what the place would look like with a bit of a renovation and update of rooms.I'll be staying here next time on my way through - excellent value for money.rgdsB.Cleaver ","annotations":[]}
