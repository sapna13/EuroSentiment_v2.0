{"text":"Disappointed From July 5th., for the third time, we spent our holiday at the Riu Bambu. To assure our room we sent a mail to the Manager, Mr. Tom, who confirmed the rooms 2112 and 2115. When we arrived we were put in 2708 and 2707, an area we did not request at all. So we aked for the Manager to resolve this misunderstanding as soon as possible. He pretended not to recognize us, though we spent a great time together in la punta last year - it seems he is one of the popular guests over there. In the end we got the rooms we asked for but the behaviour of tthe manager had changed. Last year he was an enjoyable bloke that took us around many times to show us Punta Cana by night. Now it looked like he was not interested in our presence at all. Although the quality at the main restaurant was not what it used to be we still enjoyed the hotel facilities. This year however there were more spanish speaking guests and they were pretty noisy. Lots of the staff were transfered to the new Riu Palace. At the reception they were as helpfull as they used to be. The waiters however did not speak english at all and seemed rather confused. Every single time we asked for a cocktail we got the wrong one. So we went to see the manager. When we asked him why he behaved so indifferently he invited us to la punta what we accepted. After a couple of drinks he could not keep his hands of our 19 year old daughter. We were astonished. Though we are true Riu fans we decided never to go back to a Riu in Punta Cana.
