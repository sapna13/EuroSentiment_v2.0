{"text":"The best location on the Kowloon Peninsula! The Intercontinental Hong Kong is a luxury\/business hotel occupying the best patch of real estate in Tsim Sha Tsui. We spent 5 nights there as part of an around-the-world trip, and were thrilled with the service and experience we had.LOCATION:The hotel is right at the tip of the Kowloon peninsula, and the lobby faces out over Hong Kong harbor, with a prime view of the nightly Spectacle of Lights. The hotel is right next door to the Hong Kong Cultural Center and the Hong Kong Museum of Art. The MTR Tsim Sha Tsui \/ East Tsim Sha Tsui station (Exit J) is located directly in front of the hotel, as is the pedestrian\/shopping subway. It is a 2-block walk to the Star Ferry terminal. Only a block from Nathan Road, the shopping districts and major markets of Kowloon are an easy walk from the hotel.ROOMS:We had a beautiful king-sized room overlooking the hotel's pool area, with a view of the eastern harbor. The room had an in-room safe, Internet (at cost), power in both European and US voltages\/plugs, a large plasma TV, sound system with iPod dock, and a bathroom with both shower and claw-footed bathtub. Each room in the hotel has call service for a butler, and 24x7 room service.FOOD:The hotel has several high-end restaurants by famous chefs, including Alain Ducasse. If you're in the market for a fancy signature meal, you have multiple options. For a more informal dining experience, the harbor-level buffet restaurant provides a palatial assortment of fresh foods, with a focus on seafoods, nightly. But perhaps the most enjoyable venue is the hotel's famous Lobby Bar. With giant panorama windows overlooking the harbor and Hong Kong Island, there is no more scenic place to relax with a drink at the end of the day. In the same area, the hotel offers High Tea each afternoon, and provides a wide assortment of teas and drinks, with multiple food options, including the traditional assortment of scones, savory and sweet nibbles. While not as famous as High Tea at the Peninsula, there's rarely a wait of more than 30 minutes at the Intercontinental, the view is better, and the food is comparable.The only downside of our experience was the hotel's Spa. After several long days of hiking around Hong Kong on foot, my wife and I hoped to get massages. However, the spa had no mid-day time slots available for any treatments for several days, so we couldn't book. Lack of early-morning and evening reservations is apparently a common occurrence for the spa.In a city that offers everything from street food to ultra-luxury, the Intercontinental Hong Kong offers the best of both worlds -- top of the line services and amenities, with a prime location easily accessible by foot or public transport from anywhere in Hong Kong or Kowloon. You won't be disappointed!
