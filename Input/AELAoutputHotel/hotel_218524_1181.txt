{"text":"Excellent Vacation Well, my husband and I and another couple returned from Excellence on Apr. 9, what a beautiful resort. The grounds are beautiful as well as the rooms. As stated in other reviews the beach is nice and the waves are a lot fun to play in. We wanted some RR and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ exactly what we got. The main pool is where all the action is and great for socializing.We found the food at the restaurants very good and really have no complaints. The buffet had a huge variety as did all the menu items at the a la carte restaurants. Everyone in our party found something they liked on the menu without any difficulties.During the days we mostly lounged around on the beach or pool. Everyday lunch was served at the beach at 12:30 pm or you were welcome to go to the buffet or they served sandwiches, pizza (great), fruit etc., right to you at your beach chair without even asking. There were definitely lots of umbrellas at the pool and beach to get shade if you needed it.The weather was beautiful and only rained for about √à√¥√ú hour on our first day. Towards the end of the week it really got hot and we found that the pool was not refreshing anymore, but who√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ complaining, the drinks were still refreshing!Last, but certainly not least was the service. All the staff members were very eager to please. We found the staff all spoke very good English and they all work very hard. Everyone was very friendly and went out of their way to make sure you had everything you needed or wanted.Overall it was a fabulous vacation!
