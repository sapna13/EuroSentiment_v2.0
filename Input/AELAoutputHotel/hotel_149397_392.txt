{"text":"Beauty and the Beast Beauty: We stayed at the BP Jan 7-14. This was our 4th time visiting the Bavaro area. As everyone has said, it is beautiful, its hard to top that stretch of beach. We went with the Platinum upgrade, which as nice. It makes checking in and out a breeze. If you if you want upgraded beer from the lounge, you have to ask before they would take you to a back room full of coolers. We didn't figure this out until the 2nd day. Never did understand why they were hiding it, since the only guests in the lounge are Platinum guests.The food was typical of all inclusives.The service varied from great to awful. There are a lot of rude people out there in the world, I won't comment from where. Don't let them bother you. Killing them with kindness seemed to upset them even more. Again, very typical.Beast: On our fourth day, I became very ill. I felt like something was inside my tummy ripping it apart. It lasted for 10 days. I couldn't keep any food in me. I attributed it to the food at the hotel, however after reading a previous post I had another thought. We also did the Outback Safari, which takes you to a ranch for lunch, and then to another ranch to sample a lot of Dominican Food. The reps. ensured us that the food was safe, but I wonder if there could be a link between the two. I did keep a positive attitude, I would rather be sick in paradise than at home and another plus was that this is the first vacation I came back minus a few pounds. :)All in all it was just okay. We won't repeat this hotel because of the size. If you are already booked, rest at ease. You will have a great time. Every experience is a memory made. We had a group of 12, we made a lot of memories. Most of mine were in the restroom :( If you have any questions feel free to e-mail me. bajabex@sbcglobal.net ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1135,"mention":"ranch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ranch_dressing"],"startOffset":1130},{"endOffset":1172,"mention":"ranch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ranch_dressing"],"startOffset":1167}]}
