{"text":"Good, comfortable, but not great We stayed at the Comfort Suites June 12-16th. This hotel is a bit out of of the core downtown area but very convenient to the Monorail, the Space Needle and the Experience Music Project\/Science Fiction Museum. You could easily spend a day at the Space Needle and EMP\/SFM and right now $15 covers the EMP and Science Fiction Museum (two for one price). We took the monorail downtown to shopping and walked to Pikes Market. I have to say I was surprised at the $4 round trip\/adult price tag for the approx. 1 mile Monorail ride!Anyway, about the hotel...First, the room was not a suite. It was a standard two double-bed room. It did have a small fridge and microwave. The bathroom was spacious and very clean with plenty of towels. Water pressure in the shower was great. Beds were quite comfortable, not too soft, not too firm.The heat\/AC unit was really odd...it looked brand new with programmable settings but it had the most unusual sound...like a raging tornado just outside the window! It kept me awake every night we were there, but I am a very light sleeper!There is not a restaurant on site but there are a quite a few nearby (a terrific mediterranean restaurant is west of the hotel), plus a grocery store around the corner. One evening we were simply sick of eating out at restaurants, not terribly hungry, so we went to the grocery and purchased some ready-made sandwiches and sodas and ate outside the hotel in the courtyard out back.There is a complimentary continental breakfast in the lobby which consisted of cold cereals, oatmeal, sausage patties, make-them-yourself waffles, fruit and some breakfast danish, along with coffee, juice and hot tea. It was OK...very crowded and difficult to find a place to sit, but they do allow you to take the food back to your room if you desire. There is free coffee in the lobby all day.The personnel who worked there were kind of blase...not overly friendly but not rude either. We checked out very early Saturday morning (5 am) and the gal at the front desk would not give me a receipt for our stay! She printed it out, let me look at it to make sure it showed all charges correctly and a $0 balance, but she would not let me keep the copy, she kept saying that I needed to get it from the website. I could not understand this procedure, tried to explain to her that it was most definitely common practice when checking out to receive a receipt (she spoke very broken English). However, after several minutes of this, I dd not have time to argue with her as we needed to leave for the airport right away. I'll call customer service to have them fax me a copy and I will be keeping an eye on my credit card statement online to make sure nothing else is charged to my card.Overall, it was an average hotel, nothing to write home about. It was clean, up to date and reasonably priced compared to others in Seattle (we paid $145\/night for Tues and Weds. and $162\/night for Thurs and Friday). Inside parking is free which is a nice bonus (some hotels we checked charged $25\/day to park).
