{"text":"Brilliant designer hotel for the savvy traveller Citizen M is a new concept in designer hotels. Everything has been designed with maximum efficiency in mind. The rooms are all the same size and come with a massive bed, which takes up one end of the room and a circular shower with mood lighting that changes colour. Everything in the room is controlled from a console. It's really cool, you can get on demand movies (for free), a massive no. of tv channels, and you can control the lighting and music according to your mood or activity. There is free wi-fi, but if you don't have your own laptop, there is are huge apple screens with free internet in the lounge.Check in and out is done via terminals - this is really quick and easy and there are no queues. This means there is no need for a check-in desk, thus saving space and money. Everything is done with a sense of humour, but it's not pretentious or snooty in any way.The service was excellent. There was always a roaming smiling face to help me or answer any questions I had.The lounge area is fantastic. There is a good selection of quality (but pricey) snack food (no restaurant) and a series of areas to chill out with amazing designer furniture and a library of art and design books. The only thing is that it feels a bit like a designer furniture store showroom as apparently this is where the hotel designers get to show off their line of furniture. It's so comfortable, I was tempted to hang out there all day!The hotel is located at the airport, but is only a 15min ride to the central station. This is why the hotel is such great value for money and is a fraction of the cost of a similar standard hotel in the centre. ","annotations":[]}
