{"text":"Great Resort My boyfriend and I stayed at this resort in November of 2005. The experience was fantastic. We arrived at night and discovered that I had forgot my booking number at home, so I had no proof that we were to stay at this resort. However the staff gave us a room anyway as long as the next day we got the proof that they needed. I found that the food was fantastic. Neither my boyfriend or I experienced any digestive problems. The only down side was not being able to find non-junk food between meals. Beach was fantastic. Beautiful white sand, clean water and sun was the perfect combination. Never did find the towel cabana, but I brought my own towel so I wouldn't have to go looking. We also never had any problems finding chairs around the pool. My boyfriend was smart and brought his own beer mug, because the glasses that they give you are far too small. It cut down having to go back to the bar to a minimum. The only problem we had was trying to figure out how to work the lights and the A\/C. No one on the staff told us. But all it took was a short two minute walk to the front desk to figure it out. Hardly an inconvenience. The nightly entertainment was great, we even got up on stage. All in all we had a great time and would recommend this resort to anyone.One more thing, to the people that complain about people speaking Spanish, I ask you What do you expect? That is their language and how could you expect them to speak anything else?
