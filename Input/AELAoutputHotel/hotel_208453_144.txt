{"text":"brilliant hotel,great location me  my friend went to new york in march for 3 nights which for starters wasnt long enough you need at least a week as there is so much to see in very little time .we stayed at the hilton times square hotel which is as the name says in times square well its just about 100 yards round the corner .we were really impressed on arrival we got out of our cab  the staff were there waiting to take your bags up to the room .staff on reception were really helpful  quick at checking us in. the hotel is really modern  the rooms were lovely we had a double bed each which was really comfatable as we suffered terrible jet lag but it didnt spoil it for us anyway going back to the rooms there was a big tv with games console  mini bar , desk , telephone , dressing gowns toiletries , tea coffee facilities internet access  the best bit we pulled back the curtains to see our view  wow what a view it was there in front of us the empire state building which was fantastic we were on the 32nd floor it seems a long way up  it is but the hotel is built on top of a cinema  waxworks museum you could see for miles up there it was brill.on each corridor in the hotel was buckets of ice for you to take to your room which was handy .the hotel was really clean  nothing was too much trouble for the staff they couldnt do enough for you .the location of the hotel was fantansticfor tourist like our selfs it was only a few steps to times square about a 5 minute walk to central park it was about the same to 5th avenue  macys shopping department store we got a cab down to the world trade centre site which didnt cost much at all as you couldnt walk down there as it was bit too far  straight across from there is a department store called centuary 21 which i highly recommend as its got some really good bargins there is everything in there to suit all ages . the hotel did room service 24hrs a day too which was handy when you wanted a slice of carrott cake at midnight like we did (lol) but if you you were wanting a meal we went next door to the hotel to a place callled applebys its a restaurant chain in newyok  its delicious they sell steaks, salads ,chicken  its prices were good too they also do a mean apple pie  icecream for dessert. i had no faults at all with this hotel  will definately return again to this hotel i just wouldnt go to newyork again in march as it was freezing i will make sure my next trip takes place in the summer ","annotations":[{"endOffset":809,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":806},{"endOffset":816,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":810},{"endOffset":1957,"mention":"slice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sliced_bread"],"startOffset":1952},{"endOffset":1973,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1969},{"endOffset":2170,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":2164},{"endOffset":2235,"mention":"apple pie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Apple_pie"],"startOffset":2226},{"endOffset":2245,"mention":"icecream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream"],"startOffset":2237}]}
