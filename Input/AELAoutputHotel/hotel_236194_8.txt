{"text":"absolute nightmare I have just got back from staying at this hotel. Please can someone offer me a chiropractor now as i have such back pain from sleeping in the most noisy uncomfortable broken bed for a week.I booked into the hotel thinking it looked close to town and from the photos it looked ok.The reception area is very misleading, its nice there, that is until you get out of the lift and onto your floor, where you step into a time warp. the wooden doors are all bashed up, the wallpaper is some type of rattan wicker nightmare with browning cream walls.the first room i was given was a strange triangle room, where if i closed my eyes i felt like i was alongside the grand pre circuit. it was so loud from the traffic.As i was there on business i asked for a quiet room as i couldnt sleep.I was then given a small coffin room where there was enough space to just get out and into the bed, which was broken.It was quiet from traffic, but this time all you can hear is everyone else talking and making noise. After another sleepless night, and worry of impending impaling from the coils in the mattress i asked for a new mattress, or some help flipping the old one over, the lady at reception moaned at me to the maid, thinking i didnt understand them, then sent the handy man up, who confirmed that the bed was broken and he would fix it tomorrow, he didnt come the next day or the next or the next after that. i complained each day and i felt like i was being annoying to them! they werent bothered at all that i was sleeping on a broken bed, infact the staff give you the impression that you are getting in their way , especially if you want to go down in the lift whilst they are doing the cleaning, there are no seperate lifts for them , so be wary of making them wait, one cleaner was quiet annoyed that i happened to join her in the lift.other than all that, the food was cheap if you like your burger to swim in its own grease you'll be fine..Dont go dont go dont go..
