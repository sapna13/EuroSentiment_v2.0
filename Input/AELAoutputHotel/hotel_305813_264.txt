{"text":"A cut above the norm I was a little sceptical at the rave reviews that this hotel got from Trip Advisor reviewers as they seemed too good to be true. However, having stayed there for two nights in September 2007, I would endorse the positive comments that have been written about Langham Place. The staff seemed to go out of their way to be courteous and friendly. In particular, the concierge staff in the lobby were very helpful in providing information about diferent locations in Hong Kong and how to get there. The rooms are beatifully furnished and equipped and are a cut above those of the average large hotel in this class. It is worth asking for a room with a view as some floors provide better views than others. My friends and I had booked two rooms, one of which had stunning views while the view in the other was far less spectacular. The mezannine bar is very pleasant and reasonably priced, at least during the early evening happy hour. Room service was efficient and of a good standard. There is a swimming pool (and spa) on the top floor with great views over the city. It is a really pleasant place to go in the evening or early in the morning. The hotel is also in a great location within walking distance of the top end of Nathan Street and very close to the metro station. It is linked physically to a shopping mall which mainly caters for a clientele of under 25s but has some good cheapish restaurants. The hotel is also within walking distance of the night market in Temple Street although much that is on sale is scarcely worth the effort. I had been in Hong Kong before about seven years ago and was surprised at how few bargains are to be had now. Beijing provides much better opportunities for the enthusiastic shopper! My only quibble with the hotel was that my room was not serviced until 4.00 pm which was very late. At 3.00 pm I asked at reception as well as the staff on the floor that it be done as soon as possible. I was, however, a little surprised that none of the staff seemed to think it unusual that the room was not cleaned in the morning. It slightly spoiled a good day in Hong Kong that I came back to find my room as I had left it early in the morning. Nonetheless, I would strongly recommend this hotel and will defintely stay there when I am back in Hong Kong.
