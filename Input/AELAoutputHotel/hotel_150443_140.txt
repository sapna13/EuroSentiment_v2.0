{"text":"Fantastic family vacation!!!! Our title summarizes it all--we had a fantastic time at the Condado Plaza. Henry Neumann was the only person who could guarantee us adjoining rooms. We called a couple of other hotels in the general area who said they could have 2 rooms, but couldn't guarantee adjoining. Traveling with 3 small children, it was de rigueur for us to have this. Henry was great, and set us up in two fabulous rooms. Everything was new, shiny, clean, perfect!!The pool was clean and very nice. The poolside service from Sterling was exceptional. The elevator from the lobby level down tot he pool level was out of order during our stay, but the very attentive pool staff was always there to give me a hand with my 1-year old daughter's stroller down the stairs.The beach was great and the service was attentive and friendly. We were blessed with perfect weather despite nothing but rain for the three weeks prior. The Gusto d'Italia restaurant was a great option for our first evening dinner. It was family friendly, the food was hot, well presented, portions were appropriate, and they served our kids quickly (we'd had a long day of travel and quick, hot and good was what we needed!). I can't remember the name of the waitress who helped us, but she was outstanding and my 7-year old is still talking about her! Unfortunately I can't recommend them for breakfast--it was pretty bad, but that's not the hotel's doing, as they are unrelated to the hotel. That said, it's a huge convenience to have this restaurant there.The Strip House is open!! We didn't dine here, but it certainly looked like it would be a lot of fun and a great meal.The Starbucks right at the hotel is very convenient. My husband ran out for yogurt, fruit, fantastic coffee and delicious spinach empanadas and quesitos in the mornings. Yum!Sure, there's still some construction to be wrapped up, and the place looks a little sparse, BUT it is going to be absolutely spectacular. The decor is minimalist and modernist, with a rich color palette. Very tasteful and elegant. The room decor is in keeping with this same design, and everything flows very smoothly together. The music piping through the speakers is Vegas cool around the lobby bar area. This is going to be a rockin' happening place when it's all done!!Our entire experience at the Condado Plaza was really amazing. We were thrilled with how friendly, attentive and helpful the entire staff was--from the housekeeping folks to the upper management. We are already anticipating our next family vacation to Puerto Rico and will definitely include the Condado Plaza in our plans.A big thanks to everyone who made our stay so unbelievably wonderful!!
