{"text":"Upgrade required! My husband  I stayed at the Catalonia Bavaro Beach Resort, also known as the Catalonia Bavaro Golf and Casino Beach Resort from September 28, 2007 to October 05, 2007. Firstly, our ratings are: The Beach is a ONE. It deserves a ONE because of the seaweed and numerous jelly fish - not a nice experience.The Food is a THREE. It was typical cafeteria style food and not too, too appetizing. There are four other restaurants to choose from. The Japanese and French restaurants are okay depending on what you chose. The Mexican and American are too far from the main hotel, i.e., right on the beach and as a result we didn't try them because of their location. Hearsay is they too weren't too bad.The Room is a THREE. The rooms are small, adequate but small. The cleanliness wasn't bad but the rooms themselves aren't too appealing. The Grounds of the complex are a FIVE. Well groomed with a good variety of trees and shrubs. Very pleasant walking along the pathways getting from point A to B. The complex has very good security with guards evident everywhere 24\/7. The complex offers a Mini-mall on its grounds which we found to be the cheapest place to purchase anything from clothing, souvenirs and\/or alcohol. In fact we discovered later at the airport the duty free shop was far more expensive than the Mini-mall at the hotel.We upgraded to the Catalonia Bavaro ROYAL Beach Resort which is connected to the Catalonia Bavaro Beach Resort\/Catalonia Bavaro Golf and Casino but distinct in its offereings. If I remember correctly, the Catalonia Bavaro Beach Resort\/Catalonia Bavaro Gold and Casino resort are Villas 1 to 39 and the Catalonia Bavaro ROYAL Beach Resort is Villas 40 to 50-somthing. Our ratings for the ROYAL, which cost an additional $20.00 per person per night additional cost, are a huge FIVE + except for the beach which is the same beach as the other part of the complex which I've given a ONE. Hope this helps! And, yes, we would go back but to the ROYAL ","annotations":[{"endOffset":291,"mention":"jelly","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Jelly_bean","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gelatin_dessert"],"startOffset":286}]}
