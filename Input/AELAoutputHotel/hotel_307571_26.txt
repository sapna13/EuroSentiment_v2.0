{"text":"Everything over the top! I had been wanting to go to Bali and stay at the Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay for a long time, so my husband and I decided to celebrate my √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áig birthday√à√\u2020\u2022?in January 2008 there. From the moment we arrived after 11:00 PM it was over the top. Upon arrival we were checked-in while sitting on a couch drinking a delicious √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æelcome drink√à√\u2020\u2022? We were given one of the most private ocean view villas #211 at the edge of the property. It was like a private compound after entering our double front doors. The covered two-sided living\/dining area had a mini bar, a lovely bowl of fruit (covered so the birds would not eat it all) and a telephone. From there was the view of the ocean with our own plunge pool. Through another set of double doors was our bedroom and bath suite. The bed was very comfortable, had a mosquito net around it and looked out to a patio with lounge chairs and the pool. On our bed there was not a top sheet, only the comforter, so we had to request that.Upon arrival there were flowers in the bathtub. The bathroom was great; had √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢is√à√\u2020\u2022? √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢ers√à√\u2020\u2022?sinks with corresponding amenities, which included: -Iron  ironing board  spray starch-Flashlight-Fire extinguisher-Large basket-type beach bag-Bug spray  Off-Lightweight lavender robes and matching slippers-Hair dryer, comb, brush-Box consisting of razor, shaving cream, emery board, nail clippers, ear buds, cotton pads, 2 toothbrushes and paste, mouth rinse-Bath salts-Candle by tub-Cool gel for sunburn-Incense-Lotion-Bottled water-MP3 player cord, and needs iPod connection also-Bose sound system-LCD plasma TV-Safe-Lighted vanity mirror, but bring your own to see the back of your head!It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ difficult to know where to begin with this resort. The service far outweighed anything else. Immediately everyone greeted us both by our name and we felt as though we were the only guests there the entire time. The grounds are gorgeous. You may choose to walk to where you are going, or you can call for a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áuggy√à√\u2020\u2022?to pick you up and they are there in a heartbeat. The Spa was the best we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe encountered and we had the Sea Mint and Island Fruit Rituals. They were 180 minutes of pure luxury and bliss! The massages were wonderful and every tight knot and muscle was treated! Brian Hathaway is the personable director of the spa and he will design a treatment especially for your needs. He also will give you great tips on where to eat and what to see away from the resort.We chose to eat all of our breakfasts on our outside dining area. They got every order correct and were there exactly 30 minutes or less, after we ordered. We looked forward to the Balinese coffee every morning and reading the paper they brought.When we were there I believe we must have been the only Americans because the only languages we mostly heard were Russian and Japanese with some Australians as well.The service at the pool was so amazing that it made us laugh---they cleaned our sunglasses, brought us popsicles, fresh water, cold towels and next to the chairs was suntan lotion.The food was good, but not super great, and VERY expensive. We ate at P.J.√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, their upscale restaurant on the beach, had lunch at the pool one day, and the Romantic Dinner at our villa. I appreciated the attention to detail with flowers around, votive candles and our special menu on the place mat. It truly was a romantic setting and dining experience. We chose to eat several meals away from the resort.Now for the downside√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√±wo things! The beach is not the best and there are rocks in the water plus an undercurrent that is not completely safe, however after returning from a beach waIk, the attendant washed the sand off of our feet! The second thing was the noise from the airplanes taking off. The airport is directly across the bay and you can see the bright airport lights. The planes flew most all night long. We talked about it, but it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ spoil our time there. The setting, the service and friendliness of the employees made it the most memorable stay for us. We know they are trained to ask how you are every day as well as how are you enjoying your stay in Bali and what is your √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µrogram√à√\u2020\u2022?for the day. We think they send everyone to an orthodontist before hiring them because the majority of them had perfect white teeth and beautiful smiles! The smiles indeed matched their graciousness and genuine care. We'd return in a heartbeat if it weren't so far away.
