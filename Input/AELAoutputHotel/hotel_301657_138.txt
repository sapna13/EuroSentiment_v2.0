{"text":"Stay here! We stayed in the Park Hotel for 5 nights in July, we visit Tokyo regularly and normally stay in the Hilton in Shinjuku but after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and getting a recommendation from friends we decided to stay in the Park. The hotel, as mentioned in previous reviews, is in Shiodome Media Tower with the lobby on the 27th floor. Visually the place is amazing, beautiful views and very serene. The staff at check-in were excellent and upgraded us to a higher floor upon our request. We were looking over the bay area. We stayed in 2 City Queens (standard rms) on the 33rd floor, the rooms are compact but beautifully designed and the beds are really comfortable.We ate in the Japanese restaurant on our first night with great views  excellent food although small portions and reasonably expensive. Be warned that most restaurants (incl. the hotel) in the area have last orders between 9 and 10pm so you need to take this into account when planning your evenings. I recommed trying the top floor restaurants in the Shiodome City Centre building nearby - the view  food are outstanding.From a location point of view you are within 5 mins walk of Shiodome station with excellent and easy links to all the most popular areas of Tokyo.We have just booked our Christmas trip to Tokyo and are staying in the Park again. Both times we have booked on their website and the rates are excellent plus the hotel personally email you to confirm you booking and any individual requests you might have. The City Queen Early Bird rate is roughly $160\/nt and for the room, service and location this is an outstanding deal.
