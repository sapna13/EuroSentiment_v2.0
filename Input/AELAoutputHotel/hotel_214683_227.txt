{"text":"Relaxing Stay at the Marriott Waikiki Beach Resort We stayed for ten nights beginning July 18. This was our third trip to the islands and first time back to Oahu in several years. We wanted the nightlife, restaurants and bigger city amenities of Honolulu this time and the Marriott Waikiki was a great location for that purpose. We also chose this hotel because of the Marriott Rewards points. Check in was quick, efficient and friendly. Lucked out and there was no line at our late afternoon arrival. We had booked a corner deluxe ocean view in advance. Oversized room with sitting area on the front corners of the K Tower. Room 2133. Spectacular views of Waikiki from both sides. Splurge and book it if you care about the view. Room amenities and maid service was excellent during our stay. Refrigerator in room which is a nice touch. Marriott has upgraded this hotel, or at least this room, to their new Revive linen collection. Very nice. All beds have the Marriott pillow top mattress and lots of pillows. If you don't like the soft pillow top, I am sure they will adjust bedding for you on request at any full service Marriott. Beach is right across Kalakaua Ave. from the hotel. This hotel is at the Diamond Head end of Waikiki. Two ABC stores, Hertz, travel agents, and several other boutiques on premises. All staff we interacted with were friendly, and welcoming. Used the concierge twice and were very pleased with their service. The pools are small, but recommend renting one of the cabanas pool side if you want a day away from the sand and sun of Waikiki. Attentive pool side service is available for food and drink. The hotel restaurants were expensive, but what isn't in Hawaii? Within easy walking distance or short drive to countless other fabulous restaurants in all price ranges. We did not have a bad meal at any of the Marriott on site eateries.We did the luau at The Royal Hawaiian Hotel this time just for fun. Recommend it highly. Book it early. Fabulous food, limited seating, so it fills up quick. Check out was also easy and efficient. The valet staff pre-arranged our cab pick up back to the airport ahead of time. Very easy. We will certainly consider the Marriott Waikiki Beach Resort during our next visit to Honolulu.
