{"text":"Apsis Atrium Palace Barcelona - SUB STANDARD - DO NOT BOOK! We have just returned from the hotel today.1. Pool is tiny and i mean tiny 2. Fitness suite - 3 machines 1 stepper and, and all in one and a cross trainer - poor quality. Water from air con leaking all over wood floor which makes it DANGEROUS3. Rooms were not ready still at 4.30pm on day of arrival.4. Half drunk can of coke in the fridge - shows they do not check the fridges in rooms very often.5. Maids were hit and miss....some times they left towels, slippers etc other days they did not 6. The maids left their very dirty floor cloths on the desk 7. Jacuzzi Bath did not work for the whole of the stay - they new about it but failed to tell us - apparently it had been broken a while8. Breakfast discounted if you book in advance - average breakfast.9 We booked Restaurant for new years eve dinner in advance but when we sat down the Maitre D told us all that was not available - was easier to tell us what was available. In fact he directed us to a nice place around the corner.10. The english TV channels had NO sound11. Air conditioning is non existent - cooler to leave doors open and listen to traffic all night.12. God forbid that you have any emergency issues as the whole hotel was run by receptionists \/ front office manager (Maria who was not there often either) - Mr Lara was on holiday in the south of spain and although they spoke with him he did not ask to speak to me to apologise of offer to helpIMPORTANT Advice also:We booked 2 suites which were nice suites if tvs and jacuzzis worked (3000 euros) - our friends booked a private car through the hotel so that they could have a child seat for their new born baby - the car turned up without a car seat and charged them 85 euros for a 20 euro journey. No kettles in room if you need to boil water for babiesWe were offered 80 pound discount for all of the above problems - they ruined our holiday and offered us 80 pounds....!We were only offered an apology when we came to check out.This is a 1 star hotel that wants to be a 5 star hotel when it grows up - so far it is far from growing up and has to be the worst run hotel I have ever stayed in (And I have stayed in well over 100 different ones worldwide).Our friend (Who also stayed there) is a travel agent and is going to talk any prospective customers away from this hotel as this is the worst she has stayed in!My advice - DO NOT STAY THERE. PaulPS...I am still waiting for a response to my email.
