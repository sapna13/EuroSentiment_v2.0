{"text":"Not worth it Rooms: for a 5* hotel the cleanliness was at a very low level. The shower drain was clogged. Although there was a mosquito net, we fought with mosquitoes every night - apparently the room maid left the doors long enough opened so that they could easily come inside. There were also a big variety of other bugs living in our room, a cockroach-family included.Service: half of the bartenders and the waiters in the restaurants were really friendly. The other half of the personnel was arrogant and unmotivated to do their job. Some days before we left, the air conditioner got broken. We complained at least 3 times before they sent us a technician, who needed 3 days (every time he came without any warning) to repair it. At the end he apparently changed it with a new one, which got broken the same night:( Fortunately we left the next day.Food: The same [--], different day! The salads were not fresh, the meat was almost every time burnt and the dessert was full with bugs. The a-la-carte-restaurants weren't much better. Two or three times they cooked for lunch outside, near the beach. The paellas were really good, so don't miss it. If you like wine, you'd better bring some bottles from home. The cocktails taste the one like the other.Pool and Beach: The pool is very small compared to the room capacities of the hotel. If you want a chair at the pool, you have to get up early. The beach is nice, not overcrowded and kept clean every day. If you want to visit a really beautiful Carribean beach, I'll recommend you a trip to the Saona island:) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":899,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":893},{"endOffset":899,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":893},{"endOffset":899,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":893},{"endOffset":899,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":893}]}
