{"text":"Nice hotel but poor beach On the whole this is a very nice hotel. We spent 10 nights in a pool view room. Departed on 31.10.08. Pools: The hotel has 2 pools- main  lagoon. Both are a good size. The lagoon has built in seating areas which were very welcome. The pool bar service is hit and miss- sometimes efficient and at times non existent. Drinks- fruit juice, milk shake, smoothies, coke etc cost around √ä√£¬¢3-4. Water cost around √ä√£¬¢1.50.Restaurants: Guests had the choice of dining inside or out for the buffet breakfast. The choice was average. Some mornings trying to get a cup of coffee\/ tea could be difficult. Dinner: We tried Chess Restaurant dinner buffets on two occasions- the satay on the evening we arrived and the seafood BBQ mid stay. They were both the same price R325K (ex service charge  tax) per adult, half price for children. The seafood was much better value- it included lobster and fillet steak, which were excellent. With a few drinks the cost was around √ä√£¬¢100 (2 adults and 1 child). Alcohol is expensive, a glass of local wine cost around √ä√£¬¢6, cocktails √ä√£¬¢7-8, gin  tonic √ä√£¬¢6-7, glass of beer √ä√£¬¢3-4. A bottle of decent wine would cost in the region of √ä√£¬¢30+. Had lunch a few times, food was very good.Culture evening: international buffet and dance show was lovely- cost around √ä√£¬¢100 including drinks.Rajah's restaurant (Indonesian) seemed very popular, always busy in the evening.The Asian restaurant (Japanese\/ Chinese) seemed very quiet.The Pizza restaurant: my daughter had dinner here one evening and said the food was lovely. The location of all restaurants is good- dotted around the pool, near the beach front. They look lovely at night, when all lit up.Kids club: My 8 year old daughter liked the club very much. The club and all activities were free.Beach: Generally the beach was poor but at times it looked lovely. The water is warm  very clear. However, the sand was very unpleasant to walk on- not firm, with lots of broken coral, so beach shoes are a must . There are quite a lot of hawkers who pounce as soon as you set foot out of the hotel grounds- sarongs, watches etc. Everything being sold can be purchased in Kuta or Nusa Dua village for a fraction of the price. Massages are available to the left of the beach as you walk out of the hotel.Outside hotel: There are a number of local restaurants that provide free transport to and from hotels. The most notable being Mai Mai- the food is fantastic and the service is great. The cost of a 3 course meal with lots of drinks (alcohol  soft) is around √ä√£¬¢20-25 for 3 people. Ring: 772406 for free transport. There are lots of other restaurants and shops in this area but they are not within walking distance of the hotel. If you use the free transport (both ways), you can stock up on drinks  snacks very cheaply either before or after dinner.Just outside the main gate, within walking distance of the hotel, are shops and restaurants. We tried Tropical restaurant, the food was very nice, however, the drinks menu seemed extensive but they had 'sold out' of wine and gin etc. (See above for better option).Bali Collection: We didn't like this shopping centre. We had dinner which was poor quality and over priced. There are shops passing themselves off as 'designer', they are not genuine. For shopping ask hotel for metered taxi to Kuta cost R70-80K (around √ä√£¬¢5). Matahari department store is very good- clothing, shoes, bags, jewellery, gifts etc with fixed prices. There is a supermarket attached which sells water, juice for R1-4 (approx 10p to P) Poppies Lane 2 is worth visiting- sunglasses  watches R30-50 (up to √ä√£¬¢3), purses R50-70 (up to √ä√£¬¢4.50), handbags R120-150 (up to √ä√£¬¢10). The first price quoted by the seller is usually ridiculously high, you should pay no more than prices quoted above.There are 3 other hotels in this area within walking distance, we visited all of them. The Lagoona is beautiful, ideal for honeymooners\/ couples. The Melia seems to attract a lot more hawkers on their stretch of beach. The Westin which is next door to Nusa Dua Hotel, seems nice.Tours: Pacific World should be avoided- they overcharge and will try and take advantage of you. Go elsewhere.
