{"text":"Really good stay at the Sofitel We chose the Sofitel Amsterdam after reading various reviews and finding that it was conveniently located to the train station. Unfortunately, British Airways lost our luggage on our way from Heathrow, so our mood upon arrival was less than pleasant. Luckily though, we didn't have our luggage while we walked from the station to the Sofitel. We didn't have the best directions to find it and wound up taking the wrong turn at a junction so after about 25 minutes of walking in the wrong direction, we came across the Sofitel. Upon arrival, we came across two very friendly and very helpful staff who helped us check in with ease. When we informed them that we didn't have any luggage, they took all of the details and continued to contact the agent regarding the whereabouts of our belongings (apparently this happens to at least 15 of their guests per week with BA, so if you have a connecting flight on your way to Amsterdam, don't be surprised if your bags don't make it).The room was a very good size, with a comfortable bed and clean bathroom. We spent more time in the room than we'd expected, waiting for our bags to arrive, and it was very comfortable. We ate in the restaurant\/bar which was very nice and also had room service (without a change of clothes we were reluctant to go out too much) which was lovely - they had a fantastic pasta which is highly recommended. The location was great, quite close to the shopping area (and not too far from the red light district). Amsterdam was a lovely city and we were really surprised at how much we liked it. The Sofitel was a perfect choice and was great value for money.Would definitely recommend a stay at the Sofitel Amsterdam. ","annotations":[]}
