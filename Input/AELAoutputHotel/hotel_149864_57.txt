{"text":"Best Club Med Ever! We came from California to spend a week at our 4th Club Med. We've been 2x to Ixtapa and once to the Bahamas. The property was gorgeous, the food excellent, the beach and pool beautiful, and the GO's very friendly. It is a very long 2-legged flight (11 hrs, total) to get to the Caribbean, so for me, it better be worth it. It was! The property is VERY large, and there is a lot of walking to get to your room. Plan ahead - you won't want to make multiple trips. The rooms are clean and functional - just ok, but who stays in there room? It has great A\/C, a TV with many US channels and a private room for the kids. It was fine. The weather was just right, 85 and not too humid. Just a very few skeeters (they spray every pm). Yes, the guests were mostly French. Most could speak English somewhat. The local staff spoke Spanish. Really, if you travel outside the US, what do you expect? The whole world speaks English? In California, one is at a distinct disadvantage if one doesn't speak Spanish.... the GO'sall spoke decent English. The kids' clubs are what keep me coming back. The staff REALLY appear to love working with children. My 13-year old has always made friends with the GO's and other kids and had a blast at each one we've been to. She LOVED the teen club. Just enough adult supervision and choice to make her feel she was in charge of her own activities. They may attend all or part of the day, from 8:30 am to 9:30 pm. They can engage in any of the myriad of activities offered by several GOs or just stay and watch videos or play on the computers or X-Box (!?). I had to beg my kid to spend any time with us at all! She set an alarm for the morning and spent all day with her friends. She took meals with them, also. They were mostly American or French Canadians. She cried when we left and told me she would remember this vacation forever. OK - that was so worth it!I saw quite a few single moms w\/kids and some single women who explain they prefer the kids' properties so that they are not constantly hit on. There were security guards everywhere, presumably to keep locals out. I felt very safe letting my daughter out of my sight. However, if you do not like being around kids - this isn't for you. They are everywhere!The French do go topless on the beach and some around the pool - that took a bit getting used to. Nobody seemed to care. I didn't. My daughter said the American boys made a fuss of it at first, but by the end of the week, they got over it. Snorkeling was great - right off the beach. Lots of fish and stingrays. My hubby saw a HUGEea turtle 4x bigger than he and a giant manta ray. The ocean was warm with very few waves. It was shallow for a long way out. The beach is like that Corona commercial...The resort was only half full when we were there; as we were leaving the hordes of East Coast guests were arriving. The teen club was supposedly going to jump from 100 11-17-year olds to 300+. The mini club (little kids were expected to number over 500! ) was going to be packed. Try to go in the off season...Would I go again? Tomorrow!
