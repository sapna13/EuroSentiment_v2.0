{"text":"Very Sophisticated Stayed in a Superior King Bed, which was a nice spacious room with modern\/classic design. I liked having a bathroom down a little hallway and more separate from the general bed area. The shower was nice, but the tub was not a deep soaking tub like described. The sink area was very nice, i liked the marble, the lighting, and the flowers. The bed was very comfortable, I slept very well. Nice toiletries, which they restocked each day, although the towels could have been nicer - a bit rough as was the robe which i didnt bother using. The workout room was the most modern I had ever seen  they supply fresh towels, water,  fruit, and all the cardio machines have tvs with cable attached, the weight machines all looked brand new! the first night we had a late dinner in the lounge which was surprisingly popular with hip music  cool decor. The waiter was extremely polite  sincere sounding. The food was excellent for late lounge food, although - you pay for what you get. Great location 1 block from the White House,  also close to the Verizon Center, and not too far from Dupont Circle. the last day we splurged for breakfast in the dining area, which surprisingly had the same prices for food as the room service. Food was expensive  not fulfilling, although the waitstaff was attentive. (The coffee was good, they gave you a full pot of french pressed Lavazza) I had read reviews to not eat in the dining area, and now I see why. Breakfast was about $40-50 for two people. The doorman was also very nice  attentive to call a cab or open the door with eagerness.
