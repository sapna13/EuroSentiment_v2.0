{"text":"The low down on Harbour View Suites... The Harbor View Suite sounds great from other reviews, however after booking online and paying a premium rate, I was offered a room on the 3rd Floor with no harbor view (i.e. no water visible only the backs of the buildings in front of the Hotel). I finally got a room on the 9th floor after a lot of discussion. I could at least see a tiny part of the harbor. My advice is to make sure to secure a room higher up in advance, otherwise its not worth the time and effort of coming up the hill if you don't have a room with a view.The location is a long way back up the hill even by bus or escalator if you need to pop back to the hotel for anything during the day.The location also has its advantages with easy access to Soho, via the mid-level escalators. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel door which links with the MTR. Its not too far to walk to the Peak from here - however none of the staff knew the path to the peak - so we found it ourselves! Free wireless internet in all rooms is excellent.The Elevators are extremely slow in this hotel. Checking-in and checking out is also quite slow.There was renovation work going on in January 2008, so it got noisy from 9am in the mornings. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ plan to work in your room as the noise will drive you crazy.
