{"text":"Horrible Beds; Uncaring Management I booked this hotel based on the great reviews here at trip advisor. This would be mine and my partner's third christmas in New York. We planned to stay seven nights. After our five hour flight, we checked into the hotel (Room 1201) and wanted to take a nap before enjoying the city. The room was tiny as mentioned in previous reviews (even smaller than other places you can stay in NYC) but overall adequate. However, we found the bed to be unbearably stiff and uncomfortable. The pillows also were flimsy and not nice. We realized that we would not enjoy our trip if we had to spend so many nights on such an uncomfortable bed. I have traveled all over the world and stayed in hotels from Europe, US and Australia. This ranks as one of the worst if not worst bed I have found. We decided to go over to the W Tuscany, which was much better. King size bed, heavenly bed, 31 LCD and room three times the size.The real disappointment came when dealing with the management. I didn't feel it was fair to pay the early departure fee. I can understand if we had not shown up or left early for no reason but we immediately told the front desk we did not like the bed. Well, after calling several times, and no one calling me back, Peter the general manager finally called me. He pretty much told me that he would not remove the charge, would talk to the owner and would call me back. I'm still waiting for that phone call. This should be a warning that if you don't enjoy your stay and want to leave, you will be charged and management won't care. ","annotations":[]}
