{"text":"City Garden? Have stayed at teh City Garden a couple of times now so I guess I'm a repeat customer which is indicative. As with all HK hotels, they are always busy because there's a watch \/ dentist \/ jewelry \/ proctologist conference in HK that weekend and all the hotels are full.... so City Garden had all the right things for me.... a bed and a bathroom. The first stay was in a exec room (not on the exec floor). It was big enough for two adults and a 4 yr old on the floor... we didn't order the 4 yr old, he was complementary. Bathroom is 'compact' but functional. All knobs and switches can be operated from the comfort of the well appointed toilet seat.Breakfast - always a good way to make up for any deficiencies a hotel may have. Well, it's very good and, if compared to some of the other hotels it competes against, pretty good value. If you have a 4 yr old (complementary or your own) the waiting staff will make an enourmous fuss of him. Those ladies will make a bee line and are very friendly. The location is OK I guess. Taxis are cheap so $30HK will get you into town or walk a few mins to the MTR.I took a look into the exec lounge - Not much to write home about but they did go out of their way to help when my room internet connection went down. Not sure I would pay out of my own money for teh nibbles and drinks on offer - the 7-11 adjacent supplies nibbles and bear at knock down prices. Not much around the hotel and it's in a chinese area of town if that doesn't sound too daft. Would stay again if on a business budget.
