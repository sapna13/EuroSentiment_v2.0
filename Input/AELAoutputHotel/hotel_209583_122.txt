{"text":"Why complain its a vacation! OK, first of all I found this site to be helpful and totally off base on some of the comments. Seems to me when people go on vacation they think that it should be just like home but with a million servants doing whatever you want. I had a great time this past week. Something to keep in mind is that it isn't like home. The food is different, the weather is different, and the people are different. People are right, I found the food to be not really anything that I would crave, but could always find something to make sure that I didn't starve. If you want food like you have at home then.... you get my drift. The overall atmosphere of the resort I felt was great! It was clean and the staff was excellent. Hint... A tip for the maid or wait staff can get you a long ways! I am talking $1\/day. Put yourself in their shoes, when someone gives me a tip I seem to go above and beyond my normal job\/personality to impress. A tip is not necessary as I felt they did an excellent job anyways but it doesn't hurt.The drinks were different, but by mid-trip I found my drink of choice. With the fresh sqeezed orange juice and a shot of vodka I was loving every minute of it.The beach was gorgeous and not full of people that are bothering you all day to buy trinkets to take home to your family. I went with a group of 10 and we did the snorkeling booze cruise excusion. VERY FUN! We ended up being the only people on the cruise. We snorkeled which included swimming with the sharks. After that we enjoyed drinks and fun, and one awesome seafood dinner. It was just excellent. It was only a 5 hour excursion but well worth it. We even had our own personal video guy that took footage of our whole trip. $35 for the DVD is a small price to pay for memories on tape that will last for ever.Staying at the Palace was an excellent choice for our group as it gave us access to all food and drinks, and some activites at all the resorts in the complex. My husband really enjoyed the golfing, for me the free mini golf was great. At night we hit the casino and then off to the disco. Something for everyone in our group!Maybe I just love going on vacations too much, but I love to try different things as that is part of the overall thought of getting away for me.
