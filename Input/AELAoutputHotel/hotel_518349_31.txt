{"text":"Nice design, good service, minor problems. The reason I booked this hotel is the cool design and the not-so-bad reviews the hotel has on internet forums like this one.I stayed at the hotel for a week and here are mine impressions:The good:Clean rooms, nice furniture, cool and inspiring design of the hotel.Friendly receptionists, at least the two persons that I have been dealing with.Free internet trough LAN-cable. (Availible at the reception for 20 EUR deposit)Phantastic glass wall with an outside view.Electrically operated curtains that block sunrays or curious eyes.Congestion in the sink - the personel fixed that same day.Armchair leg broken(!) - the personel fixed that same day.Very close to the subway and a big shopping place.Very close to the spectacular Torre Agbar - cool tower that can easily be seen from an airplane while landing or taking off.Great elevators.It is not possible to crank up the volume of the TV to very high levels - no disturbance from deaf neighbours.The bad:Very noisy road and a adjacent construction of a big building.Breakfast not included - in my country good breakfasts are included as standard.The view is so-so from some of the rooms. Mine view was not phenomenal despite I stayed at 7:th floor.Not very close to the centre of the city from the hotel, but possible to walk - approx less than 30 minutes.The floor of the bathroom gets wet when showering.No equpment to make tea, neither equpment to iron.The pool on the roof was closed - come on it was only October! :)Other:It is possible to see from the room in to the shower. This might be a problem for people with kids. Great for couples that find each other attractive, other couples beware. :)))))))) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":256,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":252},{"endOffset":1423,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1420},{"endOffset":1423,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1420}]}
