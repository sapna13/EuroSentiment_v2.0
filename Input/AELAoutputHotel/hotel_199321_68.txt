{"text":"Gotta love the freebies I was looking for a hotel for our family's three night stay in Frankfurt. Reading the other reviews posted here by previous guests, I figured to give the Excelsior a try. I'm glad we did. The location is very convenient, directly across from Frankfurt's main train station and subway lines. There is also a taxi stand in front of the hotel. Finding something to eat on a budget is easy to do in this area too. There are lots of food vendors inside the train station, ranging from McDonalds and Burger King to sandwiches and doner kebabs. I reserved a triple room and was upgraded to a four-bed bedroom instead. There was a double bed for the wife and I and a bunk bed for my two little boys. The rooms were a little small but for E81 (including taxes), it was a deal. My room faced the trainstation and street, but the traffic noise was not bothersome. My best part of this hotel was the freebies. The drinks in the minibar (2 beers, 2 Pepsis, 1 large water, 2 waters with gas and 2 orange juices) are free and restocked daily. Free telephone calls within Germany, which I used a lot to call Ramstein Air Base. The free breakfast downstairs has a good variety of foods to choose from: breads, cereals, yogurts, fruits, scrambled eggs, ham, bacon, even rice. The hotel also advertises a free laundering and pressing of an article of clothing but I never used it. During the day, the lobby serves cakes and tea\/coffee for its guests, for free too.The front desk is a very busy one here, yet the front desk staff maintained friendly and jovial attitudes. They were very helpful.I am glad I read the other postings about this hotel from other posters because it's all true. For the location, price, and, of course, the freebies, this hotel can't be compared.
