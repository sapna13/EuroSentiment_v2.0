{"text":"Great hotel in Superb Location My wife and I stayed in the Lenox Hotel between Thursday May 15 and Sat May 17. We had a great experience. We would recommend this hotel to everyone visiting Boston.RoomWe had a double room on the 10th floor with two windows. The room is reasonable size in the Boston metro area. Not huge but big enough. It is nicely furnished. Room was super clean. The maid came to clean the room multiple times each day. They restock the bottle water, clean the bathroom and towels, and refresh the bed and bath robes. Free Wifi was available throughout the hotel. I believe that exercise facility was available also, but we did not use that.ServiceALL the hotel works were very professional -- from bell boys to check-in counter to maid service. Always helpful and always smiling. The front desk was very efficient. We did not waited for long for anything. I am very happy that we were able to check in 7:30AM in the morning. That enable us to take a shower and have a full day to activities.LocationThe hotel is near the Back Bay Area in Boston. Near the Boston Public Library and the Green Line on the T (subway). The hotel is next to the Newbury Street shopping area, the Prudential Center shopping, Copley Place and the Duck Tour starting point. Boston Common, Faneuil Hall, Freedom Trail, Boston Harbor and Convention Center, and MIT can easily be reached via the T.TransportationWe took the Silver Line, to the Red Line, to the Green Line on the T to the hotel. Easy, cheap and fast. No problem at all. We took the T everywhere and did not try taxi or bus.
