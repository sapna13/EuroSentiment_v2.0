{"text":"Gross don't do it is my advice If you are a stoner and you are having a wild weekend and just want somewhere to crash then this is the place for you. it has internet and TV downstairs, coffee most of the day and cheap booze in the vending machine and the staff are friendly enough but if you want to spend any time in your room forget it. We got there and our room was disgusting. Walls had gross stains up them (I don't even want to think about it). It had a nasty smell and the sheets on every bed had stains on them. Again don't ask, there was sick, one sheet looked like a bike had been ridden up the middle of it and one had suspicious white stains lovely. After much complaining they did change them for us but what they changed them with wasn't much better. if you showered early then the showers were clean but they got dirty very quickly and it was easy to get stuck in them. Breakfast was ok but started about an hour later than advertised so if you want an early start you have to skip it. location by the canal not too bad but has red light ladies either side and doesn't make you feel particularly safe. Oh and stinks of weed of course. Steps are also incredibly steep so getting upstairs with a case is a no no. Not somewhere to stay if you don't want the run of the mill Amsterdam holiday.
