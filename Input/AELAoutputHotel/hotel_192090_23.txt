{"text":"Love the ParkCity! The ParkCity is truly a gem on a fantastic quiet street! We stayed there for 4 nights in early November and found the hotel to be a great value in a perfect location. It was very quiet, clean and comfortable. The rooms aren't huge, but I wouldn't call them small. I am very picky about cleanliness and our room met my standards. The bathroom is very special, with a nice deep bathtub, rain shower head and hand held shower head. I felt like I was at home!The staff was very friendly and helpful. The first night we got there, we asked for a coffeemaker and they brought up a tray with a selection of teas, instant coffee, sugars, creamers, an electric kettle, cups, saucers and spoons. It had everything we needed to make morning coffee and evening tea for our whole stay.Our TV wasn't tuning in to the CNN channel, so we called and they sent someone up to fix it. (We were there during the election and really wanted to watch the results on a U.S. TV channel.)We were offered turn-down service every night and when we told them it was unnecessary, they would give us the chocolates. Very sweet.We booked through their website and were able to get an early bird special and pre-pay for the high speed internet at a discount from the standard √ä√£¬¢9.99.I loved this hotel and would love to keep it a secret, but I like it so much that it deserves a good review. I will definitely stay there every time I am in London.
