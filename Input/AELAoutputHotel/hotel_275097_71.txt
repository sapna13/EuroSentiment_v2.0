{"text":"Great value The Atrium Palace is a rather new hotel four blocks from Placa de Catalunya. Easy transportation between the airport and that plaza is avalable by rail and bus (I sugest the bus, it is usually faster, more comfortable and you are less likely to have to fight off pickpockets). Taxi will be about 30 euro from the airport (a bit more on Sundays and in the evening).This is an excellent location with easy access to the metro, buses, the tourists circle buses. Of course, you can walk to many of Barcelona highlights eaisly from the hotel. Is the location ok? Well, the Ritz is 100 meters to the east.The reception staff was great. They kept trying to help me and seemed disappointed that I didn't need any special help.The room I was given is simply huge by European standards. Simple, modern decor and that great European rarity: reading lights over the bed bright enough to actually allow one to read in bed. Bedding was two full beds placed together. VERY hard beds (I consider this a good thing; you may not).The bathroom was fully equipped with tub\/shower, vanity. toilet and bidet. A full range of stuff was provided (disposable razor, toothbrush, sewing kit, bathrobes, slippers, etc. et al. Big fluffy towels, lots of hot water and excellent water pressure.Breakfast was served (7:15 to 10:30) is served in the hotel's small bar\/restaurant buffet style. A full range of fruit, breads, cereal, cheeses, meats, yogart and eggs are provided. The orange juice is not fresh squeezed.Free computer\/internet available 24-hours\/day in the business center as well as free wifi throughtout the hotel. There seems to be internet available through the TV and there was an RJ45 hook-up in the room. I didn't try either of these, but simply used WIfI.Small swimming pool, sauna, hot tub and a basic exercise room is open until 11:00 pm.One hint: They take privacy seriously. When you leave the room for the day, hang the Make up the room on the door.Summary: great room, excellent location, very helpful staff, good price. Hard to beat that.
