{"text":"Could have been better I stayed at the Ocean Blue resort from the 10-17 of March 2007. I must say I had a great time, the resort's grounds were nicely kept, and the weather was beautiful, but there were several problems. Airport- Nothing to do with the resort, but as soon as you make it throgh customs people are trying to grab your bags, to take them the 30 feet to the taxi, don't let them do it. They also do it when you arrive back at the airport, these guys are everywhere. You also get your picture taken when you get off the plane with some Dominican ladies, I didn't even know they were taking my picture, it was a rush job, but you can buy your picture when you leave for $8USD. The airport when we left was packed, all flights come and go very close to one another so be prepared.Water-Let's start off saying, yes, there is a problem with the water pressure and depending on which villa and room in that villa you stay you may or may not ever have hot water. Sometimes it gets pretty warm, but never hot. The tub, don't even think about using it, it is a waste of space and what is with the window into the bathroom?Staff-You see the same people working there all the time, I don't think they ever go home or live in the basement or something. Most of the staff were very friendly but compared to US standards of service, they were not the best. Usually had to wait for drinks, it was usually faster to go to the bar myself, and it did take a while to get food at several of the restaurants. The pool and lobby bars stayed the busiest and I had a hard time getting drinks, usually only 1 or 2 barkeeps at a time working, should have been more. They all know a little bit of english, some of the ones waiting tables should have known more, had a lot of problems in this area. I didn't tip much and I don't think it affected my service at all. But to each his own.Food and Drinks-Many people in our party did come down with some stomach problems, possibly caused by the food. It takes a while to get use to down there and it is medicore at best. I am in the military and it tasted very much the same. The fruit is wonderful and you will find several items at each restaurant that are good, but it is all hit and miss. The drinks were very good, miami vice and bananna mama are the best drinks there and don't forget you are in a foreign country, don't drink bud, the national beer, Presidente, is very, very good. Other- The pools get noisey at time with there stupid crazy games they get very old after the first day. I am there to relax people and the hola senor, hola senora song gets very annoying. The pools were nice, but one stayed very dirty, we even think someone threw up in it and it was never cleaned up for a couple of days. The big jacuzzi was nice, but the kids used it as a kiddie pool and it really wasn't warm, just a smaller pool. You must get up early to get a chair at the beach or pool cause they go fast and people usually save at both just in case.Also, make sure you brink plenty of cash, US dollars are fine, for no one except to check out and the spa accepts credit. If you decide to do anything off the resort you need cash. There is an ATM but it only has Dominican Pesos, not US dollars. Also the Royal guys (timeshare people) are very annoying, but the people at the resort said the are planning on kicking them off as soon as possible. Always haggle with all the people selling stuff, this includes off the resort activities and the beach market or in town, they will come down on their price. Also, all the extra activities are very expensive. In the end the Dominican Republic and Punta Cana was a nice place to visit, but I won't be going back anytime soon.
