{"text":"Great Time Spent a week at Grand Oasis Feb 20-27 typical all inclusive vacation.Resort itself is older but well maintained with alot of updates we were in building 2 our friends were in 1 both the same.Did get to see inside building 7 which is newer much nicer inside.The layout of the resort is nice since your never far from the Beach,Pool or Bars.Service I would rate very well a few dollars go a long way.All of the people working there did a great job and this made our vacation very enjoyable.The American restaurant was our favorite the beef tenderloin was excellent.The buffet was typical.The beach Food variaty was also good.The venders can be quiet pushy at times and they do have tables in the resort twice a week just say no thanks every time you walk by.The timeshare people are also there and always talk to you very politely trying to get you to ask them about the vacation club we never asked or told them we were busy.I see people complaning about sea weed on the beach the staff is cleaning constantly not a problem the other resorts down the beach seemed to have more.The water in this area is very calm there is a reef way out in front breaking all waves.We used the sail boats windsurfers and kayaks.Great beach for children.Bars only thing we missed was there lack of any canadian whiskey could not find it anywhere.Wheather was perfect comparing it to cancun area for febuary it is much warmer always in shorts.We also lost electricity a few times but were never in room.Would return again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1302,"mention":"canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":1294},{"endOffset":1302,"mention":"canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":1294},{"endOffset":1302,"mention":"canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":1294}]}
