{"text":"Friendly place with some bad design and great beach ! This place is slow on check in, but the guys are so kind i didnt mind at all, i was there with my 13year old daugther. Better book a superior room, nicer areas, because the rest lacks on the design, not warm. The personnel is very courtois and do their best, the big flaw of this resort is the housekeeping, it was a problem for everyone in the regular rooms. Food was ok, found something good at each meal and the drinks too. Great service from bartenders and servers in the restaurants, dont miss the mexican restaurant, its fun tequila at your table ! The animators are very kind and try their best, but nightlife is inexistant on the resort, youll need to go out and they plan fun stuff to do for about 25$ per person. Somes discos are worth seing. Beach is the best part, take a catamaran tou its worth it, great staff there also.For any medical need there is a drug store with a nice pharmacist that will help you. Room are descent, if you go there in summer, pick a room on the second floor, its cooler. First floor rooms were smelly apperently from people who change room.We were on third and i was fine. The main pool, where the bar is, wasnt always clear and some people got ears infection during my trip. But we had a nice and relaxing week, we met wonderful people, from usa, france, haiti !!! Beach is perfect you can take long walks...
