{"text":"Good Location We have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel that I booked for my boyfriends 30th Birthday.The hotel is in a good location for sightseeing, shops and subway - we walked almost everywhere, only catching the subway once to go to the financial district. We tended to take cabs if we didnt want to walk as they were easy enough to get and cheap, if a bit hair raising at times! As this was a birthday present for my boyfriends 30th, I had requested on booking through the hotel website, a high floor room if that was possible, we were to be staying in a Junior Suite. Upon arrival we were given a room on the 8th floor which unsurprisingly had no view, we asked to be moved to a higher floor and were accomodated but had to take a smaller room and were not refunded the difference in price. I had also requested that some toiletries and pillows be in our room on arrival, all of which were confirmed but none of which arrived. I eventually had to phone the front desk and ask for them to be sent up.I had also had tickets to Wicked delivered to the hotel. I asked for them on arrival but was told they had not arrived, I asked again the next day and still no sign, finally after numerous calls to the ticket agent, I eventually found out that the tickets were indeed with the front desk staff. I phoned to ask for them and miraculously they appeared. This is not what I expect from a hotel of this standard.On my boyfriends birthday, I asked for balloons, cake and champagne to be left in the room, and it was there waiting on him after a long day at Woodbury Common. The cake was huge, chocolate and very nice, and the wine helped us along nicely as we got ready for dinner at the River Cafe in Brooklyn.The hotel was comfortable, well located, the staff friendly - but I would not rave about it. It was a good base for what was otherwise a fantastic trip, but I couldnt help feeling a bit disappointed, like there was something missing. I felt that without the view, I simply could have been in a hotel in any city anywhere in the world. Having said that I probably would stay here again - the rooms were big, the view when we got it was amazing and the location was perfect, and at least if I do go again I know exactly what to expect...
