{"text":"Nice Resort. We grabed this hotel as part of the cheaper expedia deals and did not expect much of it. As it turned out, this was one of the most favorable vacations we've been on. Some flaws existed of course but nothing can be perfect. As long as these flaws were minor and did not matter at all, unless you are a person with pointless complains. We travel a lot and never stay at hotels below 4 stars. However, this is only 3.5 stars and the quality of food is a well deserved 5+ !!! In buffet, the variety isn't extremely wide but everything they have is very tasty. If you're a meat lover, try the Spanish restaurant (El Meson)-sirloin steak is the best we ever had! Japanese (Wassabi)  Brazilian(Baha) are also very, very good!!!! The service is somewhat slow but you can Show them the money! and you'll be the king. There's also a cafe (starbucks style). The beach is absolutely beautiful, sandy with palm trees all over  water is clean and see-through.Resort is also very pretty, a bit old but very clean. What we did not like was the night shows (immature and not interesting at all), also the beds aren't too comfortable  so are the pillows. But the rooms are clean, bathrooms are nice! Check-in took awhile-1.5 hrs but the check-out was fast. Plenty of fun beach entertainment, nightclib and cousino are nice and fun! The spa and gym are just o.k. but not bad at all. If you wanna workout you'll be overlooking a beautiful sightseeing. We are very pleased and will deffinately consider the resort again!!!!
