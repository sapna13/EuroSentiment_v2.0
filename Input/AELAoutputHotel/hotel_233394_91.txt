{"text":"The Best Small Hotel in the World! We have just returned from a wonderful stay at this hotel. We loved it so much we extended our planned 2 nights to 5 nights. Here's what we loved:Fabulous, friendly, attentive service from Matteo and his staff.The hotel's unique position right on the Grand Canal - not set back several yards with a noisy terrace restaurant underneath as is the case with other Canal-side hotels. A previous reviewer wasn't impressed by the Grand Canal - I fail to see how although I accept everyone's taste is different. I loved watching Venice on its way to work in the morning - and on its way home of an evening when we'd get a wave from passing commuters as we raised a glass to them. it's a real living breathing city and if you want the sanitised version there's always The Venetian in Vegas!!The location generally - everything you want to see is a gentle few minutes stroll and in the case of St Mark's Square you will pass fabulous shops and gorgeous views round every corner so you will barely notice the walk. The Accademmia (art gallery) is a bit further - probably 20 minutes stroll which can be a bit much in the searing summer heat but take the vaporetto practically door to door.Breakfast on the beautiful terrace with freshly cooked pancakes  omelettes, and then evening cocktails on the terrace - the drinks tasted so much better here than anywhere else in Venice!Room 102 with its amazing view of the Canal, fabulously efficent air conditioning (necessary in the 90 degree July heat) and elegant furnishings. (We had to move to Room 105 for last 2 nights - no view but still a very nice big room (European standards) but air con not quite as glacial as I like!)Matteo's brilliant daily advice to ensure we saw the best of Venice - not just the usual tourist haunts - we also loved his restaurant recommendations particularly Trattoria Marco Polo.Here's a few things to be aware of:The few negative reviews on TripAdvisor pre-date Matteo's ownership.Probably only 4 of the 9 rooms have canal views - otherwise you will look onto a fairly dark courtyard or alley however you have the fabulous terrace at your disposal and how much time will you spend looking out of the window? Room 107 has its own charming little shady courtyard. Room 103 is a bit on the small side if you're a couple travelling with fair amount of luggage.It's worth forking out for the water taxi right to hotel's own launch - otherwise the vaporetto (numbers 1 or 82) lets you off the other side of Rialto bridge - only a few minutes away but it'll feel longer with luggage as you'll have a few sets of steps to negotiate plus the crowds of course and then you can easily miss the hotel's very unprepossessing street entrance from a rather dark alley.Everyone we met during our 5 night stay loved the hotel and I feel sure you will too.
