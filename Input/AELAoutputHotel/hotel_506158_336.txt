{"text":"1st Wedding anniversary at Hotel 1898 I have just spent a long weekend at Hotel 1898 in Barcelona with my wife to celebrate our first wedding anniversary and I have to say that that I couldn't have selected a better spot! The hotel is only rated as 4+ star according expedia, but is definitely better quality than some 5 star hotels I have stayed in. The facilities were next to none, with the pool and bar area on the roof especially enjoyable in the Catalonian sunshine. The decor throughout the hotel is a very tasteful colonial style with lots of dark wood. All of the fixtures and fittings are of a very high quality and our room had a large wall mounted flat screen tv. When I travel on business I don't usually order breakfast , as I always find it to be over-priced and\/or dissapointing. The breakfast at the 1898, however, was very good value for money (√à√\u2020√ü?8) and the food was both excellent and plentiful. The only (very minor) critisism that I would have, was that although the price of most drinks at the bar was average for this type of hotel, (e.g. a GT was about √à√\u2020√ü?, a beer about √à√\u2020√ü?), when I ordered two glasses of sangria at the pool bar the price came to a whopping √à√\u2020√ü?5, which I think is highly overpriced for cheap red wine with lemonade! However, this aside I cannot fault the hotel in any other way and of course I got plenty of brownie points from my wife for having picked such a great venue for our anniversary!
