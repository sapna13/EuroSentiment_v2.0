{"text":"A down-to-earth, objective review Here is a very down to earth, objective review of the resort. We just came back from Grand Palladium from our first family vacation. We (my husband and i ) were there with our 18 month old son. Prior to this trip, we have travelled extensively world wide from the best accomodations to the worst. So we have seen horrible and we have seen extreme luxury.We had a very wonderful experience at Grand Palladium. Check-in: was quick, staff was professional and bell-boys were prompt to take our baggage to our room. We requested ocean view when we booked our trip and we did receive it.Food: was overall great. There was always lots of selection, always to choose from and always fresh. Please remember i am travelling with a baby and he did not get sick once, although he ate just about everything he could eat. We went to Las Torres quite often (we found the buffet setting to be more baby friendly) where the food was quite diversified ( my husband is very picky with his food). For lunch we usually went to the beach restaurant Los Bohio. They always had fresh meat which they grilled right in front of you and also lots of veg dishes and other side dishes. Mare Nostrum and Les Arreciffe was also very good.The staff: ok here is a wake-up call for travellers. If you expect to go on vacation and get royal treatment 100%, then just stay home. Wherever you go in the world, you will meet very pleasant people and also very nasty people. We had amazing staff making our stay very comfortable and making the baby feel very comfortable. And there were also people who clearly hated their lives and we just took them for what they were. We didnt go there expecting everything on a silver platter. Please dont forget that the staff are also people with problems just like you and i, and just because they serve you, it doesn't mean their problems or lives are much easier.The beach: absolutely gorgeous. Paradise on earth. Clear turquoise waters, white sandy beach lined with an array of palm trees.The grounds: beautifully kept and daily attended to. The only problems with the grounds were other travellers who felt the garden was their own private garbage bin. The staff however, promptly tended to whatever mess the guests made.Amenities: I went for two massages at the Spa, which is a state of the art facility. I found the experience very relaxing and worthwhile. My husband took tennis lessons which he also enjoyed.Overall, we had a great time there. Please remember that you are paying money to be there. You better make the best out of it, and if you let little things ruin your vacation, that's your responsibility. And, if you're upset about people not speaking English, learn Spanish!!!!!!
