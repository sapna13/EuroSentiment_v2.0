{"text":"Perfect Location for Train Travel and Local Sightseeing Although this is a great hotel all around, its very best feature is its location. It's about a five minute walk from Amsterdam Centraal Station, which is very convenient for making day trips out of Amsterdam by train. Also, coming in by train from the airport, it was really easy to just walk to the hotel from the station even with our luggage. The walking directions on the hotel's website are very accurate. Additionally, it's located right among numerous shops and restaurants and about a block over from the tram lines.The hotel is currently under construction, but renovations are already complete on most rooms. We stayed in one of the renovated rooms and it was really nice to have all new amenities. The beds are very comfortable and come topped with about eight pillows. The shower was nice and hot and the bathroom was stocked with a nice selection of toiletries. There was a flat screen TV with a variety of features, including internet access for 10 euros per day. There were several standard European electrical outlets throughout the room.Breakfast was awesome, although not included in the room rate and pretty expensive at 25 euros. The buffet included tons of quality selections, including freshly made omelets.The staff was very friendly and helpful, and they are perfectly accommodating to English speakers. They even lent us an umbrella one morning when it was raining.This is a business-oriented hotel so its normal rates are pretty expensive and you're not likely to meet up with a lot of other casual tourists. We were lucky to find a really good package deal when we booked our airplane tickets. The price would be the only factor that might keep us from staying here again on a return trip. Otherwise, we loved everything about it. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":905,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":901}]}
