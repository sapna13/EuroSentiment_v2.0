{"text":"Don't leave your valuables around! We'd previously stayed at this hotel two years previously and had a great time, which is why we booked it again.However this time we were really let down by poor security staff and customer service, which ruined our visit and the next time I am lucky enough to be in Toronto I will not stay here again.My wife had her engagement ring and earrings stolen from our room, only a day after we got married. These we're only lefton her bedside table for a few hours before they were discovered missing. We searched the room throughly and reported it to the hotel. It was unfortunate that this happened the day we were leaving to fly to Vancouver for our honeymoon, so we had no time to report the matter to the police. The hotel said they would look into the matter for us and we understood that they would report the stolen items. We gave them our contact details in Vancouver so they could let us know what happenedwith their investigation.No phone call was made. After returning home to the UK we emailed the hotel asking about the police report etc. An email eventually got back to us saying they were looking into it and that no member of cleaning staff had owned up to stealing the items.Of course they wouldn't! We called the head of security and left a message, but it took him a long time to get back to us.We were eventually told that we needed to file a police report and that they couldn't do it. Why did they not tell us this at the time?They said they would give us their own report to pass on to our insurers. Almost two months down the line and we still have yet to receive this. My wife was very upset at the loss of these items as they were of signicant personal value but I we have come to the conclusion that the hotel could care less. ","annotations":[]}
