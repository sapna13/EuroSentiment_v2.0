{"text":"Not what you expect from a 5 star hotel The rooms were alright and as mentioned in prior reviews a bit simple but practical. What really bothered us were the worn out beds, if you like really firm beds this is not the place to stay. After having stayed in many top hotels and also cheaper hotels we must say we were disapointed. (back pain in the morning)The check in went really well and the staff was friendly although not really enthusiastic. The main issue was the concierge, if you can really call him so. He did not know any restaurants that were not around the hotel. After asking him about some good ones (like the Altman) he just said Yea, but we have some really good ones around the hotel, you do not need to go so far. The question was not really location but rather a nice restaurant were we could enjoy dinner. On other occasions when we called from the room he just told us to get down to the lobby so he could explain since it was easier than explaining on the phone. I am sorry but that is no 5 star service.On two occasions we asked for more coffee for the coffee mashine in the room and it took over 20 minutes and two calls to get them to our room. They even came twice after we called again.All in all it was alright but we expected more from a 5 star hotel. If you do not care so much about personal service and care about location this is definitely the place to stay.
