{"text":"A Proud Staff We were looking for a place to stay in the Miami area so that we could head up north the next day without hitting city traffic and this hotel filled the bill. The endorsement by Trip Advisor reviewers was also important. When we checked in, we were reminded immediately by the desk clerks about this hotel's #1 Miami rating on Trip Advisor. They were not being arrogant -- they seemed genuinely pleased and determined to satisfy the cutomer, something that other hotel staffs could do more of. As another reviewer has noted, it's hard to imagine that this hotel is anything like the best in the Miami area; however, we give them high marks for doing what they do very well. Our primary objective was to get a restful night's sleep and we achieved that in our room, which was large, comfortable (especially the bed) and very quiet (being near an airport and in a room with adjoining door on a low floor usually doesn't portend well, but we didn't hear any traffic, airplane or neighbor noise at all). Self-parking was available -- ample, free and safe. No view, no robes, no luxury, but we didn't expect any of that. We didn't find the breakfast as great as others have, but, once again, the effort was obvious. The only real negative we have to report was the recommendation by the desk clerk that we eat at Casa Juancho, which was a dismal experience. The hotel was not bargain-priced, but considering Trip advisor reviews of hotels in this price range elsewhere in Miami, this did seem to be a very good choice. ","annotations":[]}
