{"text":"Great For Kids, We'd Go Back We were at Club Med Punta Cana January 5-15 of 2008 with two kids (ages 6 and 7)and my parents and had read reviews on trip Advisor before going. We expected the French language which was no problem. We had a great time. We were so impressed we would try Club Med again. We are not big fans of cruises but this was an all-inclusive vacation that was nice for our family.The Kid's Club GO were unflagging in their energy and effort around the kids and generally took great care of them. There were plenty of different things for the 6-7 year-olds to choose from. While we were checking our kids in, the GO told kids to put on sunscreen. One kid said he had--the GO actually rubbed his finger on the kid's face to check and told him to go back and put it on. When kids were looking upset or nervous about doing something new--whether just joining in or trying a trapeze, the GOs literally got down on their level and humored them.Our kids really enjoyed the shows--other reviews say they are excruciating, and while I would agree, I will say that Club Med has nailed what kids like, in a universal language. The jokes tend to be more risque than in American culture but no violence. I think that's a reflection of cultural differences. My husband did 3 dive trips. In general, they were good, the dive master was not as warm and service-oriented as one might expect and they had some issues with one of the 3 dives, but basically it was fine. I did the snorkeling because I got certified years ago and can't remember all the dive stuff. The snorkel trip was a a bit steep but it was fine snorkeling. The snorkeling off the beach was enjoyable but not super spectacular. We did see fish and some coral. I went with my daughter quite a bit (7 years old) and it was fine for that purpose. But the sights are nothing you would consider super fabulous.In fact, in general, I would say the excursions are pricey--instead of taking the Club Med shopping trip, we latched on to a group that was taking a cab to the shopping area. I also did a massage which was priced more like an American massage, but lovely under a palapa (thatched hut) on the beach.We all enjoyed the food, but my mom got sick 2 days before we left. We heard that each week 6-7 people get sick. We had raw fish, french pastries, Dominican fare as well as burgers and fries. Great breads and cheeses. We were all very impressed by the food.There were some other nice little touches that aren't mentioned anywhere-one day, someone walked around with a monkey for people to see, another day they were handing out fruit at the pool. You don't hear or read about this anywhere, it just happens.
