{"text":"absolutely hated this place... This is a really grotty place to stay; we decided on it because its website positions the hotel as a boutique hotel, which we understand to mean small, intimate, with a degree of luxury. Instead, its basically a former hostel that has been turned into a hotel. The first indication of this is that you have to PAY for lockers to store your bags if you arrive before check in; I have never heard of such a thing in all the many places I have travelled before. and those lockers are not cheap either! We paid $185 for a room which we thought was a good price point for a boutique; in return for that we got a tiny box of a room that was completely barren of comfort. dingy paint work, a rattly old window that allowed all of the noise of george street to penetrate. there is no bedside lamp so you have to turn the light off at the door and then stumble in the dark to your bed (bring a torch!). the bathroom was also tiny, with scratchy towels and no toiletries other than a piece of soap. there was one glass shelf next to the tiny sink, but it was on an angle so anything you put on it rolled off and fell on the tiled floor. seriously ick!! bad lighting, a TV that did not work, and no desk finished the furnishings. the lifts are extremely slow so that usually the stairs are the best option. we immediately tried to find another place to stay but Sydney seemed to be completely booked out for this saturday night so we were stuck. i used earplugs to keep the noise out, but woke up at 5.30am with a headache from the roar. we ended up checking out at 7am and heading home to Melbourne early because a nice-lie in was clearly not on the cards. I can not believe that it is possible to charge $185 a night for such appalling accommodation!!! I would not recommend this to anyone; if you are on a budget then go stay at the YHA where you can get your own room for a 1\/3 of that price; if you are actually looking for a decent hotel, look elsewhere.
