{"text":"Good clean business hotel I stayed here late 2007 for a couple of nights in Sydney on business. I was weary about a) being dumped into a hotel in Chinatown near the Uni of Technology and b) staying at a hotel formerly known as the Carlton Crest ...When a hotel uses the 'formerly known' angle - things must be bad.They weren't.I was pleasantly suprised by the Citigate and would happily stay there again - as a business traveller. Nestled in the heart of Chinatown - Broadway and Ultimo are a stonesthrow - and it is a short walk into town. There is no 'budget' or 'uni student' feel to the establishment. The best thing about the Citigate is that you walk out the door and have wonderful restaurants (i.e. Chinatown) at your doorstep.The foyer seems quite grand - though figuring out how to get to the lifts or carpark entrance is quite a struggle. The lifts are probably the worst part of the hotel and I am sure there are two child labourers under the shatfs raising and lowering the lifts with a systems of ropes and pullies. Apart from that it was great. Business services were adequate (car park a bit far from Hotel - but included in price), the rooms had gorgeous views of Sydney and I mentioned the proximity to great Asian restaurants. For international travellers - Central Station is just down the road. I would visit again - though (as I have said) probably only on business. ","annotations":[]}
