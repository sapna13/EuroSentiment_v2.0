{"text":"A disappointment My partner  I have just returned from an 18 day holiday in beautiful Bali. Unfortunately we chose to stay at this hotel.It is not a family hotel, but caters mostly for corporate guests. Our accommodation was in a newly renovated deluxe room with private courtyard. Not sure where the private courtyard comes in , anyone on the upper floors were able to look over the balcony!! and not sure either where the newly renovated room comes from. The semi outdoor bathroom with Bali bathtub had a pull out shower from the bath  had to be hand held whilst showering or else stand on it while washing and then rinse off. The 3 restaurants were deserted almost every evening no atmosphere whatsoever. The hotel could do with employing a good maintenance manager. The hotel is located too far away from the shops and restaurants so taxis were a necessity every evening. The buffet breakfast became rather boring in the end . The food was usually cold. The shuttle bus to the beach was fine but the towels provided for the patrons were not always clean. I did complain to the assistant manager but noticed days afterwards patrons still returning their unsatisfactory towels to the beach boy. The hotel pool well ok but no hand rail was provided for entry or exit of the pool just as I call them big bali steps One particular evening on exiting one of the lifts (the other was out of order all the time we were there) about 15 non european business persons were eating in the lobby what appeared to be take-aways. When we returned approx 3 hours later their take-away litter was still in situ. We could see it was once a majestic hotel but now very very tired. We had a great holiday but would not be staying here again. ","annotations":[]}
