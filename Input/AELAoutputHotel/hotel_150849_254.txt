{"text":"Three major complaints We just got back from Punta Cana last nite. I'm glad we went inspite of what I'm about to say. Before I booked our trip I actually went to this site to read the reviews. Everybody was right. My three major complaints were (1) The beds were horrible. Two twin beds pushed together to make a king  you could feel every spring in the matress. A couple we met from the Palace next door said their beds were just as bad, so don't pay more thinking you'll get better. (2) The rooms smelled musty  moldy so bad, the smell didn't go away even with the a\/c on. When we got home, I had to wash everything in my luggage twice just to get the terrible smell out. It can't be a healthy enviroment for your lungs.  (3) The drinks were terrible. I never had a pina coloda poured over ice before. And if you did ask for it frozen, they diluted it so much it wasn't worth drinking, so we just gave up. We spent the rest of our trip drinking rum  Pepsi, how bad can someone mess that up? Other than those three things, the beach was fantastic, the setting of the resort was beautiful and the weather was perfect. If you only speak English, fat chance of understanding much. Most of the staff only speaks spanish. The food wasn't bad. Desserts were better than most countries we've been to. Overall? I don't think this resort should be rated as high as it is. They need to work on the accomodations a bit more. Hope this is helpful to at least one person out there.
