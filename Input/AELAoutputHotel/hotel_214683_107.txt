{"text":"Tired and Rough around the edges I am a business traveler and stay at Marriott properties 150+ nights a year, and am very loyal to the chain. Thus, I generally know what to expect when I arrive at a hotel. I value consistency across properties and a standardized level of service and amenities, and I find Marriott generally does this better than other chains.I was disappointed by this property. While it is located right across the street from the beach, and the view from most of the rooms is beautiful, other aspects of the property left me disappointed.This is an older hotel (probably 30 years old), not built originally as a Marriott, and it gets heavy foreign tourist traffic...all ingredients for disaster even before you set foot on the property. I realize that this is not the typical airport business Marriott, and a resort is different, but it still failed in many respects where Marriott should know how to do better.The room (2269) had the terrific new Marriott Revive bed, but the rest of the room was tired and in need of refurbishment. The carpet, furniture and wallcovering were worn out and shabby. The bathroom smelled badly of mold in the shower, and I tried in vain to find the source of the terrible smell. Bath towels were cheap and small, and they did not stock adequate numbers in the room for a resort hotel where you may shower a couple times a day coming and going from your activities. Even just better linens would have classed the room up a great deal. No robe. Tolietries were average. Standard glaring fluorescent lights in all the lamps which always make it too bright in one part of the room and pitch black in another part. The room did have a great lanai which was fun to sit on for the sunsets.My room rate, booked on [--], was $191\/night, which is fairly reasonable these days now that hotel prices are so high. They accidentally put another guest's bill under my door, and he was paying $269.Elevators were undergoing renovation, meaning a 5-10 minute wait most times, sometimes waiting for two or three elevator cars because you were standing in the lobby with 20 other people also waiting.I ate two times at the poolside restaurant on the third floor overlooking the beach. Each time I found the food of crappy theme park snackbar quality, the service nonchalant and slow, and the prices high. I was really taken by the big bowl on every table of individual packets of every imaginable condiment....is this how you serve ketchup and mustard in a place with any class at all? Ick. My simple lunch with two fruity Hawaii cocktails ran over $40. Dinner one evening in the Steakhouse, also on the third floor, was delicious (the steaks really are as great as they claim) and the service was really attentive, but I was befuddled by the restaurant's decor which was an odd cross between Denny's and a Chinese Restaurant and had a bunch of vinyl seats and fake plants.. I also found it funny how they advertise a beach view for the restaurant, and the picture window is about the same size as the one on the front of my house back home. Unless you get one of three or four tables by the window, forget about seeing the beach.I agree with another poster that the pools were really small for a property of this size. The one nearest the beach gets the most traffic and it's teeny-tiny and chock full of kids and middle-aged fat men in Speedos. The back pool always looked empty to me and much quieter.There are lots of shops on-site and nearby, and the hotel really is in the heart of everything, which is a huge plus. All the fun stuff in Waikiki is within a 1-15 minute walk.Valet parking (at $25\/day) was fast, efficient and professional. My car was always waiting when I called down before leaving the room. Self parking was $15\/day.Every staff member I encountered was friendly and helpful.Overall, if I had to stay at a Marriott, and I was really loyal, I would stay here again. If I was open to other properties, I would definitely consider something more fresh and a little more refined elsewhere in Waikiki. I'll be back again if they renovate!
