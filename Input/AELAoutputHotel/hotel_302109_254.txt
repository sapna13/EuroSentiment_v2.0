{"text":"Bring your wallet I was very keen to stay here after seeing it ranked #1 and with such good reviews. It does live up to expectations, but when viewed in comparison with other 5 star Asian hotels, it is not that extraordinary. I stayed in a tower deluxe room which is huge and has a fantastic bathroom. Lives up to the pictures on their web site. The views from here are great too. The web page gives you a good insight into what it looks like so no need to go into detail. It is simply a stunning looking hotel - on the inside that is. Outside is a bit plane and 70's.The location is a chic part of town. Very leafy and surrounded by low key expensive accommodation. Seems to be mainly Ex-pats. It is isolated though as you can see on the map. About 10 minutes walk to orchard RD. If you want to be in the thick of it, stay at the Grand Hyatt. But with cabs so cheap, it's not a concern at all.The breakfast in The Line restaurant is a 9\/10. The only places better were Grand Hyatt Singapore and Sheraton Bangkok in my experience. The decor is very nice with a huge selection of food. Only thing is, it is S$43 per person. The most expensive breakfast I have had in a hotel. Not good for family holiday makers (not that you see many families here). For the corporate traveller, who cares about the price? I think they are taking advantage of the fact that there is no other option in the immediate area.While on cost, the mini-bar is just highway robbery. A local Tiger beer is S$12, a Kit Kat S$7, small Evian S$8 and a coke about S$8. There is no 7\/eleven nearby to restock either. Internet was S$10.50 per 15 minutes. I was travelling on business but I still hate being ripped off like that. The pool is large and well maintained. Inadequate poolside seating though given the number of guests so don't count on one. The gym is fully equipped and professional standard. Service by all staff is impeccable. typical Asian service.You can't go wrong here unless you are footing the bill. The charges really do add up, especially when the service fee and GST are added. But it loses full marks from me because of the sheer gratuitous grafting going on.
