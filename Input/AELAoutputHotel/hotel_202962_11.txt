{"text":"Comfortable but lacks atmosphere I chose to attend a conference in Florence at the last minute and this was one of the listed hotels. The lobby and indivual room furnishings are certainly worthy of 4 stars. The hotel itself is located on the edge of the historical city - in fact my 4th floor room has a very close view of one of the watchtowers. The staff were without exception courteous and helpful. Room service seems to be linked to the good but rather pricey hotel restaurant, ending at 10pm, which may be a pain if you arrive late and paying 5 euros for a bag of minibar peanuts doesn't appeal. A small supermarket two small blocks north and to the right stopped me having to pay minibar prices for bottled water in the stifling August heat.I was slightly disappointed by the breakfast as reviews on here had led me to expect great things. It was ok but the coffee was foul, the bread was old and things like cappuccino were extra. I also found myself getting up earlier and earlier to avoid tour parties descending en masse and taking all the good stuff like a plague of locusts. The free shuttlebus to the airport was a bonus and the hotel is an easy walk (10 minutes at a slow pace) from the central railway station. All in all, this is a good hotel if you are on business or conference, and a comfortable base if you are a tourist. However it adds little to an authentic experience of Italy.
