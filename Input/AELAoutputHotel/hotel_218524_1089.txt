{"text":"Little Bit of Heaven My husband and I stayed at Excellence May 23-30, 2007. We were celebrating our 10 year anniversary. We loved our time there. Highlights of why we loved it:The food...the variety and quality were amazing! Chez Isabelle is an elegant experience...Chateaubriand was wonderful. Toscana was good for any meal! Skip Agave, especially if you are from Texas and used to authentic! The Grill was good but it is an outside atmosphere so be ready for warmer temps and some flies. The resort staff keeps you in food and beverages at all times...the beach service is great and they offer pizzas, hamburgers, etc. around the lunch hour. The Coco Loco was my personal favorite!The activities...the beaches are gorgeous...so well kept and clean! It is so fun to play in the waves!! We took long walks on the beach and it was breathtaking! The grounds are beautiful as well. The employees work so hard to keep the gardens beautiful! The garden tour is fun and interesting and the bike tour gives you a good glimpse of life outside of Excellence...the real life of Dominicans. They are hardworking and wonderfully resiliant people! Because of the waves it is not a good place for snorkeling but the resort will arrange tours. We loved the pool too but didn't spend as much time in there because the ocean was too inviting! The pool is shallow throughout too so for us tall people it was difficult to get a good swim in. Definitely take the horseback ride that is part of most packages. Lots of fun! We also took a tennis lesson and were amazed by what we learned as they have a former pro player giving lessons...He is great! The shows were ok in our opinion...probably more for the guys who love thongs than for gals who enjoy quality entertainment.The rooms were nice and well stocked with whatever we needed whenever we needed it. We had a first floor garden jr. suite and it fit us perfectly. The beds are a bit firm but King size and spacious! We had access to almost every thing that those who were in excellence club did except the free internet but if you go to the internet cafe on site you can get 20 minute access for $5 which was great for us...also we rented a cell phone there a couple of times because we couldn't get a signal with cingular. The cell phone is $5 for 24 hours and then you can buy a 21 minute phone card for $10....the cheapest way we found to go. Other guests we talked to who had verizon could get a signal but paid 1.99 per minute. Watch out for the parrots...they like shiny things ...one almost ate my earring as he was perched on my arm. Thankfully my husband pryed it out of his mouth!There is much to write about but truly it was a great trip to rest and relax...we never had to wait for a place to sit at the beach or the pool. We were treated so well in all aspects!Outside of the hotel we went on two excursions...both were a lot of fun...Saona island was a great adventure...but be warned there is not snorkeling on that trip as we had originally been told. It does take the whole day too so play for a long and sunfilled day...we got burned....(bring a big bottle of heavy sunscreen and aloe as the salt water washed it away quickly.) Also take caution about lunch- they fed us a traditional meal out at the island and my husband got food poisoning. We also did the four wheeler tour and it was so much fun!! We had brought some pencils\/paper from the states to give to the kids and so we asked the rep. if we could stop at a school and they allowed us to do that...it was so neat to see the kids in their two room school and the joy on their faces!Make sure to bring lots of bug spray as it is the rainy season and after it rains there are a lot of little black biting bugs around......Use bug spray whenever you go out at night. I would also recommend bring a benadryl itch stick along so when you do get bit you can help the itch.In conclusion the trip was marvelous....Excellence runs a first class resort in our opinion and the staff is so happy and helpful that you feel so welcomed and pampered!! When my husband was sick we called for sprite and they brought gatorade and extras for the minibar. Our concierge Carolina also called back later in the day to check on his health. We were so thankful for our time there and would go back again!!
