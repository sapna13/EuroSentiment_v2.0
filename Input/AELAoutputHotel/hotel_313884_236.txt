{"text":"rock out at the princess! My boyfriend and I stayed 10 days at the PCP 5\/4\/2007-5\/13\/2007 and we loved every single day. The resort itself was very well polished and much, much prettier than in the photos!Next door to the resort is it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sister property, where children are allowed. And you are welcome to make reservations for dinner at their restaurants, and use their facilities as well. I never saw a child at our resort; they are very good about being strict on that policy.Behind the resort there is a huge stretch of marshland where you can see practically every type of bird the Caribbean has to offer!We did tip our bartenders and maids, which I think accounted for our drinks being just about as strong as you can make them! But it seemed that everyone was getting great service all around. Neither my boyfriend or I speak Spanish, but most people at the resort did perfectly, some more than others. Aside from a few awkward moments, we had virtually no language barriers.For the downsides to the resort, well there were very few. It is important to make reservations at the specialty restaurants for dinner. They are very quirky about this policy. You can make 3 reservations at a time, but you can go to each one as many times as you like. If you, hypothetically, get way too drunk at the swim up bar and miss your reservation, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ ok, because the large buffet always has something great cooking. HUGE plates of pasta where you can add in your own mix-ins, a grill cooking up different fish, and meats, and chicken, sometimes they had a Caesar salad station, and that was phenomenal!. During the day they have a huge buffet as well, but also a beach buffet where you are allowed to enter in your bathing suit. They make the best fried chicken of all time!The breakfast buffet is open from 7-10 and they have a huge juice bar with 10 different types of fresh juices and juice blends that they make right there in a blender. So good!The beach was great, like a caribean post card! You could swim out or snorkel a little ways, but you couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go too deep because there is a lot of boat traffic right off shore. People doing motorized sports, and taking speedboats out to snorkel and such like that.They have snorkeling everyday at the beach at 11am and 3pm, its 20$ and they take you on a 15min speed boat ride, out to a section of coral, and let you swim around for about an hour and then they zip you right back to the hotel. It was really nice and we saw a lot of fish.We never made it out to the disco, but we could hear the one next door at the LTI and it sounded like an extreme amount of fun.So all in all our room was always clean, our drinks always strong, and the beach always an endless, soft, white strip of inviting fun. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend the PCP to anyone!
