{"text":"Doesn't Deserve a 4 star rating AT ALL While the property is in a good neighborhood, and has excellent neighbors (Le Meridian is across the street) this is the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Period. Strictly speaking of San Francisco, I have stayed there many times in the last 10 years, and usually keep to hotels I know will provide good service, value, and a resonable room size. Upon checkin, I went to my room (there was no one to assist with luggage at the time) and when I opened it, it was literally the size of a broom closet. The bathroom door had to be completely shut in order to enter and exit the room, and the bed was up against the side wall next to the window. There was a small desk with a chair, but when sitting in it, the chair knocked against the end of the bed. I contacted the front desk and asked for a different room and was told that the hotel had been completely booked...this was the only room available.Normally I'm not a claustrophobic person, but this room was so small that I felt that I had to leave immediately and walk around. I spent most of my time across the street in the Le Meridian and down the Embarcadero at the Hyatt (both of which I've stayed numerous times) in their lobbies conducting business and working on my laptop as the room itself was only suitable for sleeping in and showering.I've since seen other Club Quarters in other cities and have intentionally not stayed with them for fear of a similar disaster. There is no way that this hotel deserves anything more than a 2-star rating, especially in a city like San Francisco that has so many exlemplary places to stay that are in the same price range.Do yourself a favor and stay away from this hotel. It truly is the proverbial wolf in sheep's clothing. If you need to stay in the Financial District, go to the Omni, the Embarcadero Hyatt or Mandarin Oriental and you're bound to have a much better time.
