{"text":"Lived up to the hype! Just got back from the Bahia Principe. We were there for 1 week. We picked it from all the positive reviews from Trip Advisor. We had booked the Diamond Club through Sunquest, and to our delight were upgraded to a Golden Club room. I'm not sure what the difference is between the rooms, but the DC villas are 3 floors and the GC are 2. The GC are also closer to the beach.The resort is big, There are trams that run constantly. We never usedthem. It's only a 5-8 minute walk from the beach to the main lobby. And it's a beautiful walk.The room was amazing. Always clean. Big. Has a patio or balcony. There was no iron in our room, but you could get one at the front desk. There was an umbrella for those rainy days.The weather was great. The Weather Network said rain all week. It wascloudy here and there. No rain. The restaurants were ok. I was not impressed with the Mikado or the Mediteranean a la Cartes. Would not recommend them. The French and the Italian were very good though. The duck was amazing. The service as well.The main buffet had a huge selection. Something for everyone. Strictvegans may have some problems though. The quality was very good considering it's a buffet. The other buffets around the resort were very good as well. The pools are on the cooler side, but warm once you get in an move around. The beach is beautiful. I can't say enough good things about it. Unbelievable. We did get up early to get our beach chairs. I'd say for the pools, if you want one in the shade - get up early. Before 8am. Out of the shade by 9am. There aren't alot of chairs around the pools.At the beach, if you want a chair in the shade, get one by 7:30 or so. There are always non shade chairs around - just have to search for them.In the Pueble Principe there are shops and vendors with carts. Watch out for the guys with carts, very aggresive salesmen. They have alot of nice stuff though. Be prepared to haggle.Learn some spanish if you have time. Even if it's just how to order a drink, and please and thanks. They really appreciate it. The majority know very little english.I would suggest tipping as much as you can afford. Apparently they only get paid $50US per month. The Dominicans work so hard. They were weeding the gardens at 9pm. Cleaning the beach at night. Constantly sweeping, mopping, spraying, painting. Hard workers, and they all seem to love their jobs.We tipped our maid, turndown maid, mini bar guy, buffet servers everyday. The gardeners love when you tip them. I think they deserve the most (the maid too). We left our maid gifts and she left us notes.It was a great experience. I would definetely go back. The Dominicansare so friendly. Such a change from North America.Bring lots of sunscreen, aloe vera and dollar bills for tipping.
