{"text":"Pleasant surprize for the price! We needed a hotel fairly close to The Glendale arena to attend a concert. But, we also wanted to be able to enjoy a resort type setting with a great pool and nice rrom at a very affordable rate. We got just what we asked for. I used the hotel website and got a $65 summer rate with 2 double beds. We were upgraded upon arrival (ask and you shall receieve) to a ground floor room with a walk out to the pool view. It was very convenient and what a view. The room was very nice and seemed to be updated nicely. The bathroom was exceptionally large with a large sink area seperate from a vanity area and an interesting but nice shower\/tub combo. Lots of water pressure and heat from the bath. There was a pocket door in the toilet shower area and a swivel type shuuter style door that closed off the bath from the bedroom area if you wanted too. I liked that since I had an 8 year old son with me. As a Starwood Preferred Guest, along with my email confirmation, I was sent a B1,G1,Free breakfast buffet coupon which was really nice and above average. Lots of fresh food to choose from.Can't say enough about the pool. Maybe I just needed the break, but it was large, clean and sparsely occupied. There were lots of pool toys, floats, noodles and the like provided by Four Points.Lastly, staff was very friendly and accomodating. We were able to recieve a later check out so that we could enjoy the pool just a bit longer. We would go back again.
