{"text":"Excellent Location and sevice I stayed at the Shangrila Kowloon with my parents and partner at the end of April 2006. The hotel has fantastic views of the Hong Kong Harbour from its Harbour view rooms and I have to say it is a lasting memory of my whole far east trip; just lying in bed or lazing in an easy chair watching the liners and junks go past on the sea was superb.We had only been in the room for 10 mins when the door knocked and in came the Manager and his photographer with a cake for my mother and a Shangrila spa polo shirt for my dad ;as I had booked the trip for their birthdays. Since we were really tired after our long flight from Heathrow I wont publise the photos as they arent to pretty but they did send them to me as promised when we got home free of charge.I thought that was an excellent touch.The chinese restaurant in the hotel is rated one of the best in Hong Kong and is frequented by many well to do locals so you dont have to go far to have an excellent meal. The itallian in the hotel is also excellent and has wonderful harbour views.I loved everthing about this hotel the only thing I was disappointed with was that it didnt have an outdoor pool; if that doesn;t bother you and you are happy with an indoor pool then this hotel will not fail to impress you.One thing you need to be aware of which is nothing to do with the hotel was that on the promanade outside the hotel ther were a number of asian men trying to tell you your fourtune.When one has got you talking the other one bumps pass you and steals you wallets so be aware, As I said this has nothing to do with the hotel whatsoever its just some Hong Kong advise.
