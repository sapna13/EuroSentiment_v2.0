{"text":"Okay Hotel but Great Location I stayed here with my husband late December for 3 nights. I would agree that this is definitely not a 5 star hotel.I was disappointed that we did not get a canal view room, but thought the room size was okay. The hotel does seem a little dated, but I thought it was clean and the amenities were fine (but the Internet was quite overpriced). The room was however, very dark and dim in general. The bathroom marble floors were heated, which was a nice touch. I did not think the service was up to par. The concierge was helpful, but not great. We wanted a walking tour, and they offered us their own which was over 160 euros for 2 people. I had learned about another organization called Mee in Mokum, which is staffed by local retirees and they supposedly do great walking tours for 4 euros per person. When I asked the concierge about this, they simply said, well if you want to do that they usually meet at the amsterdam historical museum at 11am, so you would need to go there. So when we went there, we were told that Mee in Mokum did not give tours at that time of the year. It was annoying and I thought the concierge should have helped us confirm before we scrambled to run out there. I did feel they tended to be fairly dismissive if we wanted to seek out tour options that were not created by the hotel.The location was great and very central to most touristy spots around town.
