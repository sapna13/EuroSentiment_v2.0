{"text":"Excellent service but beware of 1st floor The website through which I booked the hotel could only give me standard room so I had to try my luck when I arrived to see if there was a superior room. On the first stay (I had to check out the next day for meetings outside of Paris, and then checked in again 2 days later) I got a superior room. Everything was ok but I cannot say the room was new. As a matter of fact I do think the room itself needs renovation. Before I checked out, I asked to keep a superior room for my return. I was told they would try, if no superior room they would give me a junior suite at the same price. I gladly said thank you thinking about the photo I saw from the candid travelers' photos...only to be disappointed later.When I returned (late in the evening), the only room available was junior suite on the first floor...I went in gladly, only to find out it's a standard room (with no TV), attached with a small room that looked nowhere like the candid traveler's photo of junior suite, that had no door in between, that had a make-shift kind of sofa bed with the TV and the bathroom. Wait...the most terrible thing I found was...there was no aircon but a big monster cooling machine about the size of a mid-sized fridge, which ridiculously split hot air out from the back of the machine back to inside the room!!! I could not open the window as it's on first floor hence too noisy. Apparently they told me all the rooms on 1st floor were all equipped with such monster only. I asked to change to a standard room but they said they did not have other room anymore. So they left a note for the front desk to arrange another room the next day if available.I was so upset...fortunately when I returned the next evening they gave me the magic room X07!!! That solved all the problems.I must say all the staff had very good attitude. The only problem I had was when I asked for a 10% hotel discount card for Lafayett the staff that had all the cards had disappeared for a coffee!!!. After waiting and the hotel paging without any sight of him, I had to leave for the shopping without that card (so I could not get discount on skincare items which were not on sale at that time)...The excellent location made up for the unpleasant experience. However, I will probably not stay here again. For that price I would try somewhere else next time.
