{"text":"Pleasantly surpised Very nice 4 star hotel with your typical sized hotel room, rooms are nothing special but sufficient. The grounds, pools, and beach are very well kept. Beach chairs and pool chairs were overly abundant but it was November and the hotel was maybe 75% full. Some reviews talked down the beach, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect crystal blue water with white sand, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ more of a fine brown sand but kept very clean by the staff. You will find √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Ütuff√à√\u2020\u2022?in the water but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ typical seaweed, no signs of jellyfish or other offensive items in the water and I did spend a lot of time body surfing.I definitely recommend a rental car, the money spent on the car will be easily made up in food and excursion savings. Save the $70\/person rain forest bus trip and drive yourself. Stop at the El Yunque welcome center for $3\/person and get the maps to all the rain forest attractions there. We did the trail to the waterfall with a 7 and 4 year old, took about 30 minutes to get there. We beat the bus trip people by 20 minutes to the water fall and had the area to ourselves with about 5 other people. Once they showed up it got very crowded. If you hike to the water fall take a bathing suit, a towel to dry off, and water. You will not find anything to drink on the way, you must take everything. Rocks are very slippery and I would recommend sandals in the water but you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to have to hike back with wet sandals. I recommend sneakers for the hike and not a cheap sandal.The Fort San Felipe del Morro in old San Juan was worth the trip, kids thought it was a castle and found it interesting, again save the bus trip and drive there, entry fee was $6\/person.IF YOU HAVE A GPS WITH US MAPS, MOST LIKELY PEURTO RICO WILL BE IN THERE !!! We took our Garmin Nuvi 200 and it had everything in it, Rain Forest, del Morro, etc.Food √à√\u2020\u2022?we typically don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat dinner at hotels because the food is blah and overpriced. We ate out every night with the kids at local restaurants and saved a lot of money. Richie√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ at the top of the hill near the entrance to Rio Mar was good but didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a kids menu, they kids ended up splitting a $30 rib plate. Dinners were good and the view was nice.Puerto Rican restaurant where 968 meets route 3 had good food but was very slow, waited about 1 hour for food after we ordered, they operate on local time.Kiosk #2 √à√\u2020\u2022?if you take route 3 east towards Luquillo about 2 miles east on the left hand side of the route 3 you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l see what looks like a long row of shacks and bars. Each one has a number and on a recommendation we ate at kiosk #2, had two fish dishes that were very good with too much food that we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ finish our plates. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be scared by some of the shacks, some look very rough and shady, just drive by and park in front of the one you want. We found #2 to be clean, friendly and noticed about 4 other families from Rio Mar there.If you like Mexican you must try Lolita√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, it was so good we went back a second time. Food is authentic Mexican and cheap. For example tacos are $1.75 and the 2 burrito plate was $8. Maps and GPS didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have the location correct, if you head east on route 3, you must go about 2 miles past downtown Luquillo, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ in a little strip mall next to Condom World.Parking, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ waste your time with valet parking, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ $30\/day and it takes forever to get your car. Do the self park for $15\/day. The rooms have the mini bar fridge left in the room but empty. Ours worked so we stocked up at the super market on route 3 and it kept everything cold.Sign up for Wyndham Rewards online before you go. You get free in room internet and a few other perks but make sure they take off the 14.95 daily internet charge when you check out. They try to slip it in to see if you aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ paying attention.
