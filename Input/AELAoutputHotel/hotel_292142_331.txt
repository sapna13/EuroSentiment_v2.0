{"text":"Major screw-up resulted in much disappointment When we arrived at the Affinia Dumont, we found out that the room we reserved was not available. For my husband's birthday, I had made a non-refundable reservation via phone almost 2 months in advance of our trip for a 1BR suite w\/2 queens. We had a15YO, 5YO, and toddler w\/us. The man I spoke with via phone was very helpful, but the manager said he should not have told us that we could get 2 queens. The manager said they over-booked the rooms and we would have to get a king-sz bed with a pull-out sofa. This was a big problem - our toddler needs to sleep separately from people or he will be a terror. And he was, as a result of their screw-up. They tried to make up for it - better rate, free breakfast, the correct room on the following night that we wouldn't have to move our luggage to. It was not enough when the result was being kept up most of the night by a toddler  then our teen says she had the worst night sleep ever because of the uncomfortable sofa. We had to pack up our stuff - 45 mins of a waste of time (lots of stuff w\/3 kids) - then they neglected to move our items to the new room. We learned that this over-booking situation happened to at least 1 other party. The 3 grown women (sisters) ended up sleeping in the same king-sz bed. There were other minor things. The new room was better, but we already had a sour taste in our mouth. Our massages were mediocre. On the plus side - the rooms were clean  relatively spacious, the beds\/bedding were comfy, the amenities were nice, the bellmen were personable, and location decent. ","annotations":[]}
