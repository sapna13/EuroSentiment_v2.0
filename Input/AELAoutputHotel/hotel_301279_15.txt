{"text":"good My husband and I traveled to Tokyo just after Christmas together with some friends of ours. We chose this hotel because the rate was very reasonable (under USD200\/night√à√\u2020\u2022?we booked the room through the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ website a month before our trip).The hotel is located right next (3 minute walk from hotel room) to Akasaka Mitsuke metro station and a 10 minute walk to a JR station. This meant we were only 3 or 4 stations away from Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ginza and Akihabara. The best part about this hotel is it was built in the 1960√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ so you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to worry about getting lost because everyone knows where it isIf you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e a United Airlines Mileage Plus 1K member you can get a free room upgrade. The guy who checked us in ignored this offer but after much √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Ærangling√à√\u2020\u2022?he gave us an upgrade to a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeluxe√à√\u2020\u2022?tower room for 4 out of 5 nights. I must admit he was pretty rude about it and made us feel like we were begging for the upgrade. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeluxe√à√\u2020\u2022?room is double the size of a regular standard room, complete with a large living room area. Our room was clean, with a huge bathroom. The room reminded me of the 1970√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ because of the dark color scheme they used on the sofas and carpet. You could tell the hotel has been around for years (fair wear  tear) but everything was clean and they gave us an ample supply of Kanebo shampoo, conditioner and shower gel.I tried the in-room massage (JPY6300 for 50 minutes) and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like it but maybe I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not used to Japanese massages.We had dinner at Nadaman on our last night and had a very pleasant kaiseki dinner. The service was very good but I still don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand why they prefer to serve the men first in Japan!We took the airport limousine bus to the airport (the first departure of the day at 6:20am) which took us directly to Narita airport.Most people at the hotel spoke English (some spoke very good English) but we had to speak to a few people to get a reasonable answer if we had a complicated question.I recommend this hotel.
