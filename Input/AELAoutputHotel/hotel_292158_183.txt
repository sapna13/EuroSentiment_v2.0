{"text":"Great Dominican Vacation We just returned from a weeks vacation to the D.R and again we were not disappointed. Our trip started with a great flight from Quebec,Canada with sunwing airlines. The flight was great and the service #1. Our first impression of the resort was great despite the little confussion with the rooms. But this was settled quickly and we settled in to our new rooms overlooking the beautiful landscaped property. The resort was huge but we soon got orientated and discovered the train that runs all through the resort. The food was fabulous and the service great. The restaurants were wonderful and the nice thing was that you didn't need any reservations. The daily buffet was full of selection. The rooms were average but clean and the beds were comfortable. The pools were really nice and Bavaro beach was beautiful. The beach was a bit crowded at times but the tides were unusually high so space was limited. Lots of chairs and sun huts all along the beach. The bars were well stocked and water was always available and needed because the weather was sunny and hot. Only one morning of rain. Night life was quiet but the lobby bars had nightly music and the casino was open very late. The nightly show was entertaining and the theatre was a really nice building. The staff at the resort were very friendly and although the language thing was at times difficult, they did try very hard to understand us. I would love to return again to this resort and would recommend it to any one of my friends and family. A super great trip once again in the D.R!!!
