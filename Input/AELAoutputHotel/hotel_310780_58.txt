{"text":"A Wonderful Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Europa for four nights in mid-May 2008. It is a wonderful hotel two blocks from the Duomo with a lobby, breakfast and guest rooms on the first (not ground) floor and the remaining guest rooms on the second floor. They are in the process of building a new lobby on the second floor. The breakfast buffet was fresh, tasty and on par with the other Italy hotels we stayed at.Our room, #47, was reasonably sized, comfortable and faced a quiet courtyard. It had a modern theme, with beige stucco walls and a tile floor. Amenities included a large comfortable queen bed, two safes (one large enough for a notebook), wall mounted 30 plus inch LCD TV, refrigerator, in room wireless internet (free, but in six hour increments). The bathroom was small, but easily accessible.For an extra 10e per night, this room included a balcony with a wonderful view of the Duomo. Unfortunately, it rained every day there and we never got to use it. Along with this, the humidity hatched an extra supply of mosquitoes, so opening the (non-screened) doors to the balcony was out. Another issue was that the balcony had another set of entry doors from the hall outside our room, so one day we came back to find another couple sitting on our (private?) balcony. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure the balcony would be great under the right circumstances, but it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work for us.Miriam and Gassim were charming and knowledgeable hosts, providing everything from museum reservations to touring information with ease. While dining is very subjective, we found a row of restaurants two blocks from the hotel on Borgo San Lorenzo that each offered very tasty and affordable touristico specials. In summary, we enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Europa and would not hesitate to return. It is in a very good location, quiet, well maintained and an excellent value for the price we paid.
