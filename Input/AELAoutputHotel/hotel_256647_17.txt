{"text":"Paper thin walls stayed at the stamford on sat 19.4.08 after dropping brother at airport, reception was friendly enough but room seems dated even after reno's and beds are hard and pillows terrible. the worst thing was the noise from the adjoining room which started at 12 at night till at least 3am rang reception and asked if they could do something about it which involved knocking on the door and being told by guests next door to [--] off and then giving up, was offered another room but as my 1 year old daughter had just gone to sleep after 2 hours of being kept awake by the noise i couldn't see the point i asked again for them to do something about the noise and the rang them and no change, i rang again at 3 in the morning to be told there was nothing they could do about it and to see the duty manager in the morning.next morning at check out after no sleep i asked for the duty manager and told him my concerns, his reply was to offer free parking at a value of 10 dollars, i laughed as i thought he was joking after paying good money for no sleep he said the best he could offer was 2 free breakfast in there restaraunt which is about what soggy cold bacon and sloppy eggs are worth.for anyone wanting to stay at a decent hotel at the airport pick the holiday inn at least you might get a nights sleep.
