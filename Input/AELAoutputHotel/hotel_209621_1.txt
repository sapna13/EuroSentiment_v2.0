{"text":"Disgusting, filthy hotel!!!! Ok, so this was my fourth business trip to PR. I had stayed previously at the Ritz, Marriott and the Hilton next door to this crappy hotel. Upon arrival, there was no bellmen to open the door for me, so I had to hoist all my luggage myself with my husbands help. When I proceeded to check-in, he arrived and said he'd help me with my luggage. Well, when I checked in, the girl at the Front Desk told me she had upgraded me to an ocean view room. I thought, well, at least she's being nice-I was very hesitant on coming here from all the horrible reviews about this place). When we got to the room, I asked the bellman about possibly booking a tour to the rain forest, and he told us that he had a taxi and did excursions, and could take us there himself. We thought it a bit strange, and so we declined. We were probably not going to have enough time anyways. We get to the room, and the first thing I see is how disgustingly filthy the carpet is!! It was just plain nasty! I go to the window to see the view, and the blinds fell off! When I look out, I notice that I can't see anything, because the window is filthy! My husband is getting really mad at this point, but I convince him to calm down. He goes to lie on the bed and he notices that there is a stain, that appears like old blood, on the pillow! To top it all off, there were hairs in the sink! My husband went to the front desk, and spoke with the supervisor, and she apologized and offered to change us to another room-she tried everything to get us to stay. We told her that we didn't want to stay due to the poor condition of the hotel, and so she let us leave without charging us. Be warned, this hotel is filthy and I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy!! You're better off staying at the Hilton next door.
