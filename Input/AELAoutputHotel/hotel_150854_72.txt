{"text":"Great Vacation spot Stayed from January 8th to 15th and flew out of Kitchener, Ontario. We would fly from Kitchener every time if possible- shorter lines and personal service. Check-in was fast and easy and our room was ready immediately in the middle of the day. The buffet was top-notch; always many selections to please the palate. Steakhouse was good but not enough to take us from the buffet. Lobster one night in the buffet was excellent. Service at the bars was quick and friendly but could have used blenders for some frozen drinks. Rooms were good size and well-appointed. Very clean and all rooms that we could see had a good view of the pool area and the ocean through the palms. The beach area still seems to be the best we have seen and we have been to many islands and Mexico. You can walk for miles up and down the beach. Lots of lounges on the beach - with and without shade. You didn't have to be there at 5:30 a.m. to obtain one or two. Entertainment was pretty good- the staff tries real hard and they put in an incredible number of hours. Waiters are always roaming the pool area and even the beach occassionally to ask if you need drinks. Staff is always friendly and try hard to get you involved with activities but they also understand the word- No, when you don't want to be involved. The fact that you can use facilities of the Riu Bambu and Riu Taino is a bonus. Italian Restaurant at the Bambu is still a favourite of ours. We discovered this one when we stayed at the Taino last year. We always felt safe and never threatened. Side trip on a catamaran to swim and snorkel with nurse sharks and rays was a little overcrowded and over dramatized. WILL return to the Palace Macao or the Bambu next year.
