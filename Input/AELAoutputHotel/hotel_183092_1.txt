{"text":"Great Place to Stay! We spent four nights here in November as an add-on to a business trip. You can get to the hotel easily via the Toronto Airport Express Bus, and it's just $30CN roundtrip. It's a quick ride from the airport, and the bus lets you off at the Metropolitan Hotel about 2 short blocks away. Be aware, though--you will be the first stop on the way back and travel time will be a little over an hour.The hotel has a funny site and faces sideways--it's not too impressive when you walk up, but everything changes when you enter. It has a lovely, light lobby filled with professionals who are friendly and helpful! Every interaction I had with the staff was perfect. The property looks recently renovated, and the room was spacious and comfortable. Loved the recycling bins in the closet, due to Toronto's new recycling program. The restaurant was very good and reasonably priced for a hotel restaurant.The location couldn't be better. It's right downtown, next to Eaton Centre, the gorgeous Church of the Holy Trinity, and within walking distance to just about everything. We didn't rent a car and walked everywhere, including the Bata Shoe Museum, Royal Ontario Museum, Chinatown, Kensington Market, St. Lawrence Market, and the Brewery District. Sadly, we missed the reopening of the Art Gallery of Ontario by a week, but that's definitely within walking distance of the hotel. Kensington Market and the Brewery District were the longest shlepps and those walks might not be for all, but we really enjoyed them and had fun detouring through the nearby neighborhoods.I would stay here again in a minute--loved Toronto and the hotel.
