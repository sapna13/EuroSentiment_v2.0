{"text":"OK place Stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel from 23-26 MArch 2007. Booked through a travel agent as we had some travel vouchers to use.The hotel is very conveniently located in Kuta itself. Cross the main road in front of the hotel entrance and you have Kuta beach waiting for you. Unfortunately, the beach was a bit of a letdown. Our first excursion was at low tide, and the beach was FILTHY. Plus for some strange reason, there was a tractor on the beach. There were also too many touts around who did not seem to go away even after you've said no. But I digress, back to the hotel.The hotel is funky and the reception is not all that bad. In fact they were quite accomodating. I discovered that my room was not internet enabled as it was a Superior Room. Only the Deluxe Rooms had it (albeit at a price). When I asked the Front Desk, they gladly changed my room to a Deluxe room at no extra cost. I can't remember the cost of the internet service but it was sold in vouchers for blocks of 4 hours and 8 hours.The rooms were a nice size, very comfortable and clean. The bathroom is very big with a huge bathtub. Unfortunately, there were no toiletries, only a soap dispenser on the wall (kinda like those above sinks in public toilets). From the hotel, you can walk around to all the shops very easily. There is no need to take any form of transport. The buffet breakfast has quite a large spread and the menu changed somewhat everyday which was good.The only problem with the hotel was that the rooms had EXTREMELY thin walls. The main doors to the accomodation wings were good in keeping out the loud sounds of the band at the lobby. However, the room doors and walls themselves were very thin. You can hear people walking and talking in the corridors. It's even worse at night as late night revellers (it IS Hard Rock) make their way back to the rooms so you're waken up in the wee hours because of all the noise they make.Convenient location yes. But I may just try another hotel next time. But if you wanted to try out a theme hotel for a change, then you can't do much wrong with this one.
