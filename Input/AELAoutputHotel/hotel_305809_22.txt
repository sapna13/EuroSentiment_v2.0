{"text":"Ayayay!!!! Oh it wasn't nice!!! It was tatty and spooky especially during nighttime. There was a time that somebody knocked at the door at midnight and though I opened it quick enough there was nobody, no noise of running or any giggling or any trace at all. The rooms were not uniform although they were of the same category. It was like built on recycled scrap material. The bed was not fluffy at all. The TV only had news and channel v in English. Especially that time I was experiencing sinusitis and all those nasal dilemmas, I cant have the air-con on when I'm sleeping so my sister had to endure no air-con with me. When we turned it on at the mildest setting it was still too cold and when you turn it off the room smells old and rotten. It's never supposed r to smell like that.  The stuff are old and creepy, as in the cabinets have dust bunnies, some areas have spots on them. There was no doorbell. and when we got there there was not enough space to move around and we would always have to wait for each other before we could navigate (we=*sister) or sometimes bump into each other. It was so really really small, from the lobby to the room, and people just smoke around in the lobby, and the concierge was the only thing nice and the location. I, never ever, not in a million years, ever want to stay at that hotel again.
