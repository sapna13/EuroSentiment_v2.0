{"text":"I really wanted to like this hotel, but... Before going to Beijing, I read the other reviews and was really rooting for this hotel to be a gem in the rough, but in the end would almost give this hotel a '1' rating, but I'm taking into consideration that this was a Chinese style hotel, not a Western brand name hotel. We had paid extra for a suite, and I had even sent a fax IN CHINESE to make sure that all was in order. The suite we were originally put in was abysmal, even by mainland Chinese standards; dingy, tiny, little light, no ventilation, NO cupboard, closet, or drawers even! The furniture must've have come straight from a dorm room with a bed inadequate for two people (maybe this room was used for staff to crash in?). We had prepaid for the hotel, but they still insisted on a deposit of 1000 RMB (over 100$US) for key deposit (an aging plastic card which they charged us for at checkout because it had cracked) and a mini-bar deposit (yet there was none in the room...there wasn't even a fridge!!) It took an entire day of our trip and two subsequent moves to finally get it straightened out. And we ended up only marginally better than what we had started with: a room whose windows opened into a storage closet full of construction debris, again with no ventilation (they said they couldn't turn on the air in the room). I will say that the assistant manager was most accomodating; even she was appalled at the room we had been given originally, and gave us one night in the presidential suite, but were told to move the next afternoon (after being kept waiting for 4 hours) the 3d and final suite we were assigned was as described above. My partner cashed some Amex travelers cheques and we had a go round with deskstaff who wanted *US* to go to the Bank of China for *THEM* to turn the already countersigned cheques in (they didn't believe his signature matched, even though he had passport, drivers license and other cheques to support it)--that hassle was also resolved finally, but ate up a good several hours, and left me secretly angry and shaken at having been bullied by a gang of 5 hotel staff members. The only reason that I am giving this hotel a 2 is it's location: It really was phenomenal; right at the Forbidden City, and where 15 different bus routes converged that made getting around very easy (if you can read Chinese bus info). Additionally, the rooms were clean (even the dingy one) and service staff were prompt and most courteous. Yet even with these positives, I doubt that I would ever stay there again on subsequent visits to Beijing (and I am planning to go back in October) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":272,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":265},{"endOffset":272,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":265},{"endOffset":385,"mention":"CHINESE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":385,"mention":"CHINESE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":385,"mention":"CHINESE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":385,"mention":"CHINESE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":378},{"endOffset":495,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":2356,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":2349}]}
