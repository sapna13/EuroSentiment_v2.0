{"text":"Excellent despite a couple of small issues Overall our two-night stay at Atlantico was first class, it is well located on Grand Via and is staffed by a team that certainly go that extra mile to please - the hotel cleanliness was of the highest possible standard. The lounge and roof terrace situated on the 9th floor are nothing short of amazing and are certainly a must if you stay at Atlantico and wish to relax after a long day on either business or leisure. Our room (701) was not blessed with a view, in fact our only window looked into a brick service shaft, but it was a first class, spotlessly clean, good sized room with the best equipped and presented en-suite arrangement we have ever come across in this standard of hotel. On the downside we availed ourselves of the free shuttle from the airport; regretfully this sub-contracted operation left something to be desired in terms of vehicle quality and the inability of the driver to concentrate on the road instead of talking to an acquaintance in the front passenger seat. The hotel has agreed to take this matter up with the sub-contractor. The second issue concerns the lack of tea or coffee facilities in the rooms, it is explained in the room folder that there is a free tea and coffee room service facility. Unfortunately when we opted to sample this facility there was no room service available, instead we were invited to attend the cafeteria area on the 9th floor. The hotel management have undertaken to investigate this seeming staff shortage. Our verdict is that we would certainly stay at Atlantico again, without hesitation. The Assistant Director immediately acknowledged the only couple of small issues we had and we have every confidence they will be addressed urgently. By the time I arrived home I had constructive email waiting for me regarding the two minor shortfalls I had drawn to their attention When in Madrid, stay at Atlantico, you will not be disappointed.
