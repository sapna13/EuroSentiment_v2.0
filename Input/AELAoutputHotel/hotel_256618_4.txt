{"text":"Worth Breaking the Bank My wife and I spent three nights in an √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u2022pera King√à√\u2020\u2022?room at the Park Hyatt in early October. The Opera King (or Twin) is the basic category of room enjoying a direct, unobstructed view of the Opera House, but I reckon that some of the cheaper (or should I say less expensive?) rooms enjoy a serviceable, albeit not front-on, view also. Quite apart from the views, however, the location of this property is absolutely superb - probably the most perfectly sited hotel in which we have ever stayed, anywhere. Want to do the bridge walk? It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ five minutes away. Likewise Circular Quay. The proximity of the Opera House itself is self-evident, etc. etc.If you also select a basic room, bear in mind that some rooms have proper balconies with chairs, while others have much smaller balconies without chairs (even though the rooms appear to be of an almost identical size) - it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ therefore worth requesting a room with a proper balcony with chairs.The rooms are well-sized, with desk space, plus with extremely comfortable large beds and pillows. The bed linen is also top notch. The marble bathrooms are spacious, with a separate shower and good amenities.The soundproofing of the rooms is excellent, but one curious feature is that the bathroom extractor fans do not turn off (they are not at all loud, but you know how it is when you notice a noise that will not go away). Management confirmed that this was a design feature. My other minor gripe with the room was that the internet service had to be paid for. For a property at this price-point, I consider this to be an unnecessary irritant - and Park Hyatts are not consistent in this regard.Breakfast (included in only some room rates) features a great selection, including many cooked-to-order items. Both hotel restaurants, situated with Opera House views, offer excellent quality of food and elegant presentation. On one occasion the lunchtime service was slow but it was a minor complaint and the place was busy. The hotel also has a cosy and comfortable whisky bar with an open fireplace (or at least my wife tells me it does - I was sufficiently sloshed not to remember).The Park Hyatt√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ spa is a little disappointing, being both tiny and disjointed. Showers are on one floor and the sauna and steam room on another, making it a bit of an effort to cool off afterwards.Bell boys are super friendly and very quick to help with taxis, luggage etc. With the exception of a dim receptionist who allocated us a room with an inferior balcony, when the next door room with a large one was vacant, the overall quality and friendliness of staff was excellent.If you are willing to swallow the expenditure, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l find a better option in Sydney than the Park Hyatt.
