{"text":"not the best im writing this a bit late coz we went away last year 2 this place and we stayed at the beach resort. it was mid september and we went as a wedding party my sister was getting married. we had 3 days sun and 1 of them was the wedding day thank god it didnt rain then. me and my husband went 2 this hotel in 1998 4 our honeymoon so i recomended this place 2 her because then it was fantastic!!!! but its now a shabby mess. the food was ok the pool was great but it was confrence time 4 the americans in september so it got a little crowded we had 2 q up on 1 occasion 4 our food it got that bad. the staff were ok not that friendly unless u were tipping them, wich i dont understand when uve paid a lot of money 4 ur holiday anyway. i no they r not on the best money and they make a tidy profit from us but when uve saved up all year 4 a dam good holiday the last thing u do is tip.the weather was awful which cant b helped. but in the second week we all came down with the major trots which was unpleasnt 4 all. the entertaniment was not the best that time of the year. the rooms were full of mozzies we all got bit terrible but the maids gave us some spray 4 our rooms so that was good. bar staff arnt the friendliest but they put up with us coz we couldnt speak a word of spanish. overall not bad but wont b returning back here coz i done it twice but no regrets.
