{"text":"Front desk service is appalling I read the reviews and my expectation is pretty high for a supposedly 6 star hotel. I arrived at 2am and expected topnotch services. Instead I was greeted with a stone face lady at the front desk who used the right choice of words in her greeting without any warmth. For 6 days I stayed in this hotel, I was observing the front desk staffs while waiting for my colleague. I noticed most of them do not smile except I guy. The front desk manager is worst. While I was complaining to her, occasionally, her eyes were directed at the front desk and smiled. Her choice of words used example √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ from your country and I will not lie to you.√à√\u2020\u2022?This is truly an unprofessional remark. Except for the front desk, the services from the doorman to the guest relation staffs are impeccable. I truly agreed with one of the reviewer from the room, the nightlight of the Singapore skyline is breathtaking. I was shocked by daylight the view is spoilt by cranes and construction. Experienced the same thing. I switched room from 6th floor to 10th floor and realized the previous room is cleaner and the towels\/bathrobe were of better quality. Those on 10th floor were hard and I had to clean the stain on the milk jug. I was there for a meeting with several colleagues from other countries. We stayed at different hotels. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ returning to Singapore in April for 10 days and has made reservation in the same hotel. Waiting for my colleagues review on hotels they stayed and if it's better, I will switch with no second thoughts. ","annotations":[]}
