{"text":"We really liked it!!! I had reservations about this hotel from the reviews on here beforehand but we decided to go ahead and stay here for part of our Honeymoon.We took the unusual step of contacting the hotel before we booked it and asking for some information regarding the rooms.Assistant Manager Jenny Chmieleski was our contact and she could not have been more helpful.And we stayed at this hotel because of the help that Jenny gave us.Many Thanks Jenny,you really reassured us about your fabulous hotel.We got upgraded one level as a honeymoon bonus and we got upgraded when we arrived also to a Junior Suite.Aaron our bellboy was really helpful in helping us settle and only too willing to give advice.During our stay,we found the conceirge desk was also only too happy to help, with a special mention for Jessica(I think) and Ron.The hotel decor itself is really different than anything we had ever stayed in but we loved it.Although I will add that I can understand why some would not like it but it was to our taste.Our room was a nice size and decorated really nicely.The famous TV 's are small but we were assured that they were in the process of replacing them with LCD's.But they were fine and to be honest we did'nt come all this way to watch TV.The hotel is in a great location.The downside was we made a phone call home to Dublin,Ireland from our room.The call lasted around 10mins and it was to a landline.It cost $65...!!!!!!I know that ringing from a room usually costs alot more than a phone booth but this was quiet excessive.We got a phone card for $10 and made calls lasting 70mins.Also the internet charges were quiet expensive compared to other hotels that I have stayed in. But overall we really enjoyed our stay in Clift and in San Francisco.We will be back and we would stay in this hotel again,without question.
