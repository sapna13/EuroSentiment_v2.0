{"text":"Nice hotel with many expensive conveniences and a few hidden treasures The hotel complex is massive, but once you get your bearings, you'll find it easy enough to navigate.The rooms: From what I hear, the rooms are spacious by Tokyo standards. By US standards the size is just a bit smaller than your average 3 star hotel room. I had a king bed in the garden tower and was fine by myself space wise. The bed was hard and you could feel the springs, but everything else was pretty comfortable and clean. Nice 27 plasma TV, lots of freebie toiletries, robes and slippers, casual kimono sleepwear, and paid minibar. The decor was a bit dated, but overall I thought the room was fine for what I paid compared to other hotels in the area.The food: Western food at the Otani sucks, so stick with Japanese food if you eat there. The main restaurants (the ones that they advertise and put at the forefront of entrances to trick you into thinking that's all that is available) are expensive! Expect to pay up to $50-150 USD for a meal at those places. A few reasonable places include the following:Tully's - Starbucks-esque coffee shop. The coffee isn't great, but you can get a cup of Joe, a ham  cheese hot pocket, and a pastry for less than 10 bucks.Towada and Niizu - These are soba noodle restaurants so they are casual and less expensive. You can get a tasty authentic soba meal for around $20 (which is still expensive for soba, but not as painfully expensive as the other restaurants).The western-style cocktails were no better than the food (bartenders could not make a decent cosmo), so again, stick with Japanese style drinks like sake and japanese beer.The recreation - One of the reviewers said that you had to pay to use the gym. This is not entirely true. The fancy gym cost over $50 bucks to use. But there are 2 workout rooms that have a couple elliptical machines, treadmills, and stationary bikes that you can use for free. Also check out the relaxation room near the business center and next to the workout room in the Garden Tower that has a shiatsu massage chair that you can enjoy for free. You do have to pay $20 to use the pool.The shopping - There are so many shops at the New Otani, but they mostly cater to middle aged business folks and their spouses. I guess that makes sense.General comments - the New Otani is right next to a Tokyo metro stop, ask the staff which entrance to use to get there as the hotel complex is quite large. The staff are very friendly and accommodating. You can get just about anything by asking the front desk. I borrowed an adapter and rented a japanese cell phone from the front desk. Oh, and you have to ask housekeeping to bring you an iron and they only let you keep it for 1 hour. So I ironed my entire wardrobe so that I wouldn't need to keep borrowing it. The same thing happened when I was in Sapporo - don't know what's up with that. All in all, I was quite satisfied with my stay at the New Otani Hotel.
