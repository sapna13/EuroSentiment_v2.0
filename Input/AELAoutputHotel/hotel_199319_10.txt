{"text":"Unique and Special Pulling up to the Hessischer Hof you wonder what you've gotten yourself into. The hotel is in the business district and is in a non-descript building. And then you walk inside!The lobby is intimate and the staff first-rate. Check-in is quick. The rooms are large, especially for Europe. I loved the decor -- the desk was an incredibly interesting piece of furniture and the chair comfortable to work in. The bed is great with a soft feather comforter. The sitting area is decent sized. Do ask for a room off the main street, which can be noisy.The bathroom is quite large and has a nice tub. Amenities are plentiful and include bath salts. Large towels are on a heated towel rack, so always warm!Lots of little freebies -- internet is free. BIG bottles of still and sparkling water in the room are free. They give you a plate of fruit. The mini-bar (beer, soft-drinks, juice) is free. They have a free happy hour in the evening with drinks, olives, and munchies. And the hostess makes you feel right at home. Numerous free international newspapers are available throughout the day. You feel like a guest rather than a commodity.We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant. They had a wonderful prix fixe menu that included wine. Service was outstanding and the price was excellent, even with the exchange rate.Wakeup calls were timely and check out was quick. The staff was uniformly pleasant and attentive -- they actually take you to your room. Room keys are the bulky old-fashioned kind (which you leave at the front desk when you go out), but I found them quaintly refreshing.If you want a cookie-cutter, large chain hotel, this isn't it. But if you want something different, special and unique -- that makes you feel like you're in Germany, not anywhere USA -- try the Hessischer Hof. You won't be disappointed..
