{"text":"Relaxing Atmosphere, clean tidy and helpful A very tidy Boutique type hotel well maintained and decorated without wrecking the character of an old building. The rooms are clean and tidy and the view if you are at the front is of the Grand Canal is excellent to wake up to. (Well worth a few mores pennies\/cents) .The hotel is opposite the train station (not a bad thing; it is not an 'industrial' view) and 5 minutes from it and the bus station and a two minute stroll from a Vaporeto stop. Staff are very friendly and helpful and will happily advise you where it is good to visit and perhaps more importantly what is not. I can't offer much more feedback as we were generally out all day and although breakfast was included for us we only made breakfast on one occasion as we prefer to grab something while out and about but it appeared decent as these continental buffet arrangements go (I still prefer a Venetian snack from a Street vendor myself. Make sure you get yourselves a Vapporeto (boat bus) ticket to cover the period you are there (They do 24\/36\/48 hour tickets etc. you can get them from the stop over the bridge next to the train station) and you can just jump on and jump off when you feel like it. They are like London buses arriving every few minutes and there are few places more than a 5 minute stroll or a 15 minute saunter from a Vapo stop.Get a good guide book (Eyewitness with the 3D maps are particularly good for the Grand Canal) and follow the advice on eateries in Venice as they are a bit variable in quality. If you like seafood head for the fish market and if you stand on the stone bridge running alongside the grand canal and look inland there is a little wooden bridge which leads to an excellent seafood restaurant (I think it is called the Antiche something or the other) for a quiet high quality meal that will not break the bank. Turbot for two I would heartily recommend with a lobster gnocchi starter or the seafood soup. Good wine list too.
