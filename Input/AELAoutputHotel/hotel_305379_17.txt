{"text":"Reasonable for Hong Kong Overall - average missing out on above average. Ideal for short stays - maximum 10 days. Ideal for independent tourists who are not bothered about mini bars or perks. 6 out of 10. I have been to Hong Kong 15 times and with the right changes - asthetically inside and outside (uninviting) this hotel has great potential for any owner AND for visitors. THE POSITIVEDorsett Seaview was reasonable in cost terms insofar as Hong Kong hotels are concerned. Working out at around 42 GBP, 96 AUD, 56 EUR or 85 USD per night. Only five minutes walk from the Yau Ma Tei MTR station which has links into the centre. Ideal for exploring Hong Kong Island and Kowloon. Ideal for taxis if you really need them. Nathan Road has excellent bus routes. Shuttle bus service to Kowloon Airport Express Railway Station downtown. Friendly staff and room cleaned\/stocked daily. Busy area seemed safe most of the time. CCTV system, calendar of events and weather report on all floors.I would recommend this hotel. THE NEGATIVEHotel could do with a major investment to do it up particularly as hotels in Hong Kong are few in number in this particular market. I agree that the decor needs to be overhauled - if only to make it update. Drab bedsheets replaced by funky ones would make the hotel more fun - particularly after a 12 hour flight. Facilities were clean however shower curtains need to be replaced. Bedroom area was sufficient however the shower\/bathroom areas needs to be updated and regularly deep cleaned. Internet available however uncompetitive. Cheaper to travel down to Kowloon by MTR and have a full hour on the internet. Prices advertises should also include tax. Not that I watch much television but the set was poorly located. The information guide in the room for the hotel amenities needs overhauling. ","annotations":[]}
