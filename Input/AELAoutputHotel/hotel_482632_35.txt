{"text":"Hated this hotel.Never go there again.................. Stayed at hotel from 10-8-07 to 10-13-07. Worst place we have ever stayed at and on top of that ...Worst customer service. Did not care about the problems we experienced at the hotel!!1)Rooms were extremely small\/tight  no room to get around the room. 2)No place to put your clothes except for a small\/tall armoire. There were 2 of us only enough room for 1 person's stuff, majority stuff had to stay in 2 luggages for 5 days (not good!!). 3)Mattresses were extremely flat\/hard  pillows just as bad. 4)Hotel rooms were moldy (wall paper was pealing off one of the walls). 5)Air conditioning system did not work. Water dripped down on the floor from the AC vent  water was all over the carpet  some of our luggage\/clothes.6)Came out next day and fixed the AC, but never apologized about the incident or offered to clean our wet\/dirty clothes. On the 3rd day I advised them they needed to clean the clothes that were soiled so we could use some of them. 7)AC went off without any notification at 7:30pm same day it was fixed.8)Called office,advised the hotel system automatically shuts off at 7:30pm-to next morning at 7:00am. Advised to open windows to get fresh air since it was fall season  cool outside. That would have been great except we had this huge problem every night to deal with........**All night unable to sleep!! Bar next door loud music blaring from bar every night for 5 nights!!! (15-20 bikers,30-35 college students  20-25 high school kids hanging outside in the middle alley throwing bottles around, screaming\/laughing from 9:00pm to 4:00am. Never slept it was extremely loud and scarry**Spoke to desk rep\/supervisor advised have to see if they have another room available  we would have to pay the extra 20-40 Euro's if we wanted to make a change. No guarantee's if a room was available and second of all, they should have moved us to another without additional charge. We were so exhausted from hassling with these people that we just wanted to finish our stay there and get on to the next city we were going to visit. ","annotations":[]}
