{"text":"Avoid this Hotel As a preface, let me say that my husband is an extensive traveller and a Platinum member with Intercontinental Hotels for years. He really likes the service at the Holiday Inn Express hotels. That being said we choose this hotel for closness to the train going downtown so I could have the car.The front desk staff, with 2 exceptions, was horrible. Upon check in there were several people ahead of us and all were greeted with a curt No rooms available yet-comeback at 3(It was 1 PM). When it was our turn, we got the same line-dh just wanted to store our luggage and bikes so we could go over to the state fair.So the lady checks our reservation and realizes who dh is (like I said he travels extensively) and just about falls all over herself to apologize and all the sudden we can have our room right now. While it was nice for us,it's not nice for other travellers. We get to our floor and it's ghost town, confirming our suspicions that the front desk just didn't want tocheck anyone in early.The first night we went to the bar and the bartender informed us quite rudely that there was only one wine available as he didn't have the keys to the cooler. I felt as though we were interrupting him watching the game as we were the only people in there.They do have security that rides the lot 24\/7 in a golf cart but the hotel backs up to an iffy area. I did ride through it to gain access to a bike trail and was OK, but not for the faint of heart or at night.We didn't receive maid service the second day until I went down at 3 and asked.Today was the icing on the cake. Dh asked for an extended check out as he's at a conference and won't be back until 2. He doesn't do this often but when he does if the hotel isn't busy (and believe me this one isn't) they're very graciousand allow it. The guy at the front desk this morning was very rude and arrogant and he could give us till 1 but that was absolutely it.We should've stayed downtown-next time we will. The rooms are outdated and the AC is iffy. The room smelled of mildew.
