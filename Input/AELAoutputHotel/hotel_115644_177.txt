{"text":"Good value, right near the shopping We weren't too fussed about our stay in San Francisco. We were only there for 2 nights, after a big trip from NYC and Las Vegas, that we wanted a more toned down hotel, but was close to transport and the shops. And the Chancellor Hotel did it's job. The front desk was always very helpful, and provided us with as much assistance as they could, especially when it came around to booking our airport transfer. The lady at the bookings area was a bit scary - I can understand why people feel like they're being harrassed. But she does a good job at telling you as much as you need to know. Although, we found it a bit annoying when trying to book for Alcatraz, and she said she had been waiting on the line for hours, and no one had picked up the phone, when we got through straight away on our mobile! The room was slightly smaller than we thought, but it did it's job. There's a good size wardrobe to put your suitcases, even though we didn't use it. The bathroom is also on the small size, but does it job as well. All parts of our room was clean. The only thing I can say is that there is an ice machine opposite the lifts, which was in front of our room. So that was a bit noisy at times.In terms of location - it was perfect. The cable car went by right outside, which was handy to get to Fisherman's Wharf, or over to Westfield Shopping Centre. Union Square is just outside as well, but do be careful as there are quite a lot of beggers (especially on Market Street - it's very very scary!). Chinatown is a good 10-15 minute walk (up a steep hill!). Right outside, you could see Macy's, Victoria's Secret, and around the corner Nike, Tiffany  Co, Gucci, etc. Heaven for shoppers!In the end, for the money we paid, it was definitely worth the stay.
