{"text":"A wonderful family get-together Our family spent a week at the Caribe Hilton to celebrate an anniversary; we brought our three children and spouses and their three young children. It was a great experience -- the hotel has a wonderful setting, right on the edge of Old San Juan, with its own sheltered beach (perfect for young children digging in the sand). There are also LOTS of pools and space to sit in the shade of palm trees near the water. The staff was extremely helpful, spending a long time with us at the front desk and giving advice about restaurants and current traffic conditions. I asked for sand buckets several times, and was loaned a large selection at no charge. We never dealt with a single person who was not cheerful and outgoing and friendly. Our rooms were large and well-supplied; having refrigerators made it easy for the young families to keep milk and cereal, etc. on hand for the kids. And children under 5 eat for free in the restaurants! One of the best parts of this hotel is its location near Old San Juan. There is a bus that goes directly into downtown, or plenty of taxis, and a lot to see and do. We also visited art museums in a different section of town. So you get the best of both worlds -- a relaxing beach resort hotel and a city with variety and history to visit nearby. It's a good place for a group like ours. ","annotations":[]}
