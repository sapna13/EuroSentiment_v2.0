{"text":"Friendliest Hotel in Amsterdam? This was our first visit to Amsterdam, and we chose the Hotel Eureka based on generally favourable Tripadvisor reviews. We were not disapointed. Arriving mid-morning following an early start from home we were treated to a comlimentary coffee and slice of apple pie in the lounge (these personal touches mean a lot and this was typical of our stay). We had asked for a double room but there was only a twin available and although the receptionist offered to change us the following day we decided to keep it for our 3 night stay. The room was unusual being long and narrow with the single beds end to end rather than side by side. The decor was also a bit tired and the furniture is best described as inexpensive antique. However, it was clean with enough space, had lots of character and a lovely view over the Amstel River. We also had fresh flowers on the coffee table the day after our arrival. Although Breakfast was not included in the price, the first mornings was complimentary and was good enough for us to pay 10 Euros each for the following days. The hotel lounge\/breakfast room had a cosy feel to it and we enjoyed a relaxing complimentary drink there each evening before retiring. The location is great for exploring the centre of Amsterdam. In the heart of the Old Town but not near the Red Light District. The nearest tram stop was only a few minutes walk away so access to and from the station was no problem.The staff could not have been friendlier or more helpful, particularly after my wife was struck by a cyclist. (Be careful, they don't stop for red lights; no entry signs or pedestrians.) Her injuries were minor but a first aid kit and a large complimentary whiskey (for me) were promptly provided. Our stay in the hotel was well worth the price we paid although we could have saved a bit by booking our room there direct. Which is what we will do the next time we visit Amsterdam.
