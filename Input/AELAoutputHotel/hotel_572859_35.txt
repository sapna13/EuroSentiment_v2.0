{"text":"Lovely Hotel in a quiet, safe area! We were two girlfriends that stayed at the Apex for 3 nights. The first thing we noticed when we came from the underground was that the hotel was located in a very nice area, the only people we saw was office-workers. , There are sooo much people everywhere in London it seems, so we thought that the quiet area was great! It√à?√¨s located only 2 minuits walk from Tower Hill undergroundstation and really close to The Tower.We loved the hotel and our room, though the room wasn√à?√¨t big (standard twin room) it was comfortable and it didn√à?√¨t feel small. There was a lot of closet space and a fridge, also an ironing board and a really good hair dryer (in a lot of hotels they have those bad dryers that are attached to the wall that hardly has no power at all). The decor was beautiful, a lot of dark wooden details combined with light colors on the walls. Lovely pictures and nice curtains. The bed was comfy, the only thing that bothered us was that the sheets was TO crisp so everytime you moved the other person heard it. Big TV with DVD and a DVD-library in the reception where you could lend films for a deposit of 20 pounds.The bathroom was lovely, all tiled. A big walk-in shower AND a bathtub (last bathroom I saw in London was so small that I could hardly move in it at all so this was a nice surprise). The staff was very helpful and nice, and the service good. At arrival we asked for someone to go up to our room to unlock the windows (they are locked for safety reasons and have to be open with a key). The maid service was so fast that they were in our room even before we were :-) !We had booked and pre-paid for the continental breakfast. It was ok, but nothing to brag about....... Being from Sweden we are used to excellent hotel breakfast that has everyting one could desire, but of course we knew that english hotels has a totally different take on breakfast. Still we would have wished a bigger variety of bread for example. Some boiled eggs would have been nice and some hot food for example bacon (they have a menu to order from so you can get bacon if you pay extra).Another thing that bothered us was the bath towels!! It was virtually impossible to get dry by using them! I don√à?√¨t know what they-ve done to them, but I suggests that they buy new towels...... It√à?√¨s not to nice to get dressed when you are still dripping wet! All in all, we liked the hotel very much and I would definetly stay here again and recommend it to others!
