{"text":"Go With Friends! If you are staying at this hotel please don't worry about the really bad reviews - the local people do not hate Americans but I will say most of the staff were indifferent. It is true about the wash cloths and about the maid service having no real schedule. Most days our room was just gotten around to around 5:00. No bug problems at all either. Also, we stayed in Bldg. 5 and it was actually fantastic - first floor, literally steps to the beach. We were not bothered by any construction. Overall the room was fine.FOOD: Average - skip the American Grill\/Tex Mex. The Italian was pretty good as was the Beach Garden. Windows was also okay. Service at the restaurants was always very professional but unfortunately really slow.DRINKS: Always lots to choose from - never had to wait very long either. The drinks are very weak though so you can pretty much drink all day. Also, they serve everyone - Get the Banana Mama, very tasty! Ask for extra rum if you're a real drinker.POOLS: Clean and well maintained. Very warm, however. Cool off by standing under the cool showers nearby.BEACH: Beautiful - cooler and breezier than by the pool. No trouble getting lounge chairs at all - You get to know who puts towels down and never show up - we just moved them to another spot.TIP: Bring your own wash cloth - brings singles and fives. Bargain with the vendors. Try to vacation with another family - it is very true about this particular resort. Very few Americans so it is hard to find new friends.Have Fun!!!!
