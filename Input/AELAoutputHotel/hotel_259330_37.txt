{"text":"Oh My God! We went there to give our daughters hand in marrage to a wonderful young man. Right from the start there were several problems. We had to wait over two hours to get our room. It was the wrong room!!! The people at the front desk where very unfriendly to say the least. For the most part, the food was the same horrible stuff day in and day out. The only good thing was that the wedding was done pretty well and thats all. Our daughter was very happy and they both looked great.There was talk that the drinks were watered down and several people complained of very large roaches in their rooms. I had a medical problem and went to the medical office there. They did not take my insurence and I had to pay 175.00 for the treatment. They actually made a copy of my passport before treating me. I'm actually too sick to write anymore of the nightmares there as the day before we left, my wife, myself and many other of our friends started getting sick with a sore throat etc. We have been home for two days and we are still very ill.I have to tell you this though, The icing on the cake was the fact that you had to pay 20.00 dollars for a lock for our room safe so that THEIR staff couldn't rob you. The 20.00 was non-refundable and if you didn't turn it back in it costs you 50.00 dollars. Their 2 star rating is wrong ...it should be NO stars.....DO NOT GO THERE!
