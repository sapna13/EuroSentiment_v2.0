{"text":"Feelin' HOT HOT HOT! This is a beautiful hotel. It is very clean in common areas, as well as the room. The room was very spacious for Europe standards; the bed soft and comfortable. The personnel were very kind and helpful. For our room - we walked in and to our left was a trouser press! To the right - was a wonderful, large bathroom - very ornate. There were speakers in there so you could hear the tv! The shower was huge and wonderful - lots of hot, steaming water. There was a bidet as well as a toilet, even a towel warming rack.The closet had lots of room and took up almost a full wall (on the opposite side of the bathroom in the room, next to the bed). There was a desk, mini bar\/fridge and balcony with table and chairs. So the low down - we really enjoyed the hotel, breakfast, etc. However, the heaters were on bc it was cold, but it was SO hot inside the room. They lowered the temperature as much as they could, but it was still unbearably hot - so much that we had to leave the balcony doors open - and mosquitoes ate us alive (in December).Other thing to note is that the hotel is very far from all of Florence's action. Wasn't a big deal to us as we like walking, knew how to use buses and also took a lot of day trips out of the city. But it may be a bit far if you want to spend a lot of the time at the sites that are further away. It was about a 15 min walk to the 'action.' We would stay there again - it felt like you were being pampered a bit (again, esp by European stds.) but not paying for it. Next time though, we bring a fan so we don't swelter from heat! =) ","annotations":[]}
