{"text":"excellent value excellent value for money hotel,for the price we paid it could not be faulted.There were two adults and one child in our party,as we booked with 'barcelonahotels.com' we only paid √ä√£¬¢17\/night extra for the child place.Not many other websites offered this option at all.We would have had to book either two rooms or reserve a room with a third bed in it-this would have cost a lot more money.Worth remembering if you have child in your party.The bed was kingsize and there was a bed\/settee too,plently of room for all three of us in the room.There was a lcd tv,(sky news),kettle and cups(no spoons,tea bags or milk),lovely powershower and bathroom,central heating and or air conditioning. The area was a bit on the rough side,but i have to say i felt a lot safer there than i did on The Ramblas or the rest of the tourist traps.There was a hostel across the road where a young student party from Germany stopped in one night,they bought their own alcohol from the spar shop near by and headed off into town-this was the only example of noise we experienced at night.If anything i would say it was a lot quiter than most of the city i saw,it was a welcome relief to find the hotel so peaceful after all the crowds and sightseeing. There is noise and disruption by day because there is a new pavement and road surface being constructed,this did not cause us any problem either;work started mainly after 8.00am-still quiter than some of the areas i saw.I read the reviews about the drug dealing and prostitutes, i did not notice this,but then again Barcelona is stuffed full of very bizarre things and some very strange looking people;if i saw drug dealers and prostitutes i was not aware! The rest of the streets had their fair share of social problems too.If you are used to The Hilton or want five star luxury this hotel is probably not for you.You would struggle to find the equivalent hotel or bb in the uk for the same price.The hotel does not have a lot of space for the dining area and at times it was a little bit cramped but this was not a major issue,the food was very good quality,again not a lot of room for display,but what they had was quite sufficient and good attention to detail was maintained.To get to the hotel from the airport i would definately recommend the airobus from outside the airport-get off at Player Cat. and either walk down to The Ramblas or catch the metro to Licau and turn right into Hospital Street.Probably not worth paying the extra for a taxi;they cannot get down a lot of the side streets without a lot of trouble;it is likely that they would drop you off near by.i would definately recommend this hotel-excellent value and very clean-i would stay here again.Centrally placed for most things;harbour and columb five minutes,Ramblas two minutes,market one minute,Gothic area ten minutes,Picasso,Cathedral etc.There is charming bistro type restaurant across the road called organic, frequented by the locals and hotel guestsvery handy,healthy and reasonably priced-they have got a tapas type bar in the market too for take aways,delicious food.There are hundreds of bars and restaurants nearby.
