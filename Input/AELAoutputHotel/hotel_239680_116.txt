{"text":"Everything the high ratings indicate! Perfect for first-time Paris. I recently spent the weekend of July 28, 29 2007 in the Hotel Elysees Regencia. I stayed at this hotel because of the high TripAdvisor ratings and I was not disappointed. The Regencia is everything positive that is written about it in the reviews and the high popularity ratings are well deserved.Quality: The rooms are all tastefully decorated in a contemporary style with high quality furnishings. All the pictures on their website are accurate. The rooms all appear recently refurbished and everything appears new. Beds are comfortable with new linens. Bathrooms appear new and immaculate. Rooms are small by US standards, but large by Paris standards.Staff: The staff all spoke excellent English and were very helpful and accommodating. There was none of the legendary Paris attitude. In fact, I never saw this my entire time in France and I don't speak French. The staff went out of their way to be friendly and offer any assistance and also made me feel very welcomed and relaxed.Location: 5 minute walk to Champs- Elysee and Arc de Triumph as well as George V Metro station. 20 minute walk to Eiffel Tower. This is the perfect location for first time Paris visitors looking to do the tourist activities as there are lots of tourists and restaurants on this end of the Champs Elysee. 10 minute walk to the Air France bus stop providing easy and cheap transportation to CDG airport. Recommend red tour bus (Les Cars Rouge) for sightseeing combined with Metro. The tour bus stop is near the Arc de Triumph on the Champs Elysees.Price: Paid 190 Euros per night for a standard single (full) bed room. This was a good value for the area, especially for such a high quality hotel.Miscellaneous: Room safe large enough to hold widescreen laptop. Wifi internet service was spotty, but free, as I believe I was picking up the lobbies free access point from the fourth floor. Paid WiFi internet service is available.The 18 Euro Regencia breakfast via room service was excellent and is sufficient to feed two people. There appeared to be mostly American couples and families in the hotel.This was my first time in Paris, so I had to trust fellow TripAdvisors on this hotel. I truly enjoyed this hotel and will stay there again on my next visit. I slept until 12:00 PM one day as the bed and room were so comfortable.Im sure there are other great hotels in Paris; however, in terms of quality, location and value -along with good TripAdvisor referrals, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hard to beat the Elysees Regencia.Please contact me if you have any questions.
