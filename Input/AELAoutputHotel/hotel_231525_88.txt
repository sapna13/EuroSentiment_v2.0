{"text":"Good hotel, great location, bad beds You can't get a better location right in a pedestrian zone in the heart of Barcelona. The room was quite spacious and the bath, featuring a jacuzzi tub, was huge. We had a room with a balcony overlooking the busy shopping street but the doors did a good job of blocking out most of the noise (if you're noise sensitive though, you don't want a room facing the street). I would've given it 4 stars but the beds are atrocious. I asked for a double bed for two but got the old-school european separate twins that were made separately and pushed together. Even worse were the mattresses which were really very uncomfortable. I can sleep on almost anything but still woke up every morning in pain because the thin mattress was like a rock.The people at reception were very friendly, and it was nice that they regularly provided drinks, snacks and internet usage. Take their security warnings seriously. At 2 in the morning on the second night were were woken up by loud screams from the street where a man walking alone had been mugged and pushed to the ground - literally right in front of the hotel. It's not that the hotel is in a bad area (just the opposite really), but that muggers know that tourists wandering the streets at that hour are easy prey.We took advantage of the first morning 50% off breakfast which was good, but it's definitely not worth the regular 15 euro they charge if it's not included in your room.The only reason I wouldn't stay here again is the beds. They just don't give you the comfort you need after playing tourist all day and night.
