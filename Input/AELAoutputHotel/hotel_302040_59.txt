{"text":"Great hotel but Useless Concierge and Construction! Dont get me wrong this hotel is a beautiful and is of 5 star standard but I was really disappointed with the level of service of the conceirge and the construction going on around the hotel. The hotel is situated in a great location in Kowloon- close to the harbour; nathan road; harbour city; and the star ferry. Our hotel room was on the 23rd floor facingf Kowloon and actually had a really good view. The room itself is spacious with nice bathroom.My only problem with this hotel is that their website doesnt tell you about the construction- road works going on around the hotel meaning that walking across the road to the harbour front becomes a real hassle with numerous diversions to get there!Apart from this the conceirge could not of been more useless if they tried. We asked to get directions to disneyland and I was asked 'why?'. Also, they were going to book us 2 tickets to the IMAX but when we went to collect them they werent there- they had forgot!On the other hand, one of the best things about this hotel is the spa- which i would highly recommend to anyone wanting to relax and unwind- the relaxation room has wonderful views out to the harbour and the treatments are gerat.I would also recommend the verandah restaurant for sunday lunch and ask for a window table so you can watch the world go by!The peninsula is an institution in Hong Kong and has a lot of history. I would stay there again but only when the construction has finished and wouldnt use the concierge for anything!
