{"text":"Awesome Hotel Keio Plaza was incredible. My husband and I stayed there for 3 nites 2 weeks ago and we have nothing but good things to say. We booked this hotel through an agent and because it was a packaged deal with our flights, she booked us a standard room which was a superior room with a queen size bed. Because it was a packaged deal, we couldn't upgrade to a nicer room and we couldn't get the points towards our Asia miles. Although, it was just a superior room in the main building, the room was amazing. We got the basic toiletries (from Shiseido, that's pretty good for a standard room), different types of green tea, free internet... The room was a bit outdated but extremely clean. Our room faced the Parliament building, which was fine, not like we planned to stay in our room all day. The best thing to do is, once you have arrived at the Narita airport, go to the Airport Limousine counter and purchase the tickets to Keio Plaza, it's around $30 US per ticket but it will take you directly to the hotel with no hassel. It's around 1 hour to 1.5 hour ride from the airport, depending on traffic. Once you have arrived at the hotel, the hotel reps will rush out to get your luggages. They will put your luggages on the side and guard them while you check-in. Once you have checked in, the rep will walk you to your room with your luggages. Our rep told us which direction we were facing and which way was to the subway. The service was amazing. Breakfasts were included in our package. The breakfasts were soooooo good. They have a few different restaurants to choose from. Breakfast usually starts at 6:30am or 7am. On our first day, we tried the western style breakfast. It's like a buffet. There were not just Western style breakfast, but also Japanese food. The 2nd day we tried the Japanese traditional breakfast, it was really good as well. The hotel is in the center of the financial district and just across the street from restaurants and shopping. It's about a 5mins walk to the subway but it's a nice stroll because there are lots of things to see. We tried the restaurants around the hotel and they are all very good. You can also book the Airport Limousine at the hotel as well. There's a machine that you can purchase the bus tickets from. We checked out at 11am and our flight wasn't till 6pm, the hotel locked our luggages at a secure room until we were ready to leave. In conclusion, Keio plaza is a wonderful hotel. The staff are very courteous and helpful. The hotel is extremely sensitive to the customers' needs. I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again.
