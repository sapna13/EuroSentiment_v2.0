{"text":"Cant wait to go back again - What can I say that has not been said before, after meeting Matteo in 2007 and having drinks on the terrace (we were staying at their sister hotel) we knew we had to come back and stay with Matteo. Arriving in a water taxi we unloaded our bags and Matteo was there to great us like the old friends we felt we were. We had a wonderful suite (apparently the best in the house) with a very large bedroom, separate lounge\/desk area and with two huge windows that opened out onto the water of the Grand Canal. Whilst the bathroom was small, it was very modern and sufficient and the additional space in the suite more than compensated for it. The rooms were clean and the staff were all wonderful, the breakfasts delicious, with the eggs coming from Matteo's grandmothers farm and sitting on the balcony having breakfast in the mornings looking out on the the Grand Canal or drinks in the evening before going for dinner and then back for a nightcap, this was one of the highlights of Venice for us. Our third trip to Venice and staying with Matteo was like staying with a very good friend, but with five star service. A smaller hotel where the guests mingled with each other in the evening on the terrace (if you wished to do so) and there is no other place that we would consider staying in Venice in fact any time we are in Europe it would be a must stop. Cannot recommend this hotel or their sister one enough. Its worth a trip to Venice to stay with these wonderful people in their wonderful home. ","annotations":[]}
