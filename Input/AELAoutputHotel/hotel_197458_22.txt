{"text":"Great Experience We found this hotel on tripadvisor by doing the same thing you are doing now....reading the reviews from others. I am pleased to say that our experience at the Hotel Duret validated our expectations based on the numerous positive reviews here.We stayed in one of the small rooms. We expected it to be small, but we like each other so it was cozy. I have traveled in Europe many times and I am used to the smallish hotel rooms. The small rooms would be just fine for a happy couple. Not so much for a guy trip, etc. The hotel itself was great. It has a trendy feel to it while retaining its character. Everyone we encountered at the front desk was exceptionally friendly and helpful. They gave us a great sushi recommendation just across the Avenue Grand Armee (forget the name).The location was perfect. We were looking for something that had an authentic Parisian feel rather than a tourist trap. I think we found it. The hotel is situated in a residential area with several cafes. It is also right on the metro, which by the way is the best public transportation system I have ever experienced. You can get anywhere in Paris in 20 minutes. However, don't take the metro everywhere -- walk to the Arch, down the Champs, and over to the Eiffel tower. These are all easy and safe walks and the only way to truly experience Paris.We would stay here again and would recommend the Duret to friends and family. Ignore the few negative comments on here and keep and mind that there are some people out there that you just cannot please. We all know a few... ","annotations":[]}
