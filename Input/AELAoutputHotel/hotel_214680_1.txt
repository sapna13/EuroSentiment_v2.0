{"text":"Great Location and Great Value We booked in to the hotel on the 15th of December for 14 nights. Lawrence took care of our check in and made sure we was ok. Every time he saw us walk through reception he would check how our tan was coming along and ask if there was anything he or other members of staff could help with. Every member of staff gave us great service and I felt this was genuine customer service. Not just lip service. Fantastic.The rooms are Basic, but clean. Why do you need a 50 plasma? your in Hawaii go out and see the place. The maid service was very good as well. We could not fault the service we had.The location of this hotel is at the end of the strip. It is a little more peaceful than central Waikiki. However you have everything in easy walking distance and great views. Across the road you have the zoo, well worth a visit. great sections of beach. Some of the more expensive hotels don't have the good sections of beach or the section to swim as this hotel does on their door step. The pool was always clean and offered a more private dip than the sea. Lulu's surf club serve great food with great views. Check the names on the menu and look at the posters of some of the worlds best surfers then when you check in for a lesson down stairs you will know your with the best. You have an ABC store for almost everything else. There is a Starbucks as well. If you can surf or fancy ago at surfing you have the Hans Hedemann Surf School on your door step as well. This surf school is the best in Waikiki if not the world. If you book a lesson with these guys you will be stand up surfing and having fun they care about teaching you to surf. If you can surf already hire a board have a chat with the staff and they will direct you to the best sports of the day.All in all I'm wondering if I should be writing this review as i love it here and don't want it to get to popular and not be able to get my room in future.
