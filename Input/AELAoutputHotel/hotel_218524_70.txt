{"text":"Fantastic! We stayed at EPC Nov.18-25, and loved every minute of it! The weather was not great, it rained all day one day, and on\/off another. There was also a lot of cloudy windy days. We actually didin't miss it that much. The spa is awesome! We had a hot stone massage, and a couple's massage. Both were wonderful. The couple's massage, they give you a chilling bottle of champagne and chocolates after. It was so nice. My husband also got his scuba diving certification there. The team at the dive shop was great. Reggie was his instructor, and was fantastic. Our room was great. We had room 4102, right at the cascade pool. It is one of the few rooms with a semi-private balcony, as there is trees in front, so we felt we had some privacy.We had no ants, or bugs, mini-bar and snacks were filled daily, but we did leave him a tip every day. We also asked for a bottle of smirnoff and some clamato juice in our room, as I don't like beer. We gave him a couple of bucks, and he brought it, no problem.We saw a few of the shows. The circus show was amazing. I haven't been to an all-inclusive yet that put on a show like that . The only problem I found was the lounge chairs. It woun't be so bad, if people didn't reserve them, and then not use them all day. I was at one resort(can't remember which one) that if you didn't use your chair for two hours, you lost it. This should be done everywhere, so everyone gets a chair. People had towels on chairs all day, and never used them once!Overall, we loved this resort. For couples,it's a perfect romantic getaway. We'll be back!
