{"text":"Luxury and Elegance in Kenmore Square! As I often receive VIPs from across the country and worldwide, I want their first impression of me to be positive. The major academic center nearby - for which I work - attracts some of the most demanding physician-scientists who are accustomed to having things their way. At the Hotel Commonwealth, that prescription is filled perfectly. Since Fenway Park is a scant two blocks away, I had worried that the venue itself would be inappropriate for our clientele. I questioned whether the rooms themselves would be noisy, the streets would be overrun with zealous fans, and whether the ambiance of the adjoining outdoor cafe would be ruined by foot traffic. So I stayed there on a Friday night to test the waters. Whatever perceptions I had originally were quickly cast aside by the incredible service and amenities offered by the first class staff. Check-in was efficient and professional, and we were wisked up to the room on an upper floor, as I had requested. Opening the doors everything was fresh and clean smelling, with wonderful French accoutrements throughout. Details: start with the oversized tub in the bathroom, continue to the Frette towels and bathrobes, and toiletries from a famous French line. Having stayed at other luxury properties I will say that nothing was skimpy in comparison. The beds were some of the most comfortable I've slept in, with luxury sheets caressing my skin while the pillowtop mattress welcomed my weary body. I may have snored I slept so soundly - without any noise from other rooms nor from the street traffic below. The state of the art phones would appeal to techies; as would the flat screen TV and wireless internet access. But I digress: in between check-in and tucking myself in, dinner at the attached restaurant was mouthwatering. Great Bay has received great reviews locally but had not been subjected to this admitted food snob's discernment. I will review this separately, but one word describes my feeling: KUDOS! Ditto for the food and owner-operated (as in on the floor) East Standard, located on the opposite side of the building, which raises the bar. Do you adore Paris? The only Boston spot where you can relax in the true Parisian style (heated year-round outdoor patio) is attached to this hotel. Somehow the awnings made one feel like a voyeur, separated from the masses. In a nutshell -- go there to be pampered like royalty! It really ranks in the top five Boston luxury properties.
