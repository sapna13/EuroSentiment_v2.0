{"text":"Very enjoyable  My wife and I stayed at the Casci Hotel , Florence for eight nights and found the hotel to be our favorite of all we stayed in during our three-week visit to Italy (Rome, Florence, Siena  Lucca). The staff was very friendly and helpful to us in arranging our visit. We had not traveled to Europe in 20 years (children, college, mortgage, our elder parents, etc) so we were more than a little nervous in making all of our arrangements via the Internet. Our correspondence with them was very responsive and warmly worded, with every assurance that all our needs would be taken care of with their assistance. When we arrived and some needs arose, the staff was extremely helpful and kind, with everything working out well for us. For example: advance reservation tickets to galleries, send-out laundry service, luggage storage while we took a few days away to visit nearby cities, each adding to our enjoyment of our trip. The rooms were quiet at night (some daytime construction noise next-door), very clean and pleasant, comfortable with private bathroom ( with full bath tub\/shower ).The breakfast buffet had a large variety of warm and cold choices, including healthy and filling, for an active day of walking and touring the city. Breakfast choices included juice, fresh, warm hard-boiled eggs , yogurt, and fresh fruit, hot and cold cereals, some tasty treats and, of course, tea, hot coffee and cappuccino. We appreciated the attractive breakfast room, and the chance to share tips with other travelers\/guests seated near. There was also an adjoining area to relax, get coffee or tea at any time, access e-mail, and get advice from the desk. Management was always very kind, helpful, happy to suggest some favorite walks, restaurants, etc.The hotel is centrally located, one and a half blocks from Duomo, making walking the city, the galleries, churches, plazas, and vistas very accessible. We felt safe, comfortable walking day and night from our hotel through the area, down to the river, and across to the palace. We had a wonderful visit to Florence, and appreciate the very considerate and helpful family management at the Casci Hotel.
