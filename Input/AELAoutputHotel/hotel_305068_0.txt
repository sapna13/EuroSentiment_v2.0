{"text":"The reviews don't lie - worthy of its #1 spot on Trip Advisor We booked this hotel because of its rating on Trip Advisor. We were a little nervous about this as our first choice had been to stay on HK Island at the Four Seasons or Mandarin Oriental. However it did not disappoint. Admittedly, at first we liked the hotel well enough but were not raving about it like the Trip Advisor reviewers. However over the course of the next 2 days it really grew on us. You cannot but help being charmed by the amazing sevice and attentiveness of the staff: * Always greeting you, calling the lift for you, anticipating your every need at meal times * Checking when you would like your room cleaned * Finding and returning the scarf I did not even realize I had lost * Concierge gives great advice and could not be more helpful - booking tickets to Macau, organising a private tour of the island * Room service is FAST and good quality - our early morning tea order arrived in less than 10 minutes * AMAZING food - fantastic buffet for breakfast and dinner and the most delicious, healthy spirulina juices every morning. Fantastic presentation of all the food and a huge variety of deserts, cakes and pastries at every meal* Fantastic lobby service - worth having tea or early evening drinks here* An added bonus for UK travellers - a direct English Sky News feed and English newspapers* The managers are very visible in looking after the guests and the staff and the fact everyone seems so happy to work here makes your stay even betterBasically, you just can't help but fall in love with the place and the excellent staff. It grows on you the longer your stay.
