{"text":"Superb Holiday Having just returned from this hotel I thought I would help settle peoples nerves.After reading bad reviews about this hotel our group were a little worried about what it was going to be like... There is no need to worry.We had very quick transfer to the Hotel there was only our group so no other stops on the way... GREAT!On arrival Staff welcomed us, took our cases and we made our way to check in. We were given our keys and also given a cocktail with RUM in LOVELY!!On our first day we had a storm. So we just sat around and had a few drinks. Our rooms were cleaned every day and we were given fresh towels. We left a tip for the maids in a beer can and we were given a six pack of beer instead of the usual 2 cans, so if you wan more beers you know what to do!The food was gorgreous there was a different theme each night of the week in the main buffet, and the al la carte's were all very VERY tasty. The only fault we could make was that we had to wait a long time at the Tex Mex... Maybe we are just greedy.All the drinks were lovely, you could get pretty much anything you want. The beach bar was great at a night time and it was open 24 hrs if you felt like staying up late.But the best bit was the adult only pool... Apart from a couple of kids now and again (who were always cleared out of the pool) it was heaven. Lots of peace and quite. A jacuzzi. Waiter service from Nikolas... give him some tips as he works hard.All in all I had a brilliant holiday. ","annotations":[]}
