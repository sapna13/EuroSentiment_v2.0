{"text":"Great hotel ! We spend a split stay of 5 days of our trip Downunder here and booked this BB through their website.This BB takes you back to the victorian era, but with the nowadays comfort ! The staff is superfriendly (we could leave part of our luggage here without any charges when we left for the red center) and is more than willing to help in any way they can. As we stayed 5 nights, we got a free upgrade to a bouquet room, which was very nice. The room was on the top floor (please note that there is no elevator, so people who have difficulty using stairs should ask for a room on the ground level) and although not extremely spacious, was very cosy and clean. The bathroom was small (with only shower), but as you don't tend to spend much time in your hotelroom in Sydney, this was perfect!The continental breakfast is not very elaborate, but you can eat as much as you want and it is well taken care of. The breakfast patio is an oasis of peace in the city.From the BB is a 30 minutes walk through the harbour to the Syndey Opera House and the famous Harbour Bridge. The King's Cross City Rail station is at 5 minutes from the hotel and each half hour there is a shuttle bus to the Airport (domestic and international ,price per person 12 AUD).In the neighborhood of the hotel are a lot of places to eat, from cheap take away to very upmarket trendy restaurants.If we would go back to Sydney, we would certainly want to stay here again.
