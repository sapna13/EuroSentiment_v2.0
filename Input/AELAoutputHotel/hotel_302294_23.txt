{"text":"Great stay, great hotel, great service !!!!! Recently we had the pleasure of staying at this great hotel and really enjoyed our stay there. After reading previous trip advisor comments on this hotel I upgraded and went with the executive business room and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ look back. From when we arrived we were treated like we were the only people in the hotel and felt really welcomed. Not one hotel staff member walked past us without greeting us.Check In √à√\u2020\u2022?we arrived on an overnight flight and were in the lobby by 8am. As I knew this would happen I had previously arranged to just drop off our bags and had also organised a refreshing room to have a shower etc. However neither of these was needed and they kindly let us check in early which was very nice of them. Check in was personalised and we were shown to our room.Room √à√\u2020\u2022?was excellent. We were on level 27 and had a great view. They also upgraded us from a city view executive room to a harbour \/ city view with a balcony which was excellent. Room was great, separate shower and bath, good toiletries. There are slippers and gowns provided and fruits, mars bars and really really yummy chocolates also. Big flat screen TV, remote controlled sun shade and blinds. Room was very well set out with good use of space and very clean. Free internet was definitely a bonus. Very quiet.Breakfasts √à√\u2020\u2022?because we were on the executive room rate we were able to choose from 3 different places for breakfast, although we only tried 2. Both were excellent, lots of choice and great service. Plates were always taken very efficiently  the service was always good and efficient. In the global kitchen and the executive level breakfast area there was an egg station for you to choose whatever you liked.Pool \/ gym √à√\u2020\u2022?lovely place to hang out. My husband went to the gym and said it was very clean and had a great range of equipment which all looked new. He even went in a pair of thongs one day and they kindly gave him some shoes to wear whilst there from a safety point of view, which was very nice, they could√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe just asked him to go get his shoes. Pool service was great √à√\u2020\u2022?as soon as we sat down someone came over with some cold water which was good on such hot steamy days. Location √à√\u2020\u2022?we found the location to be quite good, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think we were too far from anything. The convention centre and shops is a short walk away as is the waterfront. The duck and hippo tours start from the convention centre so you could always catch the bus up to Orchid Road or Chinatown or wherever. Executive Floor (Berang Suite ?) √à√\u2020\u2022?this became our home in the hotel too, we loved it there. I highly recommend splurging and getting the executive rooms and having this included in your package. Drinks and breakfast all day long, who can resist that. With all the food we hardly spent anything during our stay. Food was great, drinks were great, service was outstanding. Particular mention goes to Dennis who was a great asset to their hotel. Overall we had a great time at the Pan Pacific. They even sent up a cake and chocolates for my husband√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ birthday which he loved. I recommend this hotel highly. Go online to their website and fill in a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020uest preference form√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?just a few questions about your preferences so they can accommodate your likes. I found this very helpful. Make sure you let them know of any special occasions. Definitely a 5 out of 5 experience. Would stay there again and would recommend for others. Our stay was the week after the Grand Prix, which I knew at the time of booking. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ experience any issues with regard to this.We'll be back !!!!!
