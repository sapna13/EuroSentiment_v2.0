{"text":"Great Hotel in a Convenient Location We stayed at this hotel from May 2 - 8, 2007. We enjoyed our stay very much. We booked a superior room through Travelocity (with an airfare package) for about 175 Euros (225 dollars) per night. For a 5th floor balcony room (503) with a full view of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris right next to a Metro stop and an Air France express bus, it is a steal! Our room was OK size for Europe, with two twin beds pushed together. (Hard foam mattresses that we liked, although the linens were very cheap feeling\/scratchy -- definitely not the Westin Heavenly Bed!) Very nice marble bathroom with a tub\/shower with very powerful water pressure. To get a good feel for the superior rooms in comparison to the regular rooms, go to the hotel's website -- they show them both. A great thing about this hotel is that the front desk staff and the concierge speak English. Before we left for Paris, we heard that everyone speaks English. We can tell you that this is nonsense. Everybody speaks English there like everybody speaks French in the United States. So having hotel staff that can get you pointed in the right direction when you arrive was very helpful. So the rooms are nice; the front desk staff are great; the lobby is cute (although smoking is allowed there); the maid service was exceptional; and it has an in-house restaurant for breakfast and dinner (it seemed vacant most of the time). We cannot comment on the food because we didn't eat there. However, we can tell you that the breakfast is 22 Euros (which based on the current exchange rate is about 29 dollars). Who needs a $29 breakfast? We ate the best baguettes\/coissants we have ever had and a cup of coffee for breakfast like the locals for about 2 Euros. This leads us to tell you about the hotel's location. It is about perfect. It is surrounded by a hundred nearby restaurants of every type and plenty of convenience stores for snacks, beverages, toiletries, etc. Also, we found the French people to be courteous, friendly, helpful -- simply wonderful. Everywhere we went there were proud Parisians anxious to share their beautiful city. We felt honored to be among them all. One sidebar on the hotel reservation process to tell you about: We paid for a superior room and confirmed a high floor with a view of the Arc de Triomphe by email and by telephone. But when we arrived, they assigned us to a 1st floor room with a view of nothing. If you pay for the superior room upgrade, stand your ground like we did and we think you will find the staff willing to accomodate you appropriately -- they accomodated our request with little fuss. All in all, it is a very nice little city hotel in a great, safe, residential and commercial neighborhood near one of the city's greatest monuments. We highly recommend it and would stay there again (although maybe not at the current Superior room rack rate of 300 Euros!)
