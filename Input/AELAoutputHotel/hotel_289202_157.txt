{"text":"Excellent service Wonderful place. Add kind and patient to the glowing reports for front desk personnel. Here is some extra info:1. Booked 3 superior rooms 5 months in advance via hotel website and expedia for pre-cruise stay. Our rooms on the 2nd. 3rd and 4th floors appeared exactly as shown on website. Very firm beds. Adequate size for us. Anyone over 6'2 and 300 lbs might find the superior rooms a tad small. Walls are padded to reduce noise. There is a lift. Guests may use one computer in lobby for free internet access. TV has English language news channel.2. Breakfast is included with room rate if booked via website but cost 5 euros ( a bargain) if booked on expedia. Ask server to make you a cappucino (no extra cost) or use the coffee machine.3. Arrived via blue bus from Marco Polo airport to Piazzale Roma (bus terminal) in the pouring rain. Bus terminal is an open-air bus stop, not a building. Cheap plastic rain ponchos are assets during the rainy season. 4. To get to hotel by foot from Piazzale Roma, look for the white stone bridge or the green metal bridge directly in front of the terminal exit. The exit is lined with small souvenir shops. There is a public WC. The bridges cross the Rio Nuovo (small canal) and consists of about 40 to 50 steps (no ramp). Once you cross either bridge, the Grand Canal will be on your left hand side (you can't miss it). Keep walking along the Grand Canal. The hotel will be straight ahead. You need to cross another small bridge (about 30 steps) before reaching the hotel. The walk takes about 10 minutes, depending on how well you drag your cases over the bridges. We had 3 elderly travellers who were able to negotiate the step bridges with their cases with assistance.4. To get to hotel by vaporetto (public water bus) or water taxi: wouldn't recommend vaporetto. Too crowded. Water taxi stand is just steps from the terminal exit, along the Rio Nuovo, and takes you to a landing right in front of the hotel. Costly but worth it if you have mobility problems and lots of luggage.5. To get to the cruise port: there are two cruise ship ports. find out which one you need. Ask front desk about sharing water taxi to the port. Elderly members of our group rebelled against walking back to Piazzale Roma to catch free port shuttle. Shared taxi fare with 7 passengers- total cost of 110 euros (about 16 euros per person) to Stazione Marittima. We were met at the port's water taxi landing by cruise staff who efficiently handled our cases.
