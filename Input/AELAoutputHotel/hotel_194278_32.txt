{"text":"Perfect location and close to nutella-filled crepes too! I just returned yesterday from a 6 day trip to Paris with my girlfriends and we could not have been happier with the Hotel Artus. No review would be complete without acknowledging and thanking Sanjay for being the perfect host, travel guide and smiling face after returning from a long day of sightseeing (and shopping, boy did we do a lot of shopping). There were four of us total so we had 2 per room (Room 101 and 111). We were told that Room 101 was the largest in the hotel and it was very big compared to what one normally gets in Europe. The bed was comfortable with nice linens (though no top sheet which might just be European but sort of plays on my yuck factor) and the bathroom was huge. The weird thing about the shower in Room 101 is that there is no shower door, curtain, pane of glass - nada. So, with a rain-type shower head you basically get water everywhere but we made do and covered the floor in towels which was fine. There is a small armoire which was plenty big enough for two of us and a small desk and flat screen TV. The hotel was not very noisy (aside from a small child screaming for apricot juice at an early hour) and we slept great even though we were on the street level. Room 111 was very similar to ours although their shower had a half a pane of glass which probably helped with splashing! The lobby is very modern with comfy couches and cool artwork and though we never made it downstairs for breakfast (why eat in the hotel when there are tons of great cafes right around the corner and a crepe stand 2 blocks away on St. Germain Blvd - did I mention the crepe stand yet? It's right outside St. Germain church and is truly a divine experience.) You can't beat the hotel for location as it's super close to the metro but I must say we pretty much walked everywhere as the city is very walkable and you get to see more (especially when the gay pride parade is going on which I highly recommend for a unique Parisian experience - it rivals NYC and Washington DC for sure! Great fun!). Anyway, I am pretty picky about my hotels and typically try to stay in 4\/5 stars in the US and prefer hotels like the W, Ritz and Four Seasons (when I can get a good deal) and this hotel, while not Ritz-level, has the vibe of a W with the hospitality of a cozy bed and breakfast. It was so nice to be able to stop for drinks at the end of the day at Cafe Mabillon or Chai and just pop back into the room to change or drop off bags. There are plenty of great restaurants and we had an amazing pre-departure Italian meal at Del Papa which is only 2 doors from the Artus. Don't miss the spaghetti bolognese or carbonara and frankly it's a nice change from jambon and fromage! There is plenty of shopping right around the hotel and lots of art galleries for window shopping. We felt very very safe in the area and the cafes were hopping until 2am and on though we never heard much if any street noise. We searched and searched in an attempt to find the right hotel in Paris and we did not go wrong with the Artus. It's Fodor's rated which made us feel a little more secure but trust us, you'll be very happy here. Ask Sanjay about where to go, where to eat, or even for a car to get you back to the airport at 6am (that held lots of bags filled with sale month goodies!) and you will not be disappointed. He's just the best as we can't say enough good things about him. Try restaurant Entrecote and Cafe Visconti for dinner in the neighborhood too. There's also great gelato right around the corner and a crepe stand. Did we mention the crepe stand?! I think my thighs now look like nutella-filled crepes after this trip but boy was it worth it. Bon voyage!
