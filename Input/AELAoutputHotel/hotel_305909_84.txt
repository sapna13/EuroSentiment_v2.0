{"text":"A 4-Plus Star Hotel Just got back from an eight-night stay at the Royal Plaza in Hong Kong, we paid for an upgrade to the executive floor during check in and it was well worth the extra cost (wireless internet at the executive lounge, breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail drinks daily) plus being on the top floor with city view (don't even book here if you definitely want harbour view rooms - where it is located, it's mission impossible).You get an above 4-star hotel for a 3-star price (in fact I'd say even 3-star hotels in Hong Kong may cost more at times). We got a pretty spacious room and really good service. Staff members speak decent English (though in my case even if they didn't, it wouldn't have been a problem because I spent a few years in Hong Kong thus able to speak Cantonese), would go out of their way to assist you in whatever way possible. I won't say it's a 5-star hotel as it clearly can't compete with some of the 5-stars in Tsim Sha Tsui or Central. For the price point, its location, quality of the room and services though, I wouldn't mind staying here again. Those of you who want to stay in the touristy areas, Mong Kok (the neighbourhood where this hotel is) may not be your cup of tea, but if you truly want to experience real, local Hong Kong lifestyle this could be something you may wish to consider.I would recommend this hotel to business travellers as well (especially those needing to visit mainland China - you can take the train all the way to the border town of Lo Wu in less than an hour), Hong Kong has one of the best public transportation network I've ever seen anywhere in the world. All you need is an Octopus Card (you can get one from the Tourist Information Centre after exiting from the Arrival Hall at the airport) or at various ticketing outlets.One minor downside with this hotel is that there is no wireless access (at all) in the room and even after purchasing the executive package you will need to pay extra for in-room wired internet access. It didn't bother me too much as I wasn't there to stay in the room to net-surf hours on end while the hours the executive floor remained open were sufficient for doing what I needed.
