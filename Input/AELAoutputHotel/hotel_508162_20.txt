{"text":"Amazing Vacation We travelled to this property in April 2008. This was the most amazing vacation ever. I was worried about some of the reviews that I read, but I did see some of the people there who write those types or reviews, and there is NO pleasing them. They complain about absolutely everything. And if you are one of those people, do yourself a favor, as well as everyone else (as no one wants to hear you complaining the entire trip), and stay home! If you are not one of those people, then you will likely love it!The property was absolutely beautiful. Everything was well maintained, and there was always workers out and about, cleaning everything in site. The only thing that went wrong was our room was not ready when we arrived (which was fine, we arrived before check in). But once we did get our room key, and got to the room, it still had not been cleaned up. We called the front desk, and they offered a different room (with double beds) or we could stay in the one that was not cleaned yet (king bed) and they would send the maid right away. We decided to keep our room, the maids were there in about 2 minutes, and cleaned our room up very quickly. So no big deal! The beach was gorgeous, and although it does not have perfect white sand and light blue ocean, it was very pretty and really really warm. As I read a lot of reviews prior to leaving, we never tested the right side of the beach, we always stayed on the left, and it was always clean, no rocks or algae, or anything like that. We spent most of our days by the pool or in the pool. You could always find a quiet place to swim, although the lounge chairs were sometimes full, and people would leave their towels, so you never knew if they were coming back or not (so if your going there, and dont plan on returning to your chair for awhile, just give it up...be nice...) The weather was perfect every day. Small amount of rain in the morning, but it was done by about 8am, and sunshine all day long!! Wear TONS of sunscreen though, I did, but it must have washed off, and I got FRIED.We mostly ate at the buffet, as I'm such a picky eater, there was always a lot of variety. Never had a problem getting full, thats for sure! We left the property a couple times, we went parasailing, ziplining, and also to Saona Island, and each one, I would recommend to anyone!! They were all a blast!!We would return in a heartbeat. I will definately make it back to this resort at some point in my life. Everything about it was perfect. You just have to keep an open mind, and let the small stuff go. There may be small things that go wrong, but you just have to relax, and grab another drink!!
