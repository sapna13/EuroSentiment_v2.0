{"text":"The reality exceeds the hype! Summary:The reality exceeds the hype! The Langham Place was fantastic - we rate it as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at. When and why we stayed:We stayed for 7 nights in November 2008 √à√\u2020\u2022?we were in Hong Kong for a holiday.Cost:The room was booked as part of an Air New Zealand package. Room:We stayed in a Club L room (3523) on the 35th floor of the hotel. The room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ huge but the Blissful Bed was √à√\u2020\u2022?it was also extremely comfortable. The room contained: a gigantic high definition plasma television √à√\u2020\u2022?look out for Smart Angel Tracie; a dvd player; Ipod docking station; free to use safe; and free WiFi. The bathroom had both a tub and shower cubicle. A vast array of complimentary bathroom goodies including: toothbrushes, razors and shaving cream, as well as shampoo, shower gel and bath crystals, was replenished each day. Dressing gowns and slippers were also supplied. Free bottles of water were also left each day by the professional housekeeping service. The turn down service left delicious squares of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?embossed chocolate each evening. A complimentary copy of the very-readable South China Morning Post was delivered each morning.The Hotel: The Langham Place was fantastic! We rated it as one of the best hotels we have ever stayed at (alongside Borgata in Atlantic City and Wynn Las Vegas), but it ranks even higher than even those two fine establishments for quality of customer service. From check-in to departure we were treated wonderfully, all staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, and nothing we asked for was too much trouble. I was dubious about paying extra for a Club L room with gives access to the lounge. My apprehension was misplaced - I was glad we took up the offer. The Club L lounge has great views of Hong Kong, separate check-in (brilliant after a long flight), served free drinks (coffee, wine, beer and spirits plus champagne for two hours daily). Also provided were: afternoon tea (3PM √à√\u2020\u2022?5:30PM); canap√ã√\u2022√ñs - a different selection each day (6PM √à√\u2020\u2022?8PM); and √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºweet treats√à√\u2020\u2022?(8PM √à√\u2020\u2022?10PM). This food was so good and plentiful that some evenings we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have need to go out for dinner.Location: The Langham Place is in Mong Kok, a short journey on the efficient and chief MTR subway from most of the city√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ leading tourist attractions √à√\u2020\u2022?the station is below the hotel (we found entrance\/exit E1 to be most convenient for the hotel. Mong Kok itself is a fascinating district √à√\u2020\u2022?we felt totally safe wandering its claustrophobic and crowded streets, browsing the ladies and goldfish markets, enjoying the street smells and spectacle. The city:In our opinion, Hong Kong is one of the greatest (and most crowded) cities on planet Earth. Highlights of our stay included:Happy Valley races √à√\u2020\u2022?this was a brilliant night out. We dined at the track√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Moon Koon restaurant (the set meal - over-priced at √ä√£¬¢25 a head). After our meal we watch the night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ entertainment from the public stands, which was a much-enhanced experience.The views from Victoria Peak √à√\u2020\u2022?reached by Peak Tram, which reminded us of the San Francisco cable cars √à√\u2020\u2022?the ascent is almost vertical in places. There are stunning views from the summit √à√\u2020\u2022?make sure you visit on a clear day for the best pictures.A day-trip to the nearby casino resort of Macao, reached by a fast and smooth boat journey. We visited the MGM Grand, Wynn Macao, Landmark and The Venetian, which is even bigger than the Las Vegas original and is even home to a Manchester United store. During our trip we also visited:Lots of shopping malls! At least they all had a coffee place where husbands could chill out whilst wives shopped.Stanley √à√\u2020\u2022?a seaside village on the south of Hong Kong Island √à√\u2020\u2022?reached by taking the number 6 bus √à√\u2020\u2022?beware the journey is more like a roller coaster ride.√ã?√òThe Museum of History √à√\u2020\u2022?whose eight galleries present the fascinating and interesting Hong Kong Story √à√\u2020\u2022?from geological creation to 1997√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ reunification with China.Feel free to contact me if you require further information.
