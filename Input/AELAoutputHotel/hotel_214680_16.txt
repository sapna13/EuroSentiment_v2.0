{"text":"Most enjoyable time at the Park Shore Waikiki My friend and I stayed at the Park Shore Waikiki from Friday, Nov. 14\/08 until Monday, Nov. 17\/08. This is my second trip to Honolulu. The last time I stayed in Honolulu, I got to know Leonor Wong-she is now the Director of Guest Relations at Park Shore. Having dealt with her before, I chose to stay at the Hotel she works at as I knew I'd be in good hands.  The day we arrived, we walked into a room that had fresh flowers, chocolates, and juice and water in the fridge. Leonor really takes the time to get to know her Guests as she remembered from a year and half ago when I stayed with her at Ocean Tower that I don't drink Champagne-so that's why she had juice for us instead.  The next day, she brought us up a breakfast coupon for 'Lulu's' which is the restaurant\/bar conveniently located on the second floor of the hotel. If you choose to stay at Park Shore, you can ask for coupons for Lulu's at the Front Desk; it's a buy one breakfast and get the second 50% off. The prices at Lulu's are pretty affordable and they stay open late until 2:00am!  That same day, Leonor called us up and asked if we'd like to move up to an ocean-view room. We were in a standard room at the time which we had no complaints about-it had a balcony and two double beds but how could we pass up the opportunity to move to an ocean-view? So, she moved us to room 921. It has an amazing view!!! Our balcony overlooked the pool and had an incredible view of the beach. We got some amazing shots of the sunset from our balcony as well :)  The rooms are clean, the beds are comfortable and (something that's important to me personally-the water pressure in the shower is awesome!) I can't stand it when it takes so long to get the shampoo and conditioner out of your hair. Location wise, it's right across the street from the beach. Within the plaza-there's a Starbucks right outside and a Subway also. It's close to all the shopping on the strip and a 15 minute walk to Diamond Head. I would recommend this hotel to those Guests who are interested in affordable prices, decent\/clean rooms, ideal location and for those who appreciate genuinely friendly staff who provide exceptional hospitality-from the cleaning staff to the manager, Terry Dowsett. To each is their own but we're not high maintenance and what brings me back to a place is their service-in my opinion, it's what matters most! **Friendly Tip** If you're going to the beach, stop by the bell desk and ask to borrow a mat for the day instead of buying one! P.S. The weather network said cloudy with showers for the weekend and we had Sun our whole stay!!!
