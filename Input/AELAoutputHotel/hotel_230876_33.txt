{"text":"fantastic the di ann is only about a 10 min walk from the train station, but there are many trams that go right past the station and will drop right outside, when we arrived nothing will pre-pare you for the stairs but this is traditional in these old buildings! when we reached the reception the staff where very happy and inviting, we checked in, (note: 20 euro is to be paid on arrival which is given back to you at the end of your stay, this is a deposit for your room key and remote control for you tv in room) the lady at reception gave us some guides to amsterdam and also a map which came in really handy!! :) the staff there also offered to carry our bags to our room for us. When we arrived in our room, we where pleasently surprised by how clean and bright it was, we had a lovely balcony which over looked the canal and the streets outside with french doors opening in wards, although the room was a little small it had everything we needed and the bath room was very clean with fresh towels and soap everyday!! we really enjoyed our stay at the Di Ann hotel, and the cleaning staff where exceptional with the room sparkling clean every evening when we returned, with fresh bed linen. We have never stayed in a 2 star hotel before, always choosing to stay in at least a 4 star, but i would definatly recomend this hotel to anyone and we will definatly be going back again :) the location was fantastic the people where so friendly and we really had a fantastic time. tips: if your looking for local places to eat and little shops to buy provisions i would recomend the italian on the corner, which makes fantastic pizzas, also the little shop next door which has really frienly staff and about anything you want! these are all to the right of the Di Ann when come out the door.
