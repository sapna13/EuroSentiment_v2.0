{"text":"Nice, But Not the Best We stayed in a Premier Suite for 5 days in January.We booked the hotel's Limo service for airport arrival and were picked up by the airport's indoor transportation (electric vehicle) as soon as we stepped foot off the plane, then were transported to luggage, then to the car that was waiting for us. We entered the hotel doors and were greeted by name by the hotel doormen, which was a nice first impression. Check-in took a while even though we were the only people checking in. The suite was nice, plenty of room, but a little tired. It could use a facelift. Great views though, and a comfortable bed. The service was good and staff were friendly, but not over the top.Breakfast had a nice variety, but the poor egg chef did not have a clue what he was doing. We ordered a hard-boiled egg, 3 times, and it came back soft and runny all 3 times, so we gave up. The other eggs\/omelettes we ordered were not very good either. Otherwise, the breakfast was ok, but not great. We've traveled to Singapore several times and usually stay in the Orchard Rd\/Scotts Rd area and thought we would try a different location for a change. We definitely prefer the Orchard\/Scotts area. The shopping in Orchard Rd is better than the shopping in the Marina\/Ritz Millenia area. (But this will depend on what you what you are shopping for. High end brands are in Orchard.)We stayed in the Grand Hyatt, Orchard Rd, before the Ritz and we prefer the Hyatt. The rooms at the Hyatt seem newer and fresher, the food is better, and the Hyatt location is convenient.We enjoyed our stay at the Ritz, but unfortunately the hotel fell just short of our expectations.
