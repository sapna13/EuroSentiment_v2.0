{"text":"Great with caveats My wife and I are on day four of a six day stay here at the Grand Hyatt. Over-all I agree with all the reviews so far. I do have some comments to add however.Room service, while fast, is of very mediocre quality and expensive. The breakfast buffet is very good but has exactly the same items every day. No variation whatsoever. Here are some examples of room service prices. Subtract 35% for USD. Add in about 30% in taxes and fees.Continental breakfast: S$28 (~US$17)American breakfast S$38Breakfast buffet: S$35 ($48 with taxes and fees)Hamburger:  fries: S$25 (tasted good but was VERY undercooked, basically raw even though I asked for well done)Ham and cheese ciabiatta: S$22 (terrible sandwich, avoid)Australian rib-eye steak: S$98Tuna filet: S$35Side dishes: S$11 √à√\u2020\u2022?S$13Bowl of penne (no meat): S$27Soda (can): S$8We had some laundry done. The prices are about S$12 per item. Our five items cost $60. Dry cleaning runs from S$12 to S$25 a piece. If they pick up by 10:00 am they have it back by 6:00 the same day. Add 50% for rush items.The pillows are hard and thick. If this is an issue for you, they say they have additional pillows of different types available.The internet connection is fairly fast but somewhat unstable. It costs S$25 a day.When you check in be sure to ask for a room away from the construction next door which is VERY noisy. The work starts early in the morning and runs into early evening.The location is awesome but you pay a price. Literally. Everything is expensive. For example, lunch that cost us S$60 would cost S$12 not six blocks away from the Orchard area. Over all we love the area and the hotel is great as long as you can afford the exorbitant markup on everything.
