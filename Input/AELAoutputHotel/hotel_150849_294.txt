{"text":"FANTASTIC Beaches My husband  I stayed at the Bambu Oct 1-8, 2006. I have to say the beach is the best I have ever seen. We called it Paradise.The room: Was OK, but thought the bathroom was too small. Pillows thin and sheets worn. My husband likes the room cold at night to sleep and they have no blankets, so I froze. Fridge was kept well stocked. Room was VERY clean, which impressed us. Food: From my experience with all-inclusive you do not get the best meals. Great fruit selection and even if you are a picky eater there was something to eat. Breakfast was my favorite.Pool: They have two pools, one was shaped like a doughnut and the other was the large pool with the swim-up bar. The pool with the swim-up bar was always crowded and noisy, all of the activities was done at that pool. We stuck to the smaller pool.Beach: I have to say the beach is the reason you go to Punta Cana. Simply beautiful. That is where we spent most of our time. This is for the Americans out there. You are going to a foreign country, where there is a language barier. Most of the vacationers are from Europe and do not speak English. While at the airport on the way home, so many people were complaining about no one speaking English at their resort. HELLO, if you want English speaking only resorts go to Florida!!! I now know why we are called the Ugly Americans. We truly enjoyed our stay at the Bambu  hope to return next year.
