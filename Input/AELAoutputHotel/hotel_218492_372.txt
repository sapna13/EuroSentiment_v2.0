{"text":"Love the People March \/April 2006 the Punta Cana Grand 4-4.5 star resort. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know where to begin √à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?.this trip did wonders for me, I needed to get away. I was unsure about going and I did not want to pay the amount that I paid but apparently upon my return I got a really good deal and I CERTAINLY got my money $$$ worth. O yeah we went back again in JUnE2006. There are two things that I express to my friends before going on this trip. I NEED to be in a nice hotel and have GOOD FOOD! THE GROUNDS √à√\u2020\u2022?talk about clean!!!! When you see people raking the beaches and wiping the garbage cans. BEACH- AMAZING I loved it. The white sand was soft on your feet you could hardly feel that you were walking on sand. ACCOMODATION- The room was spacious exactly what is in the travel brochures. The room was clean and was clean daily. The beds we made daily and fridge stock daily even thought we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use anything in the fridge. FOOD- Man, Man the food was AMAZING. Words CAN NOT express how good the food was. Put it this was I put on 6 pounds so what does that tell you , I ate 2 plates at the time because I was not sure we would gte to try it again . There buffet change themes everyday and there were some different food so I have to eat everything at the same time. Breakfast was the one meal take pride in when I am at home but the breakfast at home does not compare. We would go out to the club and get home at 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning and breakfast is served until 10:30 and we would set the alarm for 10:00 rushing to shower and get dress just to get breakfast. We look forward to lunch (our Dominican Markham Station - only if your from Scarborough\/Toronto, Ontario you know about Markham Station) and dinner. I have to say I haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eaten 3 meals a day since I have been on my own for the last 9 years so you must know that this was like heaven LOL.  STAFF- was courteous and polite. It was hard to communicate with housekeeping but I I stuck with √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u2022la√à√\u2020\u2022?that works. They were friendly made you feel like you at home. Victor in the Di Mario√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ A La Carte, Oswaldo and Humberto from the Tex Mex American Grille are our new friends. Front desk staff Siris - o my we gave them a hard time in a loving way but they were so accommodating. Paco was great he got us what we wanted. The Bell Guys √à√\u2020\u2022?Mr. Baseball Some other front desk we so by the book but I guest they are really doing there job but hey you just have to find they right person and at the en of the day it is who you know. And of coure the head Honshu herself KAREN √à√\u2020\u2022?you are the best and we miss you. POOL- Clean - had so much fun. I was looking forward to being on the bridge from when I saw it in the travel brochures. Love the swim up bar the staff at the bar was great.
