{"text":"We loved The Pulitzer. My wife and I have just returned from a very relaxed break in Amsterdam having stayed at The Pulitzer for three nights.Reading some of the most recent reviews I wondered if the authors had stayed in the same hotel as we had.The hotel was first class. It was our 25th Wedding Anniversary and we had a very nice room overlooking the canal. The room was very clean and we were provided with robes, slippers etc which all contributed to our comfort.On our first evening the duty manager telephoned to ask if everything was to our satisfaction, which it was. After long days of sightseeing the room was a liittle oasis of comfort to return to. The hotel is a series of old canal houses joined together so obviously it does not have some of the features of a newly built hotel. However this all adds to it's charm and the public areas and passageways adjoining the restaurant,bar etc are all bright and airy. During our 3 days spent there staff were constantly cleaning and hoovering these areas.I was astounded by a previous reviewers criticism of the breakfast service. We can only say it was first class and relaxed.Lambert, who seemed to be the senior waiter, could not have been more helpful and always found time for a little chat with us no matter how busy he was. We were always seated immediately upon arrival , as were all other guests whom we encountered.The choiceand quality of food was first class.An example being freshly squeezed orange juice, cereals,breads etc. Smoked salmon, various types of cold meat and cheeses. Hot breakfast consisting of scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, mushrooms etc. We found everyone from the porters, check-in staff, conscierge, cleaners etc to be efficient and friendly.Whilst the hotel is pricey it is worth paying for that extra comfort and attention and we would certainly stay there again.
