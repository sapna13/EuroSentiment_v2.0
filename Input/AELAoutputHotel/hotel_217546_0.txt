{"text":"Very Disappointing Nice people, clean and attractive hotel, yes. But for me, a number of problems far outweighed those factors. Most serious of which was that, due to severe mobility problems, I had requested a handicapped accessible room. It turned out to be located at the far end of a corridor and a great distance from the elevators. Hence after a very long, very painful walk, I was essentially trapped in the room until checkout. It was simply too daunting a prospect to even try visiting the restaurant or other facilities.Usually, special needs accommodations are situated quite close to elevators\/lifts, for what should be obvious reasons. So, it was a shock to be informed that if I needed that proximity, it was up to me to have requested it at the time of booking. Never in my experience in any hotel had I encountered such a situation.Also, while less serious, there were other problems. First of all, although I'd specifically asked for and was promised a mini-fridge at a slight additional charge, none was provided. Then there was the free internet service which, on several attempts to get my my laptop going, kept coming up as having little or no connectivity. Actually, it was none.Finally, Foster's Restaurant, located within the hotel and from which Room Service originates, was closed for lunch until the 6th of January, in observance of the Holidays. Guests wishing to have lunch had to either leave the hotel for a restaurant or find one which would deliver. Also, the menu was strictly of the meat or seafood variety; any other types of dishes, including vegetarian, had to be special ordered.In sum, I do not plan to stay there again and strongly advise anyone living with a disability to consider the Boston at Beacon Holiday Inn only as a very last resort.
