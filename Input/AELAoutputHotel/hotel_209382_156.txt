{"text":"Great Views We have just returned from a week at the Un Plaza and we have very few complaints. Yes it is a little bit further out than other hotels we looked at, but not far enough away that you cannot get to anything, A 10 Minute walk gets you to Grand Central Station and from there you can get anywhere you want to go. It is right opposite the UN Building and the area is very safe.We found the staff we came into contact with to be friendly and very helpful, No problems there at all. The room itself was a fairly good size, the bathroom might possibly have benefited from a little modernisation, but it was clean and everything worked ok. The view from the room was fantastic, we were on the 33rd floor overlooking the East River and the Empire State Building, we slept with the curtains open so we could appreciate the view. (One hint: it didn't happen to us, but one of our friends strolled out of the bathroom to come face to face with a guy cleaning the windows, so make sure you have a towel handy!!)We didn't eat in the hotel, so can't comment on the cost or quality of the food, but there were a couple of great Deli's nearby and a very nice Italian only a couple of blocks away. Deli was also handy for buying snacks, water etc to take back to the hotel as the mini bar was very expensive!! ($6 for a small botttle of water when it only cost $1.50 for a larger bottle outside the hotel.) Thru the week there was also a guy selling Coffee, bagels etc from a stand right outside the hotel, so not far to go for morning coffee!We got a good price off the internet and were pleased with what we got for our money. If you are looking for a reasonably priced hotel with decent sized, fairly basic rooms, great views and don't mind walking then this is a good choice.
