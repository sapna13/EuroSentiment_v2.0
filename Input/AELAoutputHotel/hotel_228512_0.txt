{"text":"Clean, Modern, Safe, Great Value Stayed one night, November 8, 2008, at the Hotel AC Diplomatic prior to a mediterranean cruise. We arrived very early on Saturday and were very pleased that we were allowed to check-in without waiting. The rooms are modern and the pictures you see with other reviews are accurate as far as what you get. The bathroom was very handsome and super clean. Beautiful green marble walls and floors, and modern glass vanity with sink. Bathrobes and slippers are provided which were much appreciated. Mini-bar was nicely stocked with a couple of beers and other soft drinks, plus water. Complimentary as well which is something other hotels might consider as a way to make guests happy. There is a lovely roof deck which I recommend visiting if only to enjoy the view at sunset. There is also a pool on the roof, and a small but adequate gym. This is clearly a business hotel and I actually prefer staying in business hotels on weekends. It was very quiet throughout the building. Wasn't real pleased that the restaurant didn't open until 8:30 p.m. for dinner, but apparently that's local custom. It's also odd that you cannot order cocktails at the restaurant table, just beer and wine. The lobby bar had liquor, though. We found that true in several other restuarants in Barcelona. Is that a local law? Room service was quick and fairly priced compared to other hotels. Overall, the staff were efficient and pleasant, and spoke English very well. Communication was not a problem at all. Hassle free stay in all respects. I would definitely stay here again as it was an excellent value for the money. Booked directly on the hotel website and had a rate of 121 Euros plus 7 percent VAT. Not bad at all for being in an excellent and safe location. Recommended without hesitation! ","annotations":[]}
