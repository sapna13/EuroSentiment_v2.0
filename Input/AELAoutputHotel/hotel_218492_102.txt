{"text":"Not 4 Star: AVOID FOOD this hotel is certainly not 4 star like thomson claim, also it is not a new build as we were led to believe. My partner was offered cocaine by one of the hotel staff which was shocking. Prepare to be hassled constantly to buy goods, as the hotel staff let outside vendors into the resorts and you will be surrounded. You MUST haggle the price, we got ripped off on our first day, spent $100 dollars on a pot, but we soon got wise to it. Our line was we're going home tomorrow, and only have this amount of money left you will not be surprised that they will accept your offer.Now the food: Avoid the burgers! We have never been so ill in our lives, and the burgers are raw! One night, i asked the cook to cut the burger in half, as i wanted it cooked, he threw his spatula down, then started yelling at me in Spanish. The staff can be very rude, especially if you are a woman. Eventually a manager came down, and got me a burger, i said i wanted it burnt, so i knew it would be not be pink, guess what? it was still raw.We booked an excursion with thomson to saona island. We were told we could trust thomson, so spent $304 for this day out. On the day, we waited 1hr 40 mins for our pick up, only then to receive a phone call to say we would not be picked up as we were too far away. We got our money back the next day, but the Thomson rep, was not very helpful, was very sheepish, but that's most likely as she was trying to sell her excursions to a new set of holiday makers. My advice? Get the excursions off the fella's on the beach. We met another couple on a thompson holiday, and they bought the same excursion as us, from the beach and only paid $80. That's a big price difference, and they went on their day trip. We could only afford one excursion, and as that was canceled, we spent two weeks feeling trapped on the resort. There's a lot more negatives we experienced, and Thomson will be receiving a written complaint from my partner and I.Overall: Prepare to be disappointed as we were.I'd like to add, we have been on many Thomson holidays over the years, and this is the First time we have felt need to complain.
