{"text":"Fantastic 2 weeks My wife and I stayed at the Bahia Principe Bavaro for two weeks at the beginning of May. From the moment we arrived to the moment we departed, we were just so impressed with the hotel and its staff. On arrival, we were checked in with no fuss whatsoever, glad to be over the 8.5 hr flight. In the lobby we were given a lovely non alcoholic cool cocktail as a welcome before being driven in a 'golf buggy' to our room. After unpacking, we had time for a walk around the complex, magnificent gardens and what a fantastic beach front setting. Our first experience of the buffet dinner was gob smacking!! The choices available were amazing and probably topped 100 different dishes from starter to sweet, this is how it stayed for every meal for the duration of our stay. The meeting with the 'rep' the next morning was a must, he explained everything that was available to us including visits and excursions. You could book them there and then, or go away and think about it and book them at a later time. Days were spent alternating between the pools with their swim up bars and the beach with a great beach bar where everything all inclusive is available from 1000.  The weather was great throughout with only 1 afternoon of rain.We went on the Monster Truck Safari day out, a must if you want to see the real D.P. At about √ä√£¬¢40 per head, it was good value for money, included lunch and all you could drink on the lorry all day - yes!! they had a bar and barman onboard too. Our other excursion was the morning spent swimming with the sharks and rays, this was also fantastic, but could have been a little longer for the price we thought. Get an underwater camera for this one, you wont believe the siaze of the sharks just feet beneath you. Going back to the hotel, the evenings were ok, but the entertainment was a little mundane. They tried to put a show on every night of dancing etc but it was much the same each evening. We just enjoyed going to the lobby cocktail bar where we never waited ever to be served and always had a glass in our hand. Elizabethythe waitress hovered around in the background and was there as soon as she saw you down your last mouthfull for a refill. The rooms were immaculate, cleaned each day with fresh sheets on the bed every other. Towels were refreshed daily as was the mini bar. Air conditioned it was always nice and cool on returning from a day out in the hot sun. All the staff without exception always wore a smile on their faces, never tired of assisting you in every way they could. We both had upset tummys a couple of times during the two weeks, nothing down to the hotel, just too much sun, drink, food etc we think. Kids would find it quiet at this hotel, not alot to offer them although there was a kids club on the site, dont know what they got up to there. Plenty of water sport activity in the beach area, diving, windsurfing, pedlos, kayaks etc. Nightlife outside the hotel main entrance consisted of a big square with a casino, disco and lots of bars. We think the bars were part of the all inclusive ticket, not sure, didnt venture out there. The only down side of the whole holiday for us was some of the Canadian guests. They seem to like to take over the area they are in, especially the younger ones in groups. If you were looking to lie by the pool and quiettlu read a book, this is not possible if a group of Canadians are at the swim up bar, they are loud, smoke in the pool, drink heavily and at times the language is offensive. Not withstanding the last bit, we would reccommend this resort to anyone, even with the Canadian Cabaret.
