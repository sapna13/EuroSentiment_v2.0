{"text":"Oh-Boy Well.....it is closing..... We went there with an open mind, knowing it was closing and were shocked at how over-crowded with CHILDREN under 10 it was! So much for the quiet-romantic-laid back-stress-less atmosphere we were looking for.There were Good things, they just did not rise above the bad too often! Great Staff - helpful to the ends of the earth! When our taxi did not show up they brought us to our bio-bay tour in the hotel van!Food - ran out - did not have many items on the menu. Said the truck came on Wednesdays from the main island. Elegant preparation and delicious when it was all there - a little pricy though.Room - SPACIOUS!!! Comfy - not a water view as sold though - it over looked the pool. Our room had no refrigerator, our son's room had no working phone, iron and cd player. No luck in getting stuff fixed either - rooms were full, so no place to get stuff from!Pool - Filter not working. Infinity edge not working. At least 75 kids under 10 in the pool each day - not much water left by 2:00, if you know what I mean!?! Pool cloudy and dirty - had to complain to the front desk - they had pool cleaners there every morning. Kids crowded the pool bar eating pizza - dropping it in the water\/ families and friends of hotel workers received free drinks right in front of us - delivered to them in the pool by workers! Not a good scene. Pool Level rooms: Rented by one person and used by over 20. We watched the friends drive into the parking lot - unload their coolers and food - leave it all on the terrace and go back to refill their cups with booze and snacks - looked like spring break for adults! I felt horrible for the honeymooners!!!One night there were people hanging from a balcony and screaming and singing - massive birthday party going on. When we called the front desk they told us the pool was open 24\/7 and people could come and go as they pleased. We had to turn the TV up and sleep with earplugs - in July - OFF SEASON!!! The front desk said Security would calm the noise - took quite a while!Good luck to the W Hotel people! The buildings are wonderful - the bones of the hotel are great - a nice spot - but they will have to get the hotel staff under control. No one checks Hotel ID at the gate - people come in and out like it is an amusement park. We saw staff in the pool on their day off - hanging out at the bar - etc... with their friends and family - as well as locals that we had met. They come on Friday-Saturday-Sunday to use the pool!!! Unbelievable!!! And I payed for this....We thought we were going to a resort - to a calm, adult hotel. We were told the island was laid back and quiet - where we could de-stress. What we got was a hotel full of locals ushering in the end of the hotel. What we got were babies crying, children running and screaming, jumping and throwing balls, riding on their boogie boards and floaties. What we got was chased into our rooms by 2:00 daily!
