{"text":"pretentions to hipness and grandeur that fall short i stayed with colleagues for two nights at the zaza last week on business. it's totally over-rated. local colleagues, upon hearing that we were staying there, looked vaguely piteously at us. the worst thing is that the hotel thinks it's a sexy boutique, but it's not. witness the random taxidermy peacock in reception, the ugly paintings, the bar with bright over head lighting and poor acoustics.pluses:* molten brown toiletries.* comfy beds.* quiet rooms.* clean and modern.* tasty room service.* kobe beef carpaccio in the hotel restaurant.minuses:* unknowledgable concierge - he rattled out a recommendation for a restaurant for us before we even told him what kind of place we were looking for.* tacky decor - helmut newton cheapie prints abound, fake hand-written post it notes stuck on your bathroom mirror schilling the sister hotel in houston. the executive chair at the desk in your room is - vinyl? * terrible service in happening restaurant (dragonfly) - we had to negotiate for a table for 10 mins in a half-empty restaurant. the hostess tried to seat us in the cocktail area - a corner table behind the hostess stand with a plastic bench. how insulting.* no baths - not on our floor anyway, just a shower stall. why? there's lots of room.* eco lip service - you can re-use your towels to be green. but no recycling bins and no sign to re-use sheets.* no daily newpaper upon waking - there's a pile in reception.* business center - a JOKE! two terminals, one broken, painfully slow.we won't be back. it's not bad, just pretentious and a little bit sad.
