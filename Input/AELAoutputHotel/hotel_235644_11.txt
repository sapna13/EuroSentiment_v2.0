{"text":"Most majical place!! We have just returned from an eventful stay in Disneyland Paris Park and Hotel! To say the leaset!We started off our stay at the FABULOUS Disneyland Hotel and after a walk around the fantasic, majical Park with our 2 children aged 3 and 7 years we returned to the hotel to check in at 3.00 to be told we had been upgraded to the castle club WOW! The VIP service we received there was fantastic and sOOO friendly were the staff in the whole hotel! I had read reviews about the rooms being small but to me they were just as big as any other hotel room I have stayed in but more beautiful as Disney does! Also some people had written reviews about Disney being really expensive the only thing I saw that was pricey was the mini bar which you should avoid or you will pay 5.00 euro a bottle of water! Apart from that we ate in Mcdonalds as a treat for kids 25.00euro for burgers fries drinks deserts ect. for 4 which you would pay more for in Irelands McDonald's to be quite honest. Planet Hollywood great food but do request a time that morning at conceriage so you don't have to wait long , a meal there 4 main courses(2 adults, 2 children's meals) 1 beer ,1 wine which(in disney is very smallglasses of wine) and 2 deserts(children) 61 euro fine! We booked and pre-payed a food voucher before we left I would not do that again as if you don't make the booking for a specific disney resturant you will lose your money it is better to go and then see as you have SOOO much choice for food there and I thought the food was exceptional as was all of Disney! Our children actually got a virus going over and the help we had from the staff in the Disneyland Hotel was exceptional to say the least organising a doctor ,to cleaning our room whenever requested! I would not be able to fault the staff or service in this hotel at all. Thank you Disney we will be back soon and can't wait!!!!
