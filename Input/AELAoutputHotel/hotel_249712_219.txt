{"text":"Happily Surprised My husband and I recently settled on the Westin Times Sqaure, as it was the only hotel left in NYC where I could use my Starwood points. We are very glad we did. Although I've generally shunned Times Square on visits back to NYC, we had a great time. The hotel itself is well-located on 43d and Eighth Avenue, close to numerous theatres as well as Hell's Kitchen and within easy walking distance of Madison Avenue shopping. The hotel lobby was bustling but the staff efficient--as a Starwood gold member, we received a complimentary upgrade to a deluxe king corner room on the 28th floor -- absolutely fabulous room with flat screen TV, wonderful bed, iHome, and gorgeous corner room views of the city. The bathroom was great too--never wanted to get out of the double-headed shower. I can't comment on the lower rooms and street noise, but we couldn't hear a thing in our lovely room. A couple of small quibbles: the concierge was snotty and could not seem to believe we had arrived on Christmas night without a dinner reservation. We asked if she could recommend any nearby Asian food andshe told us everything was likely booked and lamely offered to call a place I'd never heard of on the upper east side (not close) that wasprobably booked. We said no thanks and walked over to Ninth Avenue (a block away!), where we found a number of Asian places serving dinner, no reservations required. The same concierge was equally snotty when we asked where to find the half-price ticket office for same day broadway tickets (on 46th between 8th and Broadway), althoughwe at least got an answer that time. Other than that, we were very happy with our beautiful room and the fun location. Recommended! ","annotations":[]}
