{"text":"A great choice if the price is right! We stayed at the Millenium over the long Thanksgiving weekend (arriving after the parade!) while visiting our daughter who lives in Brooklyn. Having previously stayed at hotels in Times Square, we opted for something different this time around. I saw a really good nightly rate online and called the hotel directly and got the same rate. I asked for a City View King room and was thrilled when I walked in to a very large room, extremely clean, the bed was so comfortable with lavish linens (lots of pillows!). We were on the 51st floor, looking directly west (over the WTC site) and out over New Jersey. We could see south to the Statue of Liberty and north up Broadway. The window in the 51st floor elevator lobby afforded a terrific view of the Brooklyn Bridge (and Brooklyn) and the river. The plasma TV on the wall was terrific, very modern desk and dresser. Comfortable chair, large closet - lots of well-placed lamps and reading lights. The bathroom was very clean with lots of counter space (hair dryer, really really nice towels and lots of them, the usual shampoo, etc.). A nice touch was that an umbrella was in the closet for our use (didn't need it) and a safe was provided as well. The lobby was nice (a bit noisy with all the comings and goings) with a lobby bar but when the bar was full, there were no other places to hang out. The concierge was great, very good recommendations. Bellmen were johnny on the spot and apologized for the delay as we were leaving that there were no cabs to be had (we were leaving during Monday rush hour) but did call one specifically for us to get us to the airport on time. We really enjoyed our stay at the Millenium and will again (if the price is right). We were slightly amused that for the price we paid we didn't get free internet (neither in the room or in the business center) while the Burger King down the street (as well as other businesses) did! Even our cheap hotel room in Eau Claire, Wisconsin offers free WiFi!! Also, while the plasma screen TV was really nice and big, the restricted number of cable channels was a disappointment. Couldn't they offer a few more movie channels (only had HBO) or the more popular cable channels? Not that we watched too much TV, but after walking all day it was nice to unwind in the lovely room. Don't hesitate to stay at the Millenium if the price is right for your budget (we paid about $300 inc. taxes per night which we thought was a bargain in NYC).
