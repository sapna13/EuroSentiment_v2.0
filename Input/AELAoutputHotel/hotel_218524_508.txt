{"text":"Fan-Freakin-Tastic! My wife and I just returned from a short four night stay at the Excellence in Punta Cana and had an absolutely fabulous time. We stayed in an ordinary garden view room and were quite pleased with the accommodations. After a lot of consideration, we decided not to go with the Excellence Club upgrade and were quite happy to have saved our few hundred bucks as we felt the service and room quality in the ordinary rooms were excellent.Not much more can be said than what has already been written in the hundreds of reviews about this place, but given the recent negative ones, I thought I would contribute nonetheless.First off, I will start with the beach. As virtually everyone says, the beach if gorgeous. It is long and wide, has many chairs, beds and palapas and has incredibly soft sand (albeit a nice brown not the white that you see in some Caribbean locations). The water is indeed rough but we found the waves quite fun to play in and not unsafe provided you didn't venture too far out off shore. Overall, I would rate the beach as one of the prettiest I have been, Laying on the sun bed and listening to the waves on the ocean was one of the highlights of our trip.As has been mentioned repeatedly in these reviews, the service at Excellence is superb. Unlike the Sandals we were at last year in the Bahamas, drink service around the pool and on the beach was great. Service at the bars and in the restaurants was very friendly and fast. Virtually every worker you met, right from the grounds people to the wait staff always seemed genuinely concerned with how things were going for you and were always quick to greet you with a cheery Hola.The nightly entertainment was a blast and very well done. We saw the Circus Act (sort of a mini Circe de soleil), the magic show, the Stars (a music and dance act) and the 70's and 80's rewind. All of the shows were simply superb and well beyond the quality we expected for a venue such as this. So long as you don't expect Las Vegas polish, you will be happy with the performances from these very talented individuals. The workout facility at the Excellence was quite good as well. The building in which it was housed was a little hot at times, but the equipment was quite new and seemed very well maintained. It was never busy the times we were there (about 8:00 in the morning).Overall, we found the food at the Excellence to be great. I am not sure what the expectations of many of the previous reviewers were who had negative things to say about the food, but as compared to other all-inclusives we have been to (including most recently the Sandals Grand Bahamian), the Excellence is top notch. We even felt it compared favourably to the food we had experienced on a Disney cruise we were on a couple of years ago. Great selection, great presentation and great service. Sure, sometimes the meals did not taste exactly the way you might expect them at home, but that doesn't mean they didn't taste great, just different. For those who have significant complaints about the food, you are either incredibly fussy and should be taking all-inclusive vacationing off of your to-do list or are looking too hard to find negatives.The shopping on and off the grounds in the mini-markets was quite fun as well. We were quite surprised at the number of options available to us for souvenirs and gifts. Sure, you need to haggle which is not very fun for some, but generally if you realize that the first price the vendors give you is just under double their bottom line price, you will do fine. For the few things we purchased, we usually ended up somewhere between 25% and 35% off of their original asking price.The drive to the Excellence is a bit long and the road is rough, but it does give you a decent opportunity to see the local landscape and country. I would have preferred it if the hotel were a half hour rather than an hour from the airport but we felt that the long drive was a small price to pay for the wonderfully secluded setting which the hotel enjoys.Overall, I would rate the Excellence as one of our top destinations and certainly the best all-inclusives we have been to. If you are looking for a nice, romantic get away you won't be disappointed with Excellence Punta Cana.
