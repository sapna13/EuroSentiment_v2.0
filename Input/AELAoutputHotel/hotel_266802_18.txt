{"text":"Nice enjoyable stay We visited Florence and stayed at the La Fortezza for 6 nites between 31 July to 5 Aug. 2007. The staff were friendly and helpful - the check in was swift as the room was ready for us - and it was clean and cool - just what was needed after a journey. We asked them to pre- book the Uffizi gallery tickets and when we got back from touring in the evening, we were presented with our number which we took to collect and pay for our pre-booked tickets which eliminated the need to queue to get in. On the last nite before leaving the next day as it was going to be Sunday, we asked for the receptionist to book a taxi to collect and drop us\/luggage at the SMN station fo our onward journey to Pisa.The room and surrondings were always clean .In the room we were provided with the usual supply of towels and complimentary basket of soap, body lotion, shoe shine sponge etc. The breakfast was also fine and consists of tea, coffee, cereals,yougurts, fruit salad, juice etc.- there was nothing cooked as such but we were grateful to have something to eat before setting off for the day.There are several places outside which we could buy a proper cooked breakfast if we needed to.Overall. it was an excellent stay as there is not one complaint to make of the hotel staff or facilities. I find cluelessreview here as hard to believe ..it had me worried as to what kind of hotel will be going to ...but I am so glad it an excellent place to stay where The hotel staff were always willing to serve us as thier visitors.
