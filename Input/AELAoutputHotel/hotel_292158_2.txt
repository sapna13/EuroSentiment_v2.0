{"text":"Just OK! Arrived on Thanksgiving Day with my wife and 4 college age children. I had been asking for rooms in the 2000 or 3000 section on an upper floor months in advance. It was largely ignored by the very pleasant gentleman at check in. He put us on the first floor of the 7000 units that were a little far from the beach. These units had a smell that was very hard to get used to. The inside of the closets had a very strong urine smell.The kid's room had black hairs and blood stains on the sheetsthat were not changed but, just turned over, until we insisted thenext day that they be changed. We did leave a tip every day but, it did not seem to garner any better service from the maid. My girls slept in zipped up hoodies the first 2 nights. I had to call the front desk 4 times over a 24 hour period to have more bottled water stocked. Considering you can't brush your teeth without it, this was not good. I did go to the bar and get my own water but, I should not have had to at a 4 star resort. We also had to call many times to get an towels for my children. We had 4 people in that room but, they only had 2 towels. We had to use the pool towels to dry off the first 2 nights. The beach was very beautiful but, you better put your towels out early. Get ready to see lot's of skin at the beach. The sand and water were incredible but, I am not OK with men in thongs and naked 4 year old boys. The European's dominate this entire resort and made us feelvery uncomfortable at times. When we walked onto the pool deckwe felt like we were on display. A simple smile from these people would have made us feel a little better. My 2 girls look a little like Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders but, the stares in the USusually are followed by lot's of positive smiles and not blank stares.We had difficulty finding food worthy of more than a poor ratinganywhere in any of the 3 resorts. The Italian was fair so we atedinner there 4 out of 5 nights. The wait was 2 to 3 hours but,at least we felt some consistency with the pasta. All of the meatdishes we found to be very chewy. The hamburgers were a mystery meat.The grounds at the resort were truly beautiful. It felt like Disney World in Florida the way they kept things so perfect.We took 2 excursions over the 5 days. The Saona Island excursions was hard to take because it takes 3 hours to getto the boat and 3 hours to get back. The 4 or 5 hours on theboats and Island were memorable but, the constant houndingby vendors ruined that part of the trip to.The half day ATV tour was much better but, still took 1.25 hoursof driving each way through some of the poorest, dirtiest townsI have ever seen. This tour should only be taken if you are in good physical health.We met with the Turinter rep for transportation back to airport2 days in advance to confirm. They showed up an hour lateonly after we finally reached him on his cell. We were very nervous that we were not going to make the flight. Thefront desk personnel that day were non English speaking andno help at all. I really feel I am being very honest with this review. I would neverrecommend Punta Cana to anyone. The constant hounding bythe locals from the moment you step onto the tarmac gets very old after a few days. I must have said No Gracia's over 1000times in 5 days.
