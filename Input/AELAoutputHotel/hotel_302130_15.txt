{"text":"Extremely Disappointed Having read so many excellent reviews about the Island Shangri-La, I thoroughly expected to enjoy my 3-night stay here. I couldn't have been more wrong.Let's start with the positives. The hotel itself is housed in a very modern and striking facility, shared by several office buildings. The location is great for shopping and for exploring the city. We felt that the lobby was very spacious and pleasing to the eyes. No faults there, but that was only the surface of the hotel.My feeling towards the Island Shangri-La is that it's all style and no substance. Upon a long flight from Los Angeles, we were tired and fully expected a quick check-in. This was not the case, as not only did we have to carry our own luggage but also rudely told to wait in a fairly long line. To add insult to injury, our room wasn't even ready when we asked. They offered to give us a room with a city view, but we declined. We had booked one of the harbour view rooms and did not want to leave with anything less. The staff member who handled our check-in seemed kind of put-off by our adamance and grumbled to himself. Not exactly the attitude we were expecting for a 5-star hotel!After waiting 20 minutes, we were finally called and led up to our room by a bellhop. He offered with false graciousness to carry my wife's suitcase, yet left me holding my rather bulky briefcase. I was hesitant about giving him a tip after this ignorance, but he refused to leave the room when I did not. My wife had to pass off a $HK 50 bill before he left us alone. The room itself was nice enough, although not as elegant as some of Hong Kong's other luxury hotels. And the harbour view was not nearly as nice as those of the hotels along Tsim Sha Tsui, namely the Peninsula and InterContinental. The decor was also rather ambiguous. An odd mix of Oriental and Western stylings that didn't seem nearly as successful as its leading competitors. Not nearly as elegant or tasteful either.Our two dining experiences at the hotel were memorable but far from exceptional. Dinner at Summer Palace and Restaurant Petrus, two of the most popular restaurants in the hotel, was overpriced and not worth it. One can find much better restaurants in Hong Kong for those prices in their respective categories. For Cantonese cuisine, we prefer Spring Moon and Man Wah at the Peninsula and Mandarin Oriental. For French cuisine, Gaddi's and Pierre at (again) the Peninsula and Mandarin Oriental are our top picks.After our terrible stay, we doubt that we'll ever return to the Island Shangri-La. Which is a shame, since we fully expected to be blown away by the hotel as the reviews here suggested. Next time, I'm sticking with the venerable Peninsula and Mandarin Oriental.
