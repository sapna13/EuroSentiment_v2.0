{"text":"Truly Excellent Hotel! I spent a very pleasant three nights at this hotel with my fianc√ã√\u2022√ñ recently. The staff were beyond friendly and very helpful. From the moment we arrived (checked in at 11:30 AM with no difficulties), to having dinner in the excellent restaurant, to check out, the staff were top tier and amongst the very best I have encountered in any hotel at any price!The rooms were clean and bright, and adequately sized considering the central London location. The rooms themselves have excellent soundproofing, so light sleepers will have no difficulties with traffic noise or noisy guests!Many top attractions (Big Ben  Houses of Parliament, London Eye, Tate Britain art gallery) are only a short, pleasant stroll away. Westminster is also amongst the safest places to stay whilst in London.The inclusion of the Apple iMac in the bedroom was a definite bonus as it freed me from having to pack my laptop, always a plus when traveling light for a short weekend break. If traveling on a budget then do yourself a favour and order one of their excellent breakfast rolls with tea or coffee for around a fiver, and eat in your room!Considering the location, friendly helpful staff, clean bright rooms, this hotel is a bargain. Midweek rates start from as little as √ä√£¬¢50 GB √à√\u2020√ü?0 $75 rates correct as of 11\/11\/2008).The nearest Tube station at Pimlico is only 10 minutes walk (0.5 miles, 800m) and connects directly with Tottenham Hale station, where one can get the Train to Stanstead Airport. If traveling by Tube it makes sense to purchase a prepaid Oyster card. These are available from Underground stations (for a √ä√£¬¢3 refundable deposit) and can be topped up as and when needed. Typically √ä√£¬¢20 will cover an average long weekend√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ travel requirements.All in all an excellent hotel that I can recommend unreservedly!
