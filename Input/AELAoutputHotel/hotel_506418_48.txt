{"text":"Have found my San Francisco Hotel I chose the Hotel Vitale for its location - across the street from the Ferry Building and the open air farmer's market. Location is reason enough to return.The bonus is the hotel itself - welcoming and friendly, yet professional and detail focused. During check-in the front desk volunteered to move me to a higher floor and a spectacular view the next day when a sixth floor room became available. From the second day on the valets remembered my car. A bellman showed me where the ice machine was hidden so I wouldn't have to call for ice. Everyone was determined to provide service above and beyond... and they did.My room was impeccable. The rain-shower in the bathroom, awesome. My one room service order served promptly, hot and well prepared.A minor complaint that I hope the Hotel Vitale management will consider. The hotel offers free internet service and free it is. Also slow. They offer an upgrade to high speed for $9.95 a day. Charge a little more for the room and throw in the high speed internet and I won't complain. Offer me free internet and then nickel dime me for decent speed internet and I take issue. One other nit - a hip hotel like this and no Comedy Channel on the cable line-up for the Daily Show or Cobert Report? Hopefully there will be a new internet policy when I return next spring. Either way I will be returning on a regular basis. ","annotations":[]}
