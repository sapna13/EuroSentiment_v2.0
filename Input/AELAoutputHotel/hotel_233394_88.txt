{"text":"It Is The Destination. Upon arrival my husband, 16 year old son, and myself were graciously greeted by Mateo as if he had been eagerly awaiting our arrival.. During our 4 night, 5 day stay (we arrived early and stayed till 5pm), their attentiveness never faltered, and the entire staff was gracious and helpful. Our friends were staying elsewhere which they regretted after seeing our hotel. They were shown the kindest hospitality while visiting us, and were invited to have drinks with us on the most beautiful veranda in the world.The location on the Grand Canal is perfect, just placed on the curve of the canal with a view of the Rialto on one side and looking down the canal on the other. Each day we looked forward to relaxing and drinking Mateo's wonderful spritzes. Their flexibility was incredible, and even when we were very late, Mateo would always offer to make us a drink, whatever we fancied.We couldn't wait to get to the veranda for breakfast and tried to make it last as long as possible. Mateo always took our orders along with a beautiful fresh buffet. Cappuccino, hot chocolate, crepes, omelets, fresh fruit, cereals, meats, cheese, and pastries. The Rialto, streets, and markets were crowded, but at Al Ponte Antico the veranda was very quiet and private, and we will remember it as the most gorgeous and comfortable spot in the world.We were in a downstairs room facing the canal with a spectacular view. In the evenings I would sit in the window admiring the romantic view of gondolas passing by in the moon light. At bedtime (2am) I would close the wooden shutters, and find our room very quiet and dark until we woke up around 10am. I loved opening the shutters to the noise and action of the day. The bathroom was mostly marble with a nice shower and the room extremely large by European standards, both very clean.There is a romantic little dock outside this room, which is private unless the only accessible door is rarely unlocked for people who are arriving or departing by boat taxi.. We loved departing on a boat taxi, although it was quite an expense. Make sure to ask the cost. The Vaporeto stop is quite close, and an adequate alternative, just a bit clumsy with the suitcases.The little (or large) extras included complimentary laundry, Mateo's spritzes (and for our 3 friends), fabulous recommendations and reservations for lunch, dinner, shopping, and tours. They didn't miss a beat.. Everyone was interested and helpful on a daily basis.Mateo's family took possession of this hotel just last spring, and they have made many changes already, with more improvements planned for this fall. Al Ponte Antico Hotel has become our favorite hotel, and we are looking forward to our next stay.It is the destination.. It is wonderful...Bravo ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1083,"mention":"Cappuccino","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cappuccino"],"startOffset":1073},{"endOffset":1098,"mention":"hot chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_chocolate"],"startOffset":1085},{"endOffset":1106,"mention":"crepes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cr%C3%AApe"],"startOffset":1100},{"endOffset":1166,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1158},{"endOffset":1766,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1762}]}
