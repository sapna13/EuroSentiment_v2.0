{"text":"Ideal location, but basic small rooms The hotel is in a great spot, we were only minutes walk from shops and transport but make no doubt about it, we were always keen to be out of the hotel. It wasn't ditry and the staff were pleasant, but by the time my wife and I wheeled in our two cases there was no floor space left! Our room, which was relativly expensive for an Australian traveller used to paying less for a 4 or 5 star we had hoped for more than the 10 square meters of space and a tiny double bed. We kept the net curtains closed - our view was of the air conditioning towers of another building.This hotel was a bit of a watershed for me - for the first time I booked through an online agent (Zuji) instead of through colleagues at work (a travel related company). I am pretty sure that this room was one of the hotels worst but perhaps that is how some online sites have these bargains available.We only spent about an hour in the hotel bar, it was very pleasant and had a nice street view. The general feel of the bar and restraurant gave me the impression that with the right room I would have been giving this hotel an above average.We had a good time in HK - the hotel was just a place to sleep and none of my gripes were enough to ruin our holiday.On my next trip to HK, I will consider other hotels, but I won't rule out the Kowloon.
