{"text":"Royal Service is a Royal Joke if you have Victor and Francesco as Butlers We spent june 14th-21st at the melia. It is a beautiful resort, with wonderful views. The royal service was a great dissappointment for us. If you get victor or francesco as butlers, you will not see them after you are taken to your room. The y did not come thru with any of our requests and went as far as avoiding us and other of the guests they were assigned too. In fact the day out of check out they drove right past us. Make sure at check in you do your reservations, requests jacuzzi services and follow up with calls. We seemed to have been forgotten and didn't get the specialized service we wanted. I will say the Gabi is a great place to eat--Wandi- he is the best a caters to your needs. Wendy the bartender at the lobby was wonderful. They have great snacks. Benjamin, one of the drivers is the best and i will also say nicolas was wonderful. Other than that---you were on your own. I would consider talking to the resort and requesting to not have these butlers--maybe than your service will be great. I knew there was a problem when i spoke to 4 different couples that had the same complaint.As for the rides--do hesitate to keep calling until someone comes. As for the obstacle course and ziplines they were at an additional charge each and every time you used them after we were told differently. ","annotations":[]}
