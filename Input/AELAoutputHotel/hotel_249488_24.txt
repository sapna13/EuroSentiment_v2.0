{"text":"great view,and service My wife and I stayed at puerto rico for 5 nights vacations at LAS CASITAS VILLAGE. The location is STUNNING!!! , the gardens, the rooms, the pools and the beach are beatifull.!!!!The CHECK IN,and CHECK OUT process was quick (thanks ALFREDO). he was very polite and patient with us.We got a one bedroom villa with ocean view. The room was nice and clean at all times, thanks to the housekeeper, who was always verry consistent with her service. (sorry i dont remember her name, but she was great.)The buttler service was ok, i met him on the check in process but, since i never needed nothing special, i didnt bother them. besides they seems to be overwork. WATER PARK is new and nice, they still doing some light construction but we didnt care. In my opinion the shouldnt be charging extra to enjoy been at the water park. The hotel has more than 5 POOLS where you can RELAXXXXXX your self and be serve by their staff. TheINFINITY POOL at las casitas, of course is the best. Believe what you read, prices are crazy for sandwiches and drinks, but the service make it worth. (at least in las casitas rests. VENTANAS) Ventanas has such a great view, and friendly staff. FRANQUIE took care of us at the pool one day and the rest of our stay, he was serving us in the restaurant. He was very attentive always. After 5pm EDNA took care of us at VENTANAS BAR every evening. She was very nice and the best bartender in the entire resort (drinks were properly poured at all times, always tasted the same). And suggested us a few drinks. She make our evenings delightful with her drinks (MOJITOS, RUM PUNCHES, POMEGRANATE COSMO...) and talking. NIGTH LIFE: there is no much to do at las casitas but you can always take the shuttle to the main hotel. they have transportation gonig on all day and all nite. My wife enjoyed the CASINO a lot (she is a big Gambler).meanwhile i enjoyed my self at the pizza rest. BELLA VISTA.OVERALL we had a great time in puerto rico and would be booking again if we go back to the caribbean. THANKS to all the staff.THIS HOTEL IS 100 % FIVE STARS ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1052,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1042},{"endOffset":1052,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1042},{"endOffset":1915,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1910}]}
