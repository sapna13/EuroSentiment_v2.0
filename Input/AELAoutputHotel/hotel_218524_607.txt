{"text":"All Inclusive Honeymoon Dream! My new husband and I just returned from a 7 night stay at Excellence, and it was Excellent! (Feb.10-17) There are a few minor set backs, but nothing that can not be dealt with.Beach\/Pools: The beach was wonderful, with palm trees, tiki huts, lay out matresses, and canopied beds. The pools were equally as nice with plenty of places to lay out and enjoy the nice clean water. Guests can find nice quiet pockets to relax in, or mingle with other guests and enjoy a social experience.****A helpful note for all newcomers: You must wake up early to reserve the premiere spots at the beach or pool. Guests will mark their spots as early at 7am. If not, you will still find a spot, but not the top locations.Food: We enjoyed the nice variety of food offered, and didn't have many meals we did not like. Our favorite restaraunt was 'Spice'  'Barcelona', and the least favorite was 'The Grill'. We never ate at Lobster House or Chez Isabelle. The buffet lunch at Toscana is always a delicious bet, and room service food is good as well. Oh, and the pizza's that are delivered poolside are wonderful!!! Service: Everyone had a very cheery disposition and were always quick to say 'Hola' or 'Excellente'. There were some communication barriers at times though. For instance missed wake up calls, us not getting everything in our honeymoon package until persistent calling and following up. (That was annoying). However, room service and the 'Excellence Club' was great! At the end of the day, patience is required, but they are friendly and quick staff.Bars: Great drinks and excellent service! Ask for a Sammie Sosa. :) Also, be sure to ask for some 'Mama Wanna', as well. (I believe the stuff is illegal in the states). **Also, don't forget to request your liquor of choice. They have all of the premium liquors available....go for it!! (oh...and they have very 'generous portions)Activities: We were told to avoid the Dolphin experience, because it is not good in the Dominican Republic. I dread to think what that means, but I didn't want to spend the rest of my trip crying and trying to 'save the dolphins'. We enjoyed our 1 hour horse back ride a lot! It was worth the extra 30minutes! Also, another honeymooning couple went to Saona Island and LOVED it! It is a hefty drive out there, but the pictures and big conch shells they brought home seemed worth the trip.Hope that helps...we had a great time!!
