{"text":"Great value Although this was our first time in Punta Cana, we have stayed at numerous all inclusives all over Mexico. Let me start off by saying that the Tropical princess and the Caribe club princess are one and the same resort using all the same facilities. If you are booked with the tropical princess you only have access to two a la carte restaurants, if you are booked with the Caribe princess you have access to more. There are 7 a la carte restaurants one buffet and a couple of snack bars. The grounds, lobby, pools, beach are all clean,attractive and well maintained. The buffet is quite good, plenty of variety, clean, and there always seemed to be plenty of clean tables available. But it IS still a buffet and at night we prefer to eat at a nice restaurant. This is where we were somewhat dissapointed. Our first a la carte, el Pilon, was attached to the back of the buffet and was truly dissapointing. We decided to pay extra and try Mamma mia the following night. Again we were very dissapointed in the food. Our third night we paid quite a bit more to have the lobster which we'd heard was very good, and it was. Our last night we tried the Brazilian restuarant included in our package and it was good. Enough about the food. The staff at the resort was excellent. Always friendly, always smiling and eager to help. Our room was ok, it was a room, spacious but the light fixture in the bathroom didn't work, they tried to fix it but after 3 days of showering in the dark we complained and were upgraded to a nicer room with a king size bed. We were quite happy about that. Still the bedding in both rooms was very worn and the sheets and mattress pads seemed too small for the beds and we woke up most mornings on a bare mattress. Kind of gross. One more problem was mosquitos. There were alot, everywhere at night as well as in our rooms. We tried to kill as many as possible but still woke up every morning with new bites. They do spray, we saw a truck driving around one evening at supper time that looked like it was on fire. It was spewing huge grey clouds of toxic fumes for the mosquitos right into the open lobby and beyond. Why they wouldn't wait to do this till everyone was sleeping is beyond me. We went on two tours. Saona island was a very nice day, very long but we really enjoyed it. Our other tour the country safari, again was very long, didn't enjoy it as much as it involved what seemed like hours and hours of driving between stops. The horseback riding on this tour was extremely lame (only young kids would enjoy it), we choose to skip it and waited in some sad looking hammocks in a rather shabby looking back yard. The majority of the other guests at the resort were french canadians, german, russian and french. We missed not being able to socialize with our fellow guests as we always have in Mexico. We've always made new friends on our vacation... this is the first time we didn't meet anyone. This all may sound a little negative but since this is a review I wanted to be as truthful as possible. All in all, considering what we paid I do feel we got good value for our money. We really enjoyed the lobster dinner, our massages, (they were awesome!) pizza by the pool, walking the beautiful beach, and the friendliness of the people. However we are going to return to Mexico for our next vacation, we feel the food is better and enjoy socializing with other english speaking guests.
