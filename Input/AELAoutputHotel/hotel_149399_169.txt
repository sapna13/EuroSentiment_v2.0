{"text":"Best Vacation Ever! My husband and I, along with 8 other couples, just returned from paradise! The hotel and grounds are beautifully kept and we found the staff to go above and beyond for us. At first, the size of the complex is very overwhelming, but once you understand the layout, it is much easier to get around than it looks. We walked quite a bit, but also took the trolley\/bus that went around continually. The way we looked at it was... we are on vacation and we have all the time in the world so if you have to wait or walk -- who cares! We did tip generously and it was very much worth it. Bring a lot of 1's and 5's- they go along way. Mateo at the pool bar kept our cups full all day! He knew what everyone liked and went out of his way to take care of us. All of the girls had fun doing water aerobics in the pool with Francisco almost daily! The food was very good. We especially enjoyed the French, Dominican, American, and Seafood (Capri) restuarants. The buffets also had a good selection. We ate breakfast every morning at Agora right on the beach- what a gorgeous view of the ocean! Omlets made to order were a nice way to start off the day. Night life is not really what we are used to, but we did have fun at the Disco, sang some Kaoroke, visited the Sports Bar\/Casino, and made our own fun lounging on couches and laughing near the MarketPlace with our I-Pod playing all of our favorites!The rooms were very well kept and a nice size. We had one cockroach in our room, but is was our fault because we left our sliding glass door open for the entire day- no big deal! Some people have complained about the bugs on other reviews, but you need to take into consideration where you are and keep your doors shut!Our overall impression of this resort is amazing! The people are hard working and very friendly. Knowing a bit of Spanish will help, but the majority of workers spoke and understood some English. We never had a problem communicating what we needed or wanted. The beach is gorgeous, food is good, and weather is AMAZING! It was sunny and warm every day we were there- bring your sunscreen and a hat! We would go back in a heart beat!
