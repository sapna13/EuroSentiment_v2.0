{"text":"Review From New York The Grand Palladium Royal Suites Resort is located on Bavaro Beach , probably one of the nicest beaches I've seen. There are 4 resorts within the walls of the compound.We stayed at the Royal Suites section of the resort . It's adult only an a little more secluded from the other 3 resorts. There were mostly newlyweds here, so if your looking for a little more excitement , the other resorts always seem to have some sporting activities and fun stuff for children. (big water slide) .This is my 3rd time in Punta Cana . I've been to Secrets of Excellence and Dreams (formally Sunscape the Beach ) . I feel every resort has it pros and cons.  PROS. Beach and Water were awesome .....probably the best beach in DR Food was for the most part very good... Lunches in the buffet were just OK Rooms was very big and spacious, we also had a Jacuzzi in our room . The resorts grounds were beautiful. Some of the dining staff were very friendly and others not so.CONS. This is a HUGE resort . It took about 3 days to figure out were we were half the time. Didn't care for all the traffic within the resort. We were constantly dodging big buses ,cars and motor cycles Didn't like having to walk √à√¥√ú mile to and from dinner. Even though the mini train was running ever 15 minutes (really 30 minutes) we always found it difficult to get on and it seemed to be full to capacity. I realizes when you are in DR you have to go with the flow and the unexpected , but there were continual sporadic power outages. One night the power went out and the backup generators were also out .. We were eating in total darkness. Except for my cell phone light and eventually a candle.  The pool was kind of beat looking the swim up bar was missing a few of the granite moldings . The swim up bar closed and had to be out of the pool by 7:00 pm , putting a damper on our partying. Make sure you have cash... no ATM's on sight I realize having a good vacation is more than just a really nice resort, please don't take this a a negative comment it is a nice resort. More importantly it's the people you meet and converse with and we met many . Just wanted to thank the group of people that were a part of our life for that one week .I want to shout out to our friends from Charlotte .. Kristy and Jeremy (code yellow) hope my engineered raft kept you a float for a few more days. Also to Jenn and Jes from Philly .., Jenn hope your feeling better and Jes have a safe trip to Brazil .. Don't talk to strangers , except for guys with the name of Paul. Tall Mike and his wife from Chicago. Now that your married you'll need to cut back on work and spent e time with your new wife. Also Mike the bartender and his girlfriend from Northern California . Of course I can't go without saying thanks to the staff Teodoro, Manuel, Tony??? Yes Tony and Yohanna. for all the MAMAJANNASThe big question ..would I go back? Probably not. Only because I like to try different places. I guess when all said I would rate this a 7.5 of 10.
