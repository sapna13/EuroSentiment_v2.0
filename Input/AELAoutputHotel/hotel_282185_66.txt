{"text":"Hotel France Albion - Excellent Little Hotel My husband and I returned yesterday (23 April 2007) from our annual trip to Paris. We stayed at the Hotel France Albion for a second time. Again, we were not disappointed. The hotel staff were courteous and helpful and the room, albeit small, was spotlessly clean and pleasant. The day prior to our departure I required access to the internet to check in on line with Air France. The receptionist advised that the cost was 7 euro for 30 minutes or 10 euro for 1 hour. We explained we would only take approximately 5 or 10 minutes and were provided with free access. The weather during our visit was extremely hot for April. It reached 26 degrees each day which to us living in Manchester, England, was an absolute joy. The location of the hotel is superb and if you use a hotel as we do the France Albion is perfect. All we require is a place to store our belongings (each room contains a safe) and to shower and sleep. If you want luxury then you would need to pay substantially more as we did one year staying at the Hotel Jolly Lotti near to the Louvre, however, we still only used the hotel as a base and feel that the additional cost of a hotel is better used as spending money.I would also mention that we ate at the Ciel de Paris on the 56th floor of the Tour Montparnasse one evening. The views are breathtaking, the service was excellent and the food was pretty good (compared with Altitude 95). The meal for 2 cost 230 euro but that included a bottle of champagne and although some may consider this to be expensive it is still cheaper than a Bateaux tour along the Seine.I recommended the France Albion to another TA member Kiwigirl and would be very interested to know whether she actually stayed at the hotel and, if so, what her thoughts were.
