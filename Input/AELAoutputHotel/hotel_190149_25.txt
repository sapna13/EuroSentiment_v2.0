{"text":"Good hotel, Great Location Like many people, I have travelled a lot for business and stayed in a lot of hotels all over the world - and incomparison the Villa Real is a good hotel, not great, but very good.We stayed for 3 nights in Early September 2007 and we would definatly go back. Upon arriving we were greated by friendly and helpful doorman and reception staff. I had emailed prior to arriving and asked for a front facing room a few floors up - and although they can never guarantee it they said they would try their best. - and they did.We got a great room on the third floor.The room was clean, had everything you need, did exactly as it said on the tin, but I have to agree 5 stars may be pushing it - its easily 4 star though! It was a very good hotel room.Unlike previous guests I can't say we noticed any noise! Don't forget you are staying in an old traditional building in the middle of a European Capital City - its not a golf resort in the countyside - there will be a 'city centre buzz' and not be deathly quiet.With the windows closed and main door shut (to close off the bathroom) we were not bothered by any noise and slept really well.The location is excellent. In a affluent part of the city centre bang in the middle of the 'museum triangle'. We walked everywhere and always felt safe. Madrid is a safe city and very well policed.As a city Madrid is excellent - one of the best I've been too - and I think the Villa Real is a good choice of hotel. There will be better but for everything considered - location, price, services etc Its one of the best.I can honestly say I couldn't pick a fault.... ","annotations":[]}
