{"text":"Wonderfrul We (my husband and I) spent the Christmas holidays (12\/25-12\/31\/08) with our kids (37-21) and grandkids (12-7) at this resort. We are members of the Sol Melia Vacation Club so we were in the Royal Service rooms and had access to the RS beach, pool and Gabi restaurant. Our adjoining suites were beautiful and clean. We had no trouble with our dinner reservation requests. All were booked on the day time period requested. We ate at the Japanese, Italian, American Grill, Seafood, and Mexican. They were all very good. My favorite was the Japanese, but other family members like the others the best. The Gabi and other buffets had a very large selection to chose from. Our 7 year old is a picky eater, but always found something to eat. The 7 and 10 year old did do the Kids' club one day and enjoyed it, but there are additional costs for the events there. The only tour we did was deep sea fishing, which was ok (seas were rough and we didn't catch anything), but the the crew was very nice (it wasn't their fault that the weather was not good and the fish were not biting). The beach, pool and grounds were so beautiful and there were plenty of chairs of space. We did not feel crowded what so ever. The staff were all very friendly and spoke\/understood English. Some did better than others, but remember, we are in their country, thank goodness I did not have to speak spanish! They are all very patient in trying to understand or get through to you. The spa was wonderful. We had a couples massage and my daughter had 4 different massages. Our daughter owns her own spa and we all agreed that they were well worth it. I highly recommend the spa.Please read the reviews with a grain of salt. You will always find someone who will not like a resort and someone else who will love it.
