{"text":"Impeccable Service I stayed at the Ritz Carlton Singapore over a weekend for a short family get-away. From the beginning, the service provided by staff at the Ritz was impeccable and above reproach. Everything that you need is attended to promptly upon request and they do their best to make your stay so comfortable that you don't want to leave. The room was lovely - the bathroom was fabulous. The main bathroom, with the bathtub, shower facilities was gorgeous with an unonstructed view of the Singapore skyline. The separated toilet was great because it allows for greater privacy but the space is a little claustrophobic - could use a little bit more space in there! The layout of the room was alright though I think it can be improved but that's a minor individual preference than a glaring flaw that detracts from the experience. The room was nice and spacious which is a definite plus point. However, given that it is the Ritz, I would have expected their bed linens to be more pristine. While I did spot some stains here and there, they weren't too conspicous so that's alright. Swimming pool is a little too small in my opinion, with too little deckchairs given the size of the hotel. Faclitiies like the gym is top notch though a little small. Gym staff are on hand to measure your BMI and stuff like that to advise you on nutritional aspects such as your recommended daily calorie intake. All in all, a good experience and would defintely recommend it to others. ","annotations":[]}
