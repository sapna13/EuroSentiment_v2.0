{"text":"Best views in Singapore- first class hotel As someone who has lived in Singapore for years, and reviewed hotels personally and professionally, it is remarkable that I had yet to visit the Ritz-Carlton in Singapore. I had written it off as another standard luxury chain hotel, and never bothered. Uniqueness is something I value highly in hotels, and somehow I doubted it was there. Boy was I wrong. The views alone make this place worth it. I had a room that overlooked the marina and river, plus the Singapore flyer Ferris wheel from the bathtub, and it was just breathtaking. I mean 'I-woke-up-every-morning-choked-up ' breathtaking. Get the more expensive room with the marina\/river view. It is SOOOO worth it. You can see all of central singapore, and it is spectacular at night.The service was also above and beyond, on par with the best I have received in Asia. My first room had broken air con the first night. The club concierge Archie Natividad acted with such promptness and apology that I almost felt guilty for complaining. Within 30 min, he had me in an upgraded suite, the likes of which I can't begin to describe. Beautiful room and fantastic service. The furnishings were impeccable- softest, most comfortable bed ever, beautiful marble and glass bathroom (did I mention the view?). The housekeeping was worth raving about as well. They were attentive to detail (arranging everything just so, while paying attention to my preferences- how I arranged the pillows, the TV channel I preferred at turn-down, my newspaper choice). Even the bathrobes were first-rate, silk and terry, best I have ever had. The club has food service all day (I didn't eat in a restaurant the entire time!) and is more than worth it. The food was five star, the views spectacular, and the service better than I have ever experienced. They knew my name and preferences by day one, but were not intrusive at all. I really hate intrusive :-)Although the decor was a little generic, and the pool average (no real pool-side service), the service and the views made the place truly unique. I generally don't like 5-star hotels, or rather am rarely impressed by them, but the Ritz Carlton in Singapore was the exception. The spa was alright- the service were great (except the waxing, which was atrocious- I have yet to have the service in Asia with anyone who seemed to have a clue what they were doing), but there was no waiting area, which I really would have expected of a spa of that caliber (and price). Instead you just sit awkwardly in the locker room. I have moved to the Fullerton and am considering moving back as fast as I can. This tiny boring room just doesn't compare!
