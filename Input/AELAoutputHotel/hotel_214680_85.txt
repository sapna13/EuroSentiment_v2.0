{"text":"Wonderful stay at the Park Shore My girlfriend and I just got back from our 5 night stay at the Park Shore. We booked directly online with the hotel for $89 per night for a city view room. We arrived at the hotel just after 3pm and were greeted warmly by the friendly and helpful front desk staff. We inquired about upgrading to a poolside room and she informed us that we could for $20 per night so we went for it. Online it was $30 more, so she gave us a bit of a deal.The poolside room was pretty large, and very clean. The bathroom had lots of counterspace and was also very clean. Having the poolside room was great!! When you didn't feel like packing up all your stuff and heading to the beach, but you still wanted to get some sun, all you had to do was slide open the glass door and there you were. If you got too hot or wanted a cold drink, all you had to do was walk ten feet and into your nice cool room. The pool got sun from sunrise to sunset, so it's perfect place to tan at any time of day. We actually tanned at the pool more than we did at the beach due to the convenience and comfort of having your room right there!!! An added bonus, was at night the pooldeck is closed to everyone but you, and you could have drinks out there and walk over to the railing to watch all the action on the street down below. We even went late night swimming a couple of times!!!The hotel is in a very convenient location, right at the end of the main steet and across from the beach. You are only 4 blocks from the heart of Waikiki and all the shops. Attached to the hotel is an ABC store, Starbucks, Surfshop and Lulu's restaurant that turns into a busy nightclub on Friday and Saturday night. On the same block there is a Subway, Coldstone Creamery (best ice cream ever) and a Wolfgang Puck Express (best BBQ pizza ever!). The view of Diamond head and the park is great too. We rented a car for our whole trip since we wanted to shop and go to the North Shore. The hotel has valet parking for $20 per day. A bit steep but very convenient. Simply pull up and out you go, no having to circle the garage to look for a spot. This hotel exceeded all our expectations by a mile. We had a great time and are already planning a return to Waikiki and we will definitely be staying in a poolside room at the Park Shore. There is not a better value in all of Waikiki!!!
