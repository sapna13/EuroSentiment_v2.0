{"text":"Mixed experience I arrived with my family at 3:00 AM due to a delayed flight, and we were told that our booking (through Expedia) was not received by La Quinta Inns (SEA-TAC). We were treated to a rude welcome by the night receptionist who gave us a lecture on what we should do next time to avoid situations like this. We were standing there with a sick six-year old in the middle of the night, listening to the receptionist's comments and not knowing whether we would have a place to sleep. The proper way to handle this would have been to re-assure us that a room is available and that any problems with our reservation could be sorted out the next day (I had a hard copy of the reservation with me and the receptionist saw that it was already paid in full and it was for the correct date and La Quinta location).I also want to note that our stay was otherwise fine, I liked the free wireless AND wired Internet connection (there are some security issues with wireless access in some hotels), the day staff were courteous and tried to resolve the issues as quickly as they could. I also complained to La Quinta through their website, and they seemed pretty responsive. The place was clean and was very convenient for a one night stay flying into Seattle and then driving on the next day. (Note: from what I can tell, the lost booking was La Quinta's fault, but they are still looking into the issue.) ","annotations":[]}
