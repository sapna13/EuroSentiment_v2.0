{"text":"Great Time I will admit that I was hesitant to stay at the Capitol Square Hotel after reading some of the negative reviews, however being on a tight budget (being near Christmas time) this was the hotel that offered the best rate in such a great location.I had a pleasant check-in and out experience. The staff were quite busy on both occasions, but they were very welcoming and polite to me and my partner. The manager on Duty, Jason I believe his name was, explained all the services in detail and answered all of my questions. He was also very helpful in letting me know what was around the hotel and what places of interest we could go.Location was a 5 minute walk to Central Station, China Town, Paddy's Markets, The QVB and other shopping centres, Cinemas and if you add another 5 minutes to the walk you're in beautiful Darling Harbour.The room was great considering what I paid. The room, bed, linen and bathroom were clean and comfortable. I had a pretty good view of George St and there was very little noise from the city. The room included a mini fridge, seats, cupboard (with extra pillows, blankets, iron and board, kettle, mugs tea and coffee), table, TV, clock radio, internet connection and air conditioning.The bathroom was substancial including a bath\/shower, toilet, sink and all the towels, gel and shampoo\/conditioner I needed. It was small, but not cramped and I had more than enough room to do what is done in a bathroom.Overall I am very pleased with my stay and the service provided from the Capitol Square Hotel.
