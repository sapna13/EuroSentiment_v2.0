{"text":"How do you say unhelpful  It appears we were staying in the hotel around the same time as the most recent 2 reviews in early September  agree with them completely. We booked a Condal room directly on the hotel's website for 4 nights. Let's start with the positives....the room was fine - the doors opening out on to the main street are soundproofed, which was great for noise control. The room was relatively clean, although the shower could use some help in the mildew-removal department. The location is great - very central to most areas.Now the negatives - the staff could really seem to care less that you are there as a guest. Requests for assistance were provided, but grudgingly. There is no concierge service. The hotel did not bother to mention that they are doing renovation and construction in the hotel online when booking (as most reputable hotels will do). The hotel staff provides you no information on the hotel upon check-in (i.e., location of the restaurant, hours of dining, hours of the piano bar, pool bar, etc). The pool is very tiny and the outdoor hot tub water was green. The posted hours for the piano bar  pool deck bar were never actually accurate - one night open, the next night - not open. The piano bar off the lobby of the hotel was open one time of the 4 days we were there. This hotel has some great amenities, but no one seems to want to tell you about them  even if they did - chances are, it would not be open or operational if you did manage to stumble upon them.We strongly recommend finding another place to stay. This is not a four-star hotel  definitely not worth the cost or the aggravation. ","annotations":[]}
