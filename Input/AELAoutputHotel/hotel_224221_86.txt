{"text":"Greedy management spoiled our stay I chose this stay as it had such great reviews and sounded very appealing. Unfortunately, although I agree with most of the reviews posted, we did not completely enjoy our stay.The room was great, the free facilities during the day and evening were lovely and the location is great.One of the appeals for us was the advertised roof top reading area and bar. Wonderful after a hectic day I thought...sadly this was not to be the case.You should be aware that although the Hotel advertise this in their lovely brochure and website as one of the Hotel's facilities, management chose to bar guests from it's use and charge others to use it for all day conferences and evening wedding receptions. Throughout our entire stay were were barred from taking the lift to the top floor to enjoy the advertised Hotel Facility as from 8 until 5 there were all day conferences and during the evening social events such as wedding receptions. The Hotel point out that it is not their responsibility as management hire this out and then conference organisors take over the area, hence barring us at the lift!So the management of this Hotel charge guests to stay having advertised this as a facility and then hire it out again to external parties...a nice money spinner for them and they could't have cared less that we were not happy about this!I would not stay at this Hotel again as the staff let themselves down and could not deal with our complaint with any degree of maturity or concern...a robotic glazed look and please feel free to contact management if you are not happy then have a nice day...it spoiled my stay there as there were plenty of Hotels we would have stayed at had they not advertised this wonderful sounding, never to be seen roof top area....The boutique rooms were as expected too, nicely decorated boxes with a few random books placed to demonstrate the Library theme....a rip off in my opinion and not an ethical management company in my opinion.If financial companies mislead customers in this way they would be fined!!!
