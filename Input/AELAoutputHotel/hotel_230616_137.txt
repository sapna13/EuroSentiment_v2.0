{"text":"Banks Mansion -- sometimes two stars, sometimes four After a long flight across the Atlantic and a six hour layover in London, we were pathetically grateful to finally reach the Banks Mansion. Our canal view room, booked weeks before our trip, wasn't available. Instead, we were shown to a dark room facing, well, nothing.Not an auspicious start! Two stars or less.Room 312, however, had its good side. The bed was very comfortable and the Banks Mansion offers a menu of five different types of pillows, for any kind of firmness or softness you desire. The four pillows already in the room suited us just fine, and I'm a pillow snob. Four stars.The bathroom was also another definite plus. It was very big. The separate shower was large with a huge shower head and loads of water pressure. The tub was great for a deep soak and you faced away from the toilet. I love my bubble baths but I hate staring at a toilet for the duration of my bath. Four stars. However, the towels were tiny and the soap\/shampoo situation was pretty miserly. Also, a face towel that went astray sat at the back of the cabinet floor for four days. The cleaner never spotted it though the rest of the bathroom was sparkling. Two stars.Everybody raves about the free booze and snacks. Yes, there are decanters of cognac, gin and whiskey on the bedside table. If that's your thing then I guess it's pretty exciting. I'm a bit of a cynic and always wonder what other guests may have added to the mixture. But, hey, that's just me. There is a mini bar with water, juice, pop and two Heinekens. I must admit that was a nice touch. Also, the bar downstairs had lashings of red and white wine, beers, pops, sparkling and flat waters, coffee, tea, liqueurs, you name it. Help yourself. Four stars.Breakfast (included) was great. No quibbles there. It was open from 7-10:30 during the week and until 11 on the weekend. Very civilized. The usual ham, cheese, muesli, yogurt mix but also the added bonus of omelets, pancakes and porridge made fresh to order. Four stars.The staff were WONDERFUL. Especially Michel. He deftly saved every two star situation and made it into a four. He knew we were disappointed about our room change and made sure a chilled bottle of champagne was waiting for us the next evening as well as an offer to change rooms as soon as a canal view was available (we elected to stay where we were because it was too much of a hassle to re-pack). Noticing our interest in dining, he gave us a fabulous book on Amsterdam restaurants and insisted we keep it. He also gave us great recommendations. A charming man and a real asset to the hotel. As were the rest of the staff. Five stars!Would we go back? We debated this and decided, yeah, we would. By the way, enjoy Amsterdam. It is a FABULOUS city!
