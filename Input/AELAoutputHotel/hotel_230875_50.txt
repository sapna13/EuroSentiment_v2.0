{"text":"No Surprise We have been my girlfriend and I many times to Amsterdam. It was our first experience at the RadissonFirst of all, the location. if you want to have a fast and nice overview of Amsterdam It cannot be better. The red light district is 5 min walk from the hotel but located in a quiet and lovely area, so you do not have to be afraid to be invaded by the tourists. We get to the Radisson by foot from the train station, it took 10\/15mn.The Hotel lobby has a nice looking and seems to be newly renovatedNext is the staff. Really professional. Exactly what you expect from such a business hotel. The receptionist gave me a room at the first floor with a view on the street. I asked if I could have another one at an upper floor. She replied that the hotel was fully booked but to please me she will do her best to find me another one for the day after.In fact I kept my room. I was scared to suffer from the street noise. The double glazing and the quiet street where the hotel is located let us fall in a deep sleep.The room is clean, spacious with modern furniture and free wi-fi internet connection. I usually have problems when I travel to get used with the bed. This time I slept like a baby thanks to the firm but comfortable mattress. The icing on the cake is the rusland, just in front of the hotel (the amateurs will understand).The only criticism I could give is the food quality at the bar, we tried many different snacks, and believe me it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not worthwhile.By the way let drop the hotel breakfast and run to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠E Bakkerswinkel√à√\u2020\u2022? It is 5\/10mn walking. you will start your day with a smile hooked on your face.Have fun Amsterdam is magic!
