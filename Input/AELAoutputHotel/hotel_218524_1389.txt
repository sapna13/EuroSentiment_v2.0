{"text":"Fun times in DR We stayed at Secrets for our Honeymoon the first week in October. The place is truly beautiful, there is nothing better than going to breakfast and seeing the waves of the blue\/green waters. Staff: The staff were overly friendly, they took care of our issues in a very efficient manner. They spoke English very well. Our room was perfect; no bugs cleaned daily, though at different times each day., it was so quiet where we were, I slept just as if I were at home. We left a note for Budlight and vodka for our minibar and did get it ONE day only. Note that the minibar fillers and the maids are not the same people. Pool: We spent most of our time in the smaller pool by our room, it was great, a waterfall going all the time. We met great people and enjoyed ourselves each day, the weather was very hot the whole week and sunny each day. The swim up bar provided daily entertainment at 4pm by fellow travelers. I would only suggest they play some music by the smaller pool it would have been nice. The ocean is rough, if you're looking for some exersice you'll get it, it's not unreasonable to go in, it's pretty fun if you like waves and the temperature is perfect!Food: We didn't love it for sure. It was the slow season, restaurants were not open daily. The buffets worry many because of the issues of food sitting out for hours in hot weather. Mexican the best, followed by steak house, room service offers little. If you don't mind eating the same things you'll be fine. You won't starve but you will crave a Wendys burger and fries by the time you get to the airport to go home! Oh don't forget to get a COLD beer when you're at the airport too, the beverages are not ice cold like we are used to. Bummer. The ride in: Long, not too bumby, intersting to see the real dominican republic, surprisinly poor, drivers here are crazy! We enjoyed are stay it is so beautiful and the people are so nice, while I'm glad I went I am in no rush to return and would prefer to venture to new island sand places in the future.
