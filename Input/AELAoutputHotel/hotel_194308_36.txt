{"text":"Adored Hotel d'Aubusson I stayed at Hotel d'Aubusson on my first trip to Paris in early September, 2007. I was there for almost two weeks and was extremely happy that I chose this charming, first rate hotel.All of the staff were exceptionally polite and helpful. I cannot remember any service I have experienced anywhere that was better than theirs. After I'd spoken with some of the staff more than once or twice, they had big smiles for me thereafter, something the French don't usually produce for total strangers.I had a superior room that I thought was very large by French standards for one person. I didn't book any special packages, but they had a lovely, large bouquet of Stargazer lilies in my room when I arrived. Every other night I received a gift in my room when I returned. A split of champagne, a giant brioche in their beautiful navy and gold box, a small fruit basket, a lovely jar of miniature pears in syrup, and eventually, a three drawer box of chocolates and other lovely candies. I don't know if they do this for guests who stay longer than a few days or what, but it was a wonderful surprise.I had planned my own itinerary, so I didn't need to bother the staff too much, but when I had a question, they were unfailingly polite and helpful. My room was always clean. And every night in addition to the candied orange bonbons and Good Night card they leave for everyone (in memory of Robespierre who often visited their establishment in the 1700s and ate oranges when they were a new fruit for France), they also leave another card with the name of the person who cleaned your room and the weather forcast for the next day. That forecast came in handy for me.My room was on the third floor in the corner, which is directly above the Cafe Laurent. I did notice some noise the first night, which was a Saturday, but I was eventually able to sleep anyway. After that weekend, I didn't notice any noise.The location is terrific for sightseeing and shopping. I was five minutes away from the Pont Neuf and Notre Dame, a great cheese shop, great bakery (one of many in the area), a well stocked little market, several good cafes and a ten minute walk from Patrick Roget's chocolate shop on the Boulevard Saint-Germain. It was about a 20 to 30 minute walk to the Louvre and the Musee D'Orsay.I had room service a few times (their pizza was excellent!) but did not eat other meals at the hotel. Their dining room, the eating area in the cafe and their beautful courtyard all seemed lovely to me. As a single woman traveling alone, I liked that the street was somewhat busy, but not overly so. The Relais Christine just down a side street was a little too isolated for me to have felt comfortable walking down their street at night--even if it was safe. The Rue de Buci, just down the street and around the corner was great for eating and people watching, but much busier day and night.If I ever have a chance to go back to Paris, I would want to return to Hotel d'Aubusson. It's a great little boutique hotel in a great location with a superior staff and it already feels like home to me.
