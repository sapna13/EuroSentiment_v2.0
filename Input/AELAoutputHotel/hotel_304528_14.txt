{"text":"Wouldn't Stay Again We arrived to the hotel,it's huge  to be honest was a little overwealmed by the size. No one assisted us to get to check in  this was needed, no signs or assistance. The lady at check in didn't speak english well  was very confused by our booking  we then got taken to the Royal Lounge as we had a private check in due to the room we had booked. They were unorganised  took forever to check us in, but we didn't let this bother us as they had just upgraded us to a suite.Nice one!! Room was large,nothing special, but suite stunk of smoke  we were on a non smoking floor. Reported this  they said there was nothing they could do, no change of room avaliable. We found our stay to be a horrible experience. I have no idea how that get a 4 to 5 star rating as our experience was less than 3 star. Huge hotel, not enough staff, not personal at all.Examples of why is:Shuttle offered as complimentary ride to Kuta was a beat up van falling apart. The driver stopped for petrol during our trip in  made us wait in a petrol station with locals all around, we felt unsafe.The pool bar is not acessible enough from the poolShower pressure was no existant with the water hot  cold during your showerOne of their resturants Ikan, whilst it is great food throughout the hotel, we waited for 15mins after being seated to be offered a drink  we were only asked after I had to get someone. There were people leaving  having to wave their hands around to get attention.Daily paper, well only once during our stay not each day.We will not return here due to the service, you pay big money to stay at a hotel like the Westin  expect a certain level. The club lounge is the best part of this hotel  the food is great. But you could get better facilities  service for half the price elsewhere.
