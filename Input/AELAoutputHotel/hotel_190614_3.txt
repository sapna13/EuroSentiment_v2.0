{"text":"Very good but a few problems One of the most pleasant features of this hotel is that there are few rooms compared with the amount of public space, so that the hotel mostly feels quiet and peaceful. The comprehensive national smoking ban in effect since 1 July 2008 has taken care of what used to be a huge discomfort for the non smoking guests. The rooms are spacious, decorated in a classic style (mix of French and Dutch) and very comfortable (example: complimentary loose-leaf teas and infusions + Illy coffee machine). The river view is unique. I did notice, like another recent reviewer, that there were many stains on the carpeting in the bedroom. The bathrooms are superb. The standards of housekeeping and the attention to detail are first rate and at the level of the top European palace hotels.The food in the Lounge and Brasserie has improved recently and the terrace on the river has been restyled.The spa area is not large but the fitness (new equipment), pool and sauna are very elegant and relaxing.The service in the Lounge, Brasserie and at La Rive for breakfast has become poor. Waiting time for dishes is far too long.Breakfast, rarely a strong point in Dutch hotels, has declined sharply (and is now poor value for money at 25 - 40 euro): no more delicious home-made jams, poorer quality breads, average pastries, more limited buffet selection, etc. This is particularly surprising, given the quality of Edwin Cats' cuisine at La Rive. The staff at breakfast was slow and confused, and I overheard several guests complain.The Amstel is still one of Europe's very good city hotels, but it should urgently sort out the service problems in the restaurants and it should serve a world-class breakfast.
