{"text":"Hotel Jazz is all you need to know where to stay in Barcelona! Thanks to the reviews from Tripadvisor, we decided to book this hotel, mainly due to its location and price. We took the Aerobus for 4.05 euros per person as suggested by fellow reviewers and it was easy, fast, convenient and cheap to get to the hotel. The bus stop at the airport is short walk on the right hand side of the exit and you pay the driver. Get off at Place Universitat. The bus does not stop at all stops unless someone rings the bell so be sure to look out for the stops that it passes by in this sequence:Airport - Place Espanya - Gran Via Urgell - Place UniversitatThen, it is a very short walk to the hotel, like 3-5 mins.The check-in was smooth and allowed us to check-in a bit earlier but we were given a room on the 3rd floor. We could hear and feel the rumble of the subway but it didn't bother us at all compared to right after sitting next to the washrooms on the plane. Besides, the subway stops running in the middle of the night. After check-in, we went directly to bed after our tiring and sleepless flight. We heard a couple checking into the room next door a couple of hours later and could hear every word that they said and their door slamming but we were just too tired to complain and went back to sleep. After that experience, we never heard our neighbours again for the 3 nights we stayed there. We suspected that they probably moved to some other room and the room next door was vacant for the rest of our trip.The room was very spacious and larger than expected, especially our double bed, pieced together with 2 beds which ended up looking more like a queen. The washroom was also very spacious and comfortable. The room also came with a 6-digit safe. There is also a computer hooked up to the Internet for guests to use on the 1st floor next to the restaurant which was handy. We got the 2-day Bus Turistic (26 euros per person) which had its pros and cons. It is a relaxing and safe way to get to all the tourist attractions but one loop itself takes about 1.5-2 hours and you have to factor in the wait and sightseeing times...ended up not visiting a lot of sites. Be sure to check out the coupon book before you visit any sites to get discounts. It is worth taking the elevator to the top of Sagrada Familiar and La Catedral. The hotel's location is great and we walked to Casa Mila, The Pedrera, the Gothic Quarter, and La Rambla. Went to the Boqueria's El Quim for lunch @ 12pm once. We had huevos fritos con chipirones (fried eggs with squid) and setas con salteadas con foie (wild mushrooms sauteed with foie) which were marvelous!Starbucks is next door and there is a Farggi in the FNAC at El Triangle. One evening we ate at Restaurante Navarra on Paseo de Gracia 4 (walkable) at North American dinner hours without any problems. There were some people eating too but most people were just having coffee or alcohol. They have good prices and daily specials.Got an upset stomach after eating at Ciudad Condal\/Ciutat Comtal and ended up finding a hygienically safe (you know it when their washrooms have soap) and wonderful place with fantastic views of the city for meals for the rest of the trip. This place is the restaurant on the top floor of the El Corte Ingl√ã√\u2022√ñs @ Pla√ã√©?a de Catalunya which we walked there easily! I call it a true gem. We ate at the restaurant with waiters but there is a self-serve section deep inside the restaurant where you can grab cheap, quick meals with a view of the city, or you could be seated at either served sections inside or with view. The food in the self-serve didn't look appetizing to me and we didn't try it but the food at the served restaurant was good.We booked the hotel about 3 months before our trip directly from the hotel's website offering a rate of 105 euros and saw the price increase as the days went by. We will definitely stay at the Hotel Jazz again if we come back to Barcelona.
