{"text":"loved waikiki Me and a friend went down to Waikiki from New york to see the Kokua festival! We arrived on friday afternoon at 330, our room was ready and neat. We requested 2 double beds but only got a king, which was fine b\/c we are both little. The hotel is right across the street from the beach. It has a small pool but not many people are usually there so it is a good alternative to the beach for a while. The strip in waikiki is within walking distance where there are shops and restaurants. It is a really beautiful city. We went snorkeling on the outrigger which was awesome, we saw huge sea turtles. The rooms are a little small b\/c they put a huge tv stand which isnt needed, but its ok I dont go on vacation to sit in the room, it was clean and the water pressure was good thats all i care about. The views are just amazing from any point on the island. The hotel has balconies in each room. There are ABC stores everywhere, and if you go it will become a running joke on how many are within a 2 block radius. We had to extend our stay and they only gave us an extra hour, so for $20 we got an extra two hours to shower before our flight. But everything was awesome, will plan on coming back next year. I will post pictures when I get them up! :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":917,"mention":"ABC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ais_kacang"],"startOffset":914},{"endOffset":917,"mention":"ABC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ais_kacang"],"startOffset":914},{"endOffset":917,"mention":"ABC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ais_kacang"],"startOffset":914},{"endOffset":917,"mention":"ABC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ais_kacang"],"startOffset":914}]}
