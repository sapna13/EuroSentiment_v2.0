{"text":"Perfect in Seattle My partner and I stayed here for 3 nights in late October. We booked it based on the reviews on this site and knew that it wasn't right in town (which is a huge bonus) - but we like to walk because we feel it's the best way to get the feel of a town.First up - the location is absoultely perfect! There are plenty of places to eat and drink near by - our pick is the Blu Water Grill across the road (say hello to Pat from the Aussies and see if they still have my drink coaster on their wall of fame). A bit futher along are heaps of other restaurants. For breakfast, if you don't wish to do the free breakfast, go the other direction and visit the Grand Central Cafe and Bakery on Eastlake Ave for great coffee and fresh bread (and also visit the other places and shops around Eastlake).The hotel itself was very clean, quiet and comfortable. There is a great business centre for free interent, a little store for snacks and drinks, and plenty of fresh towels every day. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Our room was huge and had everything you need.The walk to the Space Needle or the centre of town is 20-30 mins which isn't bad - but there is the free shuttle and though we didn't use it - it was always arriving or leaving for the other guests so I imagine it would be great.A must do is to go across the road to the Seaplane flights and take a ride (with Jim) over Lake Union, Lake Washington and around Seattle - absolutely fantastic! We would definately stay here if we get back to Seattle! One last thing - find the 'troll' under Hwy 99...
