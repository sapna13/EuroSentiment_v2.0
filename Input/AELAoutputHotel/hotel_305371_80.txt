{"text":"One of Hong Kong's Best! Just completed my third stay at this Conrad -- three days in length. I travel to Asia 5-6 times a year from the States and last year switched to the Conrad from the Pen for two reasons: first, I decided for 2005 to consolidate all travel to staying at Hilton properties, and second, a business partner living in HKG recommended I try it. Suffice it to say, each visit met or exceeded my requirements. The service is exactly what you'd expect from a 5-star Asian property; in a word, stellar. From bellmen to concierge to check-in to chamberstaff, everyone encountered seems genuinely committed to the guest's satisfaction with their stay.As a Hilton Honors Diamond member, an upgrade to the Executive Level room (second and third visits I was rewarded with a harbor-facing suite) is automatic, if available. The Executive Level Lounge provides breakfast, drinks and evening snacks at no charge; while this is not enough to constitute a meal, it seems that many people frequent the lounge before venturing out for their day's work or prior to dinner. The view is amazing. The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet. Beds are most comfortable with your choice of pillows, comforter\/blanket available upon request. TVs with plenty of english-speaking channels (also a few french, italian, spanish and arabic). Amenities such as chocolates, tea, fruit and bottled water are gratis and plentiful. Wired or wireless Internet access is reliable (but not inexpensive). The service can be as solicitous or unobtrusive as you prefer; simply set your door for Do Not Disturb.I keep referring to the service as it impresses me so. Here's a couple of examples: I have a standing request for a bucket of ice in the room upon arrival and each evening before 6pm -- this is always accommodated. Another is a second clock in the room set to east-coast US time so that if I wake in the night I can immediately decide whether I want to communicate with the office. These are the kind of touches I don't find in many other properties.I can't speak to shopping, location or restaurants near the Conrad as most evenings I'm out with clients or co-workers near TST, and as locals, I leave the decision making to them. I can attest to a short walk to the Star Ferry, even shorter to the MRT subway 1-stop to TST and near to the Peak Tram.August 13 my wife will finally accompany me to HKG for a week then on to Beijing (Peninsula there -- I've also reviewed) fro another week. I will post an updated review thereafter as I will likely be able to speak to shopping, restaurants and sightseeing. Shen-Tzen, Lantau and Lamma are on the itinerary.Hope this helps my fellow business travelers.
