{"text":"Excellent choice Coming in from Toronto, we stayed for one week at the Bahia booked in to the Premier section and if I stayed again then it would be in the same area. Reading most reviews here and I would echo all thats been said about this resort. Its a beautiful place and most definately 5 star. Our room over looked the beautiful pool and it was heaven for one week. Ive been to quite a few resorts in Cuba , Mexico and others in Punta Cana and Puerta Plata and this one is definately up there with my other favourites. From the moment we arrived greeted by the manager Jetro, till we left with a wave from the lobby barman Jose, we had a great vacation. I had 2 minor complaints on this trip and both are nothing to be concerned about if your heading here. # 1, the house red wine is absolutely disgusting its like red vinegar, it has to be the worst red wine in the world, lol. Buy a nice bottle of red from their wine list around $13. #2, the place is way too big and thats why I stayed mostly in the premier area but as I said, this was my choice. Its a great place and a great choice for your vacation. Ive read these other reviews and theres a couple of complaints but my wife and I honestly had a great time. Do not let the sellers in the market rip you off. Whatever they tell you offer them 10% of their asking price cause that price will be closer to the right price. We experienced no problems coming in or leaving at the airport with both flights right on schedule. As much as I like the Dominican ( our third visit ) I cant see us going back there. I like to leave the resorts and other than going on a jungle tour or the likes, I didnt fancy heading out in to the Punta Cana area without someone watching out for me. PS: The Japanese restaraunt was awesome.
