{"text":"Excellent hotel at the top of the hill I got a room here on a Priceline bid. I would not have paid the full price on my own, but this turned out to be a great place to stay for less money than I would have paid for a lesser hotel. Gotta love Priceline. The hotel is centrally located and a quick walk to Union Square and tons of restaurants. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a classy place catering to people with money and nicer and more intimate than the Fairmout across the street. As a business traveler, I found the connection to the Internet to be quite expensive and never found an Internet caf√ã√\u2022√ñ closeby. Tried to do all my emails in 10 minutes for $10. Sheesh. The room was big enough. Not huge, but just right for one person. The beds were great with terrific linens. The bathrooms were clad with marble. They put me on the 7th floor at the back of the hotel, away from the street noise, so it was quiet. The room looked over the bay and the Transamerica tower so it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like I was looking at wall of another building as you are at the top of Nob Hill. I walked down to Sears Fine Foods for breakfast each day. Walking back up the steep hill worked off those delicious pancakes and French toast, though I could have taken a cable car to within a block of the hotel. I really liked that the clock radio had a CD player built in as I always bring music along. I would definitely stay there again if the price was right.The hill is steep, so if you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ walk much, you might try something close in but downtown. Walking up and down that hill is serious exercise.
