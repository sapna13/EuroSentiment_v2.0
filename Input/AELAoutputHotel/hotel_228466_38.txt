{"text":"Anyone with a sense of taste avoid this I'm a frequent business traveller working with a Fortune 50 Company. Our corporation is notorious for selecting bad to terrible hotels for events and meetings. This rule was clearly confirmed this time. I stayed in the Fear Palace 3 nights and counted the minutes to leave. It clearly rates as one of the 10 worst hotels I stayed in (among 100's). Worst: - Food was unbelievably bad during the 3 days. It can't be described but I'm sure anybody who ever stayed there and has some sense for acceptable food knows what I'm talking about. One waiter was sweating so heavily during dinner that sweat drop poured into the food. This was the most disgusting experience in my life. I literally did not touch or eat the food for 3 days and only had bread. Some other attendants had problems after eating.- Rooms. Yes they are big. But I don't care if they a room is big my first priority is some cleanliness and an acceptable bed. Let me start with the cleanliness. It was DIRTY! On the entry door there where balls of dust that accumulated over the years that was never cleaned. The bathroom was outright disgusting. The shower (yes it is separate) was full of lime. The mirror to shave was covered in dirt. The bed was uncomfortable and the cushions were old and smelly. The whole room had a very strange smell. The cabinet doors couldn't be opened without force. It was a terrifying experience. It goes on and on like this....- Service. Apart from a super incompetent service at the lobby I tried to order something on the room the first night. After a couple of tries I gave up. I never had to do that in my life.- Infrastructure. The infrastructure is outdated and looks like late 80's. Internet did not work and we had to be reimbursed. They were not able to keep the temperature at an acceptable level in a room with 300 or so people.I could go on and on..... but if you are a business traveller or anyone with a little taste or sense for hygiene avoid this hotel.
