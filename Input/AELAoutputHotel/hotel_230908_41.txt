{"text":"Comfortable but cramped I stayed here for three nights in Dec. Whilst we were on a budget we tried to get a decent hotel for our money. The hotel itself was very clean,tidy and modern and well equipped. Our beds were extremely comfortable but the room was let down by the size of the bathroom. The door was made of frosted glass and you had to open it outward into the bedroom. If you opened it inward, you banged it into the toilet. The shower doors were similar. There was very little space to put your toiletries, and I'm glad I didn't take my cat as there wouldn't have been room to swing it! The maid service also left a lot to be desired. On the first day we were a towel short and had to ask for another. My friend broke a coffe mug which was not replaced and the shower gel ran out and was not replenished. The floor also didn't look like it was hoovered on the second day. Quite poor. The bar area was nice and not too overpriced, the menu looked good too, although we never ate in there. Neither did we have breakfast as it was an additional 16 Euros. You will also get charged tourist tax on cecking out which in2.5 Euros. Whilst I was checking out, the receptionist was half way through dealing with me when she ignored me in favour of taking a reservation over the phone. Very rude. On the plus side the concierage was very helpful and his English was good. Not a bad location but there are others that are probably more central for the same price. ","annotations":[]}
