{"text":"Excellent hotel in wonderful location I am so pleased I booked this hotel. My wife and I arrived on a Saturday evening and were met by extremely pleasant English speaking reception staff. Within a few minutes we were shot up to our room on the 28th Floor by an express elevator. (The speed is amazing) Our room faced the Fernsehturm and we had a beautiful view of the city below. Our business class room was very clean and welcoming. Many reviews here mention the quirky shower \/ toilet facility in the room but no one has actually mentioned how the thing works. The door is on a hinge that lets it swing 180 degrees which allows it to be the toilet door one moment and the shower door the next. Very ingenious indeed. Great Kaffee shop at the entrance to the hotel which is where we would get take away morning coffee as there are no facilities in room for hot drinks. The location is excellent being just across the road from Alexanderplatz station which has the S-Bahn and U-Bahn. There are also trams and buses and the travel round zones A and B is cheap and easy to work out. However we walked most places to soak up the atmosphere and you will be surprised how many markets you come across, they do it in a big way. We went primarily for the Christmas Markets and were not dissapointed at all. They are everywhere and the effort that is put into them is superb and made the trip very worthwhile. I could go on and on because we had such a fantastic experience but the bottom line is that this is a very clean, popular, busy well run hotel in a truly great location. I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone I know. Final points to note; take a hat as it is very cold and beware they do not have the no smoking ban in public buildings yet and it seems that everyone smokes and avoid the minibar in your room. 2.90euro for a beer you can buy for 95cents in the Galleria shop opposite the hotel.
