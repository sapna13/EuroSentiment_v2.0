{"text":"Metropark - excellent value I stayed at the Metropark for 7 nights in March based on the reviews here. The hotel was great - terrific value. Thanks to everyone who posted!I booked a Harbourview room which was fine - spotlessly clean, an ok size, good bathroom, comfy bed. Internet access was free and a decent speed. Shampoos, etc topped up daily and a newspaper delivered every morning.It was nice and quiet but so close to the MTR station, bus stops and tram stops. Couldn't have been more convenient to get around! What a brilliant transport system!The staff were helpful and polite when I needed them which was only twice as the stay was smooth as anything.The food in the restaurant was so-so, I only ate there on my first night as I was tired from the flight. Whatever you do, don't go to the Chilli Garden a few doors down - my food (chicken) was literally raw and they still tried to charge me as they offered to reheat it. Can you imagine!7-11 and a supermarket just steps from the hotel for water, beer and other essentialsI'd recommend staying here as the price is great for the level of service and the nice rooms. The rooftop pool was also lovely with incredible views.On a side note - get the Octopus card and just hop on and off buses, trams, ferries and MTR. Fantastic. Pay a visit to the Peninsula Hotel (I went to the Felix restaurant for dinner - incredible!). The Peak tram is fun as is the bus ride to Stanley. Spend a day or more in Macau, interesting place. Of course the Star Ferry is a must and so is playing on the trams and getting the escalator to the Mid Levels. Amazing choice of bars and restaurants there.Great shopping, brilliant food - what a top holiday!
