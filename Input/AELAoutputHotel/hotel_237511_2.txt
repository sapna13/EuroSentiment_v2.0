{"text":"service extraordinaire at Hotel Giglio Arrived at the Hotel and didn't quite know what to make of it all. A bit out of the hustle and bustle of he tourist area, but an easy walk to it all, the entrance to Hotel Giglio was very non-descript , The street level door opened like something out of the Adams family. A full flight up (there was a tiny elevator big enough for a person and a bag) led you to a charming, not fancy, extremely friendly small hotel. Our room was a good size, not fancy, but comfortable and clean.The room we had overlooked a courtyard. Through the large shuttered window,we saw fruit trees, ripened pomegranites on one, peoples' cars, laundry hanging from other buildings-in a word-charming.Breakfast was buffet style served in a small comfortable dining room. It included a large variety including fresh fruit each day. You could get capuccino made to order, brought to your table,and eat all you want. But BY FAR, the most impressive thing about Hotel Giglio was Marco! He was there to help in any way possible, The service was like nothing I have ever experienced. He helped us make a reservation in Venice (a last minute change of plans.) He saw when I left that I was a bit nervous about the arrangements. You can only imagine my shock when the next night I received a call at my hotel in Venice from him asking if all was well and if I was happy with the accommodations. Goodness!!!! ","annotations":[]}
