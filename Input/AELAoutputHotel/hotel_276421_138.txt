{"text":"Great Vacation! We stayed from 7\/17\/06-7\/24\/06. As many others have written we were apprehensive about going due to the bad reviews. There were 4 of us, 2 adults and 2 teenagers.First, Do Not take traveler checks. They are very hard to exchange. Also, if you use credit cards they charge you a fee. US dollars are accepted everywhere.Next, the food. We never went hungry and no one got sick. There was always plenty of food to choose from. Remember, their trying to please many different nationalities. However, in the buffet resturaunt near the beach, birds fly in since there is no netting to keep them out. We did see some on the food a few times, but the workers shooed them away. We thought the food was better at the front buffet resturaunt near the lobby. As for the specialty resturaunts , the Mexican was good but it's still served buffet style, early seating is a bad time, it's way to hot! The Japanese we had reservations for but heard that it was not very good so we ended up not going. The Caribe was okay, it is the only air conditioned one and you were served by the staff, they were very friendly. When you get your room number make your reservations for those resturaunts right away. Beware of the milk in the carfe's which they use for the coffee in the am, more than once they poured my coffee then the milk and it was spoiled. The room, We had to wait about 2 hrs for our room since our flight was early. I packed our swim suits and a couple of towels in our carry on, while we waited the kids went swimming. We were in the Villas, the room could have used a little upgrading but I think we spent at the most 1 1\/2 hrs a day in the room other than when we slept. We left our maid $2 a day and she always made sure we had plenty of towels and water to brush our teeth with. Our ac always worked. When we arrived in our room there was a broken window in the bathroom. We told our Apple Rep and they fixed it the same day. Once we had no water for a few hours but we were leaving for the pool anyway so it really didn't matter. The water was back on by the time we were getting ready for dinner. It is quite a walk from the villas to the beach but they always had a shuttle bus running. The nightly shows are near the villas and there is a bar over the pool which is nice. Make sure you take wash cloths, they do not give you any.The staff, all in all everyone was pleasant enough, there were a few times when we had to wait at the reception area, it was somewhat disorganized. The most unpleasant person we encountered was the lady who takes the reservations for the resturaunts. The beach, Wonderful. It is beautiful. The only drawback is there are no umbrellas. Invest in one the attaches to the lounge chair and take it with you if you can. We went para-sailing, awesome!I 'd have to say our overall experience was good. We met some wonderful people from the UK and plan to go again next year with them. Remember, it's what you make of it. If you want to find something wrong you will.
