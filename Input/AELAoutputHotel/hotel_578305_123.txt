{"text":"Second Stay also a Success My wife and I stayed in this hotel over the Thanksgiving weekend. We did so last year at the same time of year. Both times we enjoyed our stay here. Breakfast is included and it is plentiful and delicious. A happy hour is held from 5:30PM to 7 PM (no alcohol) but that was wonderful as well. Situated close to Times Square and Broadway. Subway very close by. Bryant Park is 1 block away and had many temporary shops and ice skating. Staff was pleasant enough, but we did have several requests go unanswered. We asked for a new change of linens each night contrary to hotel policy of only Tuesday and Friday. 3x this was requested and never honored. The TV had a faulty connection to the cable outlet and I had to play TV repairman more than once. The corner light stand did not operate at all. The bathroom was extremely small--room for one person only and just getting the door closed you had to pay attention or else. We stayed in 3104 which gave us a nice view of the Empire State Building. However last year we stayed in 2206 and it was much much bigger. Rooms ending in 06 and 08 are much bigger and those facing the Empire State building are the ones you want to request. With city and state tax we paid $352\/night for this hotel, so the value received is borderline in my opinion. For that much money I want a fresh change of linens and towels. We are very conservative and do not waste, so for one week out of the year we like to indulge with fresh linens. All things considered we enjoyed our stay as repeat visitors. Next year though I will be price shopping more than I did this year. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":985,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":981}]}
