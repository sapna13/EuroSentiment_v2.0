{"text":"my absolute new favourite hotel I had to be virtually dragged out of the Park Hyatt Tokyo, kicking and screaming, I could quite happily taken up residence there for quite some time. It is quite simply impeccable- the decor, the service- the attention to every detail is amazing and yet never intrusive- how very Japanese.Our room, on the 47th floor, was a zen paradise of tranquil colours,fantastically organised space and amazing bathroom- yes, the toilet is quite incredible.They have an amazingly impressive mini bar too and .... they also have amazing coffee and tea making facilities-I give extra points to any hotel that provides a kettle in the room, so that you can actually make your first cup of coffee without waiting around and dealing with the fuss of room service first thing in the morning.The view is astonishing.The common areas are astonishing too, the restaurants, the reception and library area-it was just so easy and beautiful and calm,we had come from Europe, spent two days in New York - so already pretty jet lagged, then flown 14 hours from Washington - with the jet lag associated with that -by the time we got to Tokyo, we weren't sure which way was up, this is a very soft place to land, if you feel like that ! We ate at the New York Grill the first night- the service was great, but to be honest, I was so jetlagged the food didn't really register ! Then at Kozue- the Japanese restaurant- which was great and then at Girandole, for breakfast and also a couple of lunches- wonderful view and wonderful people watching!The pool and gym are amazing - underneath a glass atrium overlooking the whole of Tokyo - it is an experience to use them!The concierge service is completely wonderful,all- knowlegable, (seemingly) effortlessly effiecient, they can organize everything from personal shopping trips to any restaurant reccommendations\/tickets for travel and pretty much anything else you could desire.Use the the bus service back to Narita airport -don't bother either schlepping your bags on the Metro or getting a hugely expensive taxi- the bus stops right outside the hotel and the concierge will arrange your ticket(of course!) and then everything will carefully packed away in the hold for you.I know I seem to be overusing superlatives here, but this hotel is amazing,some reviews have mentioned how expensive it is, and it is certainly not bargain basement! but, firstly, Tokyo is not exactly a cheap town and secondly, we had just spent time in New York at the Soho Grand, which was a dismal and grubby experience(see review, if interested!) and that was MORE expensive than the PHT - this is worth every penny,Tokyo can be frenetic and confusing and it is wonderful to come back to somewhere so calm and comforting - and the experience of standing in the sky lobby at 5:00 am (the jetlag!)watching the sun rising over the whole of Tokyo, with Air playing softly in the background, having my own cinematic moment - well, as the advert says-that was priceless !If I could give this hotel six stars, I would.
