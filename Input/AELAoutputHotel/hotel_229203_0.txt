{"text":"Staff Was Terribly Rude - Will not Return! I doubt I would ever stay at this hotel again. While the hotel was clean and roomy, a staff member was horrendously rude to my family and I and it appears to me that an attempt was made to overcharge us. To preface this, I have traveled in Europe before and consider myself a good traveler √à√\u2020\u2022?I know it is not home and that things are different, and I embrace that aspect. I also prepare ahead and check my facts carefully, so this horrible experience was a complete surprise.On this occasion, I was traveling with my family of five (three adults and two teenagers). We booked our room on Holiday-Inn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ website, which described it as a, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¶\u201A√á¬®√ì√∂¬®AMILY SUITE√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?for, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¶\u201A√á¬®? PERSON(S) MAX PER ROOM√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?When I booked, I clearly indicated that we were a party of three adults and two children. The quoted rate, confirmed in my confirmation e-mail, was √à√\u2020√ü?49 + √à√\u2020√ü?0 (labeled as, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨xtra Persons Charge \/ Night.√à√\u2020\u2022? = √à√\u2020√ü?69.Prior to coming to the hotel, I called Holiday Inn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ international desk (I do not know the exact name of this department), and confirmed that the ages of the children would not place them in √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ödult√à√\u2020\u2022?status at the hotel. I do not think that it was the desk agent who misinformed me, as the events that transpired the day I checked in seem to indicate a hotel-based problem.Per my reservation, my family arrived on October 8. We all entered the lobby together around noon; checked in; verified the number of people, rate, and charges; and signed for our rate. We were advised that our room was not ready, and that we could access it after three. I emphasize that we checked in at this time, and we verified the rate and extra charges with the clerk.At approximately 9:15 the same night we returned from an exhausting day in Berlin and approached the front desk to pick up our key. A different clerk was working. The clerk advised us that we would need to pay √à√\u2020√ü?5 extra for each of the two children (for a total of √à√\u2020√ü?0 extra) as the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ policy was that each extra child had to pay. I politely advised the clerk that we had booked the room at a rate of √à√\u2020√ü?49 plus an additional √à√\u2020√ü?0 for the adults, that we had indicated the presence of two children when reserving, that we were not eating breakfast at the hotel, and that the international desk of Holiday Inn had confirmed that the children would not be considered adults. The clerk√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ tone then became, in my perception, very, very rude, and frankly I perceived the clerk√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ attitude to be disparaging. The clerk advised us that in addition to our quoted rate we must pay √à√\u2020√ü?0 total for the two children. I offered to show the clerk my confirmation e-mail, but the clerk refused, advising us again of the need to pay √à√\u2020√ü?0 extra. The clerk then advised us that the clerk believed that we were getting an excellent √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeal.√à√\u2020\u2022?I asked the clerk why it was that we were not informed of the additional √à√\u2020√ü?0 charge when we checked in earlier in the day, and the clerk stated that the charge simply had to be added. I further advised the clerk that had we been told of the charge in the morning when we checked in, I could have sought another hotel with a more reasonable rate during the day. The clerk then had the audacity to say, in what I perceived to be a very rude tone, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬µou would leave over 30 euros?√à√\u2020\u2022?This was stated in front of other guests, and with one of the children in our party present. I advised the clerk that we would, and that we would like for the staff to seek another hotel. Finally, the clerk looked over our records, and indicated that since I am an ICH priority member, the charges would be waived.I should add that it seems audacious that the hotel charges an extra fee for each person after the first adult in a family suite, and that while the fee is √à√\u2020√ü?0 for adults, it is √à√\u2020√ü?5 for children over 12. I personally suspect that the employee interpreted the hotel policy incorrectly, or that the hotel was trying to add fees inappropriately. ","annotations":[]}
