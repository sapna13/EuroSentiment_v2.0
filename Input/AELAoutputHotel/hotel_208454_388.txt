{"text":"Bravo Sofitel!!!!!!!!!!! I opted for this hotel after the mainly positive reviews posted on trip advisor. I am one who can be a harsh critic and when I'm spending my money. I have an attitude that I should get what I paid for and I'm entitled to premium service. We have stayed at numerous hotels around the world some better than others. New York City based on experience is a place that can be dicey when it comes to accommodations. In many cases the room was OK the staff not so hot, location etc....never have we stayed at a place that put it all together.That is until we stayed at the Sofitel, from the minute we arrived to our departure this hotel has found the formula. An excellent attentive staff that genuinely seem to care how not just your stay is but how your overall trip is going. Polite, professional, conscientious, dedicated are only a few of the many QUALITIES I could use to describe their team.If anyone was considering getting into the hotel industry they would be wise to go and stay at Sofitel for a week to get an understanding of how a hotel should be run.The rooms were stylishly furnished, immaculately clean, the bed comfortable with basically no street noise. The location was proximate to everything New York has to offer. There is no doubt when we return to NY where we will be staying. As a matter of fact I was so impressed with this place we would build our vacation time around the hotels availability.Bravo Sofitel!!!!!!!
