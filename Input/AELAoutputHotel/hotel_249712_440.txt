{"text":"Loved it, great possition, wonderful views We stayed here after having a two week holiday in Mexico, we are a couple with two children aged 6 and 8. We have never been to America before and it has been a dream of mine to go to New York since I was a child and the hotel could not have been better. The reception check in was friendly and fast, the lifts up to the 41st floor were fast and earpoppingThe room was large enough with 2 double heavenly beds with all the usual aminities associated with a 4 star tourist and business hotel, the bathroom and storage space is fine with a large entrance area which is great for dummping all your shoppingThe view was amazing, I have never been so high in a building before, I could look at that view for ever, especailly at nightIt is situated very well for everything, we walked everywhere and when it rained just hopped into taxis.The staff at the hotel were always very polite and helpful, the room was spotlessly clean, the heavenly bathroom was ok, the showers are great but the bath was a shallow short little affair, not big enough for a long soak but ok. the heavenly bed was not my cuppa tea, the bedding was wonderful but the bed itself was way too soft for me and with two on us sleeping in it we did tend to roll together, also under the sheet there was a matress pad type of thing that would gather up and you would end up sleeping on big folds of matress pad, this bothered me as I am a bit like the princess and the pea and anything from a grain of sand in my bed drives me mad so you can imagine how I felt about sleeping on creases!Don't eat at the hotel or use the mini bar as it's expensive but there are loads of deli's and places to eat everywhere just outside the hotel.Overall I would definately stay in this hotel again, it would suit everyone, we got a good deal where were got 3 nights for the price of 2, the overall cost for the 3 nights for the 4 of us worked out about about √ä√£¬¢400 ($780) at our great UK exchange rate, you would never get this standard of hotel in the UK for this price. And as a treat we got a limo to take us to Newark, it cost $130 (about √ä√£¬¢70) and well worth it, a great treat for the kids and given we had so much luggage it was really our only option, this was booked from the hotel reception.Great hotel but if you want a more homely traditional place then this might be a tad too modern for you ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1142,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1139}]}
