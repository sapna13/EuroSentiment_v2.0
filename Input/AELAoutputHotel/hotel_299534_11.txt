{"text":"A work in progress Hotel Jen is definitely reasonably priced relative to other hotels in HK, and is an attractively modern hotel with clean bright rooms. However, it needs a lot of work in the customer service department before I'd stay there again.I paid extra for a Jen room with a harbour view but thought it was worthwhile -- the Jen rooms are located on higher floors of the hotel so there are better views, plus you have exclusive access to the 28th floor facilities: lounge where free breakfast is served and free happy hour drinks, plus 2 computers for free internet access. You also check in on the 28th floor -- which would have been useful to know before I waited in line in the lobby for twenty minutes. The lobby was utter madness when I arrived -- the front desk staff were rude and slow, and the guests around me were all complaining about lost reservations, mixed up rooms, etc. The 28th floor was a peaceful oasis by comparison. I should note that, apparently due to the madness in the lobby, none of my friends calling the hotel were able to reach me--the line just rang and rang and no one picked up.The first room I got was bright and clean with a decent view of the harbour. The front desk sent up a plate of fresh fruit, which was a nice gesture but the employee sent to deliver it just barged into my room--while I was in the shower! The room also smelled faintly of cigarette smoke, which I was willing to tolerate but when I got back to the hotel after dinner, the room was actually smoky--apparently smoke got into the room from a smoking floor via the a\/c vents. The front desk was less than pleased to change my room when I asked to move, and took their time getting me a new room. The second room I got had a broken window shade so you couldn't even open up the curtain to see the view that I paid extra for, but it was smoke-less so I stayed. A major downside of the hotel is its location. There are no MTR stops nearby so you can either try and build your day around the limited schedule of the hotel's shuttle bus (it doesn't run at night) or just take taxis everywhere, which is what I ended up doing. I find the airport express to be the most convenient way to get from the airport to hotels in HK, but given Hotel Jen's location, I paid for a shuttlebus from the airport directly to the hotel rather than taking the airport express to Central and then another taxi. Be sure to carry the hotel's card with you (address in English and Chinese characters) as none of the taxi drivers I had knew where the hotel was located.
