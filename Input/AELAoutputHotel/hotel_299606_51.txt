{"text":"Very acceptable My wife and I stayed here for three nights at the end of November. We booked via the Rendezvous Hotel group√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ own website, chose a room on the 7th floor, and requested a room away from the main road, which we were given, so top marks to the check-in staff. Our room was well fitted with good aircon, and kept very clean. The staff were friendly and helpful, with advice on transport etc..The hotel is in a great location, from the pavement outside you can catch a bus to almost anywhere in southern Singapore, and just a block away is the Dobi Ghaut MTR station. Bras Basah road changes into Orchard Road outside the hotel, so if not too hot you can walk to all the shopping malls. Raffles hotel is an easy walk, useful after a few Singapore Slings in the Long Bar! I bought one day√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ wifi from the hotel for SGD11.60, before I discovered that the Olympic Centre one block away offers completely free wifi 24x7 √à√\u2020\u2022?and there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a Starbucks there too, where the staff are very friendly and helpful. In fact everyone in Singapore was friendly, some a little too friendly, avoid being tempted into conversation by the tailors in Chinatown, or before you know it you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l have ordered a suit and half a dozen shirts.We never ate in the hotel, as there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a Kopitiam food court right next door, for great value breakfast, lunch, and dinner, with about a dozen different Asian cuisines on offer.We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° definitely stay there again; good rooms, helpful staff, great value and great location.
