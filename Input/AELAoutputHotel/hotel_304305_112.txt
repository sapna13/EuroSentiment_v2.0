{"text":"Great location, large room The Keio Plaza hotel is in the Shinjuku area, within walking distance to the JR station . This makes it easy to take the Narita Express from the airport and walk to the hotel, even with the roll along bags. It takes about a 10 minute walk and there is a travellator on the underground plaza (which makes it even more convenient than the street level). By taking train, you can be sure to avoid traffic jams. If you are travelling to Hakone, the direct express train starts from Shinjuku. The Tochomae station is about 2 minutes walk from the hotel and served by the Odeo metro line - which gives direct access to the Tsukijii fish market with the fresh yet cheap sushi and sashimi.I love the shopping malls at Shinjuku area as you can browse at the ever exciting food basement halls and do shopping. Good and reasonable restaurants are everywhere.I stayed at the Premier rooms and they are newly renovated. The size of the room is huge by Tokyo standard. My room faces the Tokyo Metropolitan Govt. Building and has a partial view of Mt Fuji on a clear day.I stayed at the Park Hotel Shidome Towers on my return to Tokyo as the Keio Plaza hotel is full. I am disappointed with the location - you need to take the metro or take a long stroll to more eating places. I need to take a taxi to the Tokyo Station to catch a return Narita Express to the airport. The room is very much smaller and the view is much better at the Keio Plaza despite being on the 2nd highest floor. It only cost slightly less and I will definitely return to the Keio Plaza on my next trip. I am disappointed that the Park Hotel was actually rated 2nd in the Trip advisor site for Tokyo.
