{"text":"Hype...Just a Lil We just completed a seven night stay at the Mandarin in Miami. Overall we were pleased with the stay but felt the hotel did not live up to our expectation of service from a Mandarin. Noone ever addressed us by name. I thought that was a signature for Mandarin. The service is definitely on the cold side except for the housekeepers They worked very hard and were always asking us if everything was okay and if we needed anything. They were just great.Front Desk left a lot to be desired, especially considering the usual standards of Mandarin Hotels. We asked on numerous occassions that the luggage needed to be brought up, but time and after time they forgot and we had to call and ask again. One morning we were awakened in error by a wake up call that was meant for another room. They apologized for the error.The hotel lobby and pool grounds are beautiful. The rooms are medium size, well appointed, and views are okay, nothing too great. There is construction going on next to the hotel and there are two big construction cranes. We could see one of the cranes from our room.The food and drinks at the pool were pretty good but nothing fabulous.I did not see anyone using the pool with the palm trees in it. They never offered to set our chairs up in that pool as it pictured on the web site photos. The pool with the palm trees is much smaller that you would think from looking at the web site photos.The hotel is a great respite from the constant action on South Beach. Every time I entered the hotel I felt like I was in my own sanctuary. Very quiet, great smells fill the air, it really is a relaxing environment.Free bottles of water at the valet desk and use of hotel umbrellas is also a nice touch.We went to the health club on a few days, it is very large and seems to have all the equipment one could need. The views of the city are nice, expect for the building across the stree that is under construction.We spent a lot on cabs, but felt the cab service we received was very good.We secured a great room rate throught Travelocity, we paid $200\/night for all seven nights.We enjoyed our stay but really have to say that we were disappointed that the hotel did not meet our preconceived notion of Mandarin service standards.
