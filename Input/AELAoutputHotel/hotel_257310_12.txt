{"text":"Average Hotel in a great location I stayed 3 nights at this hotel. I wanted peace and quiet and easy access to the sailing marinas, yet to be in walking distance to Darlinghurst.Although I had booked a superior Parkview room, I opted, on inspection, to downgrade to a standard room. The standard room (though without view of the Park or the marina) was slightly larger than the Parkview room! And quieter because there were late night parties (with blaring music) going on directly below the Parkview rooms. Anyway I got my peace and quiet and easy walking to the Marina.I was a bit taken aback at the rooms and the general feel of the Hotel. The rooms and bathrooms were small \/ medium sized. Likewise, the bathroom. It was a no-fuss, no-frills room. The general feel of the hotel, reception, lounge etc did not seem to me to be a 4 star hotel. It reminded me of the 3 star european chain hotels - a bit plasticky.The check in and staff were helpful in shuffling me about and handling my whims and fancies. They were also very helpful and knowledgeable about restaurants and places to go shopping. I needed a traveller's multiplug and sicssors, and newspapers. No problems - immediate with a smile.The hotel is next door to a provision store and a pub. So drinks and snacks were cheap - no need to spend huge sums of money on these at the hotel.A 10 minute walk to \/ from Kings Cross \/ Darlinghurst. Great for entertainment\/nice meals\/drinks A short 10 minute taxi ride to St George, Town Hall, etc for great shopping. Overall, not a bad but not a wonderful place to stay. ","annotations":[]}
