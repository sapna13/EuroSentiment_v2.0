{"text":"Fair and Balanced Review! My wife (and several other couples) enjoyed a week at the Iberostar Bavaro. Here's the deal:1. The Punta Cana Airport is an open air, modern thatched-roof building, and actually very nice. When you clear customs, be ready for the porters, who literally will fight to carry your bags to the bus. We needed to fend them off, since we had a lost bag issue (thanks a lot United - both coming and going), but would recommend dropping a couple of bucks to the porters since the buses are often 100yds out into the parking lot. 2. Iberostar Bavaro First Impression: This is a beautiful resort. Impeccable landscaping, peacocks, flamingos, spacious modern rooms, and overall a very well put together resort. We had no problems at check in, and we threw back a cold Bohemia beer during the process. 3. Dining: I have to agree with previous posters in some regards. If you're looking for Nobu (or even Benihana) - don't try the Japanese restaurant. The service here was terrible, even on the night when the Chief Executive's daughter (and resort GM) were sitting across the room. Yikes. We enjoyed the steak house and the Cajun restaurants. The service at these two were excellent. All other meals are at one of the buffets. The breakfast buffet was great. Eggs to order, bacon, fresh fruit, smoothies, interesting breads and cheeses. The lunch buffet (by the pool) was fine, and particularly good when they made paella. It did get repetitive, but it was totally acceptable to wander over and grab a plate (remember, at lunch we're coming off the beach in our bathing suits - do you really need waiter service for that - and they do come around and take drink orders) and eat a reasonably good meal. They had burgers, roasted chicken, salad, pizza, etc. Plenty of choices. At the main dinner buffet, I found that there were always plenty of choices - fish, roast beef, roast suckling pig (seriously delicious), and many many other options. You must realize that this is not a major metropolitan area where top chefs are plating Osso Bucco. Then again, you're not paying $35 an entree either.People: We've been to a number of resorts in the Caribbean, and I thought that the Dominicans were the most hospitable of all (only barely edging our friends in Mexico). Learn some Spanish phrases - would it kill you to say Gracias? Hola? Cafe con leche por favor? People were happy and pleasant and eager to please. I would also recommend generosity in tipping. Leonardo and Basilio at the beach bar (which we made a ritual of closing daily) essentially MADE our vacation.Entertainment: If you asked me (before my vacation) if I thought I would be on stage at all during my week, I would have told you  no way. Well, that didn't quite work out, and I had a great time as did our friends who also participated (and oh my...). Get involved, and have fun with it. The star friends work very hard away from their kids and spouses for weeks at a time, and they are all good and talented people trying to make a living. Get to know them! Off Campus:I HIGHLY recommend taking the horseback riding trip. We had a guide all to ourselves (after a 45 min ride to the ranch), and we went several miles up a beautiful palm-lined deserted beach to a gorgeous river delta. This is the Dominican Republic. I'm a lousy rider (not sure if my horse was named Rocket ,Thunder or Widowmaker but he was actually very well trained), and it was still an experience I'll always treasure. See the vendor in front of the hot tubs. Our friends went 4-wheeling and came back covered head to toe in mud and smiles! Golf: Play the Punta Blanca course - it's a 5 minute cab ride, (adjacent to the Riu) or go through GoGolf. It's $150 including carts, drinks, lunch and a bucket. Tees, greens and fairways are mint. This is a new course, so the waste areas are still not really playable. We played 2 1\/2 rounds here and had an absolute blast. We planned on playing LaCana (based on good reviews from other guests) but we had to cancel.Vendors: Take a short walk down the beach for t-shirts, cigars, jewelry, and other souveneirs. Be prepared to haggle - my t-shirt price started at $17 per shirt, and ended at around $4. Smile and have fun with it.Topless: This is common here, be ready and accept the good with the bad - if you know what I mean. It's really no big deal.Weather: Perfect. No more to add here.Have a great time!!
