{"text":"Sometimes excellent, sometimes missed the mark Trip Adviser This hotel is in a superb location, very close to the Ponte Vecchio and consequently both quiet yet near to a great number of places of interest. Close to a number of good restaurants and with its own excellent restaurant. It is less expensive than one would have thought for such a location. The rooftop restaurant provides breathtaking views of the city; breakfasts are good with a wide range to choose from, and in the evening the food and wine are excellent. At all times the restaurant service is impeccable, nothing was too much trouble.  The staff at the reception desk were friendly and helpful and will pre-book tickets for the galleries and museums for you. The rooms were clean, if city hotel size. There was no tea and coffee available in our room, despite its being advertised. We did manage to obtain this, but the adapter needed to get the kettle boiling disappeared √à√\u2020\u2022?we were told that the housekeeper had taken it as it was the only one in the hotel and was needed for the vacuum cleaners on all floors. You believe this? Eventually it was returned and remained with us. We could not find a lounge, were told that one was closed. Surely this is a necessity in a city hotel. These are however minor quibbles compared to having wonderful views of the city greeting us in the morning at breakfast as well as being close to the centre of Florence and also having the pleasure and ease of walking out of the front door and on to the Ponte Vecchio to watch the evening sunset.
