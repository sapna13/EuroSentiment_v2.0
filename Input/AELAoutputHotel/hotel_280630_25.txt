{"text":"Not horrible, but many problems Some background. I stayed two separate nights in September as I used Frankfurt for a base of operations. I left my luggage at the hotel when I had to connect back through Frankfurt.The first problem with this hotel is the name. When you arrive at the Hauptbanhof (Central Train Station) and ask a cabbie to take you to the NH City Hotel, he will respond there are three. If you haven't printed out your itenerary, then this will cause some confusion. (this happened both times I was there)When I arrived at the hotel, I thought the service was perfunctory. The receptionist shoved the registration card in my face even though I had filled it out before. When I asked if I had to fill it out again, she nearly bit my head off when I didn't instantly sign it. Sorry I don't know all the regulations!The second time I was there, they didn't put my stored luggage in my room when I arrived and didn't offer to help bring it to the room. I had to ask.The corridor rugs are filthy and it looks like a frat-house with beer stains (or worse). The rooms, however, are clean, quiet and nicely designed.The restauarant was wanting. I arrived late on a Sunday night and they all but ignored me. I had to go to the bar to order and then the food took forever to arrive even though there were more waiters than diners. They seemed more interested in closing down for the night than serving their customers. The pizza I ordered tasted like they went out and ordered it from Dominos. Though at least Dominos would arrive hot.The hotel was not a fortune, just over 100 Euros, but I had expected more from the NH. I would definitely choose something else whether I stay in Frankfurt or in another location with NH.
