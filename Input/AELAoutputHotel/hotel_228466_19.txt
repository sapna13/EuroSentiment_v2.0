{"text":"Not what you'd expect... The Fira Palace has got a wonderful lobby. The standard rooms are quite like what you see on its actual webpage so all in all, pretty pleasant.Again, location was excellent and I enjoyed the breakfast buffet which has an excellent spread. Rooms are spacious and well stocked with toiletries and towels (the massage shower in my room did not work very well though but still it was alright).However, a few things happened that have coloured my perception of this place. So much so that I'm writing this in my room in the hotel!Firstly, when I checked in, I noticed that the dates shown on the check-in card did not match the dates I had on my travel coupon (booked via a travel agent). When queried, the staff insisted that their dates were correct and because my travel agent amended the booking, my agent must have gotten the new set of dates wrong (2 nights less). The part that ticked me off was that they did not offer to try to resolve the situation for me. They simply told me to contact either my agent or the company handling their website reservations and that was it. However I did not believe that such a big mistake could have been made by my agent and only upon being very firm, did they go through all the hoops one would expect of a supposedly 4* hotel service to try to check what went wrong. Turns out they did not update their logs hence put the wrong information into their system!! But I did not get any apology, just a, no, no you are right in what I perceived as a semi-grudging way.Coming up to the room, there was a particular fried dough smell in the bathroom and only by opening the door to the room did it kind of fade away but every time you closed the door you could smell it. I presume it's from the restaurant downstairs (I was on the mezzanine level)? On other levels, you can smell it along the corridor. They clearly need to work on their air filtration system!The Wi-Fi internet service is not free but the price is reasonable (10,50Euros for 24 hours). However, the connection speed is variable (at one point being very, very slow) and the connection itself is very unstable. Once, the connection just died and I was unable to re-connect to the wi-fi spot despite multiple tries (my time was still ticking here). So again, I rang up reception who was slightly more helpful and claimed that the network was fine. However, the end result was the same as when I checked-in - that I had to ring the company providing the internet!Surely they would be able to check on my behalf given that it was a pretty simple problem. At the end of it, there also was no offer to extend my usage time to compensate for the time wasted. I rang the company myself and although the staff I spoke to claims the number is free, I will be very, very unimpressed if I get billed for it! Also, if they charge me for two extra nights from the check-in fiasco, I will be well ticked off.Overall, I have no qualms about the physical aspects of this hotel (e.g. location, decor, rooms etc) but its service leaves a lot to be desired.
