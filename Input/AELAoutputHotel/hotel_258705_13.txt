{"text":"Great Location for Red Sox Game - First Class Hotel Chose the HC because of previous reviews and proximity to Fenway Park. Requested high floor, Fenway Park view and got exactly that on the 4th floor. Front desk check-in folks were a little pretentious as most folks staying there were baseball fans and not high powered business folks, but maybe thats the Boston way. The Mass. Pike is between the hotel and Fenway Park, but we never heard any road noise because of excellent hotel construction and sound-proofing.Room was excellent with great a\/c, and top of the line bedding and bath items. Requested a fridge and box fan (for white noise) and both were delievered promtly. Valet parking was quick and efficient.Only downside was concierge's lack of help with obtaining boarding passes, which he said he would do and then didn't and the $10 fee for internet use. At $300+ for a hotel room, internet access, (which costs the hotel NOTHING) should be comp as it is at every Marriott property.Bottom line is that you can't get a nicer hotel with better location when in town for a Red Sox game. The front desk staff and concierge could be a little less uppity and a little more helpful though. Although these folks acted like THEY were the high class people in the place and the guests were somewhat lower class, I would be happy to compare paychecks and bank accounts with any of those young folks. More substance and less style would be good.
