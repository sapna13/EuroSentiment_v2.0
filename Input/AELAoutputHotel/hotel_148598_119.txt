{"text":"Think Twice Before Booking Rio Mar Beach Resort  We stayed at the Rio Mar Beach Resort  Spa on a business\/vacation trip. Service in the hotel and restaurants was awlful. Food selection was very limited and overpriced. Maid service was scarce. Rooms were dirty from the dust on the furniture, dirty showers, dust bunnies on the floors and gritty tile floors. Bed linens were not changed on a daily basis, AC was lowered or turned off in the evening hours by the hotel I guess to conserve electricity. Chasing down shower supplies and laundry bags in the halls from the chamber maids. We had a load of laundry washed, no dry cleaning, 25 items mostly socks and underwear washed. $97.00 for one load of laundry that propably got washed in a massive washer along with all the other laundry. We asked to use a washer and dryer , there are none on the property . Transportation costs were staggering. The adult pool had white slimy scum floating all around the edge of the pool,Pool deck was not kept clean. One of the barmaids spilled a drink off her tray onto the pool deck and it sat there all day . No one even bothered to clean it up. Unfortunately it was in front of our $150 cabana . So we had to walk around it all day . I was very dissappointed in this hotel, we usually stay at the Marriott properties. I will not be booking anymore Wyndham properties, that is for sure....
