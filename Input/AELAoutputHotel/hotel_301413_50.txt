{"text":"New Year at the Mandarin My wife and I have just returned from a week at the Mandarin Oriental in Hong Kong. This is our fifth visit to HK and our fifth stay at this hotel but the first since the renovations. One of the things we both liked about the hotel was the balcony which provided excellent views, so when we heard that part of the modernisation included enclosing the balconies to increase room size, we were interested to see what impact this would have on our impression of the hotel. We booked the hotel limo to pick us up at the airport on arrival, and once we had cleared customs, we were met by a hotel representative, who quickly relieved us of all our luggage and welcolmed us back to the hotel (nice touch). We were then escorted to our awaiting S class Mercedes which quickly got us to the hotel, where we again were welcolmed back. We were immediately taken up to our room where we checked in. We had a deluxe harbour view room, and again its not the biggest room in the world, but it is very luxurious, and it is easy to see where the budget went during the refurb. The room is split into 3 areas. The entrance \/ bathroom area. Bedroom, and a sitting area. The Bathroom is large with 2 glass walls looking into the bedroom. It has a bath, and seperate double shower, with what must be one of he best showers I've ever had. The bathroom also has a small TV embedded in the movable mirror. The bedroom has an enormous bed, with a large flat screen TV. The walls have all been covered in Walnut, and the room has mood lighting. It also has a large minibar which is very well stocked. Finally the sitting area has a day bed which allows you to take in the view from the floor to ceiling widows looking over the busy harbour. One of the best views ever. Also in this area is a desk with everything you need for your Laptop and a comprehensive stationary kit. These features are all great but its the little things that make all the difference, nice robes, slippers, fresh fruit everyday, shaving kit in the bathroom, hermes tolietries and amazing service all go to making this hotel something special. We visitied the Cafe a couple of times for light meals, and on New Years Eve went for the special set 6 course meal in the Mandarin Grill which was outstanding. The Grill at the Mandarin is possibly my favourite place to eat in the world, and it also has had a make over by Terence Conran, opening up the previously enclosed windows for a view over Charter square. I liked the the new decor, but I think I prefered it when it was a bit darker as it give it a more 'gentlemens club feel', but they still have the huge pullman style dining chairs. We also managed to squeeze in a few other places for eating\/drinking, the M Bar (which used to be Vong) on the 24th floor still a nice place for a pre\/post dinner drink. MO Bar at the sister hotel The Landmark, a pretty cool place for a drink. Felix at the Penninsular in Kowloon, go there at 8pm to catch the laser show..and remember to visit the toilets for further amazing views. and on New Years Day we went to Aqua on the 29th Floor of Peking Tower in Kowloon, again amazing views of the HK skyline and great food. Okay, to sum up, I agree that this hotel is focused on the business traveller, but this does nothing to stop you having a fantastic experience as a tourist. This hotel was my first experience of staying at 5 star hotels many years ago, and I still measure new hotels to this standard, so maybe I'm a bit bias, but staying here should be a pleasurable time for any traveller and its still my all time favourite..and I think its got even better with the refurb.
