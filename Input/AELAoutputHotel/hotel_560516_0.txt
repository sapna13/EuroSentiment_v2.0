{"text":"Different way of living We were there from 12-6 through 12-13. We had good flighs from the U.S.A. I had arranged for transportation from our resort several days before we left. It is highly recommended. There are no road or street signs after you are out of the airport. No stop lights either. Hang on for a ride of your life. Resort-- it was very nice, our room was #210 what a view, very nice room. Everything worked really good, good water pressure. King size bed also. Cayena is the small part of the resort,it is right on the beach. small pool and it has its own Restaurant( Elcano) and only the people staying there can use it. The people at the larger part can not and the beach area is the same. They do monitor the beach,pool and restaurant.  Food-- Well if you like luke warm to cold food you will love the food. All the buffets had luke warm food.The International restaurant that served fish was good.The deep fried Flounder was hot. The sea food place and the Italian place switched every other night. Remember this is a 3rd world country, there are no food regulations on how to wash dishes or cook food or what temperature the food needs to be cooked at. I asked 1 time if my meal could be cooked longer and the plate came hotter and the food was still cold. Bacon, pancakes, french toast, potato's everything was cold. There was this hot dish that no one had touched all the time we were their in the same pan that was brought out every day. They do not waste food. Cooks wash pans with luke warm water, than wipe them with paper towels. They use oil a lot when cooking.Utensils are put in a 5 gal pail of water then wipe off and reuse them. I had 3 days of bad stomach and wife had a bladder infection 4 days, it was not caused by S-X either. People-- are very very nice their. I would advise people from the USA to learn some spanish so you can communicate better with them. Every one was very helpful when my wife got sick. You can order any medication without seeing a doctor you want and they will send it over, but there are no instructions that come with it. Thanks to a college graduate from Yale that was to become a pharmacist that told my wife what to order and how many to take and when to take it, she made it though the vacation. Beach-- is very nice. Excursions-- the one where you go to a school, coco plantation, sugar cane plantation, cigar place and visit a actual home is a very good eye opener. Expect to spend around 9 hours for this trip and very bumpy. You really get to see how people in that counrty live and you can be thankful for what you have. My wife and I did bring some school supllies and clothes for kids at the orphange(ninosdecristo.com) that Melanie( works at the receptionist desk)helps out with. They can use what ever you can bring. We also tipped the bartenders and cleaning service, a couple of dollars goes a long ways, not many people did. These people do not make a lot of money. Over all it was Ok, I just wished the food would have been hotter and better tasting.
