{"text":"Hotel Elysees vs. American Airlines Service My wife and I stayed here for a week on late April, 2008. It was wonderful. Here is the difference between American Airlines and this hotel's service. On the last day, our flight from Paris to JFK was cancelled by American Airlines. We had already checked out of the hotel. We called American Airlines, waded through their voicemail options, and then were put on hold for 45 minutes. Finally, we were told that American Airlines could instead put us on a connecting flight but it wouldn't leave for another day. This flight would connect THROUGH DALLAS that would turn our 7 hour direct flight into 16 hours of connecting flights. I asked AA if they could put us on their direct flight the next day and they told us that there were no more economy seats left; there were Business Class seats but they were holding those for paying customers. Since we paid almost $800 each for our coach seats, I asked what is the definition of a paying customer. No real response. So we turned around and asked Hotel Elysees if we could book another night in the hotel. Unfortunately they were already booked solid and had no rooms available. But instead of just turning us away, they called another hotel down the street and then told us that this hotel would give us a room for the same rate we paid Hotel Elysees. We walked down the block and were put in one of Paris' nicest hotels and they gave us a $2000 per night suite for much much less. There was an outside balcony that overlooked the Eiffel Tower. It was amazing. And we've still never heard why AA cancelled our flight. ","annotations":[]}
