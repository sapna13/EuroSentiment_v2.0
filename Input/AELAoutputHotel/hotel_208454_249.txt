{"text":"Wonderful Hotel!!! My Husband and I took our 2 children (ages 13 and 10) to New York to celebrate our daughter's 13th birthday. We also brought along the grandparents to help celebrate with us. We booked 3 king suites for a 4 night stay (Thursday thru Monday). Our rooms were on the 29th floor which is the top floor of the hotel. There were only 10 suites on the entire floor. Each suite had a slightly different layout. We had a king sized bed in the bedroom with a pull out couch in the living room. There was a tv in the bedroom and the living room. The decor was very fresh and the room was very clean. We had maid service twice daily. There were fresh orchids in the room as well as cold bottled evian water and chocolates left each night. We decided to include the breakfast in our room package. This turned out to be a good choice as the breakfast was delicious. We made an 8:45am reservation at Gaby's for the duration of our stay. We were served freshly squeezed orange or grapefruit juice, coffee\/tea and a choice of entree. The food was freshly prepared and always hot. My kids enjoyed the french toast and the nutella pancakes. We required extra bedding for the pullout coaches and it was delivered within 15 minutes. The bathrobes and slippers were a nice touch. The concierge was extremely helpful with suggesting dining options. Rene was more than happy to call any restaurant to make a dining reservation. He suggested a great diner (Brooklyn Diner) which was on 43rd and Broadway. Great family restaurant. Overall, I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. I would absolutely return to Sofitel on my next trip to New York. You can't beat the location. At 44th in between 5th and 6th Ave you are in walking distance to theatre, dining and great shopping! We walked to Canal Street, Central Park, Macy's, Bloomies and Saks 5th Avenue with no problem. Don't forget to grab a green apple on your way out the door!!
