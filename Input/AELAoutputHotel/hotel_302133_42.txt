{"text":"Top Quality hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights commencing 12th November.We stayed in a standard Horizon room on the 21st floor and even this had a partial harbour view from the bay window.Check in was very efficient, a gentleman called Andrew welcomed us to the hotel and pointed out where the standard checkin was. We explained that we were staying in a Horizon room, he then took a list out of his pocket, checked our names, made a thirty second phone call and immediately took us in a lift to the 20th floor checkin. Everthing was ready and waiting and two minutes later we were shown to our room.The room was large and spacious with a king size double bed that was exceptionably comfortable. The room had a real quality feel about in and included a widescreen LCD TV.All drapes \/ curtains as well as the air conditioning was controlled by a bedside master control panel.The bathroom was very clean and well stocked with top quality toiletries. All staff were extremely efficient with the right touch of friendliness. The turn down service was also very efficent as staff always seemed to know when guests were out of their rooms.The Horizon club lounges were on two levels which gave a sense of calm in a very hectic city as they never seemed to be overcrowded. The views across to Hong Kong island from both of these rooms were stunning and there cannot be anything much better that sipping a cool beer looking across one of the most famous harbours in the world.Staff in the lounges were superb and nothing was too much trouble, there was a two hour happy hour from 5:30pm when all alcoholic drinks were complimentory and food was also provided.One of the lounges was open 24 hours and soft drinks, tea \/ coffee and nibbles including free unlimited use of an internet facility was avalable in this lounge.It is always a difficult decision to make as to whether to stay Kowloon side or HK Island side.If you choose Kowloon, then this hotel in my opinion cannot be beaten on cost \/ location and we would recommend it to anyone..
