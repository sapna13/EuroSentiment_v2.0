{"text":"Extraordinary Service, Wonderful Food This was my very first visit to Hong Kong and in the several days I was there I had several fairly complicated work-related things to accomplish.Within five minutes of my entering the Shangri-la a young woman, the service manager from the concierge service, invited me to sit down, offered me a cold drink, and asked me to tell her *everything* I needed to do while in Hong Kong.I talked; she took notes.She told me that the Shangri-la's concierge service would take care of everything. The only thing I needed to do was go to my room and rest after my long trip.My room on the 53rd floor had a literally breath-taking view of the harbor. My bed was enormous. The sheets were crisp. The bathroom was wonderful. (The TV screen above the tub is a very nice touch.)It's not easy to navigate work-related tasks in a completely foreign environment. I speak no Cantonese. My Mandarin is very basic. The Shangri-la made what might have potentially been a very anxious stay an entirely pleasurable and enjoyable one.The hotel's concierge service literally arranged everything for me, even down to very small details. (If you'd prefer to take public transportation to your appointments, we've written down instructions for what you need to do...)Contrary to what some others have said, I don't think I've ever experienced such a high degree of sincerely personal service in such a large up-market hotel. I had a very real sense that Shangri-la's staff were looking after me.The pool, by the way, is very nice. And taking a swim in it in the very early morning, with Hong Kong's spectacular skyscrapers looming nearby, is a delightful experience.
