{"text":"Stylish  After spending six nights at the Hotel Ibis Darling Harbor, the Hilton was a welcome surprise. As Hilton Gold members, we were put in an executive floor room with access to the lounge (free breakfast  hors d'oeurves).The room:Room was sparkling clean, a good size, and the shower had great water pressure. The water temperature fluctuated a bit, never too hot nor cold, but enough to be noticable. Amenities were the usual Crabtree  Evelyn La Source.Requested a king bed but we got two twin beds pushed together with a visible line down the middle. One of the few hotels with sufficient reading lights. Mood lighting and night lights were a nice touch. Had difficulty getting the room cool enough.The lounge:Couldn't locate the spring water  hors d'oeurves on the floor as described in the exec floor booklet.Lounge was nice but there were too few tables (or too many people) and food was not replaced quickly or often enough. The staff serving drinks were friendly and helpful. Hors d'oeurves were typically fried bits or dried out quiche, breakfast was diverse with a great juicer.Miscellaneous:The elevators were inconsistent needing the room key inserted before moving. Didn't get to the pool or bar but heard that they they are excellent.Location:Well-located, across the street from the Town Hall train station in the Queen Victoria Building. You can take the train two stops down to Circular Quay, the hub of the ferry system. Lots of restaurants and shopping.Summary:A great stay in a sleek and stylish hotel.
