{"text":"Fun Family Vacation Just returned a week ago from Sunscape (which is becoming a Dreams hotel). The highlight of our stay was the employees - everyone was uniformly friendly and helpful, and were particularly fond of our two kids, aged 9 and almost 8. The resort itself was beautiful - great meandering pool, magnificent beach, and super spa. Magnificent lobby. Rooms were nice - I don't know why people on this site complained. Very well organized excursion desks, transportation to\/from airport.The kids spent most of their time playing on the inflatable iceberg in the pool. Swim up bar was fun, as were periodic water volleyball, beach volleyball. Water was nice and warm but a bit rough in the ocean - kids definitely need adult supervision and hand holding - even the adults got knocked over by the waves once in awhile. Sand at the beach was soft, chairs comfy with thatched roof shades. Massages, steam room, sauna, showers and waterfall jacuzzi in the spa were great ! The food was only fair:Japanese hibachi: The best of the group but only three rooms, so you have to get there early (before 7AM).Chinese: 2nd best - some good dishes, some fair. A bit noisy due to the activities in the adjacent Japanese area. Also have to get there early.Italian: Pretty good (adjacent to the buffet area).Buffet: Fine for breakfast and lunch, decent for dinner.Oceana seafood: Not good. Everything tasted like it had been frozen, then overcooked.Dreams(?): Adults only - didn't get to try it out. Mexican: Never tried it, based on reviews from this site. Others who did, said it wasn't good.Nightly shows were hit-and-miss but the performers did try hard and the kids enjoyed them. The couples competition was hysterical (balloon popping, unique filling of cup with water, etc.). I don't want to sound snobby, but some of the guests were a bit loud, some not in very good shape, a few dressed slobbily for dinner. I guess that comes will all inclusives. Some were nasty at the Japanese restaurant due to the wait. We took one excursion, a half day snorkeling. One hour bus ride, then catamaran to a coral reef (pretty nice) and second stop at an enclosure housing nurse sharks and rays. This was awesome. Totally safe and exciting. Three female dancers on board were quite attractive and entertaining, between snorkeling stops and on the way back to shore. A nice diversion. Music was way too loud, though. Do they think the tourists are all deaf, or want to become deaf on their vacation?The island is terribly poor, lots of people living in tin shacks. Sad to see, but hopefully vacationing there puts some money into the economy via salaries of the employees.If you meet up with the right people, like we did (two other families from NJ), or if you just want to relax, you'll have a great time! The place is very nice and upgrading it to a Dreams (and eventually a higher price point, I expect) should make it even better.
