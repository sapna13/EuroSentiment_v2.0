{"text":"Fabulous Hotel, Fabulous Breakfast We stayed at this hotel for one night on May 28th. There were 6 adults in our party (3 rooms). The lobby is small and gorgeous. The staff is very helpful (maps\/directions\/advice) as previously reported. One of the gentleman brought our luggage up to our room. They also had a glass of Cava for us which was a very nice touch. The rooms were very, very, very small. My husband and I slept in a room with 2 twin beds. We could barely walk around the room once we had our luggage in. The bathroom was modern, clean and well-lit. They provide all necessary toiletries. We needed our luggage stored the morning of the 29th, as we were leaving on a cruise and had to wait a few hours for boarding. They allowed us to leave our luggage in a back room of the hotel while we went out and discovered Barcelona. The staff also arranged for us to get transportation to the ship.The breakfast in the morning was WONDERFUL! It was very worth spending more to include breakfast. They had all kinds of cheeses, meats, breads and pastries, lots of fruit, juices, yogurts and coffee. They even had eggs and breakfast meats (bacon, sausage). It was exceptionally good.The hotel is only a few blocks away from Ras Ramblas (the busy street with shops and restaurants). Also, the hotel is very accessable to the underground subway. We were able to hop on and off very easily. We would definately return and highly recommend it to other people. Good value.
