{"text":"Very Relaxing We have just returned from having spent 8 nights at the Intercontinenal Jimbaran, which was just what the doctor ordered we wanted a nice luxury hotel in which we could rest and unwind which is what we did. We had a duplex room which was lovely but found we did not use the lounge area much, our room over looked the pool and gardens which are beautiful. In the Singaraja wing the snacks they offer throughout the day are good.Lazing by the pool each day was very relaxing not overcrowded and the pool staff very attentive if you needed them, plus nice toilets, showers and changing rooms near pool. The Jimbaran beach is much better than Kuta which we visited and walked along one day we found it busy dirty not very nice at all.Our beach was cleaner but not many good places to eat so you are resricted to the hotel which can be pricey if you are eating all your meals there, but saying that all the restaurants were very good especially the Italian and the Japanese. We were lucky enough to be staying the week they had celeb Chef Bobby Chinn cook a special Tastes of Vietnam Dinner and give a talk very good evening.The hotel is very spacious so never feels busy the staff are very good and welcoming. It was are first time to Bali and we will go back so that we can see some of the island next time. So if you are looking for a very relaxing Holiday then I would recomend this hotel.
