{"text":"Terrible Service and Serious Security Problems I stayed here twice for business purposes last month and had a terrible experience both times. The check-in staff were rude and unhelpful and seemed to have no idea what was going on. They lost my reservation, gave me the wrong standard room, didn't activate my key and then 'lost' several important messages that were left for me later in my stay. The business facilities are terrible - old computers with slow 'pay as you go' internet connection that costs a fortune and repeatedly kept shutting down with credit on there which I couldn't get back once it switched back on. I lost about $40 over 5 days in this way. During my stay, a male member of staff knocked on my door at 1am saying that he'd brought me the blankets I had ordered and tried to gain access to my room. I had NOT ordered blankets, but he wouldn't go away. I got woken up the same time the following night with a different male staff member saying he needed to come into my room to fix the broken mini bar that I'd reported. I had NOT reported this. This was all very dodgy and made me feel uneasy about staying there alone in future.I was told on my 2nd morning that I couldn't eat breakfast as they'd closed the restaurant at 9am to set up for a private event. I was told that instead I could get a take-out breakfast box and eat it outside on the street, or pay for room service. Finally, on my last night, there was a party going on in the room opposite me at 4am which spilled out into the hall. With loud music, people banging on my door, prank calling my room and shouting just metres away from where I was sleeping. I called security and reception several times and they refused to do anything about this. I then noticed that several guests at the party were Renaissance staff. This went on until 6am and when I complained to reception, they hung up on me. I was quite frankly appalled by the problems and service levels of this hotel and would never stay there again. It is in a great location but is overpriced, run down, with rude staff and lapse security. Beware.
