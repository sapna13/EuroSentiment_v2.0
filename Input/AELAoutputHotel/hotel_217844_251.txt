{"text":"First Pleasure Trip to SF Choosing a boutique hotel for your first pleasure trip to San Francisco was a little more adventurous than my wife and I ordinarily allow, but we took the advice of so many others on Trip Advisor and must say we were really pleased. The hotel is quiet, very convenient to the cable car lines (Powell, California and F Line), and the hotel staff from the desk, concierge and continental dining staff could not have been more friendly or helpful. The rooms are very comfortable and I thought the rates very, very good. I did not mind that the hotel did not have a full dining room as there are excellent restaurants nearby. In fact, I found the Roxanne, right next door, to be perfect for breakfast when I got tired of the continental fare, but the continental breakfast (free) at the hotel was really pretty nice. We are not frequent travelers, so we did not fully understand the hotel's refusal to allow us to take the continental back to the room, but it was not a big deal. If you have not been to SF before and you are going to be there for anything near three days, get the city pass that allows you to travel on the muni systems including the cable cars. The stop for the Powell lines is all of 50 paces from the hotel door and is a must for sane travel around SF. The Powell line can take you down to Market where you can get the F Line from Market and Stockton to do all of the Fisherman Wharf stops. From Fishermans Wharf you can get either the Powell Hyde or the Powell Mason cable car back to the intersection of Bush and Powell and see most of what you want to see in downtown SF by riding them that way. Ask for a map when you check in and the staff will explain it to you. ","annotations":[]}
