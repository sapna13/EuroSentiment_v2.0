{"text":"Not your average old hotel! We had an early morning doctor's appointment in downtown Phoenix and our doctor's office had given us the name  phone number of the Clarendon. We were a little reluctant to stay in a non-chain hotel but decided it would be worth it to avoid the freeway traffic at 7:30am in Phoenix. Upon arrival, it was obvious that this was an older hotel, but the staff was very friendly. We had requested a king-size bed but there was not one available so we went ahead and took the room with two doubles. The room was clean  the beds were beautifully made. I cannot tell you how comfortable these beds were! They were so nice and we ended up glad we each had our own! The decor was very modern and the artwork was unlike anything we've seen in other hotels. Okay, this is not a 5 star resort and there was some nude artwork in the lobby. I did not notice it but my husband was quick to point it out to me. This is not what I would consider to be a kid-friendly hotel because the rooms are not large, at least the one we stayed in was not, nor was the bathroom but the size was adequate for us. The only thought I had was that the bathroom floor needed to be re-grouted. I'm sure it was clean as the entire room looked clean, but compared to the rest of the bathroom, the grout looked very dingy. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. We only wish we could've brought the beds home with us! ","annotations":[]}
