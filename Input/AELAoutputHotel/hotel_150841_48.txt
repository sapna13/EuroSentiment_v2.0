{"text":"BEST STAFF EVER! We were a group of 20 people ages ranging from 28 to 65. Singles and couples. We went for a wedding- and stayed 8 days-during hurricane season. Dodged Hana and Ike- it poured rain for two days (almost 20 inches) and was cloudy with light showers on and off a few days. When it poured the staff delivered very large umbrellas for us to use during our stay and they had golf carts pick us up to take us wherever we wanted to go! Couldn't believe the service and always with a smile. Truly the hardest working staff I have ever experienced (and I am well travelled at exclusive resorts). This property is absolutely beautiful and very well maintained, every area is spot less and grounds manicured to perfection. The pictures of the resort do not do it justice! The amenities, room size, and food and beverage choices make this all-inclusive a steal! Bar service is great, cold Presidente Beer on Tap as well as Bohemia Especial and Brahama Bottled Beer, Stoli Vodka, Johnny Walker Red Label Scotch, Frangelica, Tangueray Gin - were available and teriffic tropical Rum and Vodka concoctions. I was pleasantly surprised at the beverage service. Specialty drinks of the day and even Specialty drinks of the evening - including coffee drinks with Irish whisky, Kahlua, Amaretto etc. White and Red wine available also - not great but ok for dinner.Rooms were large with very comfortable beds and great linens, towels plush, refrigerator stocked daily with beer, soda, bottled sparkling and regular water, nice coffee butler, Great shower and separate bathtub, comfortable patio,(even had a expandable rack for wet bathing suits and T- shirts) nice views of the gardens and\/or beach. Maid service was exceptional! Specialty restaurants for dinner are your best choice, The Gourmet Restaurant was the best, the Mediterranean , Cajun,and Japanese were also quite good. Steakhouse meat was very salty - might have been the tenderizer - or maybe that is just the way they prepare their steaks. Very dissappointed in the lobster and langostinos as I had heard the D.R. is famous for these. (yuck). Great shrimp and muscle dishes. Men take note you must wear long pants to all the specialty restaurants (except the steakhouse) and sleved shirts to all restaurants including the buffets. Buffet is fine for breakfast and dinner with the usual fare- pool buffet area is great for brunch\/lunch. Special themed meals everyday at the buffet- Italian, Spain, Asian, Dominican in addition to the usual fare. Great cheese bars at the buffets (inside and outside). Ice cream stations, soft serve and hand scouped , Good salad bars and fresh fruit. And no one got sick from the food or water . Tip- (NEVER drink the tap water- or brush your teeth with it ) All water and ice is filtered so you are fine with all beverages and food). Met people from all over the world - some could communicate quite well in English - that was half of the fun. You have to have an open mind, be patient, and adventurous and you will have a Great time. If you know a little Spanish that is even better. Tip all the workers whenever you can- a couple of bucks goes a long way and they work so hard it is a crime. Our biggest ddisappointment was the Casino (at the sister hotel next door) the staff are NOT friendly - actually seem cold and hurried- found out later apparently the women dealers are not allowed to cajole with the guests. The entertainment is awful - worse than on a cruise ship - but we didn't expect anything - the players work very hard and really try to engae the audience. Again, it is what you make of it! Another very important tip- don't forget tp use mosquito repellant in the evening - we all forgot the first night we were there - and were covered with bites - the repellant worked wonders when we remembered to put it on the rest of the evenings- Went on a few tours - Outback Safari was outstanding - definitely not for small children- constantly offerring beer and rum drinks (maybe they tailor it to their guests) Really fun and educational way to learn about the island, people, government, plantations, living conditions, schools, etc. Stingray and Sharks - fun if you haven't experienced that beforeATV - dittoOur other scheduled tours were cancelled due to the rainsLet your hair down, don't be too critical, keep in mind the great price you are paying, enjoy the beautiful setting and have a blast !
