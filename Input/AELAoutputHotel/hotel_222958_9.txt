{"text":"Would Stay Here Again This is not the Ritz-Carlton as some reviewers seemed to want it to be. But, I had an experience nothing like the experience of the average reviews of this hotel. The rooms were clean, the staff was friendly, the shuttle to JFK\/UMass station was 10 minutes late 1 time out of the 10 times we used it and the shuttle to the Airport was right on time at 6 am. Morning breakfast was your average waffles, bagels, muffins, cereal, fruit, yogurt, etc and yes at times it got busy, but I never found it too busy that I couldn't even eat. There is free wireless in the hotel lobby and if you don't have a laptop, you can use the internet for $7 for 30 minutes. I never did use it, so I don't know how good it is. There isn't a restaurant on the hotel grounds, but there is on the property. Confused? The Philips Family owns 4-5 properties within a 5 minute walk, so there are 2 restaurants a block from the Comfort Inn attached to the Ramada and also a pizzeria\/cafe in the bowling alley that they own on the property. There is also a grocery store, Dunkin Donuts and a sub shop across the street from the Comfort Inn. How inconvenient! (sarcasm)It is about 20-25 minutes from downtown Boston, but don't let that discourage you from using this hotel. For $15.00 you can purchase a 7 day Charlie Card and use the Mass Transit unlimited (Bus, Subway..etc). It also takes the headache out of getting around the city. The most interchanges you would have to make from the hotel to any part of Boston was 1 using the T line. Overall, I would stay there again. The distance to Boston wasn't bad and for the price, you can't beat it. It is good for travelers that don't want to spend over $200 a night just to lay your head on a pillow. I used this hotel exactly what I needed it for, to sleep. Oh yeah, I believe it is a pet friendly hotel, so your four legged friends can stay there.
