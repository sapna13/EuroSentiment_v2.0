{"text":"Lovely, but all too much!! Our holiday started with Check - in at Gatwick to be informed of a 5 hour delay, great start. Finally arrived at Punta Cana, tired, dishevelled and weary to be Photographed on arrival!Finally arrived at the hotel which was a vision of beauty lit up like a christmas tree, very beautiful. However the check in was disorganised, no welcome drink as is usual for a Riu and no clear instructions to get to our room. Beware no signposting!We had booked  paid for a Sea view in the UK, please be aware this hotel has no sea view! We had a superior room, but upgraded to a suite the following day which was lovely, however no full length mirror in the suites? Our suite overlooked the jaccuzi, please be aware whilst it feels very private and discreet, you are visible, my husband called it the gene pool,, due to the number of unprotected couplings that took place, we were woken one night at 0430 to see 5 guys and 2 girls, use your imagination as to the noises!The hotel feels tired and I would guess is quite old, it feels like it needs a makeover. The Bambu next door was based on the new Riu format, and I would not be disappointed to have stayed there.The pool was fabulous, but very cold, and the beach superb. We did have a late hurricane which was something else, but the staff coped admirably, considering 25 died and they must have been very worried about their families.The Riu concept is based on everything you need, we will provide and they do, beautiful gardens, spotless service areas and pool, they work very hard to make your holiday a success. This hotel very much caters for our German friends, and German is more understood and spoken than English, this was unusual! Entertainment: we did not see any, as I was still on English time so went to bed early!Food: More than anything you could want, in fact it was all too much. The restaurants were good, my preference was the steak house and the lovely Mateo, who never lets your glass empty!The main buffett was an experience, usually the buffett is relaxed and an ad hoc affair, you eat when you wish, here beware. You can only eat at 1830 or 2030, and you must only eat at the table allocated....nightmare, why make the buffett so regimented? apart from that the food was outstanding, Lobster and Champagne, giant prawns, smoked salmon, carvery, specialist foods, nothing was unavailable. Gentlemen beware, you must have long trousers and the whole event is a dress up affair, not a dress down one!This was the first experience of a Palace, and the first time we have stayed in a Riu where tipping is expected, especially by the pool boys, who will whistle at you to get your attention and bring your mattress to you ( they do smell a bit), However, we do always tip, but this was the first time you felt uncomfortable if you were not doing so.Overall, we had a lovely holiday as we always do.Caution, please buy any duty free or gifts before you leave the airport at Punta Cana is a joke. Puerta Plata last year was wonderful and provided everything at reasonable prices.Punta Cana was minimal and they did not even have a tot of rum for a cuba libre!!! Minimal fragrances and choice of tobacco. The charges for drinks and food was outrageous even more than the UK airports and you cannot take bought in the airport water on to the flights! If you are delayed allow plenty of cash! ( 1 beer and 1 vodka tonic $16 !!!If you want a Dominican experience I would return to Puerta Plata and the Merengue or Palace there, alternatively, if you have a family I would suggest the Bambu, lovely pools and service areas. The people were as always in Dominca wonderful, if you haven't been you will love it.If this review sounds a little negative, it is just saying it as I found it, however, remember I am now back in gloomy England and back at work!!If you go have a great holiday!
