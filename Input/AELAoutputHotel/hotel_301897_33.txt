{"text":"A Good Choice, but Need to Know a Few Things... My wife and I stayed for 2 nights in June 2007 in a Executive Floor Standard Room. A good hotel with all the virtues and amenities you would expect, but there are a few things a person should know before choosing the Four Seasons Singapore.Check-in time: The check-in time is 3PM. This poses a bit of a problem for people arriving in early morning (as we did). Usually the hotel will try to arrange an early check-in, but when the hotel is busy, then this can be difficult. We had to wait a few hours, but the reception was very diligent in trying to take care of us.Wear and tear: The rooms are quite nicely furnished (as you would expect from a Four Seasons hotel), but the hotel has fallen victim to the dreaded rattling air-conditioning\/ventilation syndrome which occurs in older hotels. Annoying.Location: Biz travellers like to go to hotels in the Marina Bay area, some tourists like to go to the colonial-style (i.e. Raffles, Fullerton), and those who plan to do a bit of shopping prefer the hotels located near Orchard Road (like the Four Seasons). A minor point, but the Four Seasons is not actually located on the main Orchard Road, but is a street away. Also a bit of a distance away from the main department stores as well. Thus not as convenient as the Hilton or Marriott if you are planning to do the shop, pop back into the hotel for a short break and drop off your bags, shop again routine.A fine place to stay, but personally would consider other options in the Orchard Road area for the above reasons.
