{"text":"Beware Dates visited Melia Caribe Tropical 6\/19\/08 until 6\/27\/08. On my urging my wife booked our trip through travelocity for the two of us and our three children and my brother who had his own room. Immediately upon our arrival to the resort the employees at the concierge desk were very eager to help us make dinner reservations for that night and in return we attend a 90 minute presentation of a sol melia vacation club.That night we ate at the Guarapo the Dominican restaurant which was very good as were all the restaurants the problem was getting a reservation. Dinner reservations are obtained by calling ext 6313 after 9 AM but by the time you get through at around 9:15 AM everthing was taken so you would need to call at 1:30 PM to see if there were any cancellations so instead of enjoying yourself at the beach or pool you needed to be worried about getting back to the room to call again. The problem with the reservations for dinner goes back to the sol melia vacation club as the employees use it as a way to get you to go in exchange for dinner reservations they get points ? for referring guests . We went to the presentation on the third day of our stay after becoming friendly with Guillermo one of the towel boys at the pool. The presentation actually took around three hours in which they took us to there other resorts which were beautiful but we did not wish to purchase the membership. My brother was actually confronted by the concierge who had originally had scheduled the presentation he is known as Erasmo.com he stopped my brother in the lobby and questioned him as to why we had gone to the presentation after he had made dinner reservations for us. My brother did not answer this employee but called guest relations and spoke to Maralys and told her what had happened and she was very apologetic and would look into it and sent a fruit platter and a bottle of rum to both of our rooms which was a nice gesture but not needed if the employees would just do there job. Speaking of empolyees who do there job well was Mario the bartender at the bar he was fantastic.There were many others who are very eager to please .Like I said before the restaurants Capri (seafood) , Guarapo (dominican) , Hokkaido (japanese) , Ma Maison (french) were excellent except that my daughter got sick the night after eating in the french restaurant (she threw up twice) . The Gondola (italian) was OK and the A\/C was broken so it was warm in the restaurant . As far as our room was concerned the A\/C was never cold enough the maid would turn off the electricity in the room after cleaning it so when we would come in from the beach\/pool we would have to turn it on by turning the card around upon entering the room. I needed to spend 30 minutes every evening killing the mosquitoes , I also spent alot of time in the bathroom flushing the toilet as there was not alot of water pressure. I finally figured it out and found a kids sand bucket at the pool and would fill that with water and use it to flush .I actually thought about leaving after our third or fourth day there. We were so happy to have our bracelets for the resort cut off this morning after check out and to get home.There is no place like home.
