{"text":"We didn't want to leave! What a place for a stopover! I was travelling to Sydney with my husband and two children, aged 12 and 13, and chose the Harbour plaza because of Trip Advisor reviews. They are not wrong. After a long flight it is fantastic to have such luxury. It is also in a fantastic location - with shops and lots of restaurants. Do not be put off eating at the restaurants just because they have no English outside. Inside most seem to have English translations, or at least one person who can help out. We particularly liked the Moon Chiu (spelling?) on the corner very close to the hotel. We were treated like royalty and the food was very good - and exceptionally good value. The food court offers lots of choice, though we found it better to eat there at lunch time as in the evening it was packed! Our last afternoon\/evening was amazing. We went up to the Peak visited Madam Tussaud's - very different to London's. There are lots of models to interest westerners and you can actually get up close and have your picture taken with them. It was very interactive and not too busy. Kids loved it. We then did a lovely short walk around the Peak and went for an evening meal. We booked Cafe Deco restaurant before we left England. It was fab. We had a table inside overlooking the Harbour (see Frommer's website for advice on booking).We all adored Hong Kong and hope to go back again. ","annotations":[]}
