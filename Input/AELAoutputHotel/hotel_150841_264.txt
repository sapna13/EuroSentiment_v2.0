{"text":"The Iberostar Bavaro was paradise! My husband and I just returned Oct 1st from our stay at the Iberostar Bavaro Suites in Punta Cana. We had previously stayed at Iberostar Paraiso in the Mayan Riviera so we knew what to expect from this resort. Even so, it exceeded our expectations, this resort was incredibly beautiful. The grounds, the rooms and the restaurants are spotless, they clean continuously.Upon arriving, the staff was extremely curteous and helpful, making sure we had everything we needed during our stay. the language barrier was not a problem as most employees spoke some, if not very good english.They are in the process of renovating the rooms. All in all, the rooms weren't bad but starting to show some signs of wear and tear. The bed, slightly saggy and the three flat pillows were our biggest complaint. Also, there are no clocks in the rooms so you may want to pack a travel alarm clock. It's easy to sleep in as the curtains are dark and the rooms were quite sound proof. It was very quiet and peaceful.The food was better than we expected after what I have read in reviews. Not what we're used to in the States, the cuts of meat were not up to our standards, a lot tougher. The chicken was usually good. Try the Japanese restaurant, it was the best in our opinion. The buffet at the pool was good and they keep it going from 10-12, breakfast and 12-6 with lunch. There is always something to eat no matter your taste.The beach was even more gorgeous than the pictures can begin to show. Always plenty of chairs and palapas. The pool was smaller than what we're used to, but with a beach that beautiful, who wants to sit at the pool?! The Star Friends tend to be a little annoying. They are constantly walking up and down the beach trying to get you to participate in activities, even if you are napping. The pool area is really loud during the afternoon, with Star Friends on microphones, etc.We found the tiki bar on the beach to be more relaxing and Julio, the bartender, is wonderful. The Rock Star Cafe was ok. My husband liked it because it is one of the few places with a\/c and sports on tv. There are American tv stations like CNN, ABC NY, some ESPN for which my husband was greatful! The nightly shows were a little cheesey but fun. We always enjoyed the band afterward, they had some very talented performers who sang in both Spanish and English. If you are considering staying at the Iberostar Dominicana or the Iberostar Punta Cana because it is a little cheaper, don't. It is well worth the extra $ to stay at the Bavaro instead. The rooms are nicer, one of their pools is closed for renovation, chairs and facilities are not as nice as it seems much older. You still have privelages to all of their restaurants, bars, etc.All in all it was a wonderful vacation. We highly recommend this resort and are looking forward to staying there again in the future.
