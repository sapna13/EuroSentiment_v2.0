{"text":"Good Value hotel...quiet location We booked this hotel on their own website for a last minute short break, mainly because it seemed good value for moneyWe got a taxi to the hotel from the main bus station which cost just over 10 euros. The taxi driver did not know where it was and we had to show him a map we printed off the internet. We would never have found it on our own.The rooms were clean and of a good standard - minibar, hairdrier, good bathroom just no tea\/coffee making facilities, Our only complaint was the curtains did not close the full way, letting light into the room in the morningThe hotel and surrounding area was very quiet at night, so easy to get a good nights sleep.There is a small supermarket just down the street and a few coffee bars close by for coffee\/pastries for breakfast if you are on room only. Although little in terms of places to eat out in the evening - you need to head into the town centre for a wider choiceWe did have breakfast in the hotel one morning - it was 10 euros each and was a typical buffet - bread, pastries, yoghurt, cereal, ham, cheese, eggs etcIt was 5 mins walk to the el putext metro stop - which takes you right into the heart of Barcelona in under 10 mins. The tube stop was a quiet one, and the ticket machine was easy to use with instructions in English. The trains ran till around 11.30pm. We explored lots of the sights using the metro.
