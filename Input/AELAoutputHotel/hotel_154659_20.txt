{"text":"Very good hotel in Paseo de la Reforma I stayed in this hotel during a business trip to Mexico City. There is a nice little cafe with about 8 tables inside the lobby of the hotel. This is a good place to have a warm or a cold drink. The lobby staff is very courteous and ready to help. The rooms have modern, well-kept furniture. The linen was of high quality and was not worn out. The bathroom was spacious and spotless. My room had a window to a backstreet, which was good because Paseo de la Reforma is a major thoroughfare with lots of traffic and it can be a bit noisy during the daytime. The rooms have a large plasma TV and DVD player and they also have internet access. If you didn't bring a laptop with you on the trip, then a nice thing is that the hotel gives you 1 hour of free internet access per day at their business center. If there is one criticism I had it was that the food at the restaurant left me a little disappointed because I ordered a dish and when I got it, it was cold, almost frozen. Perhaps it was because I arrived late and they were going to close soon and so they rushed things a bit. From the hotel you can walk along Paseo de la Reforma and go to first-rate restaurants, in any event. It is also a nice stroll to the Zocalo. If you prefer to take a cab, taxi fares are inexpensive in Mexico City, but always ask the driver to turn on the meter, otherwise you _will_ get overcharged. Even the locals are overcharged if they're not paying attention. For your reference, a cab drive from this hotel to the Zocalo should cost about 20 pesos, or US$2.00 at the current exchange rate.
