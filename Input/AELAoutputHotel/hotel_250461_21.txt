{"text":"Pretty good with a couple of minor caveats I stayed here for four nights from 10th to 14th October.The rooms and bathrooms are large, clean and modern. The location is excellent. You are 10 minutes walk from the Brandenburg Gate\/Reichstag, 20 minutes from Museum Island, 15 minutes from Checkpoint Charlie and about 30 minutes from Alexanderplaz.It's 10 minutes to good pubs on Oranienburger Strasse and there are plenty of places to eat across all price ranges near the hotel (plus a great Starbucks right on the corner).There is a fantastic walking tour I'd highly recommend leaving from outside Bandy Brooks, a shop on the corner of the hotel itself.The hotel is located just across from Friedrichstrasse U bahn\/S bahn which is convenient for travel. This would be one of only two caveats. I was at the back of the hotel and unless my window was open I couldn't hear the trains at all. On the front or side of the hotel though you directly face the station and noise might be a problem. Having said that mind, the windows had the thickest double glazing I've seen in my life so you might be okay but all the same I'd ask for a rear facing room rather than take the risk.My only other caveat is an increasingly common issue with hotels. Hotels the world over I find far too hot and I like a really cool room if I'm going to get any sleep. This hotel did have air conditioning but like many you couldn't reduce the setting low enough to cool the room: the air conditioning was in effect turned off (no doubt to save money) and ll you could do was get the fan to blow out some barely cool air that made no impact on the room temperature.That said, I suspect 9 out of 10 people will like their room warmer than I do so should have no problem.All in all I'd definitely go back. The location makes it a winner. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":610,"mention":"Brooks","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Brooks_England"],"startOffset":604}]}
