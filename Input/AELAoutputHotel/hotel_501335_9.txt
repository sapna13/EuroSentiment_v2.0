{"text":"Outstanding experience, feeling better than home... The experience of staying at the Hotel Misc cannot be adequately described with words - it has to be lived in order to be evaluated properly. However, I will try to describe our experience with words, mainly because by doing so I will re-live the experience and all the beautiful feelings associated with it...Having been in Amsterdam before, it took me a long research to find the perfect hotel for my wedding trip. Deciding factors were: location, reviews and communication with the hotel. The hotel scored excellent in all areas. So, after seeing the pictures and considering my options, I decided to book the Rembrandt room, since both me and my wife love art, and the museums would be one of our major sightseeings during our trip.First, the location of the hotel is perfect - right in the middle of the city's center, just 5 minutes from practically everywhere: the Dam square, the Central Station, the Koningsplein  the Flower Market, the Rembrandtplein, the Waterlooplein, or even the Leidseplein and the Jordaan if you're like us and don't mind walking a bit more to get where you want. Even if you don't like walking, the hotel is next to the Nieuwmarkt, which means there's a taxi stand right across the street, to make up for the loss of a nearby tram stop. And for those who feel a little uncomfortable with staying at the edge of the Red Light District, it doesn't feel like that at all. You should be able to forget you're near the RLD just by using your common sense, like you would do in any big city.The hotel itself has only one drawback - the steep stairs. But of course this is Amsterdam, stairs are steep by default, and it's really not that bad once you get the hang of it. Other than that, our room was much more beautiful and convenient than I expected it to be, with fresh flowers on the table and a lovely view over the canal, a fridge with snacks  soft drinks, all toilet\/bathroom necessities and the most comfortable double bed I've ever slept on. Each day we had a delicious late breakfast, and while we were out exploring the city, our room was cleaned\/restocked for the day.Communication with Rachel and Pepjin couldn't have been better, from the beginning of the booking until the end of our trip. They both went out of their way to, not only accomodate us, but help us with everything we possibly needed, from providing  helping us customize boat tours, to offering us a laptop to use with the hotel's wireless Internet connection. It is because of their help  understanding that the surprise I planned for my wife was a huge success, and it is because of their hospitality that we will both remember this trip for the rest of our lives.Thank you Rachel  Pepjin for all the things you did for us and for all the trouble you went into helping us live a wonderful experience. We'll see you again in Amsterdam, hopefully sooner than we think ;) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2183,"mention":"Rachel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Reuben_sandwich"],"startOffset":2177},{"endOffset":2183,"mention":"Rachel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Reuben_sandwich"],"startOffset":2177},{"endOffset":2183,"mention":"Rachel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Reuben_sandwich"],"startOffset":2177},{"endOffset":2183,"mention":"Rachel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Reuben_sandwich"],"startOffset":2177},{"endOffset":2183,"mention":"Rachel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Reuben_sandwich"],"startOffset":2177},{"endOffset":2183,"mention":"Rachel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Reuben_sandwich"],"startOffset":2177},{"endOffset":2183,"mention":"Rachel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Reuben_sandwich"],"startOffset":2177},{"endOffset":2739,"mention":"Rachel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Reuben_sandwich"],"startOffset":2733}]}
