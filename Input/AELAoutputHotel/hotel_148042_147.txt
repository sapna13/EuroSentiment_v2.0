{"text":"Great Hotel in San Juan I stayed at this hotel last month for 4 days. This was my third time and still love it. The best rooms are the ones with garden and\/or ocean view. Last time I had a garden view room but the way the hotel is built you have partial ocean view too which it was great. The front desk person told me they are adding balconies to all garden view rooms so when done you will be able to have a better ocean view too. The service, the room, the views are the best. If I needed something their response was inmediate and to my wishes no questions or excuses, it was done to my satisfaction. Great and helpful staff! The rooms are beautiful and have big bathrooms. The food is really good at any of their restaurants. I have to say I have stayed in other hotels there but this is my favorite. Good summer rates for this luxury hotel. This hotel is more quiet, relaxed still you can have a lot of fun. There's music in the lounge\/lobby at night, It has a casino, not as big as other hotels but still nice. It's close to the airport,(10 minutes max),and to other sites of interest.If you want loud, party all night, crowded hotel then stay at the nearby El San Juan Hotel, since the Ritz is too classy to be like that. My thing is relax at the Ritz and be treated like a celebrity then if I'm in the mood to party hard take a walk to El San Juan Hotel next door since the people in the lobby are from everywhere and you don't have to stay at that hotel to enjoy their entertainment. The Ritz is really the best! ","annotations":[]}
