{"text":"A Truely Excellent Vacation My wife and I choose Excellence Punta Cana for our Honeymoon and our stay was from 5\/6\/07 to 5\/11\/07. The food was excellent, we were able to eat at 5 of the 7 restaurants in our time there and I can honestly there everything was delicous and of high quality. The French restaurant was of very fine qulaity, we actually had or honeymoon dinner there, and they surprised us and made it a truly memorable dinner. We loved the Grille(we went there twice) and the Lobster House. I felt like a king on my last day there, for supper we went to The Grille and I ordered a t-bone steak, I asked the waiter to go over to the lobster house which is right next door and get me a couple of lobsters and he did. The asian(chinese\/thai) inspired restaurant, Spice, caught me by surprise. The food was awesome. The italian restuarant was very good. We did not have the opportunity of dining at Barcelone and Agave as the restaurant was either closed for the day or we did not have time to dine there. We also had the room service, I would highly recommend the guacamole burger, it was possible the best burger I ever had. I do not know how this place makes money, they offer preminim drinks, the quality of the food is excellent and they have so many waiting staff that are there to tend to your every need with a smile on your face. We speak spanish and actually got to know the some of the employees like Jose the hot dog stand guy, Francisco and Isabel who did the activities and they were very nice down to earth people. It rained on one of the days that we were there and the resort did a great job of providing table games, cards and they had a no hold tournament. We did not take advantage of the activities as we were just relaxing and enjoying each others company. The resort provides a complimentary turndown service where they give you a list of the activities for the following day. They had horseback riding twice a day, rifling, dart tournaments, water activities like kayaking, diving and snorkling as well as the beach activities, pool activities as well as other activities that they had booke don different days during our stay. They have a special Honeymoon package, that we opted not to get, some of the amenties are already included. if you provide a copy of your marriage certificate they give you a discount at the spa(we did the combined 100 minutes massage and it was so good that we fell asleep) and you can make a one reserve at the restaurant of your choice where they prepare a special honeymoon dinner for you. The rooms were great, the jacuzzi tub was big we noth fit in it very comfortably and I am 6'2 tall, the servicing of the rooms was also great. I would highly recommend Excellence Punta Cana to all of my friends and family as it is truly excellent. I look forward to visiting this resort again in the furture as well as the other resorts they have in the Carribean and Mexico.
