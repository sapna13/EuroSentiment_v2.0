{"text":"Beautiful grounds, but still adjusting My wife and I are seasoned travelers to the Caribbean. Many visitors to the Grand Melia don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand the economy of tourism, especially in poorer areas and have set too high expectations. In short, if you have a Wal-Mart budget √à√\u2020\u2022?stay home. Several reviewers were accurate with their assessments and I will echo their advice.The Melia just took over from the Paradisus this year, which was an all-inclusive family style resort. My impression was the employees are still adjusting to different hotel policy. Loungers and towels still had the old name on them. We had a great time because we did our homework, and you will too. Below is my advice for this resort.1. Transport: Rent a car. For the whole trip. From the airport. We got 5 days with full insurance and prepaid gas for $235. Not hostage to shuttles, or schedules (blah), or the onsite Avi$$. Yes parking fees are charged, but so does every other hotel in PR. There are two lots inside the gate, right is closer, left is the remote lot. Nearby is El Yunque, Luquillo beach, Fajardo.2. Royal Service: premium √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âlub style√à√\u2020\u2022?service. Basically an upgrade in room, attention and treatment, running from $75 √à√\u2020\u2022?00 more per night. You have your own lounge with complimentary hors√à√\u2020\u2022?douerves all day, free Internet and a comp bar from 7-9 PM every night. Plus any room or activity issues you go through them, and not other departments. Use of the Royal service pool. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a better class of service. Highly suggest.3. Meal Plans: The Melia needs to rethink their AP and MAP plans, way overpriced. We prepaid our breakfasts (at $20 pp over 4 days). The buffet style breakfasts were plentiful, with omelet√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, waffles made to order. For dinner, slow service meant long waits at TEMPO. Decent food, I give it 3 stars out of 5. At the Palm, Puerto Rican Paella was excellent. Reservations are not taken, its FCFS. Kids will be everywhere. Not too many fine dining options near the hotel, we ate out one evening at the Rio Mar, about 5 mi down Route 3.4. Food and Beverage: Pricey. Prices are as other reviewers stated. On Route 3 make a left out of the access road √Ç?√Ø mile on left is a strip mall with a BK, a KFC, a Subway and AMIGO √à√\u2020\u2022?their version of a Shop Rite.. Soda  beer at supermarket prices. A good way to keep the lunch and beverage costs down.5. Rooms and grounds. Beautiful. Rooms look freshly painted. Gardens are full, lots of color. Main pool is enormous, with plenty of lounge chairs (could use more umbrellas). Beach: a disappointment. Rocky, red sand. Sea grass. Good for sailing, not for snorkeling. Calm. If you want surf √à√\u2020\u2022?go to Luquillo, about 10 miles away. There is a kids club, and there are games, bikes for the young ones.6. Main building. Open air. Lots of chaise lounges  sofas. Gardens  fountains everywhere. Clean. Live music at the bar every night. Small casino, but some slots are broken, they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ take bills, or bar code vouchers.7. Tipping. I am amazed at how cheap people get on vacation. A little goes a long way. We tipped, and got great attention. Yes the service is slower, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the Caribbean. Overall: a good hotel, that can be superb if they make some adjustments. Be patient, ask lots of questions, and tip a few bucks if someone goes out of their way for you. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be amazed at how far a smile, and a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®uenos dias√à√\u2020\u2022?will get you.
