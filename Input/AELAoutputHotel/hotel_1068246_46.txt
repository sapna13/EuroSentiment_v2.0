{"text":"Paradise at Majestic Elegance Hello all TA members. We just returned from the Majestic Elegance 12\/12\/2008. This was our first visit to the Domincan Republic. We travelled with another couple who have travelled much more than we have. We stayed in Elegance Club Majestic Junior Suite and absolutely loved it. Our travel companions expressed that this was the nicest resort they have ever stayed at in the Caribbean!!We did however encounter a few glitches which were rectified very soon after arrival. There was no air conditioning working at either the Majestic Elegance or Colonial the first day....the next day it was all fixed. Our balcony door did not lock properly (we were on the first floor) but it was looked after....many times lol. (Don't worry be happy)Detailed:RoomsWe stayed on the first floor, direct access to the pool (no outdoor jacuzzi). Beautiful room. Very elegant. The beds were comfy, decor was lovely and whooooaaa the water pressure. We never had a problem with hot water it was great! Internal Jacuzzi tub in the corner near the balcony door, it also worked great!! Lots of pillows and towels, champagne and liquors left for us. The fridge was stocked daily with beer, pepsi, 7up and water and you could even get more beer or champagne if you wanted it. We used room service a couple of times and it was good as well. Our butler in the Elegance Club prepared a jacuzzi bath for us with bath salts bubbles, flower pedals and champagne on ice!! Thank you Henri!!Pool area and BeachThe pool was a little cool but welcoming on a very hot day ( we had great weather for most of our week stay). There are intigrated jacuzzi's within the pools in the Elegance Club. No they are not hot, they are pool temperature but still felt great! We had Bali Beds in the Elegance Club which were very nice. There is personalized drink service in this area....Rose you are awesome!! The beach was heaven . You could walk either way from the resort for about 1 1\/2 hours on the beach. Very clean and very clear. We all loved jumping the waves and laying under the Palapas.Resaurants...all are open, a few rotate closing daysSee and SeaThis restaurant is near the beach and opens at 10.00 AM. It serves buffet breakfast and lunch and is open in the evening for a la carte seafood. It was very good. Selection was quite varied.9 Doors (Japanese)We went here twice. Reservations are required for the hibatchi dining rooms. It was one of our favourites!FrenchThis was also one of our favourites. Reservations are also required. It is a full course sampling menu. Food was excellent.Steak HouseThis was one of our least favourites. The steak was overdone and potatoes and veg cold. Dont worry be happy... they may be just learning! ItalianThe food here was both good and not so good. Hopefully it is a learning curve. Tirimusu was outstanding.The Buffet Restaurant (Flavors)Open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We only went for breakfast. Alot of variety, very good flavour but sometimes not as hot as it should be.We also went to the Majestic Colonial beach seafood\/steak restaurant and had surf and turf... it was excellent!!All desserts in all restaurants are awesome!! They look like they have all come out of a professional pastry\/dessert shop and taste like it.BarsAll bars are open. Thank you all bar staff you are wonderful!Private bars at the Elegance Club, pool and terrace were very good. The swim up bar in the regular section was also very good. Both lobby bars serve the more premium drinks.There was constuction going on every day.....something new was always finished but it was not in any way an intrusion.We would like to make a special mention to all staff and service.
