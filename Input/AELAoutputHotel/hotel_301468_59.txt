{"text":"The best hotel in Singapore MO is easily the best hotel in Singapore, after staying at RC and the Raffles. Whilst RC is cold and soulless, and Raffles are touristy and noisy - the MO is a warm and calm oasis and retreat. Check-in was very smooth, and got my room right away (at 11 am). The room was a superiour (I think it's the lowest category) on the 12th floor, it was newly refurbished and lavish, and very nice and comfortable. A bed to die for, and a large bathtub with seperate bathtub and shower. Large 42 LCD television with 80 or so international channels. Interactive telephone and also a cordless set, which was very convenient. The room had a large balcony overlooking Marina Mandarin. Not the best view, but it was nice to enjoy a cold cocktail in the sunshine.The staff and the service was great. The best service I have experienced in Singapore. Doorstaff and reception always greeted me by my lastname, and they were always smiling and very hospitable. The way MO should be:) The hotel does not have a grand lobby area, but they have a very nice bar on the 5th floor with a stunning view, overlooking Singapore harbour. There is also another bar, and 3-4 restaurants. Tried only the lounge and the bar - service, drinks and food were great. The breakfast (included in the room rate) was amazing, one of the best breakfasts I have ever had. There was a large selection of Asian and Western options, cold and warm, sweet and sour, light and heavy. You must try the breakfast when staying here. The juices are always fresh - made on request. Delicious.The hotel is located in Marina Centre - right next to the sea. I am not afraid of using my feet, so I walked everywhere without problem. The only times I used the subway was when going to Orchard Road and Chinatown. But you can easily walk to the harbour (just across the street) , the historic centre (10 minutes), Raffles (10 minutes), Singapore Flyer (5 minutes), Suntec City Mall (5 minutes), and so on... You can easily reach the subway if you walk through the mall that's connected to the hotel. All in all, the location is very convenient for sightseeing, business and shopping.If you love seafood you should visit Esplanade Mall across the street - there you'll find No Signboard Seafood. Strange name for a restaurant, but the food is absolutely delicious. It's quite inexpensive as well. Highly recommended!!I will return to the MO when going back to Singapore.
