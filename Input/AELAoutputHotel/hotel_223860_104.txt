{"text":"The Godd, The Bad  Stayed for almost a week in April. If you have small kids-DO NOT STAYAT THIS PROPERTY! Page down to the Bad  Ugly for more details.The Good: beautiful landcape scenery, outdoor speakers w\/ soothing music playing everywhere, tranquil water features, attractively designed rooms\/suites, complimentary laundry facility. Tuscany Restaurant and great live music( 2 guys in their 40's)Complimentary mountain bikes. Allison at Tennis Center is a gem! Fitzroy, and red hair German waitress at Blue Sage are super nice as well. Lots of pools.The Bad: Black mold  mildew in every corner and grout line of the adjoining room's shower. Filthy bathroom floor covered in hairs upon checkin. Housekeeping overall was lax for such a $$$resort. Stopped into the Revive Spa the 1st day to make an appt. for a $125.00 skin scrub for next morning. Made the mistake of taking one of my kids w\/ me to make the appt. All of a sudden a man was standingover my child and I, motioning for us to leave. We had been in the spa reception area for all of 5 minutes!!! We were in the process of walking toward the door anyway. I wound up cancelling b\/c I knew after being treated so rudely, I would not be able to revive there.Finally, the UGLY-and I mean UGLY:Beside shelling out a $$$$ money for the suite and joining room, we also decided to shell out even more for a passcard to the CLOUD ROOM. They offered snacks, lite meals, drinks, web access, open bar.However, they just instituted a no kids allowed rule. That meant either parent having to go solo to the CLOUD  while 8 yr old sat outside to help w\/the carry out food; the other parent stayed in roomw\/other 2 kids. Never got to enjoy the view, or ambiance as advertised. Despite this, we understood and used our divide and conquer plan as mentioned above and were fine with it.Then there was the issue of me trying to take my totally asleep 2 yr old into the CLOUD room b\/c my spouse w\/other 2 kids were at the pool. I figured it would be ok since I was doing a quick snack run. I didn't think it was safe to leave her alone outside in the hall. Asleep toddler and I were 6 feet into the Cloud Room when on duty  Cloud concierge person stopped me and tried to shoo me out b\/caccording to her, kids aren't allowed (though it is a family resort) and it's not fair to the other guests who can't bring their kids in. She spoke rather loudly, repeating herself and embarrassing me in front of the other 6-8 guests who were in there. Naturally I reacted and told her that it was ridiculous that I paid extra $$$ for the CLOUD Room, and that I couldn't stop in for 2 minutes to grab a few things to bring back to our rooms. Not once did she offer to stand outside the Cloud room and watch my baby for the 2 minutes it would have taken. As I was leaving she got infront of me pushing the Cloud Room door wide open, for all the guests to see-more humiliation for me, and said I'm a momma too. I turned to her w\/ baby in stroller and said  That's not the point  but I didnt get to finish what I was saying to her, b\/c one of the male guests came charging to the door and told me I was making a scene. Of course all he could see wasupsetment on my face responding to her, and not the continued snipping she was doing to me. I am 5'7, and the Cloud Concierge person was easily 5' 9 , and the guy who charged at me was atleast 6'5 tall. It was intimidating and scary to have these taller people standing over me in such an aggressive manner. And they did this to me w\/ my toddler by my side. I wound up in tears at the front desk as my 8 yr  6 yr old children walked up w\/ their dad. It was awful. I didn't want to leave our suite and room after that, it ruined the last day  half of my trip. It also upset my kids to see me crying. In conclusion: If you have children younger than teen years, you are not welcome at this resort, no matter how much money you spend. P.S. The on duty manager Mr. Donough? comped us for dinner that night. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1412,"mention":"lite","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Miller_Lite"],"startOffset":1408}]}
