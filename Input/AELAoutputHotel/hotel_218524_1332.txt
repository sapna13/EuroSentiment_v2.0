{"text":"Secrets Punta Cana not as it appears Let me start off by stating that our stay at Secrets was basedon promotional materials, travel agent and a freindsreccommendations. Our freinds stayed at the resort over a year ago, and obviously they had a better stay, in what musthave been a better resort. (At that time)The resort has had some major changes in the last six months.It IS NOT a 5 or 6 apple resort as Apple claims. It is more of a 4at best. Although much of the core service staff remains, theyare overworked and stressed because of some changes theresort will be making (pertaining to the staff) in the near future.The food is average at best. Be warned -- The beef, as best wecan tell, comes from Argentina, and is not at all like US beef!When you order a filet you will get something that is like a smallskirt steak. The Seafood resturant does not offer lobster orscallops. The surf and turf is the odd beef and shrimp. Theother selections are very generic seafood. Beware of the sushiin the oriental resturant, it gets to the sushi bar in bus tubs!All the food is flavorless, not at all what you would expect.The top shelf liquor is inconsistant at each bar. In some bars the Stoli tastes like Gilberts vodka, I ordered Jim Beam at a pool bar (bourban) and received WHISKY from a Jim Beam bottle! (I am not a whisky drinker so brand is unknown, but it tasted cheap)The rooms are nice but AC is inconsistant. Make sure your room is cold when you arrive in case you need to switch. The free wet bar frig never even got cold in our room. We found that other guests has the same problem so we did not bother to report it.Something we did mention to hotel staff is the fact that two to three times a week the lobby becomes an open market. The Resort allows vendors to set up open air market tables, and sell there wares. When on vacation I do not want to deal with aggressive local vendors. If I want local wares I can find the market, I do not want to be accousted between dinner and my room.The pool is great and a focal point of the resort, like in the Apple brochure, the whole place looks great.To sum this up you can spend the same or LESS and find a better place to spend vacation. ----The Brochure and Apple materials are very attractive---- but it is not what it seems.Good Luck, Great Vacationing.
