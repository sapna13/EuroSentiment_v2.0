{"text":"Once bitten twice shy!! Myself and my husband recently enjoyed a well earned one month holiday in Australia. The grand finale for our holiday was to spend a few days celebrating New Years Eve in Sydney. We decided to blow the budget and stay in a really nice 5 star hotel near the airport as we were leaving early on New Years Day. We opted to stay for two nights at the Stamford Plaza Hotel but we were bitterly disappointed with what we found. Upon arrival there was no porter to assist with luggage, reception staff were cold and unfriendly and uttered the minimal amount of words to us upon registration. We had to explore the hotel ourselves to find out where the pool, gym etc were. The bar staff were positively ignorant and unhelpful. It was almost like having customers was a total inconvenience. The bar area was filthy with layers of dust on every piece of dismal dark furniture. The restaurant was closed for some reason unknown to us, and as meals were now only being offered in the (unclean) bar area we had no choice but to eat elswhere. Internet facilities were a joke and printing was only available by sending an email to a Stamford Plaza email address with your print job attached. This was extremely frustrating and for a 5 star hotel ridiculous in the extreme. The outdoor pool had just 5 sun loungers available to hotel guests. I witnessed people lying on their towels on the hard tiled floor. This is hardly appropriate for again i reiterate a 5 star hotel. Our executive suite, which we payed an obscene amount of money for was adequate at best. Numerous pieces of furniture in the room were visibly damaged. The mini bar was not fully stocked or replenished for that matter. The thing that shocked me the most was the state of the bathrobes. One of ours was competely out of shape, had a badly torn pocket and one of the belt hooks was missing. The rightful place for this was in the bin, and it most definitely should not have been presented to paying guests. I will add that the bed was comfortable and that the bathroom was a great size with a large shower and separate bath. I would like to comment that the best service we got was from one of the concerige team who went out of his way to flag down a taxi for us on New Years Eve, unfortunately I did not get his name. Overall this hotel was a major disappointment and going forward I know to never ever consider booking a Stamford Plaza Hotel anywhere in the world again because like I say in the title of this review, Once bitten twice shy.
