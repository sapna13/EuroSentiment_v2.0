{"text":"We Were Amazed! Folks, I went with the reviews on this site and was not disappointed. This was by far one of the most enjoyable places my wife and I have ever stayed. The staff were amazing, the hotel immaculate and the services incredible. We have stayed in many places over the years, which have included many 5 star hotels in Mexico including Golden Paradise and Crown Paradise and this one rates among some of the best. Rooms-excellent, staff- excellent (they never stop dancing and singing), beach-beautiful,. Our special thanks to Gregori (waiter)at the buffet, Sergio\/Arne\/Jordan at Dressel dive shop, Kennedy at the bar, and of course many more. The only issues I have (I guess everything can't be perfect) was the guest showers on the last day need to be fixed up, when they say checkout is at 12, they are NOT kidding ;), I would recommend sending them a fax, not an email, requesting a renovated room, and be sure when you checkout to head to the airport, you pack some snacks for the wait at the airport. My wife and I had a piece of pizza with a coke each and it was $16 US.I really need to open a few businesses in DR.In summary, there is a reason this hotel is highly rated on the review sites. You will NOT be disappointed. Also, most importantly, take the time to write a review upon your return. I believe they really do serve a purpose for those traveling.Best RegardsRob  HayleyTrenton, ON21-28 Jan 2007 ","annotations":[{"endOffset":371,"mention":"Crown","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Crown_Royal"],"startOffset":366},{"endOffset":1051,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1046}]}
