{"text":"Do not go there Just came back from Punta Cana (yesterday) after 2 weeks. We were there previously (last year) so were excited to go. We read mixed reviews on this resort but thought we'd make up our own minds.If you are thinking of going to Punta Cana and this is your first time there, DO NOT stay at the Majestic. Last year we stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe and loved it. The people were very friendly and helpful, the food was amazing and always changing - plus there was a lot to do.The Majestic staff are rude (this includes upper management) and not friendly or helpful. For the first week we had to ask daily for towels as there was 3 of us in a room. We even wrote a note, drew a picture and showed the maids how many people stayed in the room. They said ya, ya but we never did get 3 towels.The food was the same and never hot (eggs were ALWAYS cold unless you had an omelet made but you had to wait in a huge line-up to get one). The buffet at the Bahia changed every day, so for 7 days you ate a different meal each evening. They also had a lot of Dominican meals to choose from. At the Majestic it was the same fries, pizza and warm pasta (plus other meat) and in and day you. The a la carts were a joke. Their Italian restaurant was part of the main buffet, the Chinese was part of the Japanese restaurant, the Mexican part of the Dominican restaurant and seafood was part of the steakhouse.Everyone in our group - there were about 20 of us. We drank the bottled water and brushed our teeth with bottled water but everyone was still sick. It doesn't help that when people are walking around looking at what to eat, they start picking at the food with their hands instead of the tongs supplied! Manners still apply when on holidays people!The beach isn't that great and there is a lot of coral about 10 feet out. Do wear beach socks if you are going into the water. We were snorkeling out there are where you walk there is a lot of sea urchins in the coral.For a resort that is only about 3 years only it looks in horrible condition. The area around the pool has broken down so much that you need to wear flip flops otherwise you'll be stepping on little pieces of cement. The open concept toilet, bath tub and shower aren't very attractive and if you are a large person or very tall, you'll have problems in the toilet area. We had problems with the water draining away from the drain in the shower and had water all over the floor, the faucets weren't put on so you had to be careful turning water on (this goes for the public washrooms as well), there were cracks in the walls and we did have visitors at night even though we didn't have food in our rooms - yes cockroaches! The sliding doors never locked - even on the 1st floor. The main room doors had holes in them so you could literally see through them.I could go on and on, but if you are really interested in going here email me and I'll answer any questions you have.
