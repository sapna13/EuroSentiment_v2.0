{"text":"Loved El Convento We stayed at El Convento from 12\/27\/2008-1\/2\/2009. Not only is the hotel well run by Efrain Rosa, General Manager, but the entire staff from houskeeping to restaurant personnel, to bellmen, to utility personnel, and last but not least, the front office office staff. Special mention is reserved for Guest Services Supervisor, Judith Gantenbein. We travel quite a bit, and we found her to be the most helpful, pleasant, professional concierge of any hotel we have ever stayed in. Her personal attention to every detail of our trip was over the top. What an asset to El Convento she is. If you go to El Convento, you could communicate with her via e-mail before you get there, so you can get a head start on restaurant reservations, and excursions such as the rain forest and walking tours etc. And now a word about Mr. Rosa, the General Manager. Not only was he visable on New Year's Eve, he greeted the guests and poured champaigne for all of the guests at the daily complementary wine and cheese\/fruit get together. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton in Puerto Rico two years ago at this time, and the General Manager did not do this on New Yer's Eve. Additionally, a lovely touch was that every room on New Year's Eve received a complementary bottle of champaigne and two glasses in a decorative ice bucket delivered to each guest room. The room also had a flat panel t.v., radio, and internet service. The rooms are turned down nightly and you receive clean towels twice a day, as well as chocolate placed on the bed . You will not find better service anywhere in Puerto Rico, and the Hotel is central to any place you want to go to in Old San Juan. We also took taxi's to the sister hotel, La Concha several times. La Concha is right on the beach, so between El Convento and La Concha, you have the best of both worlds. Our room (513) was very clean. As you can tell, we will return to El Convento the next time we go back to Puerto Rico.
