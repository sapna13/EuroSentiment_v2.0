{"text":"Clean, comfortable, excellent stay. We were struggling to get a triple room in Barcelona and this turned out to be a superb stay. All the staff were polite, friendly, helpful and spoke english which helped idiots like me who can't speak spanish very well. The rooms were cleaned every day and there was plenty of storage space for us in the room. In addition the air con was quiet to keep it on all night on some very hot nights and not lose sleep. Plus there was complimentary bottles of water, coca cola and alcohol free beer and free internet access. The hotel is about 20-30 min walk from the Ramblas but you can get the metro and when you figure it out it is so easy and cheap to use so distance is not a problem. We didn't have the breakfast because at 12 euros each we felt it was a bit expensive. Having said that I would definitely recommend this hotel and would stay there again. As an aside and a general tip don't get ripped off at the Ramblas. Make sure you see prices of all food and drink before you order. We ordered a lunch time meal on offer at a restaurant called Chiquitos on the Ramblas. The main meal was 8 euros each. Good value but we didn't check the drinks cost and ordered 2 lemonades which came to 6 euros EACH!!! We warned the group who had ordered their drinks just as we were about to leave and asked them to check the prices. They found out the cost and subsequently cancelled their drinks order.The 10 journey ticket for the metro at 7 euros is good value for money. You can use it for up to 1.25 hours for transfers and you can even get to the airport from the ramblas on a single journey which is a lot cheaper than the 35 euros we paid to get to the hotel when we arrived. (If you want to get to Condado from the airport you need to get off at station Diagnol and the hotel is 10 minute walk from there) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":505,"mention":"coca cola","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":496},{"endOffset":527,"mention":"free beer","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Free_Beer"],"startOffset":518}]}
