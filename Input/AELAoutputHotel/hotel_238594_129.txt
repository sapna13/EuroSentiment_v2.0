{"text":"A Grand Delight Each to their own of course but happily for us our experience couldn't be further removed from a recent review 'a grand disappointment' - it was for us 'a grand delight'. I am an extremely fussy traveller as regards cleanliness, comfort, and luxury, and checked in early and wearily (having been in another hotel in town working at said convention). The room we had requested, balcony overlooking Las Ramblas was unavailable so we were offered an upgrade to their junior suite (104) which more than made up for it. Magnificient - enormous, lots of marble, chandeliers, beautiful furniture, even a small library, and a massage jet shower\/sauna, as well as the rugby team sized jacuzzi.Another recent review points out all rooms above 3rd floor are yet to be refurbished, and this was still the case, so we were pleased to be on the 1st floor. No disturbance from the workmen during the week until about 10am by which time we were out or on our way out., and then only light tapping. The staff were unfailingly helpful and chirpy, and made some great restaurant recommendations and reservations for us - even getting us a table on a terrace overlooking the fiesta fireworks on the beach with an hour's notice - impressive! Nice finishing touches like coming in late at night to see tea light candles lit all around the flowers in the lobby, chilling our wine for us, and even lending us their corkscrew. On arriving home there was an e-mail waiting for us to say my husband's mobile had been left in the room (oops), and it arrived here in the UK 3 days later, impressed us further. I believe if you make sure to ask for a refurbed room, you won't stay in a better hotel in Barcelona for the price.
