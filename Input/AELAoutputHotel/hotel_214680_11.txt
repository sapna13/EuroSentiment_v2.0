{"text":"Good and Bad With some trepidation we booked the Waikiki Park Shore staying Nov 10-22 2008 for 12 nights. As it is an √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√©qua√à√\u2020\u2022?managed property and reviews associated with Aqua are very suspect √à√\u2020\u2022?we actually made 2 separate reservations of 6 nights each, booking directly, and intending to cancel depending on the rooms, overall impression, cleanliness and service. The first room they assigned (ocean front) was very dismal, small, with double beds and little room left in the bedroom move. Furnishings were very old and dated, shower mouldy, walls scraped etc. 1* at best and accessed by exterior door like a motel. The view was great but that was it. For a night or 2 it might be bearable but not for a week or longer. While I was fuming my parter went down and let them know I was unhappy. Reception was aware we made 2 reservations and if were not satisfied would check out early as well as cancel the second one. She suggested we look at a corner room in the new tower (taller one with interior hallways). The furnishings in this room were not much better, but the room layout was and in fact was about 20% larger (meaning we could actually open our suitcases) and this room was a corner room on the 7th floor so had a large side window to look out of but sealed shut). At least it was brighter an has a straight on view of Diamond Head and to th right on the beach.. Downside was the bathroom had a tub, no walk in shower and only a small glass shelf above the sink to put show toiletries. Room safe has a key, and they charge for use a pretty steep daily charge. We rated this room 2.5* as a comparison to the other room we first checked into. Only valet parking is available at 20$ plus tips √à√\u2020\u2022?but we found secured self parking nearby at another hotel for 10$. The good and bad:GOOD: Hotel-prime corner location across from beach and zoo at far and quiet end of strip, Starbucks located within the property, Lulu's Restaurant (cheap and OK) on property, bus stops in font and across street, gay friendly and close to Hulas and Queens surf each areas, Room √à√\u2020\u2022?views in new tower facing Diamond Head in corner rooms are great, balcony (lanai) was very nice and size OK, mattress comfortable. Hotel staff pretty much aloof which suited us. Free WIFI in lobby (does not wok at pool level though they state it does). A\/C worked well, water and drainage good, bar fridge turned high kept bags of ice froze, coffee maker handy.BAD: Hotel- needs a real makeover from top to bottom, every piece of furniture needs replacement, Room: doors need better interior locks and the electronic door locks need replacement, furniture needs replacement as well as linens and drapes. Sheets were not changed daily, in fact changed on 3rd day on many days, one of us was bit by something in bed that left a a stain about 1√à√\u2020\u2022?round (we think a bed bug) and that pillowcase changed on 3rd day, while room was tidied it never felt really super √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âlean√à√\u2020\u2022?On checkout we were not given a survey card nor asked about our stay. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√©qua√à√\u2020\u2022?mark on the property is invisible. We would stay again here as we got great rates booking on-line through Orbitz but ONLY if we were in a corner room of new tower.
