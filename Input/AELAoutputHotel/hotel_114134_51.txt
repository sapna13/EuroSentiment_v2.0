{"text":"Fabulously positioned Hotel What a fabulous hotel the Lenox is. After a very long flight from Cape Town in South Africa via London, we were delighted to find such a stylish well kept hotel. It truly lived up to all the rave reviews on Trip advisor and the room looked just like the photo on the web, which was a huge relief! It is probably the best positioned hotel for touring central Boston. I booked on line and got a special rate which was great. It is expensive, especially in South African terms, but well worth it. We loved the turn down service and the Lindt chocolate that was put on our pillow every night. Even better.....there is a Lindt store right underneath the hotel so every night when you trudge wearily back to your hotel, you could pop in for a sweet √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µep me up. Another very useful thing is that there is a Dunkin Doughnut right across the road from the hotel so my husband popped over every morning for our coffee which was a fraction of the hotel prices. The hotel is so wonderfully positioned that we never had to use taxis. The 5th Avenue of Boston, Newbury Street is only 2 blocks away. Truly a 3 min walk. There you can stroll along the wonderfully wide sidewalks and experience Boston life, its people and shops. The Bostonians are so smart and they all seem to have beautifully groomed dogs. A 20 min walk will take you to the public gardens and on the other side of the park is the famous Cheers Pub. A must see with good food as well. Another half hour from the park will find you in Beacon Hill, the oldest part of Boston which is an absolute treat, with the most exquisite homes and little squares. Boston and the Lenox is definitely deserving of a second visit!
