{"text":"Great Experience Florence was the second leg of our two week honeymoon, and we stayed for two nights at this hotel. The staff was very helpful and friendly when we checked in, and we were given a room on the top floor (fifth for Europeans, sixth for Americans). We had a porch and the view was great. You can see it in the pictures already posted, but to our left were the mountains (don't look down because all you see is the train station). To our right was il Duomo and downtown Florence. The porch had a great breeze and we spent part of both nights on the porch relaxing.The hotel decor is very bare, with hardwood floors and very little decoration in the rooms. That was not a negative for us. My wife, a light sleeper, fell in love with the foam mattress and slept wonderfully, but unfortunately I did not sleep quite as well. The television in the room worked, we had good desk space, and the climate control was excellent. The bathroom was a good size and everything worked as well as it should have. One person had posted about being close to the station but not being able to hear any noise. That is very accurate, except for once we never heard any station noises even though the hotel is right next door to the train station. We had no such luck however with our roommates next door on the final day, who were loud by nature and we could hear through the walls.The staff, as I mentioned, was very friendly and helpful with our questions. The breakfast is good and has a variety of food and juice. It was a great way to start a day of sightseeing.I would recommend this hotel, the location and value are excellent. This is more of a 4 star hotel than a 3 star hotel. ","annotations":[]}
