{"text":"Nice Place Hubby, myself and another couple stayed here from Oct 3 - Oct 8. The rooms were very nice - suites- with a separate living room area. Very confortable beds, roomy bathroom and accomodating service. The pool area was enjoyable, free internet access, nice bar \/ lounge area and the lobby was tropical with an open atrium  lots of foliage. Free full breakfast available, including ready to order omelettes \/ eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, bagels, toast, cereals, oatmeal \/ farina, coffee, juices, etc, etc. More than enough to start the day. Free evening reception which amounted to free drinks for guests from 5:30pm - 7pm. Two blocks walking distance from the beach and other restaurants  hotels. We enjoy walking and after a full dinner, welcomed the opportunity to stroll along Isla Verde Blvd to visit other hotels. We went to two local restaurants: Barrachina  Mi Casita. Both were within walking distance and very flavorful - check them out! Also, we asked them for a recommendation for a local bakery. They gave us directions to Espana Bakery on Calle Marginal Villamar. This bakery is awesome! Only 5 minute drive from the hotel and they had everything from pastries to sandwiches to quiches to hot meals and even liquor. Delicious! We went there the day we were leaving and picked up sandwiches to eat on the airplane. The other passengers were jealous!Down sides - they do not have an airport shuttle. The front desk said that they are not allowed to have it??? Small casino - okay for a novice, but not sure if real players would be satisfied. Daily parking fee for guests ($10 \/ day). You would think they wouldn't charge guests for parking. An added hotel fee of 9% (or something like that). They attribute this to providing free internet access, free local phone service and other services. Just be aware of this. Not sure if other hotels have started charging the same fee, but the Embassy does. Regardless, we got a great package deal through Orbitz.Over all, service was great. We enjoyed it, and would stay there again.
