{"text":"A nice value vacation but manage your expectations The rating system is a little difficult when applied to the Palace. Some aspects would be considered 5 star, others 2 to 3. We were a group of 13, 2 families of 4, one of 3 and a couple with no kids. Kids ranged in age from 9 months to 7 years.The good stuff: the pool and beach are beautiful and the grounds are well maintained. Combined, the 5 hotels can hold 7,000 guests. There are 3,000 employees. An amazing ratio. The Palace is clean, clean, clean, but showing signs of age. The staff keeps your room very clean, but again the rooms are getting tired. We stayed in a suite, so that we could put our kids to sleep and have a place to socialize with our friends or just watch TV. The suites are very nice and have the best views. I read a review that said there are no channels in English. You can get 20 English channels for $20 for the week.The staff is very friendly. Using bad Spanish and tipping go a long way. I brought $100 on one dollar bills and tipped for everything. It is a small price to pay to get great service. We also generously tipped the general manager upon arrival. When we got to our room, it only had one bed, not the two requested. I called the GM and within 20 minutes a full queen side showed up with headboard, etc. He then personally called to see if our room had any other deficiencies that he could take care of.The food: hit or miss. 9 of the 12 people eating the food developed a GI problem at one time or another. That is a significant attrition rate, even for a third world country. Pack your medical kit accordingly. I did not eat anything that came out of a steamer tray. You can, however, get delicious food prepared for you ranging from lamb to fish to steaks. The rule of thumb is that if looks bad, or tastes bad, it probably is bad. Move onto something else. Consistency is also a problem. The lobster in the seafood restaurant ranged from inedible one night to very good another.Excursions: significant bus time is required for many of the excursions. The diving at Catalina was good, two hours each way, the four wheeler adventure was fun, a little over regulated and the equipment fairly beat up. Bus ride 1.5 hours each way. The horseback riding and spelunking adventure, very good excursion √à√\u2020\u2022?bus ride 3 to 4 hours each way. Santa Domingo, 3 hours each way. The segway rides were at the hotel and a blast. The golf course was nice. Greens and fairways in good shape, sand traps like hitting off a parking lot. In short, there is very little outside the grounds of the hotel complex.The clientele is very diverse with Americans making up the minority. If topless sunbathing and bathing suites that the more conservative would consider inadequate bother you, then it could be problematic. We found the people we met to be gracious and interesting.In general, it was a very nice vacation, but I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know that I would go back to this hotel. There are many options in the competitive all inclusive market, and we like to try new places. A few tweaks could make the hotel truly wonderful.
