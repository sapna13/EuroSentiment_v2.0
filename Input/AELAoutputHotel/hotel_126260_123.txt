{"text":"Lovely hotel and great location Just got back from the new york palace. Stayed for 4 nights in one of their standard rooms which I have to say for new york was very good lots of space and very comfy bed. If you are undecided whether to stay in the standard or executive room I would go standard. You only miss out on a view and a breakfast. We got a very good rate with hotels.com √à√\u2020√ü?54 + tax. As mentioned before the hotel is perfectly located. We ate out the whole time we were there as there is so much to choose from. If you like your breakfasts and want to treat yourself, book the BLT market restaurant at the ritz on central park south. Its not cheap but is worth every penny. Breakfast was the best I ever had. Also for all steak lovers there is nowhere else but Peter Lugers in Brooklyn (15 min taxi ride). We were told this would be the best steak we ever had, having been told that about Smith  Wollenskys (very poor), I was a bit skeptical but they were right. Melt in the mouth so please do take a trip there but be warned you have to book a few weeks in advance, we could only get a late table on a sunday night, apparently very hard to get a fri or sat. The Gilt bar at the hotel is nice for a cocktail before heading out to dinner. We didnt eat there but it looked very nice.I would stay at the palace again, I found little to complain about. The check in area and part of the lobby needs a bit of an update but overall you will be very pleased. Enjoy.
