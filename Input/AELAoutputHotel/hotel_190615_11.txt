{"text":"Good, 4.5 star - not quite 5 star I stayed here whilst at a meeting in Barcelona. The location is great being just one block off the Paseig de Gracia and hence only two blocks from the metro. The hotel itself has been constructed within an older building and the architecture is very interesting. The hotel is built around a central atrium. The front lobby is very arty with various glass and water features. The public areas were generally of a high standard.The front desk were very friendly and helpful. My room was on the fifth floor - the lifts are very small, glass affairs. The furnishings were to a high standard in the room. The bedroom and separate bathroom were spotlessly clean. It did suffer majorly from having only one small window which was set a one end of the room and opened out onto the internal atrium. This meant that little natural daylight got into the room. The toileteries were ample and of good quality.Breakfast was served in the basement - so no daylight there either. The room I found to be featureless and devoid of atmosphere. It started serving at 07:00 which is quite late for business people. The choice was reasonable and the presentation faultless. I have had better breakfasts in Spain, but I have had many worse.There is a pool on the roof but this is much smaller in reality than the hotel website photographs would suggest - so be warned you won't being doing traiing laps here. There is a bar beside the pool and another small one on the ground floor.Overall this is indeed a luxury hotel but I am not sure it meets UK 5 star standards, mainly due to the lack of amenities. It is a moderate sized, boutique-type hotel rather than your large scale Mariott or Hilton. ","annotations":[]}
