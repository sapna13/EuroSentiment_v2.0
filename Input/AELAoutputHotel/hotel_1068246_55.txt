{"text":"Majestic Elegance - Elegant We were originally booked from 15th to 29th November 2008; however the resort was not ready. We were contacted by our tour operator and advised that we could stay at the Majestic Colonial for the 1st week (Nov 15 to 21st) and then move to the Elegance resort for the 2nd week (Nov 21st to 29th).This review will only be for the Majestic Elegance resort.We went with an open mind, seeing this is a new resort and focused on the positive experiences that we encountered. Upon our arrival at the Elegance Resort we were greeted by the Vice President of Sales  Marketing, Mr. Ricardo Espinosa. Upon request we were upgraded to Elegance Club with many thanks to Mr. Espinosa.  The room was exactly as we had imagined it √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨legant√à√\u2020\u2022?with a wonderful view of the ocean. We did encounter a couple of issues with the room, but they were corrected to our satisfaction, with the exception of the air conditioning.The resort, on the first day had only 2 restaurants open, the Italian and the Sea  See buffet restaurant on the beach. As each new day rolled around a new restaurant would open. The food was excellent in all of the restaurants and reservations are only required in the gourmet and Japanese.We were very impressed with the fact that you could just walk into the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ö-la-carte√à√\u2020\u2022?restaurants without reservations.We only ate in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øain buffet √à√\u2020\u2022?Flavors√à√\u2020\u2022?on our last day, the variety, quality and display of the food was outstanding.The drink selection was very good at all of the bars. The upper and lower level lobby bars served premium drinks and had a wide selection to choose from. All the bartenders were without a doubt the friendliest that we have encountered in all our years of travel.The pool runs from basically one end of the resort to the other, with 2 private pools for the Elegance Club members. There were plenty of loungers (aluminum and not the plastic kind) around the pool areas. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®ali beds√à√\u2020\u2022?were very comfortable and great for an afternoon siesta. There was no shortage of palapas on the beach and we never had to play the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢owel game√à√\u2020\u2022? On opening day there were many √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°inishing touches√à√\u2020\u2022?left to be completed. We were amazed at the amount of work that had been completed during the week and that the workers were unobtrusive and the noise was next to none. We are quite confident that within the next month or so, they will be completed and will truly make this one of the premier destinations in the Punta Cana area. We are returning in February 2009 for another 2 week stay and are anxious to see the progress that has been made.At this time we would like to take this opportunity to personally thank those staff members that made our stay an enjoyable one.In the Elegance Club: Calix, Larissa, Mariannie, Kayala, Angel  Ramone. These people went out of their way to assure that we were well looked after and that we did not require anything, and if we did, took care of it immediately and without any hesitation or question.Sea  See (beach restaurant); Bartender Felix, server (waiter) NelsonSteakhouse restaurant: server (waiter) Juan (his speech for the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áest desserts in the Caribbean√à√\u2020\u2022? is very cute and funny. There are many others who deserve praise, but unfortunately we can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ remember all of their names.As we stated in our opening remarks we went with an open mind and had a wonderful time.
