{"text":"Great Stay! My husband and I went to the Rio Mar from Nov. 27-Dec.2 and I have to say that I was extremely nervous after reading many of the postings, but we ended having a great stay! When we arrived Otis at Check -in was extremely nice and asked about our trip in and if we were there for any special reason, it was our 10th anniversary. He upgraded our room to an Ocean Suite on the 5th floor which was a very nice surprise! The room was nice with a sitting area that had a couch, reading chair, coffee table and end tables and a desk area. We had a decent size balcony. Other reviews of the walls being thin is very true but we only had someone next to us 2 nights so it was not a big deal. The bathroom was off of the foyer area. The bathrooms could use a little work though, the vanities are nice with the granite and the tile floors but the shower\/tub had two chips in them, the shower head was ancient and the shower was small. Over all the room was clean as was the bathroom, but like I said the shower\/tub were old so there was no chance I would be taking a bath especially sine there is not much room to do so. The grounds are gorgeous like everyone said. You really can't describe the beauty of them and I don't think that the pictures do it justice either. From the moment that you drive into the resort you are stunned by the view straight out to the ocean and the beauty of the lush vegetation. We walked around the grounds and there are many iguana residents but they are not bothered by us, small getcos and coquis that you hear at night mainly. We sat on the beach everyday except for the last day where we sat at the quiet pool. The beach is very nice and we found a little palm tree heaven a little was down the beach that great for some privacy and shade if you didn't want to be in the sun all the time. The food was good but definitely pricey! Luckily our breakfast was included otherwise for the buffet everyday you are looking at around $60 for two including tip and taxes which are 7%, I live in Delaware so no tax that is why I was surprised at how high it was. Be careful though one day our waiter Kelvin who was not that attentive included the tip in the bill already and did not tell us luckily I was paying close attention going over the bill that day. I guess that explained his poor service since he know he already put in the tip. No other waiters did that thought. The buffett was plentiful and good, the pancakes, bacon, scrambled egss, etc. that were in servers could have been a little warmer. We ate at Palio which was delicious and not as outlandishly priced as I was expecting. The tiki bar by the beach is where we ate lunch and was ok food wise but the drinks were spectacular. This is the only place that we encountered a rude staff member and it was not so much to us as it was to another guest that was having lunch there. Needless to say after that day we did not see him there again and that was our second day there. I guess he must have been moved to another area. Definitely rent a car, it is a must! To get from the airport to the hotel is about 45 minutes and you only pay 1.50 toll if you take Rt.66 there. We self parked everyday for $15 a day, valet is $20 a day whcih I think is crazy to pay that much for the parking. It is great to have a car because the shuttle to the hotel is about $50-60 a person and then you are confined to the grounds unless you want to pay about the same price to go over to the rainforest or any other excursion that is offered. We went the first day to the grocery store and got some snacks and water for the week and we were able to drive over to the rainforest and go out to local areas at our leisure which helps to keep food costs down. Overall it was a great trip very relaxing and the hotel staff was very curteous and friendly going out of there was to greet you or to see if everything was to your liking. I would recommend this hotel to others and would go back myself.
