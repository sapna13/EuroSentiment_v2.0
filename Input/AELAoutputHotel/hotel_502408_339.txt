{"text":"Comfy beds, clean hotel, great location First time to NYC, stayed at the Affinia 50 for six nights Aug-Sept. We had one of the 'cheap' room rates, 1-4 floors. No kitchenette like the description claimed, but it did have a small fridge. Did not bring it to their attention, as we were a night away from leaving. Book through AAA if you can, that way you get the best rate and you can always cancel. Just remodeled, nice rooms, best beds ever- that is important. Yes you will have to get your room key activated if you stay more than a few nights- happened here a few times, and in Boston- I think its an east coast thing..Great location, in my opinion. Would stay there again- for the price it can't be beat. All other hotels with good reviews were over $200 a night. Waldorf is a block away, if you want to spend over $400 a night. Here is my review\/advice for those interested in details:Location was great. If you want a more quiet neighborhood at night, the outside is low on noise, except for cabs always honking. If you are looking for food in the a.m. McDonald's is on 3rd, literally 30 seconds away.DO NOT go to the breakfast place on 50th, the Luncheonette I think. Overpriced and the menu is misleading. We thought ten dollars, charged 20...fine print on the menu...Ugh.Ess-a-bagel (across from McD's) is great, busy in the a.m. but worth it for a cheap breakfast that will last till lunch time. Fabulous Mexican restaurant on 2nd Ave. Its a must. Mariachi band is great. Food is great. St. Bart's Church (on your way to Rock), great outdoor dining for dinner. Less than five minute walk.Subway is on 51st  Lexington, two minute walking distance. Starbucks is also right there. Always, always, always, carry a subway map and learn how to use it.Also invest in a Manhattan map so you get acquainted with how the streets work. They are VERY handy.Rockefeller Center is about a ten minute walk. Cab ride to Columbus Circle was $10, I think. Cab ride from JFK to Manhattan is a flate $45 plus bridge toll of $4.50If you like walking, Chrysler building is not too far. Ended up at the Empire State building, and Grand Central. Use the subway for Soho, Little Italy, Macys, Statue of Liberty, Ground Zero. It drops you off at all those places.-The doorman was the best part of the staff, always smiles and friendly. Housekeeping was noisey in the morning, and the slamming of doors will definitely wake you up.-Made it back for wine\/cheese hour only once time, but it was great and relaxing.-We had a smaller room, huge king bed, but no complaints about the size since there were only 2 of us. -Bathrooms are SMALL. The faucet is ridiculous, couldn't wash my face without getting water everywhere. -Street noise was noticeable, but not as noticeable as the loud housekeeping early in the morning! I guess that is with all hotels though. Plus its NYC, cars are honking all day and all night!If its your first time, bring a lot of money for touristy things. Everything costs money. Food is expensive. Plan on at least $60 for dinner\/two people. Oh, and bring comfy shoes. I did a LOT of research before booking this hotel, and I was not disappointed. Keep checking the price, mine went down after booking so I called AAA and got the lower price. Overall, LOVE NYC and want to come back soon!
