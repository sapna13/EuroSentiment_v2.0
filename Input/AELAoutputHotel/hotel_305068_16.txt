{"text":"Sheer Perfection Having just returned from a four day stay at The InterContinental, Hong Kong, I can only endorse the glowing reports already posted by previous reviewers.. My husband had wanted to stay at The Peninsula but having looked at the Trip Advisor comments I persuaded him to try the InterContinental instead. I admit to having had a few qualms as we drove up to the front of the hotel (not its best feature and a bit stark compared to the opulence of The Pen.) However from the moment we walked into the spacious lobby with its stunning views of the harbour and were greeted by the attentive, efficient and always smiling staff, we were totally 'hooked'. We had booked a Deluxe Harbour view room but were fortunate enough to be upgraded to a suite - again with amazing views and great facilities - (two large flat screen TVs, BOSE sound system, espresso machine and well equipped bathroom with sunken bath and Bulgari toiletries (Bliss!) It was a wrench to leave the room each day to explore the other delights of HK!) The hotel's facilities were altogether superb but the staff were what really made the stay so special. Whether in the corridors, lobby or at breakfast we were addressed by name and made to feel as though nothing was too much trouble. Incidentally, we did have afternoon tea at the Peninsula but felt that whilst the tea itself was good the hotel was in danger of seeing itself as more of a tourist attraction and Hong Kong institution rather than making its guests its top priority. The InterContinental on the other hand went out of its way to ensure we had a memorable stay. All in all, a memorable experience and one which we hope to repeat very soon!
