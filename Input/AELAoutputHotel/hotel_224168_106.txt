{"text":"great hotel We (myself and my boyfriend)stayed at the Renaissance Hollywood for 3 nights from 12th october 2007 and really enjoyed our stay.After a slight hiccup upon arrival, as in we didnt have a reservation even though i booked it 13 months ago! I work at thomas cook so i booked it myself, took about 15 mins to resolve, finally found my reservation in a totally different name!!!Anyway, got our room, really modern and spacious looking at Hollywood sign, lovely bathroom and everywhere clean and tidy.The hotel is attached to Chinese theatre and kodak so virtually on the doorstep to everything, apparantly alot of the celebs stay here on oscars night as you can walk through to hotel without having to go back outside to get mobbed!!didint see any celebs though!We did a tour through starline which was fabulous took us through beverly hills movie stars homes tour, rodeo drive, stars cemmetry and even up into the hollywood hills for a close up of the sign! after this we did a walking tour of the walk of fame, el capitan theatre and kodak\/graumans, amazing day and leant alot!!next day we did universal studios which was really great tooThe hotel is definatly worth 4 star as it was just a fab place and the staff were really helpful too. pool was small but didnt see anybody using it, great views from there too, if you go, request a high floor as views are great and its quieter too,I would definatley recommend this hotel for its location and i would stay here again.
