{"text":"An Amazing Hotel My family and I just returned from Japan, and we were very fortunate indeed to stay at the Park Hyatt in Tokyo. If you can afford it, this is absolutely the place to stay for the trip of a lifetime. In many years of business and personal travel, staying at some of the finest hotels in the world, I've never stayed anywhere this nice. The rooms are huge, for Tokyo or anywhere else. Beautifully decorated, simple, with a trademark wonderful Japanese bathroom (the best in the world), the view has to be seen to be experienced. Ask for a corner room, which has views in two directions. The food was excellent, the public spaces literally breathtaking, the location very convenient. We took cabs everywhere, which wasn't as expensive as we had feared. But the real key is the incredible staff. If you're in a country where you can't read or speak the language, a bilingual and extremely competent staff can really make the difference in your stay. The Park Hyatt staff all spoke English perfectly (even the waiters\/waitresses in the restaurants.) The concierges, led by the fantastic Adrian, really were tremendous, recommending great restaurants (ah, the food !), telling us where to go for anything under the sun (shopping is definitely a national pasttime), how to get there, and what to skip. I was talking to a friend about where to stay in Tokyo, and he made the point that a great concierge can really make a trip to Japan, and to stay at the Park Hyatt, cost be damned, and boy, am I glad I listened. We paid about $550 per room (including a fantastic and very filling Western-style breakfast, and like I said, if you can afford it, I can't imagine you will have anything but a WONDERFUL time. Super highly recommended. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":350,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":346}]}
