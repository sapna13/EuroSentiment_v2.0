{"text":"excellent stay I spent 5 days at Hotel Catedral in April 2008, following very positive reviews in Trip Advisor. My expectations were met and more. From the moment I walked into the hotel, tired after dragging 3 pieces of luggage about 1 km, I knew I had made the right choice. The receptionist was very welcoming and organised a wonderful tequila concotion, which lifted my spirits enormously. I then proceded to my 6th floor room with a balcony and a wondeful view of the mountains and rooftops. The room was very large, very clean with a large spotless bathroom. Everything worked perfectly, even the toilet, which is unusual in Mexican hotels. The day started with a wonderful breakfast (plenty of choices available and very filling), included in the incredibly low price of about 500 pesos, which was truly a bargain considering the location. Right behind the catedral and the Zocalo, next to the main acheological site in the city and a host of other very interesting places. I shopped in the miryads of little jewellery and perfume shops in the area. Everything you could possibly want is within walking distance of the hotel, including several metro stops, internet cafes, camera shops, shoeshine, restaurants and bakeries........ I was just so sad to leave, I could have happily spent several weeks there. One note of caution: there is a building site next door which I guess can be noisy, so check and ask for a room with a balcony for great views. The hotel also has a tourist desk which can help with day tours etc. I will be back if it is the last thing I do, and to check the rooftop terrace with more views of the city - so busy I forgot. As an older woman on my own I felt incredibly safe in the area and it was great to be within walking distance from everything. ","annotations":[]}
