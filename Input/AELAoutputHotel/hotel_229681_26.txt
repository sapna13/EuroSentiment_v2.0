{"text":"Unbeatable Location I spent 5 nights in this hotel and would highly recommend it. The location of the hotel is fantastic. It is situated adjacent to the square in front of the cathedral. A beautiful setting with restaurants and cafes nearby. I also found the immediate area around the hotel a lot more relaxed and safer than La RamblaIt is less than a 10 minute walk to Placa de Catalunya which is where the buses from the airport stop. It is also just a few minutes walk from a stop on the Bus Turistic route. La Rambla and the metro station Juame are also close by.The only downside of the hotel is the street noise at night. However I believe this is a problem with most hotels in central Barcelona. Indeed the street noise wasn't as bad as at another hotel I had previosly stayed in while in Barcelona. If you close the window and pull the shutter down it does make a difference in Regencia Colon Hotel.The room we had cost 75 Euros per night and this was excellent value given the location and the quailty of the hotel. Breakfast is an extra 10.70 Euros. The breakfast is a buffet consisting of scrambled egg, cocktail sausages, bacon, cold meat, cheese, fruit, yogurt, cereal, bread, pastry, juice, tea and coffee. The breakfast was good although slightly expensive at 10.70 Euros.We also dined in the Hotel restaurant which is located in the sister Colon Hotel across the street. There was a decent selection of food on the menu and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal. We were also served a complimentary glass of champagne which was a nice touch.Our room was spacious and clean and indeed was cleaned each day. There was also a decent LCD Television in the room with a selection of channels.The ensuite bathroom was of average size. Shower gel, shampoo and dental kits were supplied in the bathroom on a daily basis.The staff in the hotel were very friendly and helpful.I really enjoyed my stay in the hotel and would certainly look to stay here again if I'm ever back in Barcelona.
