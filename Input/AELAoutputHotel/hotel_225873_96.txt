{"text":"Really, really overrated After reading reviews on tripadvisor, in magazines, Boston's Best of...about the Charlesmark, I decided to book it. I think this place and its staff have let the reviews go to their collective head. For paying $198 per night, I expected a lot more in terms of customer service. When I walked in, there were three people behind the 2.5 foot long front desk. Two continued their personal conversation and the third person looked at me with no interest whatsoever. There was no How may I help you?. No good afternoon. No nada. When I asked for help with our bags, one young man followed me out to the car and watched as I unloaded the bags. It took over one-half hour for our bags to make it to our room. Although there was an apology offeredfor it taking so long, it was given while the offeror was on his cellphone in the midst of a personal conversation. This was not a good sign. None of the three staff we had regular contact with would engage in a conversation without being prompted, no good morning, etc. The carpets did not appear to have been vaccumed either in the halls or our room in several days. Again, not for essentially $200 a night. There are some positives: The interior design is great, there is one bartender named Jefferson who I'd recommend to anyone, the location is perfect (however, any downtown hotel is strategically located for business\/tourist travel), the disorganization and generalinattention to detail got us a couple glasses of Pinot Noir and appetizers for free. That wasn't the intention, however. When I checked out, I was told that everything was taken care of. I remindedthe person at the desk that we had two nights of a bar tab charged toour room. She looked at me, said, Well, that's a separate system andhe (not sure who) isn't here right now. Twenty minutes later one ofthe staff said, Your charge is $10 but I'm having a hard time printing it. In the next ten minutes, he walked by me four times anddid not address me. While we were double parked and loading our car ourselves, I ran back in and asked that the bill be mailed to me. BTW, our bill should have been about $50 so I'm apparently as confused as they are. We'll be back in Boston in September and will not be staying here!
