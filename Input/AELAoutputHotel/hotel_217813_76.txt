{"text":"This was THE PERFECT HOTEL!!!!!! We absolutely loved this hotel! Stayed for four nights in room 483 and 485 (the fourth floor is the top floor so this is not a huge place). There was no view as you are sandwiched in between hotels and other buildings but we didn't come to sit in the room. We paid $62\/night through hotwire.com on a rather last-minute trip and this was an extraordinary value for this normally $200+ night hotel. The hotel looks like it is brand new!! It is probably the cleanest, best maintained hotel we've stayed in and we've stayed in a lot, including upscale five star establishments! The furniture, furnishings, linens, beds ... everything ... top notch and in perfect working and very comfortable condition. The staff, including the maids, are all very friendly and helpful. The new hot breakfast is very good and saves a ton of $ on breakfast every morning. The only complaint - well, a couple complaints, is it isn't very hot. The hot items are lukewarm at best and the variety is the same every day. Some pancakes or waffles would be a nice touch as not everyone enjoys biscuits and gravy (a daily offering). The other complaint that really doesn't have as much to do with the hotel is the other guests - every morning we had pushy, rude people crowding in trying to cut in line, like a bunch of pigs waiting for food at the trough. The thing the hotel could do to mitigate this is re-think the way the breakfast is set up. Logistically it could be set up in a better way to avoid people crowding in. It is fantastic that they provide a hot breakfast, it is good and the gentlemen manning the breakfast ensure there is never anything empty, they do a very nice job. A nice touch are the two free computers they provide in the lobby for internet use. They are even hooked up to printers which was great to be able to print out city maps etc. They do get busy though and the waiting line can be long. The hotel location is perfect and so close to everything you'd want to do. We didn't have a car to worry about the exorbanant parking charges; we took the 'Go Lorries' airport shuttle both to\/from the airport which worked out wonderfully. We walked everywhere or used the 3-day MUNI passes we purchased for $18 to ride the cable cars, streetcars and bus system all over SF. The passes were well worth the money. We would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat and we were sorry to leave!
