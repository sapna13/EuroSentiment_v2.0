{"text":"Ideally located, helpful  I just returned from a great stay at the Ambassade Hotel in Amsterdam. We had room 26 (a double room) which worked out great since my wife and I were traveling with out 4 yr. old son. (Attention Families, Room 26 was perfect for us since it had a small room off to the side with a small twin bed just perfect for our son.)Rose at the front desk was particularly helpful after we mistakenly left a bag at the airport. They even helped us shorten our stay by one night by helping to contact our airline's local number and speaking with a local agent. Our room seemed a bit larger than other typical European hotel rooms. Furniture was better than average. Due to persistent rain, umbrellas were always available in the lobby, which we made use of repeatedly. (And the umbrellas were not poor quality either).The location, in my opinion, could not have been any better for what we wanted out of a hotel room in Amsterdam. It seemed to be perfectly located amongst dozens of small antique\/varietty shops, bars\/pubs and coffee shops. There were so many things to see and do which were all just a few minutes walking distance from our hotel.Breakfast was a bit expensive inside the hotel, but we splurged on our last day and I believe it was well worth the price paid. Breakfast had great variety, eggs were prepared as we requested and the coffee was, as expected, great. Fresh fruit, juices and bread, salmon, cheeses, etc.Overall, our stay at Ambassade Hotel was an excellent experience and since Amsterdam is so easy to reach from the US and the Middle East (where I work), we likely will return to Ambassade again.
