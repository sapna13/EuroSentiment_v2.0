{"text":"Good location, in severe need of revamping Having stayed here many years ago, I decided to book myself into this hotel as I remembered that it was a good hotel right in the midst of bustling Kuta. Having arrived at the hotel I realised that yes, the hotel was right in the heart of the bustling area, near the shops and beach, but the hotel looked like it hadn't changed since I was there all those years ago (i'm talking 1998!!!). Everything about the hotel screamed 'renovation', the lobby was dilapidated, with paint coming off the walls and even the grass looking like it hasn't grown properly in years. The rooms are average at best, with marks on the towels and floors. In addition, the staff seem to not be that bothered to even smile at you. Oh, and another thing, the breakfast is very very disappointing, so much so that the waffle station (which doesn't operate everyday) was filled with ants!The good thing about the hotel is that the pool is very large and right on the beach. This is contrasting to the other hotels in the area that do not have direct access.Overall, I would not recommend to stay at the Inna Kuta. I definitely did not deserve its four star rating, and it shocked me to see that their certificate was renewed in July of 2007. I would suggest to stay in any of the various other hotels in Bali, which look far more maintained, Kuta Seaview being our favourite along the beach (cross a main road to get onto the beach), and the Ramayana Hotel looking fantastic at very respectable prices, albeit slightly further away from the beach.
