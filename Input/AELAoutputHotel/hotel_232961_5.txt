{"text":"Small, clean, friendly hotel My boyfriend and I (both aged 27) have just got back from a 6 night stay in Florence at the Hotel Rapallo. It is a tiny hotel but we really enjoyed our stay there. the decor is traditional and has character. Our room was as the photos we had seen suggested although maybe slightly smaller than they would have you believe and the bathroom was more of a wet room and wasn't water proof but was fine and as the bathroom was kept spotlessly clean it wasn't a problem. Breakfast is a simple affiar-Italians do not do fry ups (much to my boyfriend's chagrin) so it was cereal, rolls, ham, cheese, boiled eggs, croissants but was set out in a buffet style so you could have as much as you wanted. The waiter at breakfast was also very friendly and helpful. The guys on the reception desk were friendly and offered to recommend restaurants and told us about trips outside Florence we could make. They were very hospitable and even indulged my nightly request for a corkscrew so we could have a drink in the room before going out! The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from all the main attractions and in a fairly nice area.If you want a place to stay in Florence and cannot afford 5 star luxury then go for this place. It is extremely clean, friendly, has character, is fairly centrally located and none of the guests are noisy. We also got free internet access-only one computer but there was never a queue and anyway you don't go to Italy to sit at a computer!If you want a nice, friendly cafe, which is chilled out then turn right out of the hotel, cross the road and about 50 or so metres down is a great one-I can't remember its' name but it's on a corner and is really nice.Oh, by the way, expect the smallest lift you have ever seen-very funny!
