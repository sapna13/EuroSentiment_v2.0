{"text":"Not bad for the price... My wife and I stayed at Grand Paradise Bavaro Jun. 26 to July 3. Overall it was a very good trip. First room was a bit funky, in Building 3. It had a moldy smell and and the bathroom was falling apart and there was no view to speak of. The toilet didn't flush but I fixed it. We complained at Reception and were given a new room in Building 6 with a king bed and a clean bathroom and a view of the pool and the ocean. The rooms are functional but not fancy. They all seem to need a bit of work. But it was fine, AC worked, shower was fine. The TV got a ton of channels in Spanish, English, French, Portuguese, Italian and German(ask for remate at reception). I noticed some people mentioned in the reviews that there were no face clothes, but our room had them. The maid worked very hard, you really should tip these ladies. All the staff at the resort are very hard workers. You can hear everything going on outside, drunk people yelling, people next door gettin' some. The resaturants were all good. But I can see why typical Americans would not like the food. The Buffet didn't have hamburgers, pizza or fried chicken fingers. They did, however, have the best red beans and rice, tropical veggies like yuca, tayote and green plantains, and tropical fruits like chinola. Lots of meats and seafood as well. Great coffee. Ate at two A la cartes, Taino (dominican) and Michaelangelo's (Italian). The Italian was ok, nothing special at all. The Domican place was one of the best restaurants I've eaten at in a long time. Amazing cream of Yuca soup, delicious Chicken stuffed with ripe plantain. At the buffet I often had to get up and get my own drink at the bar, or find my own clean silverware, but that didn't really bother me considering that we paid $550 each (including air) for 7 nights. Everyone works so hard, many live at the resort and work for 10 days straight then get three days off so they can travel back to their towns and be with their families.The beach was really nice. Impossible to get a palapa unless you get up before dawn. There are many palm trees you can sit under though. The sand is white and the water warn and clear. It gets rough toward the end of the afternoon. Overall, we were very satisfied with the resort considering what we paid. We are both Spanish-speakers too, so we didn't have any communication problems. I think that it's true that many of the staff had limited proficiency in English. The other guests were a mix of Spaniards, French, Canadians, other Europeans and a few other Americans. Everyone was nice except for the Gift shop ladies.
