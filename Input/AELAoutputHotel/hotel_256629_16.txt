{"text":"Excellent Hotel I am a leisure traveler, who now lives in Bangkok. I stayed at the Radisson for 12 nights at the end of September 2008. Location. Perhaps the best feature of the Radisson is it's location in the CBD. I was able to take a train from the airport to the Wynyard station, which is only a block away from the hotel. Because I was able to walk to almost all the places I wanted to visit in Sydney, I used public transportation very little. Some examples: Circular Quay (10-15 minutes' walk), Sydney Opera House (15-20 minutes), Pitt Street Mall (5-7 minutes). In the immediate vicinity of the hotel, were all the services I needed, such as two 24 hour convenience stores, book store, food courts, and ATM machines. Some comments I read suggested that the area was dead after office hours and on weekends, but I did not find that to be the case. There were always others on the street and I always felt totally safe, even with many late night walks back to the hotel from the Sydney Opera House. Neighborhood restaurants and entertainment venues were open nightly.Room. I had an inside room on the 10th floor. It was large and had every imaginable convenience and amenity. I particularly liked the iPod docking station with speakers. The room itself was furnished in the contemporary or minimalist style favored by international chains. I would prefer something more elaborate, but the room was so convenient and comfortable, that I can't complaint. The bathroom was gorgeous.The Staff. The staff couldn't do enough for me. They were friendly and went beyond just answering a question or providing a service. I consider the friendliness and competency of the staff a prime attribute of this fine hotel.Plaza Club. Because I was going to stay for 12 nights, I decided to spend the extra money and upgrade to the Plaza Club, or whatever they call it. Breakfast in the Plaza Club, which was located on my floor, while not grotesquely elaborate like some five star hotels, was plentiful, varied and delicious. The cocktail hour at night was replete with wonderful food. I had free access to the PCs in the business center (I don't travel with a laptop) 24 hours a day. The upgrade was well worth the cost and I highly recommend it.I loved Sydney and am planning to return next year. I wouldn't stay in any hotel other than the Radisson. As they kids say: They have their act together.
