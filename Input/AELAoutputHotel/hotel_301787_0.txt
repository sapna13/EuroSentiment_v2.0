{"text":"Very nice hotel, but not quite a 5-star experience We spent two nights over New Year's Eve 2008 at the Laguna Resort Nusa Dua. We arrived at the Laguna after having spent 10 nights in the neighboring Westin Nusa Dua.The rooms at the Laguna Resort were certainly nicer and had more of a high-end feel about them, but then we also paid almost double what we had paid at the Westin.Upon check in, we were told that, although we had booked a regular garden view room, we got upgraded to a laguna access room as our room preference was not available. We were thrilled with this until be stepped into the hallway leading to our room and were struck by the damp air and musty smell. The room itself also felt damp and rather dark. In addition, for the two days that we stayed there, we hardly pulled the curtains away, let alone open the balcony door, because of a perceived lack of privacy. The balcony itself was very small, in fact smaller than the one that we had at the Westin.We were traveling with friends and they were given a room on a higher floor. Neither their room, nor the floor they were on felt damp, so we blamed the dampness on the proximity of the lagoon. As a result, our recommendation would be to not pay the extra charge for the lagoon access rooms. They lack privacy and can be dark and damp.Another issue that we faced, but one that we were already familiar with from the Westin, was the loud croaking of frogs at night. It seemed like the noise was coming from the lagoon-like pool with mock sand that people were swimming in during the day. In fairness to the hotel, we looked at the water during the day and couldn't see frogs in the pool, but we hesitated getting in that pool, nonetheless. Luckily for us, the beach at this resort seemed nicer than at the Westin, so we spent our two days on the beach.We can't say much about the breakfast buffet because our first morning there was right after New Year's Eve, so we slept in late, while our second morning the place was so crowded that after waiting for a table for about 15 minutes we decided to walk over to the Westin and have breakfast there instead.For New Year's Eve (and unlike at the Westin), guests didn't have to pay for a mandatory dinner celebration. Instead, we reserved a table on their restaurant terrace. It was directly on the beach and pleasantly decorated. We paid a very reasonable charge and food was plentiful at the buffet, but drinks were not included and a bottle of Moet  Chandon champagne cost $480 (!!) -- that same champagne costs $29 in the States and $90 in Bali. While we certainly expected it to be more expensive in a restaurant than in a supermarket, we still found a 500% surcharge excessive.All in all, this is a very nice hotel, but falls a little short of what one would expect from a true 5-star property. The furniture was nice but fairly nondescript, we didn't receive a newspaper in the morning, we only got two pairs of slippers when clearly three guests had checked into the room, the balcony door didn't close properly, the shower head was not attached firmly to the wall and was shaking, we could have used more dresser space, etc. Nothing major, that would definitely ruin one's vacation, but not quite a 5-star experience. We would probably not pay the premium to go back to this hotel, or, if we wanted to spend that much, we would probably look at comparable properties elsewhere.
