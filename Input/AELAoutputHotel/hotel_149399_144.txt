{"text":"Wonderful wedding and vacation at the Melia! We spent two weeks at the Melia Caribe from May 3rd to May 17th for our Wedding. We had a group of 18 and all stayed Royal Service. Hubby and I stayed in the 1 bedroom master suite and it was Heaven!! The room was spotless, and the maid was nice enough to restock our fridge with cold presidente every day! (a few $$ tips will get you a long way!) Our other guests all thought their rooms were nice, and there was only a few bug sightings in the rooms.. (well, it is in the Caribbean folks..)Resort and grounds- its been said before, and I'll say it again, this resort is massive and beautiful. Lots of comfy seating everywhere, great bars, great drinks (Strong). The grounds are perfectly manicured and look like a dream.. Nightlife is something we found a bit lacking on the few nights we could actually stay awake!Food- ranged from good at the buffets, to great at the A la Cartes. We ate at all the A la Cartes except for the International which was closed. Favorite was the Japanese and least fave was the Capri (seafood) Buffets had lots of selection, the picky eaters in our group really liked the snack bar near the Gabi pool for ice cream and french fries.. (just a note though, all of us experienced stomach issues- take some immodium!) Beach and Pools- Beach was quite simply awesome, white sand and aqua water. When we were there there was no problem getting a good spot, even for our big group to sit together! Pools are spotless- we even went for a dip at 3 am one morning.. Perfect! One thing that drove us crazy was the beach vendors- it is difficult to walk the beach without them practially dragging you into their shops with their Cheapie Cheapie prices. Im not much for being bullied, but this seams to be the way its done in the DR. Again not the resorts fault.Wedding- Although it was a bit bumpy in places (they were late with the hair appointments-my name was incorrectly spelled on our menus) The wedding overall was fantastic. Our pictures look like something out of a Fairytale and all of our guests raved about it. The musical Trio is worth every penny.With the weather being hot hot hot everyday, and not a drop of rain for 2 weeks, we all had the most amazing time. Its a perfect getaway for a vacation, wedding, anniversary etc etc.. Would return, but would stay only in the Royal Service side.
