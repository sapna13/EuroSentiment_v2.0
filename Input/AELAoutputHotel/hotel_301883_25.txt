{"text":"Needs some polish, just not the best We stayed 3 nights here to celebrate our 25th annversary, coming from Kayumanis Jimbaran Bay. Positives:The setting is beautiful, especially the entrance over the bridge, and the common areas are nice as well. We were upgraded to a villa because the manager of our 1st hotel called ahead (he had worked there as a manager). The food was excellent and it is a luxury to have breakfast in your viila . The service in both restaurants was prompt and pleasant however, many children. THe hotel is really to far away to pop out to a local restaurant without paying for a taxi.Negatives: I was disappointed at the value given the price of our room. The furnishings needed some upgrading, there were frequent interruptions by staff and this was our 2nd honeymoon. Requests for an extra mosquito burner and blanket were met with: You already have one, not at all what I expected from a hotel of this caliber. Sometimes waiting a long time for a buggy to be tranported throughout the hotel grounds. Overall staff were nice but not at all what I've grown used to traveling all over the world. I think my biggest disappointment was that I had specifically asked for a private room, being on our 2nd honeymoon, however, we were in villa 2, the second villla from the lobby. The road ran along the side and behind our villa, giving anyone access to see into our outdoor shower, We also had no privacy in our plunge pool, sunbathing or being outside on the patio. I felt like we really wasted our money!! I was very disappointed in this hotel and would not recommend it When we come back to Bali, we will stay at Kayumanis instead, read my review on Kayumanis for further info. ","annotations":[]}
