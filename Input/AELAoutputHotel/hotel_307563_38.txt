{"text":"Great small family hotel Small, neat hotel. We spent two weeks with our two young children (aged 3 and 7) on an all-inclusive deal. Because it's a small hotel you get to know the staff well all of whom were polite, friendly and always willing to help. The children spent virtually all day either by or in the pool. Great mix of guests ranging from european (Brits, French, Germans, Russians) to asian (Japanese, HK Chinese, Koreans) meant that there was always a varied choice on the menu along with good local food. I have to agree with the other review on here that said that if your children don't like what's on the menu there's always the snack menu with burgers and fries etc. The beach is clean and the hawkers are no problem. The 'sea' in front of the hotel is in fact a small tidal lagoon, with a reef about 1\/2 a mile out. When the tide is in there are all sorts of watersports on offer (available from Grand Mirage) and when the tide is out it's sand flats with wading birds on.There are plenty of shops and restaurants on the road behind the hotel for when you get bored, including a 24hr shop directly opposite for life's little luxuries (namely, chocolate!).Taxis are very cheap - about √ä√£¬¢12 to Kuta (the main tourist\/shopping area) - the driver will drop you off and then wait for you until you have finished. Drivers and guides can also be booked for sightseeing - don't even think about hiring a car, I'm sure there are rules to Balinese driving but I'm damned if I could work them out.Hotel positives: Small but uncrowded hotel with fantastic staff. Reasonable all-inclusive menus. Great pool.Hotel Negatives: Unusually for me - nothing.Best experience of the holiday: Riding an elephant at the Bakas elephant park.
