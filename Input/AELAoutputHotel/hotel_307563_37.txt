{"text":"The second visit. After we stayed at the hotel in Aug -Sept last year, we returned to meet with friends from the UK. The booking was handled by a very competent travel agent in Australia who informed us that the hotel had emailed her company assuring us of many refurbishments in the hotel. Quite frankly, I can't see how they can class a new shower curtain, kettle and telephone as refurbishments when the cupboard doors won't open and the plumbing is defective. The prices they have begun charging at the bar have risen dramatically, on my rough calculations it is 110% increase on last years prices but the prices outside of the hotel have risen only slightly.The accounting section of the hotel administration must have had a bad week while we were there, that is the only explanation I can find to their rude treatment of our friends insisting that they take back American Express travellers cheques that they had presented to the hotel for cashing and had been accepted one day only to be told the next that they were invalid due to the fact that they had a bank name on the cheques . Along with the travellers cheque debacle, the hotel then presented us with a check out account bearing another rooms credit card transactions and totalling several million rupiah.To anyone thinking about the Club Bali Mirage, think again and check all possible venues before booking there. I cannot recommend it as any value at all after past experiences in Bali.If you do go there and have problems, it appears to be of no use asking to see the manager, he appears to be permanently on days off , although he is seen regularly in the hotel.
