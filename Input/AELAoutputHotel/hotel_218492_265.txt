{"text":"Wonderful week at Grand Oasis We had a very enjoyable week at the Grand Oasis from Oct 6-13. We flew with Sunwing and both flights were smooth and on time.The resort is very easy to get around and the grounds were beautiful and well maintained.Our room was in building 7,third floor above the lazy river with ocean view. The room was beautiful with king bed, jacuzzi, fridge,clock radio, coffee maker,ceiling fan,iron,ironing board and a safe that was included at no additional charge. It had the most closet and cupboard space I have ever seen in a hotel room. The fridge was stocked daily with water,beer and soft drinks.The beach at G.O. was nice. Not the nicest I have seen but he ocean water was very calm and warm. The beach activities included volleyball,soccer, basketball, ping pong, darts shuffleboard, badminton, trampoline and kids club. They also had organized beach games and tournaments. The pool area had scheduled dance lessons and acqagym. They also have a daily agenda posted there of the daily events.There are three a-la-carts.The American Grill which is tex-mex, Dimario's\/Italian, and the beach garden restaurant which changes to a-la-cart for the evening -Marinaro's\/seafood. The only one we tried was the American Grill which we very much enjoyed and Jean our waiter provided excellent service.Windows buffet was quite large and air conditioned. It was split up into a smoking and non-smoking section. We thought the food presentation and quality was very good and perhaps the best we have encountered to date with this being our 4th four star all-inclusive. And for us ketchup lovers, they did have packets of HEINZ ketchup.For those wanting a general idea of the layout, building 2 and 7 run along the lazy river which was a very nice and quite area for relaxing. Building 3 is closest to the pool area which can be quite loud at times. Buildings 4,5,and 6 are closer to the beach.The animation team was very visable throughout the day and did a good job keeping people entertained with beach games and vollyball tournaments. The evening entertainment started at 9:30 pm and was held in a covered theatre. The best shows being on Friday\/majic show and Saturday\/Michael Jackson show.The only negatives I have at this resort is that the beach vendors can get quite annoying by weeks end. I would also recommend to bring your own pillow because I found theirs smelled sour due to the humidity. I also found the fridge did not keep your drinks near cold enough.On a positve note I'm a picky eater and I always found something good to eat. I'm a light sleeper and I was never disturbed by any noise at night. So thanks to Grand Oasis for making our vacation a very enjoyable experience. Also, hello to Roger and Brenda the only english speaking couple we met while there. We enjoyed your company the last couple of days. I would not hesitate to recommend the Grand Oasis.
