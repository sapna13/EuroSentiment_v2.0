{"text":"Great Hotel for location and food, but lacking in room quality and decor We just returned from a nine day stay at the Waikiki Beach Marriott Hotel. I give a tip of the hat to the front desk clerks and the housekeeping staff ..... they were really good. The open air theme of the hotel lobby floor was a truly refreshing reminder that we were in Hawaii.The food in the Kuhio Grill was superb .... we had 9 breakfasts there and 3 buffet dinners, and the food and the service was superb. You were never rushed and there never seemed to be line-ups.Elevators worked terrific, no problems there.Being right across the road from the beach was really delightful and all the shops were so close by.Now, for the down side. We stayed in a Deluxe Oceanfront room which was really great. just that we expected more quality from a Marriott Hotel. The room was quite sparesely furnished, with a small clothes cupboard with ancient louvered doors and 6 coat hangers. There were 2 small drawers in the TV cupboard to store all the rest of our belongings. Luggage was barely able to be stored in the closet. We had 2 chairs, and a writing desk and a small round table. The bathroom left a lot to be desired. They have replaced the taps and faucets ........ but the bathtub has been cleaned so much that it is down below the enamel and it did not drain so you were standing in 3 inches of water while showering. I hated even standing in it to shower. The tub and toilet are in a small cramped room with a door and the basin and mirror are located just outside. Again, an old sink that should have been replaced years ago.Other that that our stay in Hawaii was really great. Next time we come we are planning on checking out a Condo, as you really do not spend that much time in the Hotel, but when you do you want the quality you paid for in the surroundings.
