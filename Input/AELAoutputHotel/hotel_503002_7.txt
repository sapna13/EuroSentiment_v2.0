{"text":"Comfortable hotel, great location in Tokyo I enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The hotel is well located and has the added convenience of a subway entrance in the basement of the hotel. The station is the Ginza Ichome station on the Yurakucho line. Getting to the actual subway still requires a few minutes of walking underground, however. The hotel is located near restaurants and shops and there is a convenience store right outside.I had a room with a double bed and it was comfortable and much larger than I expected. The room had a safe and the bathroom was immaculate. The staff spoke fluent English and were very courteous. The breakfast at the restaurant is good, but pricey. The only disappointment was having to pay for wired internet. I walked to the hotel after arriving at Tokyo Station. The walk took about 15-20 minutes with my bags. Exit the station on Sotobori-Dori and walk south until you see a Wendy√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ on your left. Take a left at the Wendys and walk past the Ginza Itchome subway station. You will find the hotel on your right. The hotel is located near the Tokyo Station, but you have to change trains to get between them. Take one of the trains (not the subway) to Yurakucho Station and then change to the Yurakucho line subway for one stop Ginza Itchome. By the time you make the changes, you aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ saving much walking, however.In summary, a comfortable well located hotel with convenient access to the subway. I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hesitate to stay in this hotel again. ","annotations":[]}
