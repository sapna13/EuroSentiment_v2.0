{"text":"Great Hotel within walking distance to Kuta's night life My husband and I stayed at the Kartika Plaza for 11 nights after moving from the Hard Rock Hotel (which was pretty terrible).We found the overall ambience and experience a pleasant one, very suited to a relaxing holiday whilst still being able to walk into Kuta for shopping and nightlife.Good Points:1. Beachfront Location - so has nice breeze.2. Lovely pool and grounds that were maintained very well.3. Beautiful lobby that has been designed to make the most of the sea breeze.4. Great Breakfast - especially for a buffet. The odd thing was cold, but a very good quality of food.5. Great massages.6. Next door to Kartika Shopping Plaza - definately a plus point for shopoholics.7. Nice pool, never to crowded.Not so Good Points.1. Building work was being done along the seafront whilst we where there.....so a little noisy at times.2. They where renovating some rooms, which again was a little noisy but kept to a minimum. The rooms were OK, I think ours had been repainted, however some of the furniture was looking a bit dated. The bathrooms were the most disappointing, looking quite dated indeed. Cleanliness could also have been improved in bathrooms with a bottle of bleach and some elbow grease.Overall a great stay - much better than the Hard Rock Hotel. The best thing was that it felt like a hotel away from all the hustle and bustle, but a 10min walk and you could be back in the centre of things again. One really nice surprise was that we celebrated my husbands birthday in the Hotel. The maid obviously noticed birthday cards and a birthday cake appeared in our room which was a really thoughtful surprise.
