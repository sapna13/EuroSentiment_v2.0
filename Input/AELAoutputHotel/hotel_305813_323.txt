{"text":"My detailed review of this fine hotel I stayed here for 6 nights and was impressed. As our airport limo wasnearing the hotel at night, we were a little worried at how the Mong Kok area looked and wondered if we made a mistake, but the next day we explored and felt totally safe. Just keep away from the west side of hotel (Reclaimation St and over). Some say the hotel is out of theway, but it makes up for it with the Langham Place mall attached and also a MTR station downstairs which has you minutes away from Tsim Sha Tsui, HK island etc. Subways are spotless and I know the routes rather well by now. The Ladies Market is kinda trashy, low class vendors bracing for bargaining. As I walked past several stalls I canhear the vendors actually yelling at the tourists if they couldnt close the deal. I bought a Swiss watch, which worked for a day, when the maid empties the trash can, I hope she doesnt think it works. Save your shopping for Nathan rd. The Bird Market, hmmm stay away..when we were in hotel we heard on news they shut it down because a bird was infected with bird flu, this was June 16th. They showed the health people spraying the area and the shop owners were livid, screaming about the closings. Dont chance it. All other surrounding streets spark the senses, interesting to see one of the most crowded areas in the world pulsate. We wanted to see a HK horserace so we took the KCR rail to Sha Tin Racecourse. It was an awesome experience, not like the USA tracks. There wasnt cursing, spitting, throwing programs or yelling. It was orderly and really a pretty track. From Langham take the Mong Kok KCR to dedicated Racecourse stop..which was about 14 minutes away. Bring your passport for free admission, we sprung for the Members Club which was air conditioned, well worth it. If you like Malls, Times Square is the best, take MTR to causeway bay and exit at Times square ramp. The pavilion is picture perfect. You must do the Peak, and eat at The Lookout, reserve for a table looking over the city. We went forbreakfast and it was almost empty. We did the HK sponsered Tai Chi classes offered at the Museum of Art near the Star ferry in Tsim Sha Tsui. The instructor was fantastic, really into his Tai Chi, many locals were there as volunteers. The Canton Rd mall and shops were kinda pricy and dont have that HK feel. Also visit the Temple on Nathan Rd about 5 minute walk north of Police Station. Dont choke on the incense smoke, it is overbearing but its an experience watching the locals give their offerings. Respect their privacy, no photos, however they allowed us to take pics if people werent in pic. I can go on forever, I love Hong Kong. My only donts are the Ladies Market and Bird Market. The Langham Mall has great food choices on 4th floor, actually quite cheap for good food. Oh another 'dont'...I wouldnt eat from those vendors with the meat and squid out in open, I saw several instances where they handled the food and touched theirfaces, dirty water etc. Well, I got off track, this was supposed to be a hotel review, its great, the 5th floor work\/play area..free internet and a bar with superb eats, kinda pricy. The pool is sweet and the treadmills make you feel like youre walking over the city. The breakfast was excellent, Im a Dim Sum and sushi addict and they had both. Rooms are small but we basically slept there only, so no big deal.
