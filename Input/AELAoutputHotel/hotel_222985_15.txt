{"text":"Great Stay I was a little worried after reading some reviews about this property but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised. The front desk staff was not very friendly at first but my hubby made them smile by the time we were checked in. We took the Go Shuttle to this hotel, so we didn't have to worry about a car, which was probably a good thing. There wasn't any rooms ready yet, as we were really early but they locked up our luggage and pointed us in the direction of Biscayne Bay (spelling?) and we were off. We were going to take the free people mover but we decided to walk a bit. It only took us about 10 minutes to walk there using the map the front desk gave us. Very easy. After a couple of hours at the Bay we came back to the front desk, got our luggage and they told us where our room was. A smile must go a long way ( we always say that) because they put us in a suite and it was massive and clean. I'm sure it could have used a little bit of TLC but it was nice just the same. Our window did face the street and it could get noisy but it didn't bother our sleep at all. We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant and it was awesome and so was the service. Since we had such great service at dinner we decided to head there for breakfast and we were greeted with the total opposite service. Oh well, what can you do! ","annotations":[]}
