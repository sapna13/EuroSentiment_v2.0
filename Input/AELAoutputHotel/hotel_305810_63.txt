{"text":"Nice but it looked a bit tired... We booked a 5D4N stay with the hotel. This would be my 2nd visit to Hong Kong in 4 months' time. I booked this hotel for myself  my family after reading the fave reviews about this hotel. The look of the hotel  lobby was nice. Check in service was fast. Though I have requested my two rooms to be adjoining but it wasnt ready upon my check in. But it was quickly solved by the reception who subsequently offer another room  I was too tired to hang around for another room.We didnt have nice views from our rooms - our rooms were facing the back of a building - but it was okay cos we werent staying in the room the whole day. I totally agreed with other reviewers that a harbour view room would be much better but it was okay with us. The decor of the room was okay - i feel slightly above average than other HK hotels. Just that I felt the bathroom looked tired. No stand-in shower was available - still gotta stand in a bathtub. The tolietries were great but i felt that the hotel wasnt too generous on that. No comb, no vanity set no extras shower gel, shampoo were available - only 1 set was available for a couple. I had to call the Instant Services a couple of times to request for them. I like the location - nice  quiet, about 10 minutes walk from TST MTR, 5 minutes from TST East KCR. But it is opposite the victoria habour which is a nice walk after breakfast or dinner. The service was good too - reception staff could still remember my name 2 days after my check-in  I hardly appear around the hotel except in the morning  late at night after my shopping.Given another opportunity to re-visit (which i hope soon cos i like the shopping), I will still use this hotel but this time round, I will book the harbour view room.
