{"text":"Top notch service from everyone... I'll start my review by saying that I had some mixed feelings toward the Ritz here in San Juan. Most came only from reading previous reviews here on Trip Advisor. I have stayed at several other Ritz Carlton's before, all with great experiences but I did notice some reviews here have not. As you'll read, our stay was fabulous and I do highly recommend the Ritz here in San Juan.So this doesn't become an advertisement for the Ritz, I'll start with the few negatives we had on our stay here. We stayed here from the last week of October into the beginning of November and came in at the tail end of the tropical storm they were having, so the weather was not great for the first day but it cleared up perfectly and of course that had nothing to do with the Ritz. As I read the previous review, I couldn't help but question what dirty cups were they talking about that were floating all around It looked like from the dates that we were there the same time and did not notice any of this. The mini bar checker person did come in on our last day when we still in the room. She did not offer to come back and we did let her in, however I would advise that they should be instructed to come back later if guests are in the room still. We could have asked her to come back later, so it really wasn't a big deal for us but I could see how it would bother some.While at the pool, there were several workers planting and keeping the grounds landscaped. The noise was a nuisance for a bit, but this is how they keep the place looking so great. For those who haven't read, the airport is close by so you do hear planes taking off. This wasn't a surprise and any of the other hotels near by would have the same problem. We never heard anything whil in our room or the hotel. Not a big issue at all.With these few minor issues, the overall stay was amazing. From check-in to check out. We could not have been happier with our stay. The front desk was very helpful, from a glass of champagne and cool towels to the bellman who was waiting to escort us to our room. The room was clean, neat and always serviced each day. No issues at all. We had the pleasure to stay on the Club level, which allowed us to access the lounge and services they provided. Everyone was extremely helpful and overly accommodating. All the employees would address with 'yes sir, yes ma'am, right this way sir, have a nice day....these are the little things you will not always get at other hotels. The hotel itself, was very clean and fresh flowers were everywhere. Every evening they would have a rum tasting in the lobby bar which would draw guests.We had the great pleasure to work with Mr. Ramon Venutra at the hotel. I saw his name on one of the previous reviews and appreciated his response to some of the issues other guests may have had. I found this to be extremely professional and made me believe even more in the Ritz. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Ritz! The service was excellent, the staff was always friendly and pleasant. The concierge service gave us directions and answered whatever questions we had. We rented a car for the week from the Enterprise located within the Ritz. This to, worked out well. Mr. Ventura was extremely helpful with our stay and I would expect others to have the same type of stay that we did. For some, I notice complaining about the price of the stay or the final bills on checkout. Our bill was correct and we knew what to expect when we booked the stay, so there was no surprise there. I highly recommend the Ritz in San Juan and look forward to visiting again. The Ritz was worth the price and the service and overall resort was wonderful!
