{"text":"Its not hard to see why its won so many awards Having reviewed many of the top resorts in Bali for Yahoo!7 there is one outstanding resort which sets the standards for others to follow. The Maya Ubud is unique in so many ways it's not hard to see why its won almost every award in its category from Spa of the year award to the Trip Advisors Travellers Choice. Sometimes there is a gap between an award and the experience of staying there which is why i stayed a few days and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ just 'drop in'. I have to say that the Maya is in a class of its own. Located just a few minutes outside of Ubud, the long driveway takes you into another world...as you step across the candlelit water entrance and ascend onto a beautiful pavilion you know that this is no ordinary resort. The stress literally melts away as the beautifully dressed Balinese staff wrap you up in their warm hospitality and for the duration of your stay. The Maya blends contemporary design, tradition and luxury into an experience. If its a romantic getaway or honeymoon indulge yourself with a spa or garden villa with its Balinese grass roof, with plunge pools, day beds, DVD player and huge bathrooms. Waking up to the morning mist over the river valley and the smell of the forest is as unforgettable. If you prefer more formality the rooms in the hotel offer value for money but you would miss the best the Maya has to offer. I love the way the Maya embraces its majestic juxtaposition with nature. Every care has been taken to include the visitor to engage with the environment. A team of 35 gardeners attend to 10 hectares with knowledge and care. A 3:1 staff to guest ratio shows the attention to service. The botanic gardens are breathtaking. Just one of the free daily activities is a guided nature tour which takes you through a journey which descends many levels to river bed displaying the diversity of the environment. At secluded spots pavilions have been erected for yoga and meditation. Other daily complimentary activities include yoga to help kick start your 'new me' campaign. There are a number of restaurants to choose from and the cuisine is outstanding. The main restaurant is listed as one of the top 10 fine dining choices in Bali. Sourcing it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ ingredients from all over the world, including meat from Australia and fish from Tasmania. It even cures its salmon in-house. Many top resorts offer 'afternoon tea' as an attraction. But in essence its one cup of tea\/coffee and a sponge cake if you are lucky. Not so the Maya. Afternoon tea is an event you manage your day around. A huge range of different teas, coffees and fruit juices are self service,. The buffet of finger sandwiches, cakes and savoury items is extensive and changed daily. Its a wonderful colonial tradition so often poorly provided by other resorts but the Maya does it in style.The spa is without doubt one of the best in the world. Its hard to lead in this category but the Maya has the magical combination which many lack...its environment. As you descend in an elevator through to just above the forest floor you step into another world. The spa is set atop the river bed. A private consultation leads you through a path to a wooden bridge over a black stone water pond to be greeted by a private spa pavilion. The doors open onto paradise with views on to the forest as swallows swoop and dive over the constant hum of the river below. The treatment is dreamlike. Soft music simply a backdrop to nature. Even the shower is run in advance not to interrupt any slumber like trance as the pewter bath is filled with frangipani flowers and a fruit plate is placed to compliment the senses. The Maya is an award winner in more ways than one.
