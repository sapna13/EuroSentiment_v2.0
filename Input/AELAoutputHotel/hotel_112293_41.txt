{"text":"Ah the Suite life With an excellent location right on busy Lombard Street in the heart of the Marina District, Cow Hollow has a mix of regular hotel rooms and suites. We stayed in the 2BR 2B suites in the back, with its own underground parking, entrance and exit onto a quiet back street and literally 5 steps away from Noah's Coffee that supplied us with caffeine and breakfast on a couple of cold San Francisco mornings. The suite was more like a fully furnished apartment, full kitchen, fireplace, a 4 poster bed in one bedroom and ridiculously soft down comforters in both, a walk-in closet and another pullout in the living area. Restaurants and watering holes ring the motel, I counted 10 within one block of the front door. Everything from pizza to Korean food. Convenient laundry room right across the hall, with free soap. **Now the minuses. Old tube tv (with broken knobs  buttons)in the bedroomthat could only manage a greenish tinged picture. That was overcome by the nice flatscreen in the living area complete with DVD player. But I like to watch Leno before I sleep! Rooms are kept spotless by staff, but trash under the sink when we checked in and one day, no one made up the room! Lots of towels, so no big deal. The guy who came up to empty the trash acted as though he was doing us a favor. No tip for you buddy! And of course, the requisite kids upstairs jumping off the bed or walls. We chalked it up to youthful exuberance, until it went on for an hour, then we called the desk. Problem solved. Finally, when I called to make my reservation I was told that an AARP discount of 10% would be applied. Of course, I never took a name, but upon checking in a matronly lady said quite curtly only AAA but that doesn't apply to the suites. Thank you very much. Again, no biggy, but every little aggravation seems to be amplified when you have certain expectations. Know what I mean?The suite should not be confused with a five star hotel, with turn-down service and chocolates on the pillows, but should be appreciatedfor what it is, a comfortable, family oriented, base of operations for exploring SF and all it has to offer. Overall I'd go back.
