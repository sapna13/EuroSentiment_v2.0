{"text":"Fine Stay I chose the Intercontinental for a last-minute 2-day trip to Singapore in early November, and I'm very glad I did. I've stayed in some of Singapore's top hotels, including Raffles, Ritz-Carlton, and Mandarin Oriental; and I was a bit concerned that the Intercon would suffer in comparison. Happily, it did not.The only minor sour note occured when I was checking in and I asked the clerk about the 4 p.m. late checkout (subject to availability) mentioned as part of the weekend rate I'd booked. The clerk said there was nothing in the system about this, and a second staffer, who'd come to take me up to my room, reiterated the availability line (of which I was already aware) and said she'd let me know later. I politely but firmly asked her to check and let me know before heading up to my room, as my return flight was not until after midnight on my checkout day. She quickly confirmed the late checkout availability, and all went very well from that point on.Hotel: The Intercon is a 13-year-old midrise located in Bugis very near Raffles and a short walk or taxi ride to most of the city's attractions and interesting neighborhoods. All the public areas are attractive and spotless, and the hotel's decor is very smart if rather generic. The Intercon eschews the grandeur of the Ritz-Carlton and Oriental and is more reminiscent of the simple luxury of the Four Seasons.Room: I had a standard (Deluxe) room on the 6th floor, and while I thought that that might be a bit lacking, I was again pleasantly surprised. While not huge, at about 35 sq. meters, my room was just right: very comfortable, spotless, and more understated luxury -- in short, the Intercontinental mien at its best. The large bathroom was done in marble, with a big, separate tub and walk-in shower. The room had a large, triple bay window; and the view of the surrouding buildings in Bugis was quite nice. The bed was very comfortable, as one expects in Intercons. The hotel had even provided a small bowl of complimentary fruit and a bottle of Evian. The only drawback to the room was the internet service: wired (no wifi, at least from the hotel) broadband with adequate speed but an annoying feature: having to reopen the startup pay-as-you-go page with each new session, even after paying for a 24-hour block of time. Nor was this cheap: SGD 30 (about US$ 21) for the 24 hours. But the Intercon's not alone in charging high ratees for internet access. I'm hopeful that five-star chains will follow the Peninsula's lead in providing complimentary internet service in all rooms. But this was a minor quibble, and overall, I was very satisfied with my basic Intercon room. My rate of SGD 220 included breakfast and the aforementioned late checkout, and it was actually cheaper than the cheapest room-only rate at the time I booked.Staff and service: With the small exception of my initial checkin query, all of the Intercon's staff were very pleasant, friendly, and helpful. The concierge recommended an excellent seafood-speciality Chinese restaurant (Jumbo) on the waterfront for chili crab; out of this world, and I highly recommend it. The staff at Olive Tree, where I took breakfast, were equally helpful; and the food there was excellent, with a wide choice of fresh western and Asian dishes.Bottom line: I'd recommend the Intercon to anyone visiting Singapore. It's a true five-star (maybe even plus) hotel that, at least at promotional or weekend rates, is a real value compared to more famous Singapore properties that may or may not warrant their higher prices. The Intercon feels smaller than it is (I think it has close to 500 rooms), and the staff make guests feel welcome and special. Well done, Intercontinental Singapore.
