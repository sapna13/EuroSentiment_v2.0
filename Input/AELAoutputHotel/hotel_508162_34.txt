{"text":"In LOVE with the Dreams! Mu husband and I were at the Dreams Punta Cana the week of 11\/10\/08 and CANNOT praise the hotel and its staff enough! We had an awesome time. I read some reviews before we went and the 2 common complaints I saw were: bad road from Airport to hotel, and something wrong\/unclean with the rooms. To both I have to say not true at all (for our visit at least). The ride from the airport is about an hour, and there is a part of the road that is bad, but what do you expect?! The highlights of the stay:Greeted with champagne immediately at check-inDidn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to worry about our luggage when checking in or out as it is tagged with a number ad taken to the room or lobby. The staff is on that! The honeymoon\/junior suite was very roomy. I would estimate about 600 sq ft. We had a hot tub in our balcony!!! We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have an ocean view room, but the room was absolutely beautiful!!!The food at all the restaurants is great. However, best one was Bordeaux, and least favorite, The Seaside Grill. No reservations are needed for the restaurants which is nice. Room services is available 24 hrs and is part of the all inclusive! So are the beverages in the mini-bar which included sodas, bottled water and beer, AND are re-filled as you use themBars √à√\u2020\u2022?there is plenty of them and ALL the bartenders are awesome. Especially all the bartenders at the Oceana bar. They were absolutely THE BESTEntertainment √à√\u2020\u2022?the nightly shows were really entertaining. The one we liked the least was the Karaoke night. It got a little dull when guests got to serious about it√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>The club\/disco plays great music, and the entertainment team is usually in there keeping things going, encouraging guests to have fun and danceTwice a week they have couples night at the beach which includes a bong-fire, champagne, and romantic tunesActivities √à√\u2020\u2022?the entertainment team is serious about keeping guests busy throughout the day, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ nice that they are not pushy about itSpa √à√\u2020\u2022?we got 1hr massages and they were great. Very professional and thorough. You are allowed to use the spa facilities 1 hr prior to your massage. So we definitely took advantage of itBeach √à√\u2020\u2022?plenty of lounge chairs available. The water is nice, but it is on the Atlantic side, which not as pretty as the Caribbean side. There are also a lot of rocks, so bring water shows if you can. That is one of the few things we wished we could change; again, the Caribbean side is so much prettier. But, got to enjoy it (Caribbean) during the excursions we booked through Hotelbeds at the hotel. The Saona and Altos de Chav√ã¬\u2022?n tour is a must. So is the Sunset Tour.Local shopping- there is a small market that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only a 10-minute walk away (the walk is safe). The prices there are better than the ones at the hotel shop. However, beware of the vendors as they are extremely pushy and get extremely disappointed when told you will be back later or you will think about it. Regardless, make sure to bargain with themThe d√ã√\u2022√ñcor, atmosphere, beach, and specially the staff are what make this hotel a DEFINITE come back for us!!!! Even though we have no other hotel to compare it with, we would strongly recommend the Dreams!!!
