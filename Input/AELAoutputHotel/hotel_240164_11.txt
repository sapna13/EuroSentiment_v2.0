{"text":"All bad!!! Horrible customer service, smelly, loud, etc. etc. We booked our stay a few months prior to the actual date of stay via telephone for a portion of our honeymoon, while returning from a cruise. We called and confirmed our 2 night stay one week prior to. They advised they had already pre-assigned our hotel room to us. It didn't matter,read on........ After our first night's stay, which was horrible. We didn't feel too safe staying there, as they have security that pace the floors throughout the evening and day for safety. The bathroom had mildew and mold growing in the tub and walls. There was paint chipping away in the hotel room and the hallways thoughout the hotel. It was very smelly there. Then to top it off after our first evening there,( at approximately 11:30am) the front desk personnel called our room and advised we needed to check out and when were we planning to, since check out time was 11:00? We advised we had reserved the room for another night, months prior to. The front desk person insisted that we were not reserved for one more evening and consulted with the manager. (even though we had confirmed for 2 nights stay)The manager then contacted us and advised we needed to pack up and leave. We advised we had no where to stay and could they provide some type of comp or sister hotel for us. (all of the hotels in Miami were booked, we had already called, believe me)The manager advised it didn't matter, we needed to leave and we would be put out on the street by security or they would call the police. We left on our will, gladly. Whatever you do, do not stay at this hotel!!!!!! It needs to be bulldozed. It was a bad ending to our wonderful honeymoon!!!!!!! Thanks a lot Casablanca and to the horrible staff there!!!!!!!!! ","annotations":[]}
