{"text":"disappointed stay I have chosen this hotel based on some of the reviews from this web and one of my colleague said that this hotel was 'quite good' especially the location. I would say the location is good however me and my friend were disgusted by the staff. We are Chinese and I do speak and understand Cantonese but I chose to speak in English when making conversation with the staff. We book a room on club level. On the day we checked-in, I didn't know that we are so privileged that we can check in on the club level which is on the 17th floor. I passed the voucher to the counter staff and she spoke in cantonese to herself that 'what is this nonsense' and gave us an impatient look. After she found out that we should be checking in at the Club level, she called the club level that telling them that 'someone coming', of course, in cantonese. She changed her tone and smile at us and show us to the lobby. By that time we were quite surprise the kind of service this hotel staff provide.However, the most upset moment was when we have our tea time at the cafe. We were entitled to afternoon tea and evening cocktail at the 2nd floor lounge. After a tiring day, we went to have our afternoon tea on the first day and told the manager who show us to the table our room number. It took them 5 mins to notice the 2 of us (there were less than 10 customer at that time) to take our order and took another 5 mins to serve us our coffee. There wasn't any food left (they indicated - afternoon tea with snacks) except a few slices of bread. My friend went ahead to get the bread and was shouted by a waiter - 'Excuse me, what is your room number'. We were so embrassed as others were looking at us. We told him our room number and he pretend to take down the number and walk away.Next is the fruits in the room, we did not finish the fruit and it was left rotten for days. Shouldn't fresh fruit to be served to the customer?If I were to know this is the kind of service we get, we wouldn't spend so much to stay in a tiny room.
