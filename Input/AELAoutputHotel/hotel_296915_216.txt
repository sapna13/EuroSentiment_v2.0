{"text":"Fabulous Hotel! I stayed at the Pulitzer Hotel for around a week at the end of August 06. I am from the US and in my mid 20s. The hotel was in a great location, just steps from the Placa Catalyuna and Las Ramblas and right near the metro stop. Since it is on a side street, the hotel was quiet. It is a perfect spot if you want to be right near the action, but not in the middle of it. It is walking distance from shopping in the Barrio Gotico and restaurants on the Paseig de Gracia. The hotel staff was very friendly, helpful, and spoke English. They even helped us map out a road trip. The room was a good size, the bed was a comfortable queen (which is hard to find), and the bathroom was modern and a good size. The hotel itself is modern, and has the feel of a luxury hotel with the personality and service of a small hotel. I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to Barcelona. I reserved the room through Clarion's website, and got a good rate. My only complaint about Clarion is if you book early and then need to cancel a day at the start of your trip, they will reprice your entire reservation. So if you book early, but may need to cancel a day, book two reservations on their website. We stayed at another hotel during our two week stay because the hotel was booked a few days, and all and all this was our favorite. The only thing missing was a business center with internet. However, I believe they have wireless if you bring your laptop. Barcelona is a great city, and the Pulitzer was top notch! I would like to go back. ","annotations":[]}
