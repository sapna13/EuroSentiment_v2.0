{"text":"beware this hotel watch what you are booking when booking this hotel,there are two parts to it one of them is on the beach side looks good but the other one is appox 1mile from beach transport available,it wasnt until the last week we found out the differences between the two resorts, this was an all inclusive package,so you expect everything in the price, you have to pay 20 dollars per week for a safe in the room thats if it works, mini fridge you get 4 drinks and a big bottle of water in the package,but also in the fridge is pringles,small bottled water choc bars beer but these are not free you will get billed for these, but if you stayed at the other hotel all of this was free so why the difference? service in the restaurants was very disorganised ,having to wait 20 minutes for a cup of coffee or even for a cup,or a glass of water with your evening meal,food was undercooked . Their was approx 5 british couples at this hotel and not one of them had a good word for it,even the rooms were different ,i spoke to a very nice couple who paid more than we did and we had various things in the room which they didnt ,have, even after returning to the room after days out the room hadnt been cleaned or their had been no clean towels put in the room the thomas cook rep was only seen once at this hotel the first day,one of the couples wrote a two page complaint about what was going on at the hotel, we found out the resort we stayed at ,was a timeshare apartments for the the french last year some of the apartments had been renovated,ie fresh lick of paint , i wouldnt recommend this hotel to anybody this part of the hotel is known as the GRAND PARADISE CLUB run by a company known as AM , when the rep was approached about the service we recieved she replied their was another agent working for thomas cook ,who checked the hotels out god only knows what he was looking at ,i would rate this hotel not above 2 star ","annotations":[{"endOffset":566,"mention":"choc","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":562},{"endOffset":807,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":807,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":807,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":1671,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1667},{"endOffset":1671,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1667}]}
