{"text":"Great location for the Tourist We spent three nites at Hotel Jazz after disembarking from a cruise. When we arrived, our room was not ready yet, but the staff directed us to the Catalyuna Square and locked up our luggage as we set off off on an advernture - our first time in Spain. We were so pleased to realize how close our hotel was to the action. We were a couple blocks from Ramblas and basically across the street from the stop that allowed us to get on the tourist on\/off bus - 2 day pass was 25 euros per person. There is a cute, small restaurant on the corner called Rainbow - good food reasonably priced. Good place to start the day with breakfast.We asked for a room with a view and were upgraded to a junior suite. It was huge. The decor is very contemporary, emaculate, wonderful water pressure and 3 doors that open to the street to take in the view or shut out the street noise. The bed was very confortable and the linens were plush - thicker towels than I expected. Our bath had a toilet and bidet - extra - a towel warmer plus a separate tub and shower.. Black tile in the bath with white fixtures and chrome faucets. We had a sofa, desk, and slim TV mounted on the wall. The room also had a mini fridge, but we discovered a small grocery store on Ramblas where snacks and pop were very reasonably priced. Our room also had a safe that operated by your password .There did not appear to be any brochures in the lobby, but upon inquiring for tourist information, the staff opened the doors on the wall behind the desk where everything is stored. One other surprise was that we had free use of two computers on the first floor where we could check on flights and e-mail, etc. No printer was available. The morning that we left, the staff secured a taxi for us. When we return to Barcelona, that is no doubt that we would stay at Hotel Jazz again. Why is it called Hotel Jazz? There is jazz music piped into our room thru speakers in the ceiling controlled by a switch right next to the bed.
