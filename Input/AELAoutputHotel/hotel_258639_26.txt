{"text":"Worst ... Hotel ... Ever My company booked a room for me here, so the hotel must've charged a corporate rate. What I found when I checked in was nothing short of disastrous.There was no TV in the room! I called the lobby and asked for a TV ... and they acted as if I had committed a sin. It took until the second day of my stay before I received a 13-inch TV, without a remote control, accompanied by an envelope requesting a tip.I don't know how their website claims free wireless internet. There was no wireless internet service at all, and when I asked for wired service, I was charged $10 a day.Breakfast is prepared by an overworked little old lady. Clearly not geared to people who have to work early in the morning. While I am used to having hotels serve breakfast around 6am, the signs posted at this place declared a 7:30am start. Not too bad, I thought ... but when I came down at 7:30am, the little old lady clearly had not readied everything. There was cereal - but no milk. Coffee was made, but no cups were available. I decided it was faster to go out for breakfast.I asked for a manager, and I was told there were no managers on staff. Is this possible?I've stayed in plenty of hotels, some not as good as others. But the level of service I received here was as close as one could get to crap. I later found out that for $20 more, I could've had a real hotel (just across the street).
