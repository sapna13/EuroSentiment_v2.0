{"text":"They must pay for their 4-5 star rating - This is NOT a high service hotel After reading the many reviews and being familiar with Westin properties we ventured to think for the price we were paying ($800\/night) we would be staying at a high quality hotel away from the hustle and bustle of San Juan. Boy were we wrong. Customer service is an area that requires much improvement. We booked our dinner reservations in advance and reconfirmed on the day of our arrival. We showed up at the Grill Room for dinner to be told we did not have a reservation and they could not help me. I requested they call the reservation system, which again confirmed I had a reservation. The snotty hostess still told me I dd not have a reservation even after their own folks confirmed it. This issue was not resolved until the manager stepped in. The management here must be very limited with towels, toilet paper and soap. We needed to call each evening for towels for the four of us in the room. As we had no plans to share the two towels provided amongest us. Toilet paper rolls with a few pices were left on the roll and not replaced. There was one day we needed to call to remind them to clean our room at 4:30pm!!!The crowning blow to this very poor customer service orientated hotel was on our return to the airport the driver never bothered to tell us we needed to clear US Agriculture scanning before waiting in the airline check in. This mistake added another half hour to our wait at the airport.Based on this experience I am very leary of any hotel ratings...I will rely more on the customer inputs like this because they live the nightmares and probably stay clear of Westins in the future.I ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1100,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":1096},{"endOffset":1100,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":1096},{"endOffset":1100,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":1096},{"endOffset":1100,"mention":"roll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread_roll"],"startOffset":1096}]}
