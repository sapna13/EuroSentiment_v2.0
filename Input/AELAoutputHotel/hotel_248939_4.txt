{"text":"A bit out of the way, but we loved it! This hotel is located on Via Orcagna, which is in a more residential section of Florence, about 10 minutes walking from Santa Croce. We arrived in Florence via train, and right across from the train station were buses, which made it easy to get to the hotel. (I can't remember which number, but it is orange!) The closest bus stop in both ways is right around the corner from the hotel.This is a family run hotel, and the staff is plenty nice. The lady at the front desk was very pleasant and after check-in, quickly oriented us on the Florence map. No elevator, but we were given a huge triple room on the second floor for the two of us. Room was clean. The bathroom was small and it was just the tub, showerhead and a flimsy curtain, but got the job done. Breakfast was good, with very nice espresso and milk, warm croissants, yogurt, cereals, and juices. We were actually encouraged to take a bit extra for the road! In terms of eating options, there are lots of places within a few blocks. One we enjoyed is a pizza place (Luna) that has excellent pizza, in addition to very good pasta and some sort of a lounge in the basement (we didn't check it out). There is a single free internet terminal that we used. This came in handy as we tried to contact Air France to try to change our plans during our trip (to stay longer in Florence)!If we were to go back to Florence, we'd try to stay somewhere closer to the train station, as we'll be planning more day trips out, but if this were the only hotel we available, we'd still be thrilled!
