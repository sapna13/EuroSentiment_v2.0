{"text":"Ottimo - Excellent To be honest, I'm astonished at some of the negative reviews about this hotel - our stay was fantastic. The hotel was once a palace and IS an old building. This means that it is full of character, charming, comfortable and has lovely touches like the huge, wood-pannelled ceilings. Medieval it is not. The reception is lovely and the location of the hotel couldn't really be much better, being just a short walk from the Duomo, Ponte Vecchio, Via Tornabuoni and also the station for trips.The bedroom was large and had a lovely wood tiled floor. The bed was really comfortable and the air conditioning meant that it wasn't stuffy. The bathroom was really nice and clean, and had nice toiletries. The room was generally quiet and there was no noise at all from outside. In fact, the only noise came from coach parties (from a certain part of the world), who seemed to forget that other people might be asleep at midnight and talked loudly and banged doors in the corridor. My particular favourite was the night I was awoken at 1am by the sound of Willie Nelson songs really loudly from the next room!! Scary.The restaurant was beautiful and had a stunning view over Florence. We ate out on the rooftop terrace one evening, which was lovely for a romantic meal. The food was top notch, both at dinner and breakfast, and there was a wide range of choices. The steaks at dinner were incredible. We found all of the staff to be really friendly, both on reception and in the restaurant. The concierge really went out of his way to help us out, booking tickets by phone for the Uffizi and Academia for us, and even phoning our resort rep to check something for us. As with many things, you get back what you put in. A little politeness never hurt, and I've always found that a smile and a 'please' and 'thank you' in Italian goes a long way. They really do appreciate it if you try a few words, and your efforts will be rewarded. Be rude or abrupt in Italy and you'll get it straight back , and quite rightly so.Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to go back. They made us feel really welcome and I couldn't find much at all to fault.
