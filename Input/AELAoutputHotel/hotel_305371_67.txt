{"text":"Awesome Hotel I traveled to Shanghai last May for a wedding and wanted to take advantage of being in China so I opted to travel solo to Hong Kong for a few days. Since I would be celebrating my birthday I wanted to pick the best place possible. I was also traveling solo and wanted to feel safe in a place where I knew no one and could not speak the language. I arrived in Hong Kong and it took me about and hour to get up my nerve to figure out how I was going to get to the hotel. I opted for the train and the free transfer to the Hotel which was a great and inexpensive ride. It was right before a Holiday when I checked in late on a Tuesday afternoon. The weather was overcast and the hotel lobby seemed a bit muggy. The Bell Hop was very generous and held by bags while I traveled to the Executilve Level to check in. The host was nice and I explained it was my birthday and she was kind enough to book me in one of the renovated rooms away from the construction they were doing at the time. The Bell Hop brought my luggage and even connected my computer and arranged for someone to come and open my bedroom window so I could get some fresh Air. My room faced the Harbor and was beautiful. All the small touches like the flowers and rubber duck in the bathroom were nice.After being in Asia for over a week, I was excited to see a burger on the room service menu. I ordered it with fries and soup and it was delivered in good time. The burger was a bit soggy but I tried to eat it. During my stay I filled out a customer card and commented on the burger and the kitchen actually called and apologized. They were also kind enough to bring me some fruit and cookies and chocolates due to my experience.The Italian Restaurant was a bit pricy but I was able to get a late sitting at 10pm. I was dining solo and they arranged for me to have a table overlooking the city. The bar adjacent was nice as well. Again it was a Holiday in Hong Kong so not many folks were around.Hong Kong is real easy to get around and the next day I ventured out and took the Ferry. I was a bit nervous getting around on my own but I did just fine. I treated myself to a massage on my birthday at the spa. It was so heavenly I almost wished I had not made reservations for dinner because I was so relaxed all I wanted to do was sleep the night away.After I returned from dinner, I arrived at my room and the Hotel arranged a very nice birthday cake for me. It was a nice way to end my birthday.The Hotel staff was wonderful. My only wish was that the concierge could have given me a few more tips and ideas on what a single person could do as far as night life. Overall my stay was nice. This hotel is in the business district so you won't see as many folks walking around at night like you will on the other side of the harbor. And the Construction Teddy Bear was great.
