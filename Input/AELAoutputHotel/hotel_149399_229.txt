{"text":"Fun in the Sun Everybody...People....Open Bar, All Inclusive!!!! We stayed at the Melia from Feb. 1-8\/08 and had a great time. We were a little apprehensive about the Melia due to all the poor reviews around the holidays, but there is no need for concern. The check-in ran efficiently and a waitress served drinks to the people in line as we waited. We asked for a second floor room close to the pool\/beach. Our room was a 2 min., walk to the beach and a 5 min. walk to the lobby. We were on the Caribe side. This resort is big but it is almost like 2 resorts stuck together. We just used the Caribe side and found it very manageable. I don't know what people are talking about saying it is a 15 min. walk to get anywhere, maybe if you are walking in circles, it wouldn't even take you that long to get from one side to the other. The food was good, no complaints. We ate at the beach buffet restaurant every morning which was good. You have to be pretty picky to not be able to find anything to your liking. We ate at the a la cartes each night, Mexican, Thai Fusion, American and Japanese and really enjoyed them. We did not have a problem making reservations at all. We found that if you call right at 9am the line is busy so we waited until around 9:45-10:00ish and we were able to get into the restaurant our our choice, with a choice of reservation time each night.The drinks were good, we did not find the staff to be unfriendly, if you are friendly to them, they are friendly back. We did do a lot of tipping and I think they deserve it, they work long hours, almost every day and I am sure that they appreciate the tip. They were always grateful when a tip was recieved.We vacationed without our 3 little children and found it relaxing. There were many families with small children and it appeared to be a very family friendly resort.Overall it was a great vacation and would not hesitate to recommend it to others. ","annotations":[]}
