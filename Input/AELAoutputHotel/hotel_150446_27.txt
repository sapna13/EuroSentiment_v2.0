{"text":"The Intercontinental Rocks! We had a room overlooking the beach. Upon arrival, there was a piece of chocolate cake in our room because my birthday would occur during our stay. The first night we walked on the beach right off the hotel and watched a beautiful sunset. Every day we swam up to the bar IN THE POOL and had drinks (cappuccino colada!!!) and the best chicken quesadillas! One day I hung my bathing suit on the balcony to dry, and a gust of wind made it fall below to a rooftop ten floors below our room. My fiance (well, back then he was a mere boyfriend but we since got engaged!!!) went down to the concierge to ask for help, and minutes later a maintanance worker was sent to rescue my bathing suit and he promptly brought it to our room. Another time I left my watch near the pool to go for a swim, and one of the pool boys must have thought I left it there and took it to the lost and found. When we inquired about the watch, they were very helpful and the concierge even made me prove that the watch was mine before he handed it back to me.At the hotel's recommendation, we celebrated my birthday at Pamela's, a beautiful restaurant right on the beach. It was so romantic and delicious. We loved the Intercontinental and would recommend it to anyone who likes to swim up to their bar and hang their bathing suits to dry on the balcony. We'll be back!
