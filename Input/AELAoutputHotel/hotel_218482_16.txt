{"text":"Always better facility, food and staff We have been at this resort for a small family reunion about 10 times. Normally once in early Sping and the week after Thanksgiving. The reviews posted on the site are all on the money. The staff and management are on point, responsive and super friendly. Food is above average, healthy and taste great. Music and fun galore. What they apparently cannot control is the TOURIST. An influx of folks from Moscow in my opinion were incompatible with the spirit of the Resort. My fellow tourist had no trouble sharing the same conclusion. One comes to relax, enjoy t he weather and socialize. Others come and exibit some odd behavior. As an example one Moscow type gentleman was too rushed to wait for a burger on the grill so he reached over and grabbed the spatula and put two patties an his plate. This at the surprise of the folks that were waiting their turn. Then after the gentleman tasted the burgers at his table he apparently realized they were raw. He returned the burgers to he grill and continued to cook the partially eaten meat. At breakfast they walk in to the dining area and appear to wear their hangovers like a badge of honor. At breakfast these folks drink 8 to 10 beers in place of coffee. As they get drunk, you relax over coffee. Then they get louder and louder start to smoke and there goes your relaxing breakfast. At the same breakfast hour one gentleman asked for two full glasses of whiskey and then asked for coffee with whiskey in it. A slim lady bellied up to the breakfast grill, reached across and served herself no less than 1 1\/2 pounds of bacon. Curiously I watched her to see if she was with a group. It was only she and her husband. At breakfast they walk in to the dining area and appear to wear their hangovers like a badge of honor. At lunch a nice couple in their 40's stood alongside the grill which had just been loaded with pork chops. As the line grew the couple waited and asked for chop after chop until the grill was emptied. The pile on the two plates was quite a site to see. A comment was made and the couple (him drunk) became furious. An exchange of words led to other Moscow men ganging up to their aid. Apparently the feeding frenzy should not be interrupted. At the beautifully executed weekly Beach Party I saw one of these guys going through empty bottles of wine looking for drops to complete his evening. Everything is self-service for these guys. At the pool trying to have a siesta my daughter got up from her lounger and in 20 seconds I had one of these guys pulling at her lounger sayingOK OK as he pulled away under protest. More poolside fun: A group of 8 or so decide they will sit at the kids pool. They pull every possible lounge chair up to the pool and block all access for waking. Then the white edge of the pool was the only access. As they saw that folks were going around them this was, they put a towel down to attempt to block access. We walked over the towel. They did not like this and the gang got angry and vocal. Thank God we can't understand them.Late night we heard tales of fistfights but thankfully did not see any. Tipping is apparently unheard of in Moscow. Manners are not expected and complaining is considered an art form. We saw alot of complaining. The positives are that they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ appear to stay at the beach long. I think it's too far from the food and drink. The Resort has a real challenge here. A business decision that may be painful in these economic times. These resort owners and employees at every level work so hard to give you a huge bang for your dollar. I wish them luck. As for me the Tourist seriously damaged the vacation experience.
