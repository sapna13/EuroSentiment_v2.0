{"text":"Loved the Amistad My partner and I just returned from a first time one-week stay at the Amistad. What a great little European style hotel! It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ located in the central part of the city just a few steps away from three of the city√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ main tram lines. Several museums are within easy walking distance. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a great location for doing the tourist thing by day and enjoying the night life in the evening. There are lots of restaurants in the area too.What√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ so special about staying at the Amistad? I expected a clean quiet room in a small local hotel. We got that and a whole lot more. A limited menu breakfast was included in the room rate. Each morning they offered hard or soft boiled eggs along with other meats, cheeses, cereal, toast, juice and coffee. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ served until 1pm. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a nice way to meet other hotel guests. The breakfast is served family-style at one very large table. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe got to take the canal boat! No, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not talking about one of the 747-sized hop on hop off tourist boats. The Amistad offers private two-hour boat trips on a normal sized pleasure boat. That means they can take you on canals the big tourist boats won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fit on. We booked it for late afternoon. We turned it into a dinner cruise on the canal by including sandwiches and a bottle of wine. We had such a good time we booked the boat twice. I really liked the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ free WiFi. I brought my PDA and was able to keep up with our home email. No PDA? No worries. Most of the rooms are furnished with a full-sized desktop PC with free internet. The staff offered lots of helpful sightseeing advice too. If you like WWII history check out the Dutch Resistance Museum. Apparently, the hotel is very popular. So book early! We almost didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get in. When I made our reservation all of the rooms in the main building were already booked. They were able to accommodate us in one of their √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Önnex√à√\u2020\u2022?rooms in another building a few doors down the street. Here√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the best part. Even the annex rooms were booked the last two nights of our stay. So, we upgraded to one of the Penthouse Apartments. Very nice. Next trip we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e booking one of the apartments for the whole stay.My only criticism is that our hotel room in the annex building got pretty warm in the afternoon on a couple of the sunny days. The room faced the west and had lots of windows. There was a fan in the room and we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ in the room most afternoons. So it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a big problem. Yes, I would stay at this hotel again.LWFort Worth, TX ","annotations":[{"endOffset":774,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":769},{"endOffset":792,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":786},{"endOffset":848,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":844},{"endOffset":848,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":844},{"endOffset":1343,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1333}]}
