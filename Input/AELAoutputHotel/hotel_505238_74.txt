{"text":"We Loved The Princess I was a bit worried about staying here after reading some of the horror stories and bad experiences. I can honestly say we had a wonderful stay in this hotel, we didn't really spend an awful lot of time here using it as a base as we were only in Barca for 3 nights.About 10 minutes ride away from Las Ramblas on the Metro and 35 cab ride away from Barcelona Airport. Great location right next to the exhibition centre, shopping centre and huge food hall. Nearest metro 1 minute walk across the road. Quiet part of town, very safe.Lovely modern hotel very clean and minimal decor. 25 floors with 2 pools and a gym. Restaurant and bar open til 1am. 24 hour room service, porter, laundry service and 24 hour reception.We stayed in a superior suite on the 24th floor. Bath, shower, bede, toilet, hairdryer, with fresh towels and robes. Shampoo, soap, razor, shaving cream, nail file, comb, toothbrush and paste.Dressing room space, bedroom and balcony. Huge windows with amazing views of the city. TV, stereo, safe, free internet access (no wifi, conection wires available), phone, mini bar\/fridge. Contains 1 beer, 1 small coke, 1 small lemon fizzy non alchoholic drink, 1 small still and 1 small sparkling water.Refilled every day. Shoe cleaner slippers and shoe horn. Smoking rooms\/floors and non smoking available. A\/C in room controlled by yourself.We loved this hotel, found the staff very friendly and polite. Quick easy check in. Gave us handy maps of the city and metro.Our porter bought up our bags and asked us if we needed anything or wanted info on where to go. Brilliant service.Amazing view from our balcony and in the lift going up. The only thing we didn't like that there wa no iron in the room. We found this very poor. Sadly we had to pay 41.80 euros for an emergency iorning service of 2 shirts a pair of trousers and skirt. Either bring wrinkle free clothes or a travel iron (I usually do bring one). Some other things we found expensive and didn't take advantage of. A tiny bowl of crisps in the bar 3.60 euros, and this one tickled me, ice, 4.80 euros a bucket on the 24 hour room service menu. I guess this tries and stops you from bringing in your own drinks. I would recommend this hotel to couples\/singles and business people. We had a lovely stay here, it ticked all the boxes for us for our short stay. I certainly would stay again.Enjoy x ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1146,"mention":"coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":1142},{"endOffset":2029,"mention":"crisps","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip"],"startOffset":2023}]}
