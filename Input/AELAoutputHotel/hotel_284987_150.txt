{"text":"Nice Get Away I would say that just about every reviewer has this right. It all depends on why you are going here. You would probably hate this place if you are looking for night life and high energy. You would think it was pretty bad if you just wanted a beach to swim in. But if you are looking for a beautiful or romantic place to relax, you may have found a gem. I took my fiance for a long weekend, and it was a lovely experience.THE GOOD: We had an ocean front suite with the jacuzzi tub. The main area of the hotel is very beautiful, lots of marble, candles lit every night, open air, fountains everywhere. The royal service pool was perfectly quiet, we had an amazing bed looking out at the pool and the ocean just beyond. We enjoyed the fact that the pool workers weren't coming over every 15 minutes asking for another drink order. When we wanted something it was a short walk or an armwave. We ate at the Asian restaurant and watched the cook on the grille in front of us. Fun to watch, fun to meet people, and the food was just fine. Cafe Soliel had a great breakfast buffet that would tide you over until dinner if you ate around 11:00. The grounds are nice, above average but not like a Ritz or Four Seasons.The service was acceptable, nothing special but certainly not to the point of complaining. When we wanted to go off site for a local dinner, our butler, Marcos, recommended TACO RICO, which is just east of the resort road on 3, past the shell station about 2 blocks. You will probably pass it the first time, but it is worth the trip! We were the only non-locals and the owner is the only one who speaks english. They do not serve alcohol, but if you want a beer or wine, the owner will go to the bar down the street and get it for you. The food is awesome...let the owner set you up with appetizers and your meal! You won't regret it! The BAD and UGLY: While the beach is very picturesque, everything you have read on previous posts is true. It looks great! But what is pictured is like a hard clay with lots of rocks and coral that they groom in the morning so it looks a little like sand. Gorgeously landscaped, with chairs and hammocks but not very friendly to bare feet. There is a line of rocks that separates this clay beach from the sand beach. The sand is very coarse and is more like broken shells than sand. If you have water shoes or plastic flip flops, this is a nice beach to walk, and you can go pretty far. We were with people who saw an octopus, an eel, and a manta ray in the water from walking on the beach. I think you could have some fun and see some fish snorkelling here as long as you don't need the water to be really deep and sandy, but unfortunately the one day we tried, the water was too cloudy.The only other complaint is that the road into the resort is long and with a lot of construction. It detracts from the beauty of the resort to see all the dirt and mud and the lack of landscaping. Overall we had a super relaxing experience. Went to the rain forest and walked to see mina falls and tall tree trail. Saw Luquillo beach where people were surfing on giagantic waves, and spend a lot of time reading books and enjoying the sounds of the surf at the resort. And enjoyed some sunsets over the tree line to the west. Finding the information about the $250.00 food credit on the puerto rico forum pages made the food taste even better, since most of it was free! :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":1399,"mention":"TACO","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Taco"],"startOffset":1395},{"endOffset":2107,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":2103},{"endOffset":2402,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2398},{"endOffset":2402,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2398},{"endOffset":2402,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2398},{"endOffset":2402,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2398},{"endOffset":2905,"mention":"dirt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dirt_cake"],"startOffset":2901}]}
