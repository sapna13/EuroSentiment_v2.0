{"text":"Would stay again I was very happy at La Quinta. I used to stay at what was the Travelodge across the street (it's changed names and has really gone downhill) and I like the location. It's an easly walk to the convention center\/downtown, to Belltown for good restaurants, Space Needle, or to 1st Ave. (some hills) for the free bus to the Public Market or beyond. My only complaint with the area is that there is no pharmacy or supermarket in walking distance. There are 2 small makets but the prices are really high.The staff were very friendly. I checked-in early and since they didn't have my room ready I was able to leave my bag with no problems in a safe area. I had a regular room and not a suite. My room was large. The bathroom was big with a curved shower curtain rod. There was a sink in the bathroom and in a dressing area outside the bathroom. The room\/sheets\/towels\/carpet were all very clean. There was a balcony which was nice. The room had a microwave and refridgerator although the microwave didn't seem to work right and there was no manual for it. The room was quiet. The bed was very comfortable as were the pillows. The towels were plentiful and thick and somewhere between soft and scratchy.The free breakfast was fair but typical: toast and muffins, make your own waffles, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, terrible coffee, apples and bananas. In a 5 or 10 minute walk there is an excellent Thai restaurant called Golden Singha and a good pizza place called Zekes. They opened another pizza place there called Bambinos which looked like realy NY pizza but we didn't have time to try it. The Hurricane cafe behind the 8th Avenue Inn used to be good but it's gone downhill in quality so best to avoid it unless you are hungry really late and nothing else is open.There is a computer with printer off the lobby with internet access (free) and free wifi in the rooms. There is a jacuzzi which looked nice but we didn't have time to use. I come to Seatlle at least once a year and I'll definately stay here again.
