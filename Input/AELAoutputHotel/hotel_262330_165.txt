{"text":"Millenium Hotel After reading the other reviews of this hotel I was looking forward to staying there but I ended up being disappointed.On arrival at the hotel It took 3 bell hops to get our cases to our room 1 to get them out of the taxi, another to put them on a trolley and the third to get them up to the room. We really don't mind tipping but this we found that this was rather excessive even for New York standards. On arrival at reception the staff were more concerned about chatting to on another than checking us in. Throughout our stay not one of the reception staff greeted us with a smile and it really felt as if they had a could not care attitude .(Perhaps it was because we were english..)The room was clean and tidy and the bedlinens were rather lovely but some of the towels were stained so we were very particular over the ones which we used.On leaving .My husband had to ask them to take off a movie we had been charged for . We could barely get the Tv doofer to work ( batteries we thought) let alone manage to navigate the system for a pay as you go movie. Trying to get hold of a bell hop for help with the suitcases was a complete waste of time after calling both the bell hops and the concerge numbers alternatively for over 20 minutes I ended up struggling down in the lift with 3 suitcases and 2 bags by myself. I was told that I should have rung reception because they had changed their numbers...!!!! duh as if I would have known that one...!!!On the whole the hotel was ok but they need to sort out the staffing issues.One last thing, If you don't like having street vendors hanging around outside the hotel then this isn't the hotel for you.Each day at least 5 street vendors were pitched up outside the hotel on what appeared to be hotel frontage, selling immitation handbags, purses watches etc.The best thing about it was Kevin from room service who provided me with honey and lemon for a cold. and it's closeness to Century 21 , the seaport and the village.
