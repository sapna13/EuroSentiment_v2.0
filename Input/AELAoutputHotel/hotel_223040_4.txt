{"text":"Great Deal, Great Service, All-around Great experience! I'm actually a die-hard Hilton Honors fan; however, the rate at Marriott was better than the Conrad in Miami so I went ahead and tried it.Let me first tell you that this hotel is one of the best I've experienced. Clean, large, well equipped room. Top-of-the-line amenities (soap, lotion, mouthwash, shampoo, conditioner, shower gel); free bottled water and coffee\/tea service; 42 plasma wall-mounted TV; FREE internet in the room; awesome views of the city; comfy but firm bed with crisp white smooth linens and lots of pillows; great room service ... really very pleasant stay!Within two blocks, there is access to the free metro mover which takes you pretty much every where you'd like to go. Went from the downtown\/Brickell area to the port area to the shopping at Bayside. Very convenient, FREE, and lots of bang for the buck (LOL! shopping queen here). Right next door to Gordon Biersch which was very nice to have a variety of cold beers and then be able to walk back across the street to the JW Marriott. Also across the street from Morton's Steakhouse, if that's what you're into (I'm not, since I'd much rather BBQ my own ranch-raised steers than pay for their overpriced a la carte steak dinners).Last, I do have one suggestion for the JW Marriott folks ... you are missing a TREMENDOUS opportunity for some really great PR with those silly newspaper holders...you know the ones that hang over the door, with your hotel name on the front, and a little strip of fabric holding the newspaper inside. Well, spend a few more cents and make it a bag with a solid bottom, and I'll bet folks will take them home\/traveling with them to tote items around. What a great way to get publicity and get your name throughout the airports, with very little cost or modification of what you're doing now. And the little tote could turn up around the world, given the business travelers and cruise-line hoppers that come thru your hotel daily. Just a thought!
