{"text":"Great value Most of the reviews of this hotel make valid points, but put it all together, and you get a better experience than the sum of its parts. The building is a condominium, where some of the owners rent out their apartments when they're not using them. As such, some of the furniture is old, and could use replacement. The housekeeping is OK, the place isn't spotless, but considering the staff size (I think there is one housekeeper), the apartment was clean. We were on the 25th floor, but didn't have much of a view, because we were at the side of the building, but we were above the pool, and if you looked out over the edge of the terrace, you could see the ocean. The location is in a business district, so on the weekend it was very quiet. It was a block from the free downtown subway, which took us to the entertainment district and Bayside Marketplace, and also connected to Metro Rail and Tri Rail.The parking ($16 per day) was convenient with elevator access. The front desk and concierge were very helpful and friendly.There is a lot of security, I'm not sure how much of it is necessary, but you need your key card to get into the front door, on the elevator or into the garage, and again from the garage to the elevator.I would not hesitate to stay here again, and would use the public transportation even more now that I know how it works.
