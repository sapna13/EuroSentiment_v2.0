{"text":"A Fantastic Babymoon! We're expecting Baby #2 in September and chose IBB for our Babymoon Getaway destination (4\/7-4\/11). Great choice! A few highlights (I'll try to keep each section brief...)1) Palapa-roof airport (so tropical!) Greeted with a live musical trio. Paid $10 per person entry fee. Customs was a breeze.2) A 30- minute ride from the airport in air conditioned comfort (VIP Travel Services) on well-maintained roads. 3) Check-in was effortless! We were immediately upgraded to a beautiful room just a very short walk from the beach\/pool.4) Our room (#2382) was very nice: air-conditioning worked well, no musty odor, clean linens, good housekeeping with fresh towels (if we wanted) daily. Comfy garden patio with the occasional visiting peacock. We left in the a.m. to spend the day on the beach and returned in the p.m. to find a brand new 32 LCD flat screen TV!! Fabulous 2-person marble shower, a bathtub  spacious vanity w\/huge mirror. Stocked mini-bar. The safe is free so we used it. (just don't lose the key...)5) Grounds: ABSOLUTELY gorgeous and superbly maintained! Almost no bugs (mosquitos, etc.) Staff members always sweeping, cleaning, even common-area baths are immaculate. Gazebos, covered bridges, ponds with pink flamingos, peacocks showing off for the guests. Perfect!6) Pool: beautiful. Lots of chaise lounges.7) Beach: UNBELIEVABLE!! The most beautiful we''ve ever seen. White powdery sand, crystal-clear waters, some seaweed but the staff raked every morning. Lots of palapas in the shade. Note: some topless sunbathing. The sun is intense so wear sunscreen!8) Staff: super friendly  helpful. Their mission was to make us as comfortable  happy as possible.9) Food  drink: Not gourmet but good. The breakfast buffet is huge! Omelets to order, smoked salmon, local dishes, something for everyone. Loved the fresh fruit  juice bars. Make your dinner reservations in the a.m. We had no trouble at all with reservations. Try the seafood paella at the Mediterranean restaurant. I enjoyed virgin cocktails all week but my hubby enjoyed all of his cocktails. Our favorites were the Lobby Bar and the beachside bar at the Dominicana (the sister hotel next door ~ just a short walk away)10) Special hello to: Francy at the Ice Cream stand, Speghetti the comedian  Lucy for a fantastic massage! We'll see you next year...with the kids!! (Although our son wasn't with us on this trip, we noted that the resort is family-friendly)Note: I see why Budget Travel magazine rated this resort Best Value...you get a nice bang for your buck! If you go, Enjoy!
