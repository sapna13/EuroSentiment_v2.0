{"text":"A memorable anniversary break What a fab place to stay for a special occasion!We stayed at the LTI in October 2007 and would return in a flash.Our favourite part of the hotel, other than the glorious beach, was the lobby. What a breath-taking entrance. In the evenings, after our dinner and before our moon-lite walk along the beach, we would sit in the lobby on the HUGE comfortable sofas with a 'Cafe con leche' and relax and soak up the atmosphere.Days were spent lounging between the pool and the white sandy beach!The pool bar El Torro was really convenient to go and grab a couple of cocktails to take back to the beach.The Room:Clean and functional. The mini bar was stocked daily with 2 small bottles of Sprite and Coke. Also 1 litre bottles of water. The TV was temperamental (Although we only found this out in the last 2 days of our holiday when we suffered the backlash of a hurricane!) The air-conditioning was a god send although ours decided to leak water during the night on numerous occasions, waking us up and having to get reception to get cleaners to come an mop up!(There was a lot of water!)The bathroom was a good size with a very powerful shower (I remember this as it killed with sunburn!) The one strange thing about the bathroom was the door which had a glass pane in the middle of it so you could see out, but more worryingly people could see in! Although the loo was to the right of this door. (You could still see someone using it easily though!)The Food:The main food hall was amazing. Breakfast gave you the choice of:Hot drinks, porridge, Fresh bread (all types), many different cereals, fruit galore, Cheese, smoothies, juices, cooked breakfast items, freshly made to order omelette's with your choice of filling, crepes, pancakes, Croissants, etc etc.Lunch:Pizzas, Chips, Salad, Fruit, fish dishes, chicken, soup, potatoes, pasta, all types of meat, deserts, fruit juices, smoothies.Dinner:Soups, breads, potatoes, freshly made pasta dishes to order, fish counter, Meat counter, Chinese made to order counter (my favourite), deserts etc.El Toro - The Beach Bar - Offered a buffet of hot and cold foods at lunchtime and also had an all day grill which offered Burgers, Hot Dogs, Chicken pieces and chips.The Pizza House (Can't remember the name) - BOOK INTO HERE BY THE MAIN RESTAURANT COMPLEX BETWEEN 9am  10:30am OTHERWISE YOU WONT GET IN! THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN GET IN WITHOUT A RESERVATION TICKET!You were able to eat here once a week (although when we went it was very quiet and were able to eat there 4 times in 2 weeks!) This was a buffet style restaurant with lasagne, bread, salad, soup and starters available. You are then given a menu from which to choose your desired Pizza or Calzone.Drinks are on tap no matter where you go in the complex and their days out are very well organised!Overall, this is a child friendly, honeymoon friendly, group friendly place in which to holiday!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
