{"text":"Do not Recommend at all!! I was very excited about our stay in Hotel Enza especially after I confirmed and read all the reviews of the hotel on many websites. it turned out that we possibly got their worst room because our experience was anything but good. first and foremost, the walk to the hotel from the train station is longer than 10 minutes and is a difficult walk what with suitcases etc. you have narrow sidewalks if that and the traffic is heavy. the hotel itself is in a non-descript neighborhood, many flights of stairs before you get to your room (imagine lugging your luggage after having walked 25 minutes). the room we were alloted had the worst bathroom no real demarcation between the shower, the toilet and the sink..they all just sat in a small area.. awful. the air conditioning refused to work and the front desk refused to acknowledge that there was a problem with the AC. Our room was supposed to be ready by 1 pm but we could not get in till close to 3 pm delaying our plans to sightsee. I know we were not the only ones waiting as we saw several pieces of luggage in the office area of other guests waiting to be checked in. I felt like the neighborhood was not very good later in the evening...some good things about the hotel: one of the few places that had free internet access, the hotel did all our museum reservations ahead of time, the staff is very good (katia) on email and would respond to any emails promptly. apart from this, do not believe the location proximity, some of the pictures on the hotel website show nicer rooms and bathrooms (not where we stayed!). Go only if you have no other choices...it is somewhat close to the duomo and very close to the accademia museum. ","annotations":[]}
