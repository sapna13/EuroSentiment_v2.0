{"text":"6-week stay - thank goodness for this GEM! I arrived April 1, (leaving) May 10 for business - thank goodness I decided on Metropark Causeway Bay. I booked a Panorama Executive Suite - the room is very large, clean and bright with comfortable furniture and fully equipped. The view is spectacular and the extras included are worth the upgrade. I have a huge bowl of fresh fruit delivered each Monday, daily paper at my door, pm turndown service replacing any used towels, free breakfast offered from either the restaurant or the private Panorama lounge, which then offers free cocktails and snacks from 5:30 to 7:30 daily and free broadband (from all rooms). The Panorama staff is there for your every whim; the staff throughout actually. Maintenance is great and the room is always spotless, others are always around the hotel polishing, staff will deliver almost anything you require within minutes. The concierge area offers free daily shuttle service that drops guests at the Convention Centre in Wanchai several times in the morning from where you can continue to your destination very conveniently. There are two pm pick-ups from this same location. The pool \/ gym area has the best view in town of the harbour and Victoria Park. Location - MTR (the underground, Metro, subway, whatever you call it, you will not have seen a more spotless, efficient system in North America or Europe) is a 5 minute walk. The tram is always fun but make sure it's not after a day of shopping - very narrow. Taxis, first 2 kms only 16$hkd. And though it is located in an area that houses local small businesses and residences, it is an ideal location because it is not rowdy with tourists when you are winding down from your day - having stayed in Wanchai area last year, the difference is day and night!Being in HK for 6 weeks for biz would have been difficult were it not for this hotel and the staff (past 10-day stay at another establishment was disappointing). I am able to have a solid workout at the gym, eat fresh fruit and oatmeal at breakfast, get to work comfortably on a shuttle which I take home after work almost regularly, wind down in a quiet lounge during happy hour, and log in to continue working in the pm as I watch the harbour light show every night at 8pm from the comfort of my spacious room.
