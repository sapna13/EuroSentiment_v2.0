{"text":"Top Notch Food-n-Drink This was our first ALL-INCLUSIVE vacation, so we don't have much to compare to, but we absolutely loved the service, food  beverage! I hear they usually get a bad rap, so we made sure to pick a place with good reviews (like Excellence) and we're glad we did. Drinks just flowed constantly, not that we could even drink that much honestly, if you are a big drinker...you won't be disappointed. The service was top notch. Those of you who complain about somep people being on caribbean time ... not at the Excellence..they were right there ever time our drink was empty or soup was just finished. Service was TOP NOTCH. We opted for the Excellence Club which we liked mostly for the convenience of having 7a-11p internet access. Our cell phone did not work in the Dominican, so we had to chek once or twice a day to an email account to make sure our business at home was running smoothly...the free\/easy access internet was perfect. There was also a buffett in there for snacks\/lunch\/etc if you were hungry  a tv. We liked the club. We did not opt for the entertainment mainly because we came to the resort to relax. There are sort-of 2 sides to the resort...the noisy side and the quiet side. We stayed at the quiet side. The daytime entertainment usually was connected to a microphone...outgoing stuff, ya know. Some people LOVE IT..others just cringe. (that's us). The nighttime entertainment was very, very nice. We loved the shows ... the Michael Jackson Show, the International Show, The Circus Show...i think there was also a Magic show and a Cris Blizzard show...i didn't see those thow. They also had jazz on the plaza  a nightclub with a different theme each night. They work very hard at their entertianment and it shows. Whether you prefer a more outgoing style or more subdude...you'll find something you like.Two small problems of note: bed is ROCK HARD and threw-out my husband's back! We even brought our own pillows. Our particular electronic safe repeatedly broke down and they kept thinking we didn't know how to use it, but we're pretty sure [sarcasm] we know how to key in 4 #s (that was quite annoying).The definite issue we ran into is the doctor they have on their premises. We went there looking for a heating pad or ice pack for my husabd's back (since he threw it out from the hard bed) he was denied that and instead was prescibed medication. OK, fine. But instead of paying cash, he wanted our insurance, copies of our drivers license, copies of passport, copies of credit card. We were obviously not comfortable with that, so we insisted on paying cash and after 2 days of insisting on getting the bill of services. He finally gave it to us. That stressed us out and put a damper on our trip, we must say. My advice...suffer with whatever ailment you get... we were not comfortable with his insistance, that's all I'll say anymore about that.Overall very beautiful, relaxing, accommodating, pleasant environment...We loved our trip.
