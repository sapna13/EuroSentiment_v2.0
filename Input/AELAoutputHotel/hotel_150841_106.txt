{"text":"Great Resort Our group of 27 stayed at this resort from June 4th-June 11th for my daughter's beach wedding on Friday, June 6th. The wedding photographer assigned to our wedding took many great shots and didn't mind family members taking pictures, either. The wedding coordinator was new to her job and did her best, as some of the smaller details were overlooked. The staff was very friendly, efficient, hard working and made sure you had a great time. The food at the buffet was plentiful and served hot. We never had a problem getting a spot at the pool or beach. The Dominicans appreciate any tips and remember those with better service and a big smile. Remember to bring lots of singles or smaller bills, as the front desk usual doesn't have change. The rooms were comfortable and cleaned early in the day by maids. My clothes did smell a little musty when I returned home, but were fine after washing them. We did the Stingray Bay trip and I would highly recommend this 1\/2 day experience. Hint: The hot water in the shower is not all the way to the left, but set the top of the knob to the 1 to 2 o'clock position to get hot water. The only complaint I had was the peacocks. They are beautiful, but make call to each other in the night and expecially early morning, which makes it had to sleep in. They nest in the palm trees or on the balconies. Our room (1093) was in the first bungalow after the lobby area and many nested in trees. Some of our party were away from this area (closer to the pool) and didn't hear them as much.
