{"text":"Great decor! I love boutique hotels, but usually don't want to pay high prices and instead stay at a plain old chain. But the rates at the Clarendon were very reasonable and the decor was fantastic! It's modern and sleek and colorful, I just wished my own house was decorated like this. Also had a great martini menu in the bar. I had vegetable enchiladas in the restaurant, and you could actually tell what all the vegetables were, and they were delicious! Not like some Mexican restaurants were everything is smashed together and not very fresh. The beds and linens were amazing, much better than a high end resort I stayed in a few weeks later. Again, how do I get my own house to be this great? I was in Phoenix for just one night for business, so I only got to view the beautiful pool but not experience it. Loved that people were up swimming early the next morning, and wished I'd thought to set my alarm earlier! I also liked the feel of being near downtown Phoenix but still having parking and not being in the middle of all the traffic. The neighborhood is super cute, lots of older homes being updated, just like this hotel. If you like fabulous beds, great service, and bright, modern decor, you will love this place. It made my business trip much more interesting than when I stay at plain chains that are nice, but nothing exciting to look at or talk about when I get home.
