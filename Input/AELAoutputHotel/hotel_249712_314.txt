{"text":"Great Location, lovely hotel My husband, 15 year old daughter and I stayed here in a double twin room for a 4 day break over the Memorial Day weekend holiday. We used our SPG Starpoints for 3 nights and had to pay for 1 night. We were lucky enough to be upgraded, stayed on the 40th floor and had free access to the executive club, which included breakfast and afternoon drinks. The room was a good size, spotlessly clean and tastefully decorated. My daughter loved the bathroom and having her own double bed! We received a turndown service each night and chocolates, which was lovely. The staff were friendly and courteous. The location is great if you love to be in the hustle bustle of things, but I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ recommend it if you hate crowds. The weather was great whilst we were there and we were able to get out and about and see much of the city, however, since it was a holiday weekend the tours were all exceptionally busy with long queues and waits. We were advised not to bother going to the Statue of Liberty or Ellis Island since there were 2-3 hour queues around Battersea Park, so we took the free Statton Island ferry and back, which was really nice. Also advised not to bother with the Empire State building due to excessive waits so we went up to the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??op of the Rock√à√\u2020\u2022? no wait, hassle, large crowds or anything, absolutely fantastic views, including the Empire State building, well worth the visit.In all we had a truly wonderful trip and our daughter can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait to go back, she loved everything about the city and managed to spend an absolute fortune!!!!
