{"text":"A perfect weekend My husband, 12 year old son and I went to Seattle for the weekend to have fun. We stayed three nights at the S.C. on Broadway. It is a bit out of walking distance of the downtown attractions but the complimentary shuttle is easy to use. The staff were very friendly and helpful and the decor was upscale from the box hotels. The rates were the same as the Holiday Inn or Travelodge but the feel was more elegant. The breakfast buffet is pretty basic; cereal, bagels, waffles; that type of stuff. We paid for parking in the underground garage but that's standard in the downtown area.The room was your basic two queens room with a comfy reading chair and ottoman and a well appointed desk. We were able to use wireless internet with our laptop for no additional fee. There is a large flat screen tv which is much nicer than a typical unit that takes a lot of space. The small things were nice; the hangers come off the rod. The towels are softer than your usual box hotel. There is a complimentary laundry room on each floor. The beds were super comfy. We didn't use the pool and spa but the area was clean. I used the small gym; it was unremarkable but does have a tv.We ordered dinner from room service (from the Cayenne Grille downstairs) and it was prompt and yummy. My Captain and Coke was just right and a at good price.We'll definitely stay again. I'm not sure what it is about the S.C.; it's not a remarkable hotel in any one area but the atmosphere and staff make you feel comfortable and just a bit pampered.Our son loved the hotel and highly recommends it, also.
