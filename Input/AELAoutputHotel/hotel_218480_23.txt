{"text":"very roomy! There was myself, two sisters, and my mother travelling. We wanted 2 rooms because we were informed that the max occ. in a Golf apartment was 4. We didn't want to share beds so we booked 2 rooms. From the moment we got there everything and everyone was super nice! BUT when we got to our rooms, we were shocked!! our rooms could have easily slept 6-8 people. There were 5 beds, one was a king in the loft upstairs. Two full bathrooms! So, between this family of 4 there was 10 beds!! Since then everything went very smooth, some how we had the best timing and luck, we beat all the line ups everywhere even at the airport, not on purpose either!The food was not good though, I found a worm in my cooked brocoli at the buffet, I basically ate buns and butter the whole time. The bartnders were very fun and happy go-lucky, singing all the time. I really hit it off with one at the pool bar. His name is Esubio, very good looking!However, don't expect them to make your drink right away, unlike NorthAmerica, they take their time there. Your on vacation! no need to rush!When I saw online maps of the full barcelo resorts, I was a little bummed because I thought that I would have to walk quite a ways to get to the beach from the golf apartments. Turns out the beach was right around the corner 2 minute walk! all the other resorts were very easy walking distance too! There isn't much point in waiting for the tram because it's always full! and by the time you waited 10 minutes for the tram, you could have been where you wanted to go anyway!The toilets and showers were weak, there was a rather large cockaroach in one bathroom.All in all I think the attitude you take in with you will be your attitude the whole vacation. It is a beautiful resort, gorgous beach, fun people, food not so good but not horribly bad. I will definatly go back! One tip I have would be to pack alot of snack food!!
