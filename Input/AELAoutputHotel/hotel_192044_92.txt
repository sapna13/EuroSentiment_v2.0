{"text":"GREAT London hotel, will definitely go back We booked this through Travelocity, and it was a fantastic experience for us. We hadn't been on that side of the Thames before, but it was less than a block away from both the Thames and the London Bridge Underground stop. We absolutely were thrilled - were greeted in an open, friendly manner by staff who actually seemed to care how we were, and who even upgraded our room without asking from a double to a King size bed. The breakfast, which was included, was the best we'd had in Europe - we were SO happy and unfortunately couldn't stop eating so were always full for lunch. Really good scrambled eggs, sausages, ham, potatoes, tomatoes, all sorts of cereals, croissants\/danishes, juice, toast, and when you are seated you are promptly asked if you would like some tea or coffee for breakfast, and then it's promptly brought to your table. We LOVED that part of it.They have a concierge on duty all the time who will gladly help with any travelling or show plans. Although they are obviously not the most trained concierge (they seem to do double-duty as the bellman), they are so overly helpful and friendly that we were thrilled to have them.Loved the location too - right on the walking path down the Thames, if you follow the jubilee path from there toward Big Ben\/Parliament house direction, you will happen upon these great old alleyways with lots of great pubs. Will definitely go back again...
