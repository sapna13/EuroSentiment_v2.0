{"text":"Good but a little noisy I booked this for a business visit since the rate was good and the location seemed ok. After I informed my contact where I booked they were quite alarmed since the neighborhood apparently is not too friendly, but I must say I haven't really had any trouble.The rooms are good and clean, although the walls are a bit thin. Sounds carry over easily from other rooms, especially through the ventilation system.Another major contributor to the noise is the proximity of the hospital which is just around the corner, with ambulances going by very regularly. Nothing too bad though.The complimentary wireless internet access is definitely a plus. Speed is decent and it's very reliable. Staff is very friendly and helpful. I haven't tried the shuttle services, so I can't comment on it. The location is not too good if you want to have quick access to a good restaurant, bar or theatre. There is a Ground Round bar adjacent to the hotel which is pretty decent but will gett a little boring if you need to spend more than two nights in a row there. So getting a taxi into the city center seems to be the only option.The breakfast is reasonable although a little one-sided (sugar) and all in all I have to say I'm pretty pleased with the hotel. So if you're looking for a decent hotel for a reasonable price, and you don't take too much notice of the ambulances rushing past every now and then, this might be one to consider. ","annotations":[]}
