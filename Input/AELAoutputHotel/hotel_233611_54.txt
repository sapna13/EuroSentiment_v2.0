{"text":"A real piece of Paris! My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 1-4 December. We go to Paris quite a lot and I really liked the look of this hotel. We were given room 15, on the first floor. If you look at the picture of the hotel, ours was the two left hand windows. The bedroom was huge, with no less than six lamps to create a lovely warm and cosy atmosphere, marble fireplace, oil paintings and art deco furniture. There was a table and two chairs which was a useful touch.The bathroom was amazing - lovely and big, unusual in Paris, again with a marble fireplace, a lamp and huge mirror. Usually we hop in and out of the shower in a bathroom that is on the compact side to say the least, so it was rather nice after a long day pounding the streets of Paris to soak in a hot bath pondering on the hotel's history (it used to be a bank).We skipped the breakfast, which looked very good, in favour of mingling with Parisians at little cafes, or enjoying the panoramic view from the cafe at the top of Galeries Lafayette (another reviewer's recommendation).There were a couple of minor downsides - the toiletries weren't up to much, just sachets of shampoo which we had to double up as bath foam, and being at the front there was a lot of street noise. Mainly traffic (and the rumble of the metro, which I quite liked bizarrely) but also loud noises coming from the renovations of a building up the road. But I don't mind noise so if you do, ask for a room at the back. You can also hear the bells of the Trinity Church which I definitely liked!The young girl at the desk was quite friendly, and after a day in Paris and being a bit damp from the rain, she was more than happy to bring us hot chocolate and coffee to the room, beautfiully presented on a lace-lined silver tray.I would definitely go back here again, I used to think hotel rooms were just somewhere to lay your head whilst you got on with making the most of Paris, but I felt at home and that added an extra something to our stay.
