{"text":"Perfect Price to Quality Ratio I loved my stay at this superbly located Hotel.If going to Paris it is important to understand that in the central historic areas you just don't find big high rise international hotels. The vast majority are small street front boutique style 3 or 4 star hotels. Rooms are 'compact' but adequate in this hotel just as in all others. If you do manage to find a big suite style room you'll pay a small fortune for it.At 165 Euros per night for a 'superior double' with balcony on an upper floor this hotel represents excellent value for money in Paris. You can easily pay a lot more - sometimes for less in terms of quality.The only reason I don't give this five stars is because the decor in this popular gem is becoming slightly tired. Don't get me wrong - the room decor adequate and the standard of cleanliness is excellent but it's time for a bit of light re-decorating. A spot of paint here and there, some fresh wallpaper and revamped flooring and this place just couldn't be beaten at the price.My comments above on decor don't apply to bathrooms which are in pristine condition.Staff - all of them were wonderful. I endorse all previous comments made about their helpfulness and attention to detail.Location is simply superb for sightseeing on foot. 10 mins walking time to The Louvre and 10 - 20 mins for many other famous landmarks. For the really adventurous walker - The Eiffel Tower is about 45 mins away with a return walk via Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees taking another 1 hour.If you get hung up on small details having to add up to perfection then hotels in central Paris aren't going to be for you. If however you can be happy with charming plus very good standards rather than perfect then this hotel is for you.I will definitely go back if visiting Paris in the future.By the way - Paris is fabulous!
