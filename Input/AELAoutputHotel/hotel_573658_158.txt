{"text":"Great location, service and a great deal. I spent three nights at the Suites at 1 King West during the first week of August 2006. Generally when I visit Toronto I try to save money by staying in suburban Mississauga. While I spend most of my visits to Toronto in the Downtown Core and surrounding neighborhoods, I usually forgo downtown lodging since anything desirable is usually $200-300 CDN a night during the peak summer months.But with the deal I received for a Tower Superior suite for $149 USD a night, I reserved three nights. And for the most part I was not disappointed. Courteous, excellent service from the front desk, porters and valets made a big difference. I had a 17th floor suite with a modest view of Yonge Street and Lake Ontario. I even paid for Valet parking with in and out privileges for $25 a day, which I felt was worth it.The Tower Superior Suite I stayed in was small for something classified as suite, but it had a nice king size bed with a duvet cover, and despite its size (about 500 sq ft) it did not feel cramped since it had an open plan and floor to ceiling windows. It included a small kitchenette with refrigerator\/freezer, sink. Microwave and dishwasher. The room and hotel facilities were exceptionally clean and any construction that is mentioned in previous reviews has been completed. The only hotel amenities I used were the small health club on the 15th floor. I worked out a 9PM and it was cool doing a run on their high-tech treadmill with cable TV hooked up to the treadmills√à√\u2020\u2022?built in TV. But much better than that was the nighttime view of Toronto (the treadmills face the window). There are no nautilus machines but a decent selection of free weights. Location is exceptional, the hotel is at the heart of the Downtown Core at King  Yonge and it is across the street from the TTC√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ King Street subway station. Many points of interest are in walking distance from the hotel. You can forgo a car and purchase a TTC Day Pass for $8 CDN. The TTC day pass allows full access to their system of subways, streetcars and buses up until 5AM the next morning. King Street is also a primary streetcar route. Great location, service, very clean and a great deal. Highly recommended.
