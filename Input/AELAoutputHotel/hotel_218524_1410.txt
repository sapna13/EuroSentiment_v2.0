{"text":"GrEat TiMe I was very nervous about our selection to go to Secrets after reading all the poor reviews. i honestly do not know who was writing these reviews, my boyfriend and I had a blast:) The ride from the airport was long about 1.5 hours but it was nice to see the country and how they live. I think I was just excited to get my vacation started but did appreciate seeing the view from the air conditioned bus:)When we arrived we were handed a cool washcloth and drink while checking in which was quick. When we arrived at our room our luggage was arleady there and ready for us. The room was clean. We were in room 5005 and it was VERY close to the cascade pool. I would recomend staying over there near that pool. Dont let your vacation go by w\/o checking out this pool. I loved it, it was deeper and much less crowded that the main pool and there was also a bar there. Never any problems getting a raft there. Ok, well the beds werent the best but I slept OK, but i dont think anyone sleeps as well as they do in their own bed:) The food was good. Breakfast and Lunch wasnt to exctiing but it was good. Dinner was AWESOME! So many choices, we loved the French Resturant, Borduex and went there twice. I had no problems with getting sick from the food and I ate the salad. All the people I talked to had no problems as well. We never made a reservation but did have to wait one night for about 45 min at Burduex, although we enjoyed listening to the paino bar and having a few cocktails before dinner. The shows are fun, the atomsphere is very nice. The Micheal Jackson show is the best. GO SEE IT! I didnt spent to much time in the disco b.c we were tired from the sun all day. I would bring 50$ in tips. We tipped, and the workers really appreciate it. I got my hair braided and the lady who braided it said the workers make $300\/month.. Its hard to find someone to braid your hair but she is down the beach at the end and her name is Nancy. She will do it for a lot less than anyone else. Well have fun!
