{"text":"REALLY convient-completely recommed this hotel This is a very modern, safe, pleasant hotel. It is located SO near the Sants (Saints?) train station you could throw a tennis ball over to it and hit it (RIGHT across the street). There is major construction right out front and across the street on the train station, but unless you are very near the bottom floors on the west end you'd never know it--i must admit we were there on a weekend tho, maybe is it loud on weekdays. We stayed on the 10th floor. The free breakfast was insanely good: a ginormous buffet with tons of everything: all kinds of juices, pastries, meats, coffee, cereal, yadda, yadda and vegetarian friendly. And the view from the restaurant is gorgeous, just make sure to get there early and grab a window seat and a free paper!). It is very clean and the bathrooms are really killer too: marble with frosted glass doors. You have to stick your key in the inside light switch to make it turn on (odd, esp since we arrived at night and had no clue), so get an extra key if you have to hang out alone with and wish to have lights on. There are a bunch of English channels, mostly news and sports. The hotel staff was exceptionally polite and very helpful too. And there are the subway stops right across the street making the trip to the Ramblas\/Borne area about 10-15 minutes away total time. No free WIFI. Did not use spa or eat in restaurant in hotel. This is very, very good hotel!
