{"text":"Great value, great hotel For the price, this is one of the best hotel deals in Tokyo.1. Very high speed internet is free. Most places I've stayed at in Tokyo charge an extra $10 to $15 a day for internet connection. The connection is only via LAN and I wouldn't have preferred wireless....but free is a good price. 2. Join the hotel Executive Club. You can join from the hotel web site (for fee) and this gives you free access to their a club room on the 34th floor of the south tower. The club has tons of free newspapers, free beer, free soda, rice crackers and a killer view. 3. The health club was small....but at least they had one. 2 treadmills, 2 stair climbers, and 1 bike. 4. The hotel is RIGHT next door to the Tokyo Government building that has a free observatory on the 45th floor. Great views and the price is right. 5. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Shinjuku station but it is right on top of the Toccomae station on the Oedo line. Easy access to the train system is the single most important factor when I choose a Tokyo hotel and the access is great here. 6. There is a convenience store in the basement of the hotel. You'll save a bundle on food and drinks if you take advantage of this budget eating option. 7. There is a large district of budget restaurants and pachinko parlors 1 block away. You won't suffer a lack of low cost eating options if you stay in this hotel. THE CONS1. Shinjuku is on the far eastern end of Tokyo so it takes a long, long time to get from Narita to the hotel. 2. When possible, I like to stay at a hotel that is right on top of a JR line. While the Tocomae line is right beneath the hotel, I did get tired of the 10 minute walk to Shinjuku station not to mention the finding your way in that maze of humanity. 3. The health club had aerobic equipment but very little weight lifting equipment. I paid about $240 night for a triple room (breakfast NOT included) and felt it was a bargain. If you have 2 or less in your traveling party, I think you can do better than the Keio Plaza. If your traveling party is 3-4 people, the Keio Plaza is the best bargain you will find in Tokyo.
