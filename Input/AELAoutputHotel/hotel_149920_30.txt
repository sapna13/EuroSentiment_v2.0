{"text":"Great Hotel, but not really a Resort This is a great beachside hotel, with all the level of services and amenities you'd expect, but I just wouldn't call it a Resort So, let's start with the good: decent sized room, comfortable beds, nice bathroom with lovely Bath  Body aromatherapy toiletries. They had an efficient front desk staff and good housekeeping. The bad thing about the room was that the AC didn't seem to have the oomph to fully overcome the hot, humid weather, so it was always about 72 F in the room (which was too hot and sticky for fully comfortable sleeping in my book).The beach access was great, though the surf can get a bit rough in the Condado area. The downside is that the beach attendants seem pretty reluctant to help you set up your beach chair and were constantly suggesting that you take other guests' chairs - even if it appears they had just gone into the water rather than left the beach for good. It can also get pretty crowded, but not as bad as you might expect, given the size of the hotel.The Pool area is very pretty and even has a swim-up bar. However, it's pretty family-oriented. The water is no more than 3 ft deep anywhere and there are a LOT of screaming children at all times. So, great if you have children, pretty lousy if you don't. The waterslide is open to adults, though, so you can kind of cross the divide that way.The breakfast buffet is pretty good and definitely a good value. Lunch and dinner options are fairly standard hotel fare. But luckily, there are 3 excellent Puerto Rican\/Carribean restaurants within walking distance - Yerba Buena, Ajili Mojili and Vieja Ropa. The casino is small and fun, and they even offer gambling lessons each evening.The location in Condado is really convenient. There's a fair amount of shopping and eating available nearby and you are halfway between the neighborhood of Isla Verde for good nightlife and Old San Juan for cultural\/historical sites and good nightlife. Either area is about a 15 USD cab ride away. There is also a city bus that stops on the corner in front of the Marriott and terminates in Old San Juan. It's supposedly 75 cents, but I kept riding for free, and it doesn't appear to follow any kind of set schedule, so I'd only recommend it if you are flexible and like the adventure of riding other city's public transport.All right, so that's all mostly positive, but here's why I really can't call it a Resort. As far as I could see, the only things that differentiated this from a normal beachfront hotel is that they have additional tours and activities available via the Tour Desk and the Ocean Club (aka the Pool). However, these were pretty lame activities, such as cupcake frosting and throwing a volleyball net across the pool. And though the gym facilities were good, the spa was kind of puny. Finally, I have to reiterate the lazy beach attendants. That was really disappointing after spending the first half of the week at a much less expensive location where they practically fell over themselves to be at our service.
