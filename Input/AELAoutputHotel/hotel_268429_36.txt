{"text":"Coral Princess a let-down We stayed in the Penthouse suite for one quick night, and on first impression it was very cool! Definitely a smooth decor: very modern. The whole hotel has a random chic appearance with antique furniture blended with bold colorful paintings and modern lines. Only upon settling in did we begin to be disappointed. The toilet paper, a priority for my D.H., was the cheapest quality one could purchase, the shower was plumbed directly into the jacuzzi tub, which was a little awkward to step in or out of, there were cheap soaps and, a female's favorite, conditioning shampoo. I don't know a female that doesn't appreciate conditioner!! There weren't even kleenex in the room! The cheap t.p. had to suffice! There were doors that opened directly onto the roof-top deck that had no instructions and were impossible to open. The a.c. was an individual unit mounted on the wall controlled by a remote that, apparently, had been dropped so the LCD screen was unreadable. I spent the night either roasting or freezing not being able to find a happy medium. Another disappointment for me was that the hotel was a $12 (one way) cab fare away from Old San Juan. The last, but not least, missing commodity in our PENThouse sute was an alarm clock!!!! All that said, the bed was very comfy, the staff friendly and the hotel fairly clean. Probably wouldn't stay there again, or wouldn't pay *$200* dollars for maybe what a lesser room would've offered. ","annotations":[]}
