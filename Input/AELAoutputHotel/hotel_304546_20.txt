{"text":"Nice hotel, staff very helpful  I booked a special deal through Japan Travel Service at a very good rate and was given a deluxe room. The room was on the 19th floor with views of Tokyo  Mount Fuji, and was clean and nicely decorated, but very small - perfectly adequate for me so not a problem, but if this was deluxe I wonder what a standard room is like? Otherwise, very nice, very large hotel with a good selection of restaurants  bars in-house, although they are a bit pricey - cocktail bar\/restaurant on 25th floor is nice with good views. The staff were exremely polite, friendly  helpful (as were most of the Japanese people I had contact with). Hotel location is good - a few minutes from Ikebukero station, which is a major station - TIP: there are many exits, so take the one at the end of the platform marked 'Metropolitan Exit'. Ikebukero is a very busy area with lots of shops, restaurants etc. and is not a tourist area so you may struggle to be understood in English, but as I said, the Japanese are very helpful  friendly so just have a go at communicating and you'll get by (be brave, try speaking some Japanese - it's really appreciated!) - also, many restaurants have picture menus, so that helps!. Ikebukero is not right in the centre, although you can easily reach everywhere by the efficient train service.Tokyo tips:Be careful of the cyclists on the pavements(sidewalks).On escalators, stand on the left\/walk on the right (opposite to UK).Beware - taxi doors open automatically.In toilets, you may find heated seats (a surprise when you sit down!) and many buttons at the side - DO NOT PRESS ANY UNLESS YOU ARE SURE WHAT THEY DO!!!! ;-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0}]}
