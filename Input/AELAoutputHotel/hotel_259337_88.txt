{"text":"Great Resort for young families!! In the process of choosing the right resort for a family vacation, our biggest criteria was that it was accommodating to toddlers. Our little bambino is 21 months. We booked through transat vacations and we did not regret this decision at all. The flight (approx 4 hours) was great. Because the flight was not fully booked, the flight staff situated us with a 3rd seat and allowed our two year old to sleep almost all through the flight. The experience was the same when we returned home. We would definitley fly with Air Transat again. Overall, the resort was great. We were very well received. We notified them that we need a crib well in advance and we were situated right in the middle of the resort so that everything is easily accessible. Checking in went very smoothly. The only complaint with arriving was that we were hungry and we were unable to find a place to eat. There is no room service available. And finding your way around at 10 in the evening would have added to the fatigue of the trip. The resort is massive! 4 pools, 11 restaurants, and a long stretch of beach! Orientation is a must for valuable tips going around the grounds and all the services available.The food was great!! only complaint was that it was a bit on the salty and oily side. The food was great for adults but not neccesarily good or healthy for the kids. Recommend the lamb at the Arrecife restaurant for lunch. Each night has different themes. Spent the majority of the time in the buffet as the a la carte restaurants served the same food. There is a kiddie menu. So my son's diet consisted mostly of fries, fish and chicken nuggets.The pool was also great. They are mostly situated close to the eating area and each pool has a kiddie area.The beach is beautiful and is quite a long stretch. Although at this time, the waters were quite choppy and windy as the location is the meeting place of the caribbean sea and the atlantic ocean. At the end of the resort to the east is the flea market and Captain Cook's seafood restaurant.The resort has bazaars in each of the two main lobbies. You can buy souvenirs, clothing, rhum and coffee. Recommend staying in the resort to do your shopping as the prices in the flea markets were similar and the vendors were quite inflexible to negotiations.The resort also has a mini club where toddlers and young kids can spend their time. Their programs accommodate children that are 3 and over, but my son was able to use their playgrounds and toys under my supervision.Medical facilities were also excellent. My son got sick with bronchitis and the medical staff was immediatley available. The Hospital was 20 minutes away from the resort. Important to have medical insurance as it is costly.Overall, the experience was above average. Enjoyed the facilities and was very accommodating to young families. Staff was excellent. Food was great but needs to be less salty and oily.
