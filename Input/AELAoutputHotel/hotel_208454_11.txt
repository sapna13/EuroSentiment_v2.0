{"text":"Lovely hotel with european style, but lacking a certain something. Stayed here recently in one of the larger queen bed rooms. The location of the hotel was great, I had a view of the Chrysler Building out my window, and I was shocked at how quiet and restful it was inside my room. The room service food was delicious, but be warned: each time estimate they gave me (i.e. your breakfast will be there in 30 minutes, ma'am) was off by at least double. One time it took 1.5 hours to get a sandwich up, but at least they comped me. My two main complaints are: the towels and robes feel as scratchy as sandpaper and the lobby is blah. So, the towels. For a room that retails for over $2k a night (we got a better deal, but still), the towels were unbelievably scratchy, and shouldn't be. Worth noting, the bed was super comfortable and soft sheets, though the down comforter on top was very hot, and it was frustrating that there was no blanket on the bed as a lighter option. Second, the lobby. For a upscale NYC hotel, I would have hoped for more ambiance and action in the lobby, something more Ian Schraeger-esque. As another reviewer said, it's more like a very stylish pass-through. A missed opportunity on their part, I think. Overall, liked this hotel very much, perfect for an upscale business travel visit (as long as you're careful when you plan your room service calls before meetings) or fun trip to the city...
