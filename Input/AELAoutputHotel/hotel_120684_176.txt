{"text":"Not Too Impressed We just returned from a 9 night stay with our two teen sons. We had a great time and I must say that this hotel is probably the best one for teenagers who like to be in the center of all the action. We had an oceanfront room which was nice -- but hte walls are very thin! There was plenty of action and the hotel is convenient to everything as many others have noted. This is our third time to Waikiki -- the first two times we stayed at the Sheraton Moana Surfrider. When I return to Waikiki it will defintely be back to the Sheraton Moana Surfrider -- provided I can get a room in the newer section (deluxe tower).I thought the service at the Outrigger was just average and at sometimes below average. Definitely not a 4 star hotel. They best thing they have going is Dukes restaurant. There was really nothing special about this hotel. We even had visit from Security because a neighbor had complained about noise from our room. We were watching a funny movie and there was some laughing but nothing out of the ordinary. It was rather annoying to have this visit when the music from their bar downstairs kept us up late every night -- after 11:00pm. The pool area is very small and not enough chairs for everyone. And, they close off one of the pool sections at 3:00 so they can set up a happy hour with music, etc. and all of those who are sunbathing are told to leave. They will just pick your things up right off the chairs and set them in the mulch over the little balcony! If you want a beach umbrella and chairs, you have to be there at 7:00 before they open or you won't get one. And, the charge $40 some per day. Food is expensive. I noticed that many, many people who stayed here would go over to the mini market for reasonably priced sandwiches and many people went to ABC store to purhcase chairs\/umbrella. You could purhcase an umbrella and two chairs for the same price as a ONE day rental at Outrigger. They really nickel and dime you here. At the Sheraton Moana (next door) there is no charge for beach chairs and umbrella and you don't have to get up at 7:00 to get one either. Next time we go to Waikiki it will definitely be the Sheraton Moana. I would not stay here again. These are just a few of the negatives there were others.
