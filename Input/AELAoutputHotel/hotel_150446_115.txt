{"text":"Fantastic Getaway My husband and I just returned from a four day getaway and found the hotel to be nothing short of fantastic. From the moment our cab arrived at the hotel, the staff was extremely attentive and catered to our every need. We arrived at the hotel at 10 AM and check in was to be at 4pm, but our room was ready the second we arrived. 16th floor, ocean view, the most gorgeous sight of the pool area and behind that, the ocean. Our room was above our expectations..flat screen tv, new clean furniture, updated clean bathroom with a separate vanity area. The king sized bed was extremely comfortable. We went down for lunch at the outside cafe on the beach. We had a very nice meal with a very attentive and polite waitress.my husband had a burger and fries with a coke and I had a chicken quesadilla with an iced tea and the bill came to $30. We found the prices to be reasonable for a resort. After dinner that night we went to the lively lobby bar to have a drink. We then took a walk around the lush landscaped pool area and then down to the boardwalk by the ocean. ( very romantic) For the rest of the evening we went to the casino with many slot machines and various card tables. The casino is beautiful and the waiters\/ waitresses were extremely attentive.  The next morning we enjoyed an excellent buffet breakfast on the lower level of the hotel which had everything you could possibly want. (you can order ala carte as well) The waiter was attentive and catered to our every need.  Afterwards we visted Old San Juan. We toured the fort, which was a very interesting step back into the islands history. We then spent the rest of the day walking around town. There were charming old style restaurants and cafe as well as modern places such as Starbucks. There were outlets store for great shopping. The following day we relaxed by the pool and found there to be an ample amount of lounge chairs and cabanas with a good amount in the sun as well as the shade.  Every evening we were there, we went to the casino and walked around the grounds and overall we found this hotel to be one of the nicest we ever stayed at. The staff is polite, helpful and attentive. Whether you are looking for a place to just kick back and relax or to find some fun and excitement, the Intercontinental Hotel is the place to stay.
