{"text":"Terrible room, Cheap breakfast I was in SG for business trip Apr 16-25. I normally stayed at The Fullerton but my colleague recommended that the bathroom has spectacular view of SG skyline. So I decide to try The Ritz. The hotel itself is pretty old, as if it reached its top in the 90s and never rejuvenated thereafter. The room is spacious but the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was so wrong. The sofa and TV was laid in-line meaning that I had to turn my head 90 degree in order to watch it. Bedside table was so tiny and was occupied with some stuff i.e telephone, note pad and chucky lamb which didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ provide me enough light to read. Working table , again filled with bulky stuff like unusable lamp, hotel\/city guide. There are not enough outlets to charge my cell-phone, laptop and digital camera. I went into the bath room, of course the bathtub sits right next to the large window but I was recommended by the hotel staff to put the shade down as the near by buildings are infamous of peeping hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ guest. The toiletry was the worst I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever seen in the 6-stared hotel. It came in colorful \/ cheap packaging. I asked house keeping if they had other kinds of shampoo\/soap. The answer is no. So, I had to go out and bought my own relyable shampoo at Watson store. The shower was nothing but ordinary. The weighing scale was broken. The blanket was smelly, some kind of stir-fried food. It was my bad luck that the construction was next to my window. Even though I was on 26 fl. I was irritated by the rumbled machine at nite. This is not the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ false, but they should have warned me about this so I opted to stay on the other side or perhaps change the hotel. The breakfast stunned me most. Well, I have the Fullerton to compare to; especially they charge exactly the same price. The breakfast is cheap, they have the muesli with canned fruits and this is not acceptable. The pasty is noting special. All I have to say the service is superb though. The breakfast lunge looked a bit dim with weird d√ã√\u2022√ñcor especially the creepy green alien-liked installed on the wall. I have no sense of Art, perhaps. I stayed only 2 nites instead of 9 and I moved to the Fullerton. Seemed like The Fullerton had it all; I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to turn my neck to watch tv, I had enough space on my desk. The wash room is very nice with large round showerhead of rain-dome type. The toiletry was not that superb but better than the ritz. The pillow and blanket smelled good and comfy. The breakfast was superb where the freshly squeezed juice √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Ü available. I scraped the honey out of honeycomb. And above all, I could sit out side and enjoyed the view of the Boat Quey.I guess it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ enough about my comments. Only the service at the ritz is superb, everything else needs improvement though ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1916,"mention":"pasty","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasty"],"startOffset":1911},{"endOffset":1916,"mention":"pasty","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasty"],"startOffset":1911},{"endOffset":1916,"mention":"pasty","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasty"],"startOffset":1911},{"endOffset":1916,"mention":"pasty","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasty"],"startOffset":1911}]}
