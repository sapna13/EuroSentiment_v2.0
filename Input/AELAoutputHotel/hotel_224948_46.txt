{"text":"Great hotel in a great location We stayed at the Omni in July this year. It was our first trip to San Francisco, so we weren't sure of which area to stay in, but the Omni turned out to be perfectly located for us. It's in the Financial District, so it's quiet at night, but we felt perfectly safe walking there after dark. It's also on the cable-car line, within easy walking distance of Chinatown and the Ferry Building and if you don't mind walking a bit further, you can easily walk to the Union Square and Fisherman's Wharf areas from here. The hotel itself is lovely and the room was spacious, clean and comfortable. If I had to pick one thing to fault the room on, it would be the fixed-head shower. I didn't have a particular problem with it, but it was just ok - investing a little money in the shower would really bring it up to the standard of the rest of the accommodation. Staff at the Omni were very friendly and helpful, from check-in, where they offered to help us book any attractions we wanted to see, room service bending over backwards to make us happy when there was a slight problem with our order, the concierge recommending places to eat, right through to the doorman offering us the hotel car when we were leaving for the airport (at only $5 more than the taxi fare, this was a nice option). In addition, when we had an issue with the guests in the adjoining room holding an impromptu party late one night, hotel security dealt with it very quickly.We joined the Select Guest program online for free and this entitled us to complimentary tea, coffee, hot chocolate and juice every morning, as well as complimentary WiFi access and a daily newspaper. We ate breakfast twice in the hotel restaurant, which was somewhat expensive, but excellent quality and really tasty. There was complimentary fresh fruit (peaches, apricots, plums etc, not just standard apples) and juice or iced tea in the lobby every afternoon, which was nice when returning from sightseeing before going out to dinner. And the gym provided complimentary bottled water and apples and bananas too.Overall, we really enjoyed our stay here and will definitely return if we are ever in San Francisco again!
