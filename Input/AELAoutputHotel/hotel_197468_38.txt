{"text":"Fantastic Hotel-Great Location We just returned from Paris on June 23, 2007. Aside from Paris being a magnificent city, the Golden Tulip Opera de Noailles made our vacation even more so. The hotel is located on a side street in the Opera District which is so convenient to everything. Once you walk through the doors of this hotel you are amazed your in Paris. The hotel has a Zen Japenese feel, very modern and very charming. When I booked I requested a room with a private patio, we were told they could not guarantee this, but to our suprised we did get one of theseunbelieveable charming room. The room is small but wonderfullyplanned out with a large very modern bathroom, the private patiowe had was small but so charming it has a table and two chairswith jasmine trees and other foilage completely surrounding ourpatio. What a treat in the middle of Paris to wake up and have your breakfast surrounded by trees and birds on your private patio. The price of the room included a full breakfast which had everything from your typical french pastries to fruit, cheese, eggsmeats and so on. The staff went out of their way to help, with everything from suggesting fantastic restuarants to site seeing advise. The whole staff speaks fluent english which is very helpful. We already are planning our next trip there, because of the wonderful experience. We highly recommend this hotel toanyone seeking a quite refuge in this very busy city. We are from New York City and have travelled extensively, but this was quite a delightful surprise even for us.Renee  JackNew York City ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1053,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1045}]}
