{"text":"Great little Inn in San Francisco My husband and I stayed at the Castle Inn for our first trip to San Francisco. It was just what we were looking for. We didn't want to stay in the hustle and bustle of the Wharf and this was perfect. It was in a quiet neighborhood away from all the tourist areas. The room was not an upscale luxury room but clean and comfortable with a microwave and fridge\/freezer, after all we were there to see the sights and not spend all our time in a motel. Within walking distance is a Subway, donut shop, Escape from New York pizza, Peter D's (open for breakfast and lunch and has a great breakfast), Walgreens, Starbucks, a Tai restaurant, a local bar\/restaraunt (excellent hamburgers), and a small grocery. We felt safe walking to these places. We purchased a 7 day muni pass that gets you on any bus, cable car, bart, and f-market street car. The passes are 24.00 but well worth it. A one way trip on the cable car is 5.00 so the pass is the best way to go. Marshall, at the hotel desk, gave us a map of the bus routes and gave us information on where to go, how to get there and where not to go. We asked about some tours and Arlene called and made our reservations and we got a discount from the hotel booking for us. They were very helpful and we really appreaciated their information as this was our first trip.As for the breakfast, it was as advertised, a continental breakfast. It was perfect for someone in a hurry to get going in the morning. We took advantage of this our first morning but then went out for breakfast or purchased donuts around the corner to have in our room. We enjoyed our stay at the Castle Inn and would stay there again if we ever get to return to San Francisco.
