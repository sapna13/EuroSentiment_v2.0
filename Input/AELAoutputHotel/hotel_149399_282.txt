{"text":"resort was fantastic I just came back from a family and friends trip and after doing this trip for the past 9 years to different resorts and destinations, this was by far the best trip yet. The people were very friendly and extremely helpful. Most spoke english but it would help to know some spanish. The family suites which were closest to the beach were very convenient for us who are beach people. You are right near a great buffet and fun bar for drinks all day long. If you stay further away from the beach it can be inconvenient to have to wait for the shuttle to get to and from the beach. There is a shuttle to get you from the beach to the lobby\/restaurants which goes a round about way. If you walk it...it is a good mile walk. Great exercise after eating and drinking all day! The food at all the buffets was really good. For lunch, the pasta bar was a hit with all the kids. The international restaurants were wonderful, especially the Japanese and the Mexican. All the bars and lounges were spectacular! There must be 10,000 candles lit all around the property which was absolutely beautiful. The resort was so well manicured. They were always cleaning or re-doing something. The beach was wonderful, more than enough beach chairs so no need to get up early to grab one like you have to at some resorts. For honeymoon couples that want something more private and quiet the Royal Service rooms is the way to go. They have a private beach with large bed-like couches, a private bar, restaurant and pool. Butler service, 24 hour room service, turn down service, etc. etc!! Can't say enough about it!!!I have been a travel agent for 26 years and can't say enough about this property and the people that work there!
