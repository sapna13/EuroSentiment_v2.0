{"text":"Helpful staff, good location We booked this hotel for a weekend stay in San Juan. It is located on Calle Magdalena, which runs parallel to the main avenue, Calle Ashford. It's therefore close to all of the restaurants, bars, clubs, etc., but still quiet.There are about four to six parking spots available in front of the hotel, depending on how well the cars are squeezed together. There is street parking on side streets if you are up for looking, but you'll do yourself a favor by having a compact car. Parking rules in the area are marked, though sparingly, and since many people park illegally, you can't pick spots based on where others have parked.The hotel entrance is controlled by an electronic latch, so you must buzz in to enter. The front desk is staffed 24 hours, giving additional security. The staff was incredibly helpful and spoke both English and Spanish fluently.Hotel rooms are arranged around a small courtyard. We stayed in a Corporate Executive Queen. There was also a night table, dresser, TV, armoire, small fridge, microwave, and kitchenette sink. The bathroom also had a bath tub with jets. There was an internet router with a wired connection available, though we did not use it. The air conditioner and fan were powerful enough to get it cold (actually chilly).The continental breakfast was great, with yogurt, cinnamon and apple loaves, hamm, cheese, croissants, tea, and of course coffee. There is also a small in-ground pool on the property, though it could get crowded fairly quickly. The in-room fridge is stocked with water and soda for $1 each and beer for $2 each, which is only slightly more expensive than the same items at the Walgreen's right around the corner, but much cheaper than buying from vendors on the beach.The hotel is located in the Condado\/Santurce area of San Juan, close to many restaurants and amenities. The beach is also only five minutes by foot, though we walked east a bit to find a less rocky portion.As another reviewer mentioned, the taxes add quite a bit to the published rate, but this is a result of local laws, not the hotel or the booking agency. On the whole, we had a good time at the hotel, and it served as a relaxing place to come back to every night. Our only complaint was that checkout time was at 11 a.m. instead of the usual noon.
