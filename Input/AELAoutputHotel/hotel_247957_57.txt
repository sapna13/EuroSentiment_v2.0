{"text":"best time of my life!!!! I personally do not understand how anyone can NOT enjoy this place. I went the week of Aug 22-Aug 31 2008. Let me tell you, you will WANT to stay at that resort. I went with a friend of mine ( just two of us girls ) and had the time of our life. We went there with Air Transit and stayed at the perimum club. I suggest you all go with air tranist because they will book ur a la carte restaurant for you also bring fresh towels to your room everyday for the beach, on top of that you get a free bottle of rum which is nice.Upon arrival, the bell boys helped us bring our luggage down and placed on the side while we checked in ( the process was really quick ) and then as soon as we got our keys, they drove us to our room to settle in. I read a few reviews regarding the check in time being slow n' all..honestly ppl..you are on freaking vacation..if the check in takes long..why don't u goto the bar and grab a coco loco hahaha...seriously u didnt go on vacation to stay in ur hotel room did you??? haha..Anyways...aside from the amazing beach..i would highly sugguest the nightly entertainment ay the main stage, me n' my friend didn't miss one. They will start the nite off around 730 or 8pm with entertainment for the kids, then come around 9pm...the animation team will start games with the adults which is REALLY entertaining..then around 945pm they will start the offical show ( which is ALWAYS good). The animation guys are sooo friendly and they know everyone by name so make sure you talk to them and hang out with them. There is one that look EXACTLY like Jamie foxx..that guy is soo funny and there is this really short guy name Erik who always goes ' I LOVE MY JOB' hahaha he is soo funny as well. The food there was okay.....make sure you tried the pizzeria and taco upstairs near the mainstage, it opens all nite till 6am so if u get hungry u can always go there. The buffet is not that great you will pretty much get sick of it by the third day, the a la carte resturants were not too bad, the Mexico one is pretty good acutally they serve a huge piece of rib eye steak. If you enjoy clubbing...you are in luck because the best club in Punta Cana is in our resort..its call Mangu and its soooooooooooooooo fun!!!!!! The only down side is that the drink is not free there so what you can do is drink at the lobby till 1am until the bar close then head to Mangu...the bartenders are really nice upstair at the techno room and pretty much gave me n' my friend free drinks all night haha. Mangu was definitely a happening place ( you can expect all of the younger people there every night ), great place to meet ppl and me n'my friend was there for 5 nights ( and we stayed 10 days there).The excursions were really good as well, we went on two. One is call Marinarium, this one allows you to swim with the sharks n' stingrays ( was acutally kinda boring ), party on the boat ( was really fun, funny host) and takes you to a natural pool in the middle of the ocean where the water comes up to ur chest ( amazing for swimming ). I went to another one call the Bavaro Runner..this was a pretty cool experience cuz u get to do alots of things, you can go horseback ridding, goto a hand made cigar places to learn how to make cigars, check out the farming places, goto a local school and visit a local's home. They will also take you around the moutain area in a jeep. Overall amazing experience with a really funny host name Mimi haha. What can I say. This place is soo amazing..I can't even say anything bad. Honestly..go there..have fun and bring a open mind. :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":332,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":328},{"endOffset":1796,"mention":"pizzeria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1788},{"endOffset":1805,"mention":"taco","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Taco"],"startOffset":1801},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2169},{"endOffset":2433,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2429}]}
