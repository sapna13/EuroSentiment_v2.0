{"text":"It was nice... My husband and I stayed at the Sonesta as part of a wedding room block. Since this was a first time in Coconut Grove (visited South Beach the year prior) we did not know what to expect. At first glance at check in the hotel is quite lovely and the staff are very friendly. Once we arrived in our room which was a bay view we were quite surprised by the size. Our room was rather small. The bathroom itself seemed larger than the bedroom area. And after much searching, we realized the room had no closet just a large dresser to hang your clothes. We decided to rent a car but the proximity of local spots was walking distance... i.e. Cheesecake Factory, Johnny Rockets, Hooters, CVS, etc... If you do rent a car do not utilize the valet parking at $18 a day there is a public lot right next door for about $3 a day ... but on the weekend there is a $6 flat fee for the bar hoppers. And if you do not know, Coconut Grove is a very posh city...every other car we saw had to be a Hummer and\/or Range Rover...Since we were there with the rest of the bridal party... we did get a chance to see the 1BR suite and that was quite larger with a full kitchen and nice size living room. Because hubby  I are more beach bums... we felt we got more for our money on South Beach and do not see ourselves returning anytime soon to Coconut Grove.
