{"text":"**Please read- You will thank us...** ***** Please read this if you are travelling soon...*******we stayed at this hotel June 6th until the 10th. A few notes on this hotel.-it is good walking distance to the sights.-it has breakfast included, and rates are reasonable-the morning staff at counter (females) are very nice-breakfast is simple yet nice.also nice breakfast room.*** our downside experiences*** PLEASE READ*****there is construction going on both in the lobby, and ESPECIALLY on the building next door. this started at 7:30 am, so expect to get up early!!, also if you are staying in one of the rooms on the side the scafolding goes up past your window, so unless you want someone climbing into your room, keep your window closed!!!** no air conditioning, and I wouldn't advise to keep your windows open** our veranda was nice, but there were left over booze bottles and cigarettes from previous people, and the tiles don't cover the whole porch and are a tripping hazard, it looked unfinished.** the evening staff are young and useless. we asked for car rental info, they told us they closed at 6pm (both in the area and at the airport-or so we were told) and made no effort to help- I got on the internet and found an Avis ( two min walk away) open until 8pm and found out the airport had car rentals open until 11pm, shoud they not have known this????**** we had our car parked RIGHT OUTSIDE the front doors of the hotel, and went in for 10 minutes to have the front desk check on an address for us, and OUR CAR GOT BROKEN INTO. A side window was broken and our camera and equipment which was in the trunk and out of view were gone. We spent the last day in a police station filling out reports and getting replacement cars.*** My advice -- remember, you get what you pay for. At this hotel they have 1 or 2 staff members on a good day taking care of requests, and most often you have to push to get help with something. I found they were not well informed and felt it was very much like a self service experience. My advise, if you can afford it spend the money on a better hotel, possibly with a doorman that can add extra piece of mind. ( by the way, after they broke into our car, I noticed that there was a hostel on the same street.... go figure.Also, if you are renting a car, get full insurance. our deductable for that little window wa $30 euro. it would have been 200+ without. and parking outside the hotel is 3.60 euro per hour... food for thought.... have a great trip everyone!!!
