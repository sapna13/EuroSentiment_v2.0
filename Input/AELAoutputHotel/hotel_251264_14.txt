{"text":"Outstanding What a stay! It was awesome! The staff treated my family like royalty. Every staff member that we came across had a smile on their face. We had a large family of 75 that was attending a wedding and had free time on our hands, the front desk staff offered suggestions of places to go to and local events in the area. Truly we felt great about the choice that we made for the wedding. Weddings are stressful however, the manager Frankie Diaz made sure that all of our needs were well met. He truly cared about our function and was at the property from morning to night taken time to greet customers, giving direction to the staff and taking care of setting up different functions. He always gave us time to chat with him and we never felt rushed even though we could see that he was very busy. Frankie addressed all my concerns with the location of my rooms, down to the food for our wedding. My wife√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ family is very meticulous and was completely impressed with the hotel. As we mentioned prior that this location had many events taking place during the time we stayed and they were well handled, the Hotel Manager Frankie Diaz is a lead example of why the staff offers outstanding customer services.Our family was very happy with the cleanliness of the hotel and the overall service that we received. El Palacio is not a well, recognized brand however, living locally I heard that this property had changed of the past 2 √à√¥√ú years and I chose to tour it and take the chance and it shows that this property has made great strides to perfection. I have small meetings from time to time and will keep Frankie on speed dial for the future. ","annotations":[]}
