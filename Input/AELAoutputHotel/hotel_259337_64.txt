{"text":"Best of the Best We were thereApril 2 thru April 16 and it was the best resort we had stayed in and we travel alot. All the good things that people write are all true.We were in room1033 which we loved as it was near the lobby pool and beachand a ground floor.The rooms are very private and quiet and a nice place to sit out.we had a junoir suite which is very roomy. We spent alot of time at the pool and walked the beach every day.You can walk for mileson white clean sand and the water is warm and that's a treat for us here in the northern part of the country. The bars and food along the beach are very safe and it was a change to go there and talk to the locals.The language is a little problem but we knew that when we booked we met wonderful folks from all over. We did 2 tours OUTBACK SAFARI and we loved it and Saona Island take it or leave it do not reccomend. The food is excellent and the wine and drinks great.There pizza is yummy and the steak house great. We are people that try all food and not fussy at all and it was above average. Once you go off the resort to the right there is a town and the shopping is great at the plazza .We are walkers so we walked every where. All in all this place was a place I would return to.
