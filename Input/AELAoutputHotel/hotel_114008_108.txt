{"text":"Very Nice, a Bit Overpriced We stayed at the Kahala back when it was Oriental Mandarin property in March of 2006.The hotel is very lovely and in a great location. It's close enough that you can take a cab or even bike (they provide bikes) to Waikiki but you are also far away from all the noise and tourists that tend to be in Waikiki.The hotel offers complementary shuttle service to certain areas downtown and to the local malls, if you are interested in those. They do charge a rather high fee each day to keep a car parked on the grounds. What we did was rent a car from the hotel agents just for a day to avoid having to keep one in the lot and pay fees each day. I believe it was 22.00 a day otherwise.When you arrive you are greeted with leis and given a tour of the property. Room check in is very strict so you can't actually get in early. However, they will give you keys to their little Chi center. This is where you can change for the pools or ocean, relax in the sauna and use their showers or excercise equipment. You can watch the dolphins do their show for free or pay a fee to swim with them yourselves. The hotel offers snorkle gear and surf lessons.But beware, if you are even a little late returning it you get socked with a hefty fine. The rooms are very lovely and spacious. We had a corner room which gave us views of the ocean and the mountains. The restaurants on property was very good. Every day we started with the breakfast buffett at the Plumeria Beach House. We also had their lunch buffett and menu items a few times. Casual and right near the beach. You can also order sandwiches and drinks by the pool. As long as you are checked in you can charge your food to your room. At night we would hang out at the Veranda and have drinks outside enjoying the breeze. We also had dinner at Hoku's one night, everything was very good. The staff is very attentive. The only downside to staying here were the prices. There are a few stores inside, but the prices are ridiculous. You're better off taking the shuttle to Waikiki if you want souveniers or suntan lotion. Little things like if you keep the snorkle masks out longer than 30 minutes cost us nearly 25.00 in late charges. We also found the parking fees to be ridiculous. Another thing, that is no fault of the hotel, is that many of the other guests are rather snobby. They are rude and patronizing to both the staff and other guests.
