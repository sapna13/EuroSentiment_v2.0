{"text":"A wonderful hotel! We stayed here for 2 nights before leaving on a 12-night cruise. After looking at the website, we learned it was part of the Select Hotels Group, and they gave special rates and amenities for members of its iPrefer club. It's free to join iPrefer and the hotel has a link to the iPrefer site.The hotel is clean, classy and all the staff were personable. As a result of being iPrefer members, we were upgraded to a suite. It was huge - living room, bedroom and a large bathroom with a separate shower, plus a free bottle of wine. The hotel itself is in a great location. I'm glad we didn't book a hotel near Las Ramblas because it's busy and congested. Fira Palace is near Montjuic and is a 5-minute walk to the nearest Barcelona Bus Turistic stop which is a hop-on\/hop-off double decker bus. It's a great way to see all parts of the city and then you can decide on where to spend more time later. The hotel's restaurants are very good. We had the breakfast buffet. It was 16 euros and well worth the price. It had hot and cold cereals, eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, tortilla espanola (Spanish potato and onion omelet\/fritatta), fresh fruit, yogurt, etc. It was enough that we didn't feel the need to eat lunch. The El Mall restaurant is open for dinner, but a little pricey. There are loads of other restaurants in the area that are good and well-priced.We will definitely book a room here the next time we're in Barcelona.
