{"text":"Not a good hotel for families with young children Our overall experience was very positive, I must say, even though it is not the most friendly hotel for families with young children.The hotel location is priviledged - next to Paseo de Gracia, Las Ramblas, the port. The breakfast is superb - very varied and delicious (although the tortillas de patata were frozen!). The rooms are clean and comfortable and the shower is good.The negative points are the parking - very badly designed, difficult to manouver. The room service doesn't work 24 hours - actually it is very inefficient. Some staff are very unfriendly - mainly the ladies at the bar\/restaurant and breakfast. On the other hand Javier, Esther and Gabriel are very helpful and sweet. The staff is not well prepared to give recommendations e.g. for places to eat. I was looking for a vegetarian or organic restaurant to get something healthy for my 16-month-old daughter to eat (it is very difficult to find non-fried food in Spain or boiled vegetables, for example) and was recommended a chain called Fresc Co but Javier really tried hard to find more restaurants but the thing is that it seems they are not familiarized with the concept of healthy food, which people working in the tourism industry should be. As a personal tip, f you're really hungry at 3am in Barcelona, I recommend you try Bagoa at Plaza Doctor Letamendi (not far from the hotel) and their jamon canario, delicious! La Bodegeta, suggested by the hotel, closes at 1:30am.Finally, my impression from the hotel was that it was renovated recently but it was only a facade renovation - you can see the furniture in the rooms is old, for example.
