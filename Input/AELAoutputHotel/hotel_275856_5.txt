{"text":"Location, spacious, elegant -- worth it! Overall, a truly excellent experience and worth the price (indeed, we could not have gotten rooms like this for the money in any of the high-end Florence hotels, yet we felt surrounded by elegance here). We had asked for the fresco room, but apparently it had been given to someone else, and we were put in a room on the main level. We had a large bedroom, as well as a good sized living room with sofa bed, and a nice bathroom (athough the shower stall leaked and the hair dryer had some issues). The ceilings were perhaps 15 feet. It was spacious and gracious -- we never missed the fresco (although perhaps they ought not to promise it if they aren't going to keep the promise). The location is utterly fantastic (unless you want to be on the river). Not even half a block from the duomo, yet everything is quiet inside the palazzo. Breakfast was great -- a good range of things, many of them very yummy, and all in the sitting room with its painted walls and more high ceilings. What a great place to come back to after a day playing tourist in the heat of a Florence summer. We were happy not to be in a hotel with lots of people after spending most of the day in crowds. The people at the desk were pleasant, but we were not thrilled with the restaurant recommendations (still, our experience was that it is actually somewhat difficult to find very good food in Florence at less than expensive restaurants unless you really do your homework or have a friend in the know -- but for a great traditional and inexpensive lunch try Mario's in the central market area and for a great traditional Florentine dinner, try Sostanza).
