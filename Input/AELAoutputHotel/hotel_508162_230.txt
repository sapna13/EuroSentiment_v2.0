{"text":"Amazing - Americans are NEVER happy I went to Dreams Punta Cana in June for my Honeymoon and we stayed for 2 weeks. I cannot honestly believe that people can give this place bad reviews! I will subtitle this review to make sure I miss nothing.The Pool and daytime entertainment--- Amazing! We always got great loungers no matter how late in the morning we got up. The Pool was cleaned ALL the time! There were always staff around to make sure it was really clean.IT WAS SO CLEAN THAT MY ENGAGEMENT RING FLEW OFF MY FINGER, WE FOUND IT IN 5 MINS THANKS TO THE PERFECT CLEARNESS OF THE POOL.The staff around the pool were really good (the bar staff not so much but oh well) and the entertainment was excellent! (50 cent, Usher and Stephanie in particular) Daytime activities galore both in the core zone, the beach and all along the lenght of the pool.The BeachI am scared of the sea so I cannot write a review fairly. My husband did cut his toe on some coral though.The Food and RestaurantsReally really good! Not repetative at all and an amazing choice. They were laying a new floor in the oceana restaurant, but they did not let this disrump anything as they simply alternated oceana and the seaside grill so people could still go to both. Very considerate.The japanese and chinese was my favourite and we had a fabulour waiter called LELI :DThe ConciergeReally good at sorting out all problems quicly and efficiently and they all speak really good english (this is throughout the hotel) - also excellent with card tricksAmericansDon't hate.... but they ALL moan too much! The good thing about this is that it brings the british holiday makers closer together, because we can have a good moan at how much the Americans moan lol.--- They think if they leave the big tip at the start, they will always get served first.Try relaxiing and making some friends!--------------- ps... This is not relevant to all americans as there was some lovely ones. In fact... everyone from Utah was really nice lolGood branded drinks, 24hour room service, nicely cleaned rooms, entertainment excellent!!! bingo bongo bongo bingo ba da da da da, cheep cheep!Ok, thats it....Victoria and Chris Horn(A.K.A - Chris the Loser 2, and Tricky Dicky Vicki)xxx ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1282,"mention":"chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1275},{"endOffset":1992,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1988}]}
