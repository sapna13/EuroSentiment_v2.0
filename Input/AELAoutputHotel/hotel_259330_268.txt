{"text":"Great Potential, But Overall I'd Say Just OK. OK... Where do I begin?Overall I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° say the facility is fabulous. I loved the whole Caribbean feel the resort had. The colors, and the ambiance were incredible, but then again who wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ love staying on a pristine beach surrounded by crystal blue waters?This was our first trek in the All-Inclusive world, and I will say that we WILL do All-Inclusive again. While we MAY visit Punta Cana again, we WILL NOT return to this resort. Why, you ask? Because of employee theft. I had made a conscious effort to be aware of what was going on around me thanks to some reviews that I read prior to leaving. However, during check-in (we rented 2 rooms) I was with the receptionist (which was very nice and accommodating, by the way) while my mother-in-law was watching the bags and my 4 year old son, who was sitting on a couch in the lobby playing his Game-Boy. My mother-in-law was summoned up to the desk to sign for her room so I turned from facing the receptionist and faced the bags and my son (but still stood at the desk). Soon afterward, my son got up from the couch and ran over to us and I turned away from the bags, glancing back at them every few seconds. 1 or 2 minutes later my son returned to the couch with my mother-in-law and immediately asked for his Game-Boy which he had inadvertently left on the couch. It was gone; never to be seen again. The funny thing is that there was nobody in the lobby other than us, the bell-boys, and the reception staff. He cried and screamed for his game-boy and nobody did or said one single thing. Now I know that I cannot prove that it was an employee that stole it, however I know it was because there was nobody else around.If I, as an adult, left something like that unattended, shame on me; I probably deserve to have it taken. But this is a 4 year old boy, who does not know the difference. He just cried, and cried. I felt so bad but could do nothing about it. This put a damper on the whole vacation, and we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even there 10 minutes.When we complained to guest services, they said that they would investigate, but we never heard from them again. At checkout, I spoke to the hotel manager and asked him it they had a game-boy in lost and found, to which he replied no so I proceeded to tell him the story. He was visibly upset and stormed over toward guest services (I never seen him again either).PROs:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√òncredible beach √à√\u2020\u2022?say no more√à√\u2020\u2022?This alone is worth the every penny of the trip√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?arge pools √à√\u2020\u2022?with activities (volleyball, water polo, basketball, aerobics, etc√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬©lean rooms (I did not see any bugs in either of the 2 rooms we rented)√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?rounds were well manicured√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?ost of the worker√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ attitudes √à√\u2020\u2022?Dominicans, I found, are really nice people.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?hows √à√\u2020\u2022?a good variety√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬±ids Club √à√\u2020\u2022?they watch the kids and have fun with them at no additional charge!√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?lenty of food and alcohol (though all local stuff)√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?rofessional photographers on staff √à√\u2020\u2022?Phenomenal photo sessions, very reasonably priced photos.CONs:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?ome of the worker√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ attitudes (Especially in the WAAAAAY overpriced gift-shop √à√\u2020\u2022?VERY, VERY RUDE)√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?AAAAAY overpriced gift-shop √à√\u2020\u2022?Do not forget anything at home or you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l pay through the nose.
