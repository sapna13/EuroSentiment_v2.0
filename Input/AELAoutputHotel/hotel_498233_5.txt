{"text":"Best Over All Hotel in 15 Years of Attending Jazz Fest I have stayed in hotels in Metairie, Kenner, the French Quarter, the Warehouse District, the Garden District, on Canal and on Bourbon Street and even in LaPlace one year when I waited too long to make reservations--you name it. Country Inn is a safe place for a single female traveler that doesn't cost $400 a night during Jazz Fest. New Orleans is not a safe place for a single female walking alone, and this hotel is near enough Canal Street that even at night and with the other tourists coming and going to the hotels in the area of this one, a single female is safe going out to dinner after dark. There has been many a night when I got a bargain room in NO but was terrified to leave it alone after dark--ordered pizza in. The hotel is new--none of the mold\/mildew problems you see in some of the older, more expensive hotels. The breakfast is ok with me. They have fresh fruit, bagels, and coffee, along with the waffles, so I was happy. The staff is friendly. The bartender was a great guy. I never one time felt afraid, and I have seen people mugged right in front of me when exiting other hotels in NO, so I know of what I speak. The Jazz Festival is absolutely addictive--every year of the 15 I have gone I have never once been disappointed. This is a great city with great food and great people--just pay attention and stay safe.
