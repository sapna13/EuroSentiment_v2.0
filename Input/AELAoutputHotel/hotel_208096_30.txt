{"text":"Perfect Location for First-timer in Paris! I stayed at the Studio of this apart'hotel from 11-16 Mar. The room is spacious with sufficient lightings, power plugs are well placed for charging mobile phone  camera, the mattress is comfortable (with sufficient back support), the water pressure for shower is great, the kitchenette is well equipped, the knives are sharp, the plates  bowls are clean. Dishwashing sponge is provided, but not the dishwashing liquid.The location of this apart'hotel is really great for first-time visit to Paris. Bus no. 24 from Gare de Lyon stops right infront of this apart'hotel. This same bus stop also has no. 27 that takes you to Auber bus stop where the bus stop for Roissybus is just around the corner to take you to CDG airport. This mode of transport is highly recommended as you just need to carry your luggage up  down the bus once instead of the many flight of stairs at the metro stations.St Michel  Pont Neuf metro stations are also within reach for travelling around  out of Paris.Attractions like Notre Dame, Musee d'Orsay, Lourve are within walking distance. Same for the River Cruise, which is just at the tip of Pont Neuf. Eiffel Tower  Arc de Triomphe are not within walking distance but if you do not mind the distance, the walks are quite pleasant.Supermarket, bakery  butchery are behind the apart'hotel a few buildings away. I suppose it is a common question that the counter staff has the map ready when you pop the question where is the nearest supermarche?If cooking is not preferred, there are plenty of eateries around St Michel metro station or around Notre Dame.If you are a chocolate lovers, you can find at least 3 shops on your way to the supermarket.To sum it all, I did not regret choosing Citadines St Germain as the base for my first visit to Paris.
