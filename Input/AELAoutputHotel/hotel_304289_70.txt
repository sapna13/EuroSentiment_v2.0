{"text":"I could live here! We stayed in the Hilton Tokyo for 5 nights and we were so impressed. We are HHonors Gold Members and have stayed in many Hiltons but this one comes top of the list. Ther hotel was full for the first 2 nights so we were not given our complimentary upgrade but the room was fine, in need of an upgrade but this is to happen soon. On Saturday we went out for the day and returned to find we had been upgraded to the 36th Executive Floor (3rd from the top) and the room was fantastic! Refurbishment was completed in September and the rooms are modern, well designed and the shower is one of the best I've ever used. The attention to detail is great and there are extras like a pillow menu, pajamas and robes which make the stay more enjoyable. The Executive Lounge and service are top class.The breakfast is the best breakfast ever - so much choice and so delicious! It was the perfect way to start the day. The other meals we ate in the hotel both by room service and in the restaurants were wonderful - try the Singapore Noodles on the Room Service Menu!The service was of course wonderful, the staff couldn't be more helpful. Another bonus was the frequent shuttle bus which went to nearby Shinjuku Station which is a great hub for travel. The hotel is slightly off centre in Tokyo but you can get anywhere you need to within 10 or 15 mins on the JR or Metro (there is a Metro Station on the Red M Line connected to the hotel).We loved Tokyo and we loved this hotel.
