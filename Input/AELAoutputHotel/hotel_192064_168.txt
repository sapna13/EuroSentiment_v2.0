{"text":"Great service and lovely hotel My partner and I were having a night out in London and decided to book into a nice hotel for the night (even though we live in London). Booked a room at the Chesterfield via their website which seemed to give the best prices. Booked a Superior room as there was not much difference between that and a standard room. At the weekend full english breakfast was included.The Chesterfield is in Mayfair on a lovely quiet street - yet moments away from Bond Street, Park Lane etc. As soon as you arrive the service is great. Doorman opens the door and you are greeted by the freindly reception and concierge staff. Special thanks to one of the recpetionists Cindy who was charming. We were informed that we had been upgraded to a suite and checked in and were taken up to our suite. It was fantastic a separate living room with TV and then a large bedroom and huge bathroom. The Chesterfield is a traditional english hotel in that the furniture is mainly antique but it has been decorated in a very stylish way. We had a call shortly afterwards to check the room was OK and we had everything we needed. We ordered afternoon tea in the lounge of our suite and felt thoroughly spoilt!Returning back to the hotel at night it is in a safe area and it was very quiet so a good night's sleep. Breakfast was served in the restuarant with an a'la carte english breakfast to order form as well as a buffet continental breakfast.Overall a lovely experience in a grand old hotel in Mayfair and we had only paid just over √ä√£¬¢150 for this so well worth it. Definitely a good hotel. Upgrading to a Superior room would seem well worth it.
