{"text":"Fabulous Pan Pacific We stayed here for 5 nights in January and February on our journey to and from Oz. I could not fault this hotel on anything.The location is great sitting on top of the Marina Square complex which is excellent for dining and shopping. A short walk and you are at the MRT and City link centre. Walk in the other direction and you are at the Suntec Centre.The staff are fantastic. Extremely polite, friendly and helpful. Stop for a moment and someone is sure to approach you and ask if they can help. Check in and out was fast and efficient. Walk outside for a taxi and one was summoned. The rooms, as was the rest of the hotel , are maintained in immaculate state. I loved the large LCD TV tastefully wall mounted and all the sports channels. Almost all the entire outside wall is glass and you can lie in bed and operate(play with) the remote which mechanically brings down the window screen and then a Roman Blind.The views from the room over the city and river were also spectacular. Worth mentioning is the pool and sun bathing area which was great. Very spacious and I spent more time here than any other hotel pool in Singapore. In the heat of the afternoon staff come around with cool towels ,fruit and free bottles of ice cool water. Free water is also provided in the room.The only thing I found missing from the hotel which could inhibit long term tourist travellers from booking was the lack of a guest laundry.Although some may find it expensive the top floor Cantonese restaurant is worth a visit for something special. Although I did not use all of the dining options other guests recommended them and there was a good price spread over these.All in all if I could put this hotel in my case I would and take it to all my destinations around the world.
