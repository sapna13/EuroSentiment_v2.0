{"text":"Terrific Family Getaway in the Sun We just returned from a 5 night trip to the Biltmore. I was travelling with my husband and 2 year old daughter. We love historic properties with interesting touches (in other words we were boutique hotel fans in our pre-baby days); after a bit of research looking at other high end hotels in the area, we chose the Biltmore because it seemed to have the right balance of character with kid-friendly amenities. We were very happy with our decision.If you look on the Biltmore's website, there are a number of different kinds of rooms you can book. They range from the classic to resort rooms to suites, with a range of prices. In light of having a rambunctious 2 year old we ponied up for a resort room. The room was $470 per night (about $120 per night more than a standard classic room), but it was huge, located right off the paradise pool, and featured a large walk-out patio that was surrounded by hedges and was very private. It was definitely worth the premium. The layout of the hotel is several buildings, most only 2-3 stories tall, so unlike a lot of high rise McMansion type resorts, there is no waiting for the elevator. The grounds are spacious, immaculately kept, and teeming with interesting touches like tiny fountains and waterfalls that are nestled into every nook and cranny. Perfect for a tiny rock collector, our daughter spent lots of time outdoors inspecting the various scenery. My only complaint was that housekeeping was quite late in the day (between 2 and 4pm most days). We liked that the hotel had separate offerings for adults and families. There are pools, restaurants, and public areas specifically for adults, and ones specifically for families. There was a large, canopy-covered playground we took our daughter to each morning, and we spent each afternoon at the paradise pool (one of 3 pools specifically for families). We loved the water slide and the art deco details in the pool area. I would have preferred a zero entry pool, but in light of the age of the pool and hotel I was OK with it. It was a very shallow, wide stepped entrance and my daughter could sit and splash for hours. We ate poolside most days and food was good and reasonably priced ($5.25 for a gourmet PBJ with fries, $12 for a shrimp salad). The cocktails were good and strong, too. We ordered room service several times, and found it to be a good option--not the most delicious food I've ever eaten--but again it was reasonably priced and quite good (imagine similar fare to the California Pizza Kitchen). One night we did go off property to a local Cuban restaurant, Cafe Havana on Camelback road, which was delicious with a huge menu of options. I had a pedicure and hot stone massage at the spa, and the services were good, in line with other high end hotels I've stayed in. In summary, we had a terrific time at the Biltmore and plan to return next year. I would recommend it highly to families that enjoy staying in unique, historic properties.
