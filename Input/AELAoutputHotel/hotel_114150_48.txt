{"text":"A gem...an absolute gem I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Despite all of the negative posts it turned out to be a delightful place. I am not sure why everyone is so fussy about the somewhat outdated rooms, they were clean and unique and the location could not be beat. I do not like staying in chain hotels...they are boring and very antiseptic. While here, the staff was over the top friendly and professional. I felt safe as a woman alone and my room was so funky cool. No, it is not the Marriott or Hilton...THANK GOODNESS Any problems were quickly handled and they were minor. I made my way around town from the hotel and found it to be the best of locations. Others attending the BIO convention complained about their hotels...some four star and yet mine was perfect. The one's who complained...perhaps it makes them feel better...a bit of snobbery? For there certainly seemed to be a lot of rather wealthy folks staying at the hotel, if one could judge by the mercedes and bentleys parked in the drive and the manner of dress. I think if you like personal attention and a more european atmosphere, then this is your spot. If you like McDonalds and the same thing you have at home...then perhaps not. Thank you all who made my stay so nice. I was so nervous about the negative reviews I even emailed the corporate headquarters with my fears...they answered as did the hotel mgr within 24 hours...that set the tone for the entire trip. Never promised me anything except a nice stay and that is what I got. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1488,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1484}]}
