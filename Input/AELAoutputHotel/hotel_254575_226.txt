{"text":"A Real Find in London We stayed at the Luna  Simone for a weekend recently based on the reviews here. We were delighted to find out how nice the street it's on is - we felt very safe at night. Pimlico as a nice residential area which has tons of great places to eat and drink - we had breakfast at Grumbles (or Mumbles or something) every morning (nice big breakfast menu) and had drinks in a charming pub called The Page which was light and airy and had a fantastic Thai menu. We preferred a quieter area, as London can be quite manic in some neighbourhoods. The hotel itself is owned by Peter  Bernard, and two nicer lads you'll never meet. We asked for a quiet room and that's exactly what we got - at the back all you could hear were birds. The room was teeny tiny - we burst out laughing when we saw it! But it only took a second to see that it was spotless and had everything we needed. The bathroom wasn't as small as we feared based on the size of the bedroom and my God, you could have eaten your dinner off the surfaces in there! London was in the grip of a heatwave and thankfully there was a massive fan affixed above the headboard of the bed, so that was much appreciated. Complaints: well, not much really, but I suppose breakfast ending at 8.30am is a pain - we simply didn't wake up for it in time once, even though it was included in the price. And you don't get any toiletries other than soap, but I didn't really care about that much as long as the towels were plentiful and fresh every day. Oh yeah, the hairdryer was rubbish, so bring your own if you need one. And the whitener instead of milk was yukky, but in fairness at least there was a kettle in the room, which you don't often get at this level. The best thing was how near Victoria station is - from there you can get to absolutely everywhere so that was unbeatable.
