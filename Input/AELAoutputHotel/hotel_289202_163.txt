{"text":"An excellent hotel located on Grand Canal We booked this hotel after reading reviews on Tripadvisor and we werenot disappointed. The assistant manager, Gianni, was very helpful throughout our short stay.I am not going to repeat all of the great comments but add some that we found very helpful on our visit.We arrived in the dark and after settling in Gianni directed us to a lovely, local restaurant, very close to the hotel, where we were able to eat (shuts at 11pm).Our booking did not include breakfast but because we had booked through expedia breafast was only 5 Euros instead of the normal 15 Euros. There was ample to eat:- cereals, yoghurts, cheese, ham, boiled eggs etc. Coffee was from a machine but it was fine. The hotelalso runs a free water taxi to and from the island of Murano where you can visit the glass factory.Our room did not have a canal view but we were shown rooms that did have this view. Nothing was too much trouble for the staff and they spoke excellent English.This is information that I found extremely helpful when arriving in Venice.1. After picking up your luggage turn left in Airport entrance and buy a 30Euro 3 day pass for the water buses (vaperetto) and the airport bus. This pays for itself after day 1.2. This info was given to me by another trip advisor member but it was so handy. Take the number 5 bus from the airport to the Piazzale Roma (the main bus station). This takes about 25 minutes, runs every half hour and the 3 day pass covers the fare. Stamp your ticket in the orange box when you get on the bus. When you get off the bus, go straight ahead, down the steps towards the canal. Turn left, cross the bridge, turn left and then cross another bridge. The hotel is now only a short walk away. 3. If you have a short stay ,use a day to visit the islands in the lagoon. The hotel taxi service will take you to Murano, then you can use your 3 day pass to go to Burano. This is a must. A beautiful island which makes lace. The houses are all brightly coloured. Plentyof places to eat. From there a short hop to Torcello where you can see Venices oldest cathedral. Beautiful mosaics. Then back to Burano and the on to San Marco (St Marks Square). Allow a day. The journeys take longer than you expect. Enjoy Venice. We did and we would returnto same hotel.
