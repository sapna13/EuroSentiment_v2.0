{"text":"Mediocre at Best We booked this hotel while we were staying here on vacation for 10 days and found the following problems-overly expensive decent at best 25 US dollar breakfast buffet, also it closes at 11 and they will let you in at 10:55 and pack up the food 5 minutes later which happened to us-20 US dollars per day for internet access that is terribly slow, whereas roughly 80% of hotels in hong kong (many of them with much cheaper rates) offer free high speed access-10 US dollar food-reheating charge, gave them my Morton's prime rib that was medium rare and they brought it back well done, though this may seem terribly picky they asked me twice how they should do it and i said i just want it warmed, not re-cooked-Terrible room cleaning, they leave empty bottles all over the place, forgot to leave towels twice, stains on bed and sheets, what looks to be a nice blood stain on the marble bathroom floor and the toilet doesnt flush properly-TV is older than i am, doesnt work, no channel selection, tough to turn on, cannot change volume etc...-Location is not as central as they make it seem, though in a harbour, it is not even close to being the main harbour with the famous star ferry and beautiful shopping centers. Not a shopping center, MTR, Ferry, Nightlife, good restaurants or anything else within a 30 minute walk, or ten minute taxi. Overall the room and Hotel was OK, the lobby is beautiful, room size (for hong kong) is great and staff are fairly pleasant. For all the hype definately not worth it. Next time i come I would spend an extra 50 dollars a night to stay in a more elite hotel, that this one tries to be like.
