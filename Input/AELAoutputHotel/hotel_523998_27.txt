{"text":"budget hotel We chose to stay at this hotel because of its value, its location and it is with the Marriott chain (so there is no big surprises). We stayed for a week. Here are several points:1. Location: It has malls and a lot of restaurants downstairs. Then it is not far away from Tiananmen Square. It is also one block away from the subway station.2. Reception: The receptionists are polite and very professional. As you may, or will, experience, waiting in line is not something that can be taken for granted in Beijing. People tend to cut in line shamelessly whenever they can. Several Chinese tourists attempted to cut in front of us at the reception area when we were checking out of the hotel. I am glad that the receptionists refused to serve them unless they get back in line.3. Internet: They do not offer free internet usage. You can use the internet connection for 40RMB @ hour or 80RMB a day. However, they only have 1 cable in the room, and the system doesn't allow you to share the internet service with multiple computers. My husband and I have 2 laptops, and we have to purchase the service individually even though we were in the same room. However, if you talk to the receptionists, they can fix the problem, and reimburse you on the final bill.4. Guest rooms: The rooms are generally clean and adequately maintained (although I agree they could use some renovations and updates especially in the bathroom). There are no strange smell in the room. However, you can forget about requesting for a non-smoking room (I don't think you can get a non-smoking room anywhere in Beijing actually...).5. Common areas: The reception area is pretty nice. The elevators has strange smell in the morning, and the carpets are old. They washed the carpet in the hallway during our stay, but it seemed to look the same after they washed it....6. Concierge: They seemed to have merged bellboy and concierge together. They provide adequate service (I booked a 1-day tour to the great wall with their help). There is often no one at the concierge area, and I wonder if you can rely on them on helping you plan your sightseeing trip\/route.7. Breakfast: The breakfast was too expensive for what they offer - I'd recommend just getting breakfast from the many restaurants downstairs (There is Mcdonald's downstairs, and they are opening a starbucks soon. Then, you can get Chinese style breakfast in several restaurants too).In general, we had an OK experience with this budget hotel.
