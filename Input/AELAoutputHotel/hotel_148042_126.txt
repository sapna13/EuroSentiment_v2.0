{"text":"The Ritz is service! I must tell you that I had stayed here previously, and thought the service was marginal at best. I am thrilled to say things have changed for the better.I had been following up on other reviews and noticed that the hotels' service manager was taking the time to e-mail back on positive and negative feedback which I found unusually refreshing. I decided to contact him prior to our stay to make sure we basically were on the same page. Ramon Ventura is the real deal. I would contact him again without question. I asked to be upgraded if possible and also explained that it was our wedding anniversary. He got us upgraded to a junior suite which isn't actually listed among their room categories, and upon arrival had a bottle of champagne and anniversary dessert for us. Serivce was impeccable everywhere. We travel twice a year to the caribbean and have a certain standard of travel and this definitely met it.To take it a step further, we had rented a car through an agency established in the hotel. We ended up getting a parking ticket in Old San Juan (be careful there were no signs stating that). We came back to the hotel with our $75 ticket and asked the concierge what to do and how to pay it, she handled it for us without any questions asked, and at the end of our trip we received a small bag of goodies from the gift shop telling us that the staff was very sorry for any inconvenience the parking ticket cost us. That small token of good will means something in times where real service is terribly lacking. You get what you pay for here. This is the Ritz not the Marriott, but it is the best hotel experience in Puerto Rico. ","annotations":[]}
