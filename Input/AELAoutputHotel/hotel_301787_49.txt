{"text":"Absolute paradise My husband and I have just returned from a six night stay in Bali. It is our 6th visit to Bali, and we usually stay in Nusa Dua at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel, but this time, as we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have our children (ages 7 and 10) with us, we decided to go up a notch and stay at the Sheraton Laguna as we had always admired it. For those unfamiliar with Nusa Dua, the Sheraton Laguna is located on a lovely white sandy beach\/lagoon in a strip of four up market hotels which all back directly on to the beach. They are all joined by a lovely pathway which runs the length of the beach at the back of each hotel. Although all are nice hotels, in my opinion the Sheraton Laguna is the best.The Sheraton Laguna did not disappoint. In fact, it was the best resort I have ever stayed at. Our room was spacious with an extremely comfortable king size bed and good size bathroom with a large corner bath. There was a plasma TV mounted on the wall and a DVD player, which was great to play the tons of DVDs which all tourists end up buying. It was decorated and furnished beautifully with a balcony which overlooked the immaculate gardens and extensive pool area.The pools were out of this world. They ran almost the entire way around the hotel (hence the name 'Laguna'). Sun lounges looked almost new and were extremely comfortable with thick cushions. There were sandy beach entrances at some of the pools which were perfect for young children. Breakfast was an absolute feast with every conceivable food presented magnificently. I read somewhere they had an international food stylist and it showed. The gardens were huge and beautifully maintained and all public areas of the hotel were immaculately clean. There are many pool areas which meander through the grounds and lots of spots to relax. The Spa had a lovely spa bath, plunge pool and hot water foot bath. We ate at the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u2022cean Terrace√à√\u2020\u2022?restaurant one evening and the meal was very good. The service was exceptional. All staff were extremely friendly and professional. There is a shopping complex about five minutes away accessible by hotel shuttle. It has a large Sogo department store and a few other stores like surf wear etc. Worth a visit if you feel like getting out of the hotel. The village of Tanjung Benoa is also about 10 minutes away by taxi (about $2-3) with a strip of restaurants and shops, you can get a decent meal here for two with drinks for about $20 AUD. On this trip we stayed 3 nights at the Laguna, then moved to the Sofitel in Seminyak to be near the shops etc. I wish we had stayed at the Laguna as it was significantly better than the Sofitel and the beach at Seminyak was apalling by Australian standards. I don't think I would stay in the Kuta-Legian-Seminyak area again. It seems to get dirtier every year.It was an amazing visit and I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. I would most definitely go back again. About the only negative thing I can think of is that it was very difficult to get a sun lounge by the pool unless you got up seemingly in the middle of the night to reserve one as they were all taken very early, but I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know what (if anything) management can do about this, and I know it happens in most large resorts. Also, international telephone calls from the hotel were unbelievably expensive (around $50 AUD for a 5 or 10 minute call to Melbourne) and in hindsight we should have organised a phone card or something before we left home.I think you would have to be a very, very fussy or jaded traveller to find fault with the Sheraton Laguna.
