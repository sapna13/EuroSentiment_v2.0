{"text":"Great Location, Good Value Kensington Park is ideally situated on Post Street, a half block from Powell Street and a cable car line. The hotel rooms occupy the upper floors of the building, with a theater and an Elks Lodge below. My room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and I had a lovely view of Nob Hill. The bathroom isn't large (not much countertop space), but it was immaculate, and the walk-in shower (no tub) was great.If you're looking at the hotel's website, just know that the rooms are not as large as they appear. That said, my room was more than adequate. The wall-mounted flat screen TV was a nice touch. The bed linens and pillows were excellent.The lobby is small and a bit tired looking, but since I wasn't hanging out there, who cares? The pricing was extremely reasonable for San Francisco's Union Square area, and booking through the hotel's website, I got 15% off for staying 3 nights (or more).The business center is nothing more than a fifth floor room with one desktop computer and a high-speed connection, and you have to visit the front desk to receive a key, so it's not especially convenient. One of the two times I wanted to use it, it was occupied. As all I wanted to do was go online to check in for my departing flight, the front desk staff graciously allowed me to do so at one of their computers. For those who travel with a computer, the hotel also provides wireless.The biggest strength of this hotel is the staff -- they were great. Very gracious, friendly, and accommodating, and extremely knowledgeable about the city.I rode BART from the San Francisco airport. For $5.15, the thirty minute ride to the Powell Street station puts you within a short walk of the hotel (or anything else in the Union Square neighborhood, for that matter). The Kensington Park isn't a Fairmont or Four Seasons, but it isn't priced like they are, either. For a clean, friendly, and safe accommodation in this neighborhood, it's a bargain, and I would stay there again.
