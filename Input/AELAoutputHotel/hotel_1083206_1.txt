{"text":"Fun hotel, great location I rarely write hotel reviews, even though I make use of them - esp. Tripadvisor's - so this is an exception, prompted partly by the Barcelo Raval being a new hotel, and partly by a wish to counter the occasional negative reviews it gathered early on.We've just returned after spending a really excellent 5 days at the hotel over the New Year - a generally low key event in Barcelona, incidentally. All the positive comments in previous reviews about the style and features of the hotel we felt were justified: friendly staff, general hotel facilities, rooftop terrace + views, internet access, cleanliness of room, shower, quality of toiletries, towels etc (though a bit of conservation awareness here wouldn't come amiss), and of course the gadgetry which, when you work it out, is great fun. Only occasionally does style triumph over functionality - would a handle on the sliding toilet door be SO unsightly? Or a work surface of some description?We had a Superior Double room on the 4th floor, and it may be that the layout of the more expensive rooms on the higher floors (with better views) is slightly different, but we didn't feel the open plan design would present any problem for the great majority of guests. As for the location - the other negative mentioned in some reviews - the Raval neighbourhood tends to receive its own section in updated tourist guides and it is surely a fast developing tourist area. So, while still roughish at night, it is fine during the day and should, in our view, certainly not be seen as prohibitive (even the Carrer de l'Hospital route to Las Ramblas, from which you can cut through to the excellent Central Market).Eating - if you can get a deal including breakfast, it's almost certainly worth it - the continental breakfast is varied and plentiful, and hot is available (included in the price, at least if you have the scrambled eggs!). There are two restaurants even closer than La Reina del Raval (and, we felt, better) - El Cafeti and, slightly more expensive - though both offer set menus - Casa Leopoldo, both on Carrer de Saint Rafael, literally alongside the hotel.All in all, a hotel that is enterprising, trying hard, and that deserves to succeed. But yes, certainly at present, Barcelona is not a cheap short break. ","annotations":[]}
