{"text":"Think you can do better Stayed here for four nights in September. We rented the Jr. Suite (195 E\/night). First keep in mind that this building is from the 1700's. So we expected some dated features. But they note in their literature that it was completely renovated in 1990. Hmm.. almost 20 years ago--and it shows. Sorry to the others, but there really is no charm here--not when it needs so much renovation.Pros-Overall staff was very friendly. Room was large. Did not hear noise from outside. Location is close, easy walk to the train station (good  bad). Room was clean (though they did take my wine glasses from both rooms--never got them back--only inexpensive acrylic ones I bought to travel, but I've never had this problem before.)Cons--Ok, I tried to lead with the good, but I really feel that they are resting on their laurels. This place was a disappointment. Some depends on the room you get. Our friends also had a JR suite and it was better (though not luxurious.) Ours, however was in need of repair.The showers are about 24x24 inches. Really. It's hard for most people to shower in something this small. The bathroom is very small. Toilet, bidet, shower stall and sink. Very cramped--stand in the middle, and you can easily touch all elements without stretching. You do hear the plumbing from the other floors.Mattresses are very firm...some would say hard. The furniture was distressed. There was only one wardrobe for clothes--no dresser. I'll add pictures showing the damage to the furniture and the lovely contact paper lining the one drawer in the wardrobe.Our Jr. Suite had a large bed  a separate twin bed. Limited electrical outlets (I need to start packing a european plug since this is an issue in a lot of hotels.)Interior walls are thin, so while we didn't hear noise from the street, we did hear noises from the hallway (my partner actually answered someone thinking it was me talking.) Also got a lot of smoke drifting in from someplace. Not sure where, but it was annoying.The air conditioning is close to the door, while our bed was on the other side of the room, so our room never really got cool. Our friends' room, though, had the bed closer to the vent, so their sleeping section was much cooler (see, depends on the room.)The rooms have the lovely art that is typical in many Italian rooms--ours had the addition of a small but noticeable hole in it.Breakfasts ranked near the bottom of the ones I've had in the many times I've been to Europe. The coffee, when it wasn't out, was not drinkable. Juice was watered down. There is a bar right across the street where I would get coffee. No Biggie, but really not befitting a hotel calling itself a palace. :o)TV has one or two English channels-cable came in and out. (not that we watch tv that much, but sometimes it's nice to hear the news.)I tried to find the good--again, very big room for Europe and the staff was very nice. But the discrepancy in the rooms was startling...but none seemed that nice. After multiple times in Florence I feel that this hotel is taking advantage of the tourists . I much prefer Albergo Scoti--a one star pensione that at least has a better price\/value relationship, along with charming owners.Bottom line, at about $270 \/ night, you would never put up with this in NYC. (not that you'd get a room this big for that price...but you'd never pay that for a place that really needed renovations.
