{"text":"This was an amazing place, I've traveled to Punta Cana - 10 times Let me start by saying I travel 50 weeks a year for work. I am seasoned in world travel and expect the best. This was the best.Over the years I've come to see Punta Cana as the new Cancun. I travel here every year for at least a week for rest, relaxation, and great beaches. Keep in mind I live in CA at the beach.I was very nervous about trying Dreams because of the reviews. The travel agent repeatidly told me not to worry. Let me tell you having stayed Catalonia Bravaro, Iberostars, and many other 4 to 5 stars.. I rank this the highest of them all. The other hotels were fine did a good job, hands down, but I like to try new things and took the chance.Why was this superior..? The people were great! could not do enough for us. The drinks were premium labels, and service at the bars was quick and friendly. The food was amazing. There were 5 specialty restaurants.. and you could go to any of them as often as you liked with no exceptions. Most of Punta Cana you can only go to one specialty restaurant per visit. There were daily newsletters of activities all day long if you wanted to participate. My kids are grown, but there were many very nice playgrounds and waterslides for young children, as well as well supervised activities.We upgraded from beach view room, to a big suite. We went from small suite to multi-room suite with hottub on balcony. The room was amazing..NEGOTIATE.. the price they give you can be heavily negotiated. We were able to drop the price by 2\/3rds what they wanted. (Keep in mind availability is the key). We were given keys to both rooms to compare before deciding.There was a wedding onsite each night. they really worked each day on making each wedding a memory. There were lots and lots of seating at the pool and the beach. You never had to worry about saving seats. There was entertainment each night and a disco.. I went to relax and enjoy time away from busy travel workschedule.. so this was not important.If you want to go to town it was a 20 - 40 minute drive, tours available. Other resorts offer more crowds, and sister\/brother resorts.. this did not. But the choice of food far far outweighs the travel time to town.My traveling friend was a chef.. and picky picky about food. The choices included Prime Rib, Carribean lobster, Lamb chops, Steaks, ect. this was real beef imported from the US. The good stuff. There was a sushi restaurant, mexican restaruant, steak house, and italian restaurant. All quality. We ate at the buffet one night and had lots to choose from (turkey, veal, ect). Again this differentiates the resorts.. makes this a premier resort.I will go here again. I throughly enjoyed the people, the friendlyness, the service, and choices. They far exceed both our expectations.dwgraham242@yahoo.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":824,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":817},{"endOffset":824,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":817},{"endOffset":1222,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1218}]}
