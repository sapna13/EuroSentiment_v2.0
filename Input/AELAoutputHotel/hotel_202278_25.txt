{"text":"For Airport Travelers Only - Otherwise Go Elsewhere. I had certain pre-conceived ideas about what it would be like to stay here for our the 1 night we had to due to timing issues on our flight back to the U.S. Most all of my preconceptions were right...so I guess you might say my disappointment was expected, but I was hopeful going in.Airport shuttle to\/from airport is very frequent, easy to find, clean, and fast...gets you right there. Hotel told me it runs every 15 minutes.Hotel itself is in a business park and actually pretty nice. Absolutely nothing around it...so you don't stay here unless you are looking for a bed close to the airport.There are LOTS of people that work here...except for the restaurant staff, all are somewhat aloof...but then they ARE Europeans!Room was VERY hot\/stuffy when we got in there. Turned on the A\/C full blast and it never did cool down the whole night. You can't open the windows either. Called front desk to ask about A\/C...they said to wait awhile that it was normal. Next day at checkout, told mgr. about it. He asked why I didn't switch rooms...I could have slapped him! I told him I called down and was told it was normal. He said that isn't true that I COULD have had another room...so it was my fault. They refused to issue any kind of discount let alone refund for the room...but in great European style...he was of course sorry.TV choices in the room are awful...you would think they'd have more than a couple English channels....but nope!Best thing about the hotel was the cold beer, burger, and fries at the bar restaurant. Sure it was around $20.00, but a highlight of the hotel stay!Oh yeah...smoke is EVERYWHERE in the hotel. I think it must be a requirement or something that everyone smoke everywhere as much as possible.So why did I rate it a 3 on TripAdvisor? Because they met my lowered expectations of an over-priced average room w\/ semi-bad customer service...but they DID get me to and from the airport as needed...which is why we were there in the first place.
