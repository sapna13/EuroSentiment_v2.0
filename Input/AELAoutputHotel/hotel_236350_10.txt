{"text":"Class Act! The Sofitel St. James is fabulous and in such a perfect location. So many major monuments, galleries, and restaurants are within walking distance. The hotel is pure luxury. Breakfasts were excellent, as were dinners. The rooms we booked were spacious by any large city standards. Beds were very comfortable. The concierge recommended very good restaurants nearby and booked excellent seats for us at Wicked.We found a great deal on the hotel website, which beat anything offered by the discount brokers. We received 3 nights for the price of one, one free dinner, one free tea, free breakfast every morning. We also stayed over the weekend, when the prices are much lower than during the weekdays. All those freebies and our stay over the weekend drove the price down to something that was very affordable. (By the way, this excellent deal was not available on the hotel website until just a couple of weeks before our stay - so keep checking back.)The hotel staff, front desk and restaurant personnel were very professional. We had a bit of a mix-up on the free dinner. Apparently, there is a special menu for the free dinner, which we weren't given when we sat down. Instead, we were given the regular menu. Not knowing any different, we ordered off that menu and purchased a bottle of wine (48 pounds). The bill was 200 pounds (for 4), but we figured everything would sort itself out, since we did not expect that we would actually have to pay for the dinner in full, nor did we expect the wine to be complimentary. When the restaurant was closing out, they realized their error in giving us the wrong menu, called us up and asked us if we could come back the next night for our free meal (meaning we would pay in full for the first meal). We said, no, we had other plans the next night, but we would talk to the front desk about it in the morning. The next morning, we raised the issue with the front desk. We said we wanted to be fair - could they please just deduct the value of the free meal from our restaurant bill? They said they would talk to the restaurant. When we got our final bill, we saw that not only did they deduct what probably should have been the value, they deducted a full 150 pounds. That was more than fair. In fact, that was exceedingly generous. We were so impressed with every aspect of this hotel, that we will always try to stay here whenever we travel to London. This is a hotel where the guests clearly come first. Sofitel St. James is the ultimate, and there is no need for us to look elsewhere.
