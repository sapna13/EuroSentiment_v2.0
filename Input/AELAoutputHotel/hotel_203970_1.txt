{"text":"one night only sheraton firenzemon 15 sept, one nightcouple traveling by carhad no real issues during our one night, and really enjoyed ourbrief stay, however we would have preferred to have chosen ahotel closer to the city center. location is convenient if youare on the road as the hotel is very close to the highway, butthe environment\/surroundings could be better.pluses:very friendly staff, and excellent service.very spacious and clean room with very comfortable beds andlarge bathroom.sound insulation in room ok (highway is close, but was no issue).hotel shuttle connects guests with city center throughoutthe day at convenient (but limited) times as a complementaryservice (time hotel to firenze main train station at piazza stamaria novella approx 20 min, local traffic permitting).continental breakfast ok.availability of open and closed parking spaces.a special thanks goes out to the night receptionist who preparedhot tea for both of us at 3 o'clock in the morning without anycharge (no 24-hrs room service and hotel kitchen closed at thetime), as we both had a flu and were in desperate need for sometea.minuses:very tired hotel, in need of an urgent refurbishment in and out.our room window on the 4th floor had a serious oversize crack,and was in need of replacement.internet access with credit card charges next to reception only.hotel surroundings and buildings (garage building for example)look very abandoned.hotel shuttle service stops early in the evening, and there is noconnection during night hours.no city view, location not far outside of city, but behind hills,convenient only if traveling by car (that may well be a plus).breakfast would be nice to have fresh juices and scrambled eggs,as a standard offering.would generally consider the hotel as overpriced because of theabove.overall impression:we enjoyed our brief stay, and would have no objection to visitthis hotel again, although we will try for something closer tothe city center next time. from what we've seen, hotels infirenze are highly overrated and overpriced.
