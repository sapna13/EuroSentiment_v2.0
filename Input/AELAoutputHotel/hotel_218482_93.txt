{"text":"Hell Hut and the Dungeon of Doom First off I will say this, the place is gorgeous. But the food is horrible. The breakfast and lunch are buffetts, nothing changes and there are A LOT of flies and birds eating with you. We nicknamed the two places to eat, hell hut and dungeon of doom. The dinners are edible but nothing to write home about. The best place is the Japanese restaurant but you can only eat there once. The pool was large but too cold to get in when we went(oct). Very well kept up though. The beach was great, lots of room with lots of trees. Very, very windy however. A lot of kids, which is good or bad depending on your purpose of travel. I found the people friendly but ran into a few rude ones. The rooms are great. The one I stayed in was clean. The only complaint is the shower is TINY. The hammock on the porch is nice. If you go in a group, get ready to not be close to any of your group. I think they spread them out on purpose, which I like. I know this sounds bad, but the food really ruined it for me. So did the drinks, they were so sweet you could almost chew them. The beer there was soooooooooo bad, and I like a LOT of different beers. You can however get corona at the mexican restaurant, budweiser at the steak house and I can't remember the beer at the Japanese place, maybe Sapporro. If you are looking for a very inexpensive get away and you could care less about the food then go. But I rate this place 1.5*'s at best. ","annotations":[]}
