{"text":"Royal Park Hotel - upscale hotel - easy subway and bus access We stayed at the Royal Park Hotel in July 2007. I would recommend this hotel for anyone and I would stay here again anytime.We followed the advise of another TA member and joined their club (free of charge) and we decided to upgrade our room to the executive level. We received a great suprise when we arrived - as the room rate was dropped by 30%. The executive floor rooms offer free full breakfast (western and japanese style), free access to the in-house gym, executive lounge access with complimentary happy-hour nightly with a well stocked bar (I had champagne every night). I completed their club application, which they had to mail to me, and in order to cut-down on processing time I decided to scan the application and emailed it to them. They had our membership package, with club card, ready for us upon check-in. Check-in for the executive floors is handled at the executive floor lounge.It's a nice upscale hotel with over 1\/2 doz restaurants. They have an in-house gym with good equipment and a yoga\/stretching room as well. I don't remember seeing a pool. The provide in-house massages (my husband swears is the best massage he's ever had).The staff was wonderful - at every level (not just executive floors). They were caring and very helpful (suggesting nearby restaurants), providing customized maps for us.Rooms are well appointed with the usual amenities you expect in an upscale hotel (robes, slippers, minibar etc)Restaurants; they have several restaurants and lounges throughout the hotel. Some more upscale than others - all with different cuisines.There is a subway entrance attached to the hotel and across the street is the Tokyo Air Terminal Bus Station - which also has a corridor connecting it to this hotel)At our departure, we needed to get a bus to Narita Tokyo airport and they had 2 staff members assist us to the bus terminal (access directly from the hotel). Again, if you can upgrade to the executive floors - the perks are worth the price and may actually save you money if you add up all that you'd have to pay for if you stayed in the other floors. Make sure to join their club to get a room discount and perks.Enjoy.
