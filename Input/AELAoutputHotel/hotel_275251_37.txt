{"text":"Convenient and Attractive Downtown Hotel We arrived for a four night stay during the fourth of July holiday week in 2007. We were quite pleased with the attractiveness and cleanliness of the hotel. The front desk and bell staff were very friendly and attentive to our needs. We were a little disappointed with the concierge staff, never received a smile or greeting when he was seated alone at his desk as we passed by. The room was very nice and had a very comfortable king bed with 6 comfy pillows. The bathroom had great soap\/shampoo amenities and look forward to buying them for my home. The restaurant was the most disappointing experience. During happy hour we ordered a couple drinks, and was served a cosmopolitan in a chipped, leaking glass. The server didn't notice it and quickly left as he set the drinks down. We had to go search for him to let him know about the broken glass. The service was very slow and there was no reason for it either. Nobody was dining in the restaurant and there were 3 waiters who were handling about 8 tables. On our second adventure to the restaurant\/bar, we were acnowledged when entering but were completely ignored when we were seated. After 5 minutes, we got up and left and went outside the hotel for our dinner.Housekeeping did a good job for the most part. However, we didn't receive any service on our last night and I had to contact the front desk. They sent somebody who did a haphazard job of restocking the towels and soap amenities, but didn't clean the room in the same style that we had experienced the previous three nights. Hotel has a convenient location in downtown Seattle and is just steps away from world class shopping and dining. ","annotations":[]}
