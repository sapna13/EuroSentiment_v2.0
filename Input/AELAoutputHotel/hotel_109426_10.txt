{"text":"Pluses and minuses This hotel can best be summed up as a series of pluses and minuses.This hotel was in an excellent location in terms of local restaurants - a plus. In terms of proximity to the Convention Center, it was a good 15 minute walk and a $7.50 taxi ride back - a negative. The hotel had indicated on the phone that they had a free shuttle but it did not operate on the weekend.The room was large, well maintained, included a kitchen area\/table and the wireless free -- big pluses. But, the room had a strange layout that included having the sink in the same area as the beds, meaning that turning on the light to use the sink disturbs any still sleeping. Further, the air conditioning was good but incredibly loud. The TV was relatively small and hard to see from one of the beds.The included breakfast buffet is very nice -- a plus and an excellent value, particularly for families. Except when the worker responsible does not show -- a negative. On the Saturday when the worker did not show, a staff member went out and bought about 200 take out egg sandwiches from McDonalds to put out -- OK but not a breakfast buffet. There is no manager's reception on the weekends.Staff ranged from very helpful and friendly -- a plus -- to rude and indifferent -- a negative. Sometimes, cheerful greeting. Sometimes, the front desk did not answer the phone and staff monitoring to ensure food did not run out at the buffet was missing.
