{"text":"Old, Tired and Lacking Stayed over a 4-day business meeting in February. Warning 1 - stay in the Casitas and make certain that you get the ocean front room - don't stay in the main hotel or in any non-ocean facing direct view room in the Casitas. To start, you arrive at the airport and the staff are clueless to get you to the long, no-shocks bumpy, CO2 odor, ride 1 hour + after a 1 hour wait at the airport to get there. They have a bar cart on the bus, give you bacardi, then after 4-5 drinks, our riders spilled all over themselves - quite funny. Warning two - once there, you are a captive; if this is what you want fine. Get off the resort by going down to the marina and left and walk into the little town. The private island is fine and the transport to and from is fine. As you expect, drink\/food prices are astronomic. The little shops are ok. The penny slots and gaming tables are full of people. Lots of business meetings there. Warning three - I said get the ocean front room - our first ocen front - was a dank, back-view of the pool, stained desk and moldy bathroom. We requested to be moved - they moved us. The ocean view was great, but then again, the room showed serious sign of age. The internet access in the room did not work, and neither did the room safe. Staff - there are are lots of them - but they buzz past you on golf carts and when they stop, expect you to tip them. Food was bland over bland - expect 30$ for a breakfast for 2. Warning four - if you are looking for a beach front resort, the only sand is the private island - a boat ride away and 6 spaced apart of well oiled chasies. Heard the golf and spa were fine. The ride up and down to the marina was fun in the little cable car. Lots of tree frogs and little lizards running about. ","annotations":[]}
