{"text":"Get What You Pay For I'll be brief...10 of us booked through Apple for an inexpensive getaway. We read all of the reviews, so we knew what to expect. Honestly, you get what you pay for. That is not good and it is not bad. My husband and I paid for the Platinum upgrade and felt it was WAY worth it. Our room was close to the beach and restaurants. Newer and cleaner. Better alcohol when you wanted to go to the lounge for it. The lounge was nice for refreshments, internet, help with restaurants, etc.The good...We avoided tap water in our rooms and did not get sick.Food was pretty good.Beach was beautiful.Casino was entertaining, as was parasailing, shark encounter and snorkeling.The not so good...The condition of the pool water ( and the people peeing in it).Drinks were low alcohol, so we drank lots of them!Chewed on by mosquitos and ants under the palapas.Some rooms had a musty smell that the AC couldn't get out.A little boring after a few days since leaving the resort is a little sketchy.CARLOS the Apple rep in hotel told half our group that their flight was pushed back when in fact it wasn't! They nearly missed their flight home! Wherever the fire happened, there was no trace of it during our visit last week. They did a great job of rebuilding. The hotel is huge, and must have been a real thing of beauty when it was first built. With the hassle getting to D.R. with passports, delays with broken down planes on the runway and the sketchy conditions here, I don't think we'll be back. We had fun being together, but Key West was better\/easier last year. ","annotations":[]}
