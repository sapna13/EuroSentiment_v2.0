{"text":"Good but not great We (husband, 10-year-old daughter and I) had a great vacation and Dreams was nice but it did not strike me as great. The things that stood out on the vacation were the friendly people of the Domincan Republic, great excursions and the general comfort of the hotel including a great pool. See below for specifics.GROUNDS: Nice grounds but not spectacular. Well kept but the open area around the lobby did not do much for us. Very nice lay-out of the resort though, nothing feels too far.FRONT-DESK\/CHECK-IN: Fairly helpful but the least friendly people at the resort. Arrived in the middle of the night and did not get one smile out of the guy. Did not bother me too much but I have to say I did overhear a few arguments so I think there is a bit of an issue with expectations not always being met.ROOMS: Had booked a Junior Suite and had asked for a quiet\/renovated room. Stayed in building 8 and we were very happy with the room and the location. Big suite and very clean. Cleaning staff was great. We would run in and out but they were always ready to come and clean when we asked them too.FOOD: Overall so-so. The buffet was extensive and OK; you could always find something. Included some nice things as well. The setting was also so-so. Tried Oceana and the Chinese restaurant (as the Japanese was full). Did not care for either but were very entertained by the Domincan Coffee maker at Oceana. Did not hear great things about the food from other guests either.ROOM SERVICE: Definitely a perk! Worked very well for us. This way you can get food at 430 in the afternoon (had just come back from an excursion). Very courteous and efficient staff taking orders. They all spoke excellent English which really helps when you order on the phone. Food very OK. Salad good (except one day when it was a bit brown). Nachos so-so but the guacamole was great so that worked. Great Fettucini Alfredo.POOL: Very nice! Really liked the lazy river. It makes it feel less crowded and you get different sceneries. All the action is at the end and that really works. You can have a quiet rest at the top of the pool and then swim down for a livelier crowd with lots of activities going on. My daughter enjoyed the ice berg. The resort was busy but we always found chairs.BEACH: Mixed feelings. We liked it but it was not great. It was quiet (no people around) and vast but at the same time the surf\/current was a nuisance. It was closed for water activities several days but still not enough waves for boogie boarding. We may have just been unlucky but I probably would not take that chance again. Seaweed was bad a couple of days as well. Still, we made the best out of it and again we really enjoyed that it was not so crowded.EXCURSIONS: Outback safari - Really enjoyed this. You move along at a nice pace and get to see the landscape and learn about the country. Included a stop at a Dominican small farm home, cocoa farm, ranch for lunch, boogie boarding at Macao (fantastic beach with great waves!). Ziplining - really liked this one as well. Good for beginners. Took about 3.5-4 hrs so not an all-day thing. Again, a nice way of getting out on the country side. Horseback-riding: Went with Ranchero. Yes, I know the horses are skinny and it does not look like much but we had a ball. The horse-people were very friendly and we really enjoyed it. Decided to do it again on our last day and then they just took the three of us to the place and we went alone with a guy.One thing we liked about this resort was that it had a mixed crowd. I would not recommend it to honeymooners or for a romantic get-away but I think it works for all others.Finally, I would like to say that we were very close to giving Dreams four stars but opted for three. The not so great food and unpredictable\/not great beach pulled it down. For the rest probably a 4.
