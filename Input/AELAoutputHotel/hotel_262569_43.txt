{"text":"Huge dissapointment for a Sofitel Hotel After disembarking on a cruise (on which we were thorougly spoiled) my husband and I were expecting more of the same service during our stay in Sydney when we checked in to the Sofitel Wentworth for two nights. Checkin was courteous and prompt, but the room was disappointing - walls were grubby with lots of scuff marks (not a good standard for a Sofitel) the furnishings overall are not in keeping with what one normally expects of a Sofitel no quality in the finishes, window coverings are blinds which are very impractical one redeeming feature the bed was comfortable though there was no turn down service with the little chocolate on the pillow - like housekeeping this must be another service that has been cut back.Requested assistance from concierge to make a reservation for a show - and even though we had a $10 tip in our hand to give him - we were directed out onto the street to make our own reservation at the Ticket shop. Tried to dine in the hotel restaurant on a Friday evening as it is open plan the noise level from the adjoing bar area which was in full swing with pre-Christmas parties was horrendous and since they only have one inhouse restaurant had to go by taxi to Darling Harbour to dine. Had similar problem on the Saturday night, could not dine inhouse as they were fully booked and with no other inhouse restaurant had to again take taxi to go to Darling Harbour to dine. Should have stayed in Darling Harbour, where the restaurants are superb, and THE Sofitel Wentworth did not live up to the Sofitel standard.
