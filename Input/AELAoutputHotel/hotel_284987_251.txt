{"text":"Not for Beach Lovers Just returned from 5 night stay at the Paradisus. Overall the resort is good, with exceptional rooms (we were in their Royal Service buildings), great pools and grounds. Staff were friendly and went out of their way to help. Food was varied from a great breakfast buffet to a so so dinner buffet. The theme restaurants were decent although the service was a little slow (Italien)The beach was poor so if you are a beach person who likes to walk the beach and swim in the ocean this is not the place.Traffic in Puerto Rico is bad so plan lots of time to get to places. Every trip was twice the time we were told. Took us over 1 1\/2 hours to get from gthe hotel to Old San Juan. Weather was good, had a couple of rain storms that blew through in about 15 minutes.Next to the property is the CoCo Beach golf resort with 36 holes. The Palms (9 holes) is the tighest course I have ever seen. No room for spraying as the jungle takes all! THe Mountain (9 Holes) has some great view and holes but also a couple of quirky ones. The other 9's Lakes and Ocean are a little more forgiving. Not cheap though as a round and rentals cost $200 USTHe Paradisus presently is the only All Inclusive in puerto rico but as of May it is dropping the all inclusive option. THey are getting ready to start a new Caribe (another Sol Melia chain) but it will not be ready for a year of more at least.Overall we had a good time but given the beach situation and the cost of the package and now losing the all inclusive I probably would not go back. I have stayed at the Paradisus in the Mayan and would rate it better than this.As a side trip we did one of the Catamaran snorkling days. (Spread Eagle 2 was the catamaran)Water and boat ride were fun, (although first one I have been on the drinks are not all included in the price) but the snorkling was mediocre at best.
