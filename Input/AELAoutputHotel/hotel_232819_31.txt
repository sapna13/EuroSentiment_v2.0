{"text":"Good hotel, great location This is a good hotel in an excellent location. Staff were helpful and professional. Our room (on the 4th floor) was not huge, but stylish, air-conditioned, lots of storage space and very clean. I thought the bed was too hard at first, but got used to it. Although it was a twin room the beds were right next to each other (and no room to move them apart), which might not be ideal for everyone who wants a twin room. It looked as if rooms on lower floors might be quite noisy, and there was a lot of rubbish on the street below.The balconies are tiny, too small to sit out on, though they are typical of Madrid architecture. We felt quite envious of people who could afford the rooms\/suites with terraces on the 5th and 6th floors!There was a problem with the safe not working but this was sorted out within minutes.We could walk to all the main attractions in Madrid√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ old town, also the Prado and the other art galleries. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to walk, there are several metro stations close by, and taxis are reasonably cheap.Particularly liked the free wifi, the plasma TV with 42 channels (we watched Rafa win a Canadian championship) and free minibar (only soft drinks and beer, but room to store your own water).Breakfast was charged extra (very expensive) so we went to various local cafes √à√\u2020\u2022?about 2-3 euros for a coffee\/juice and croissant √à√\u2020\u2022?though we wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ recommend Domingo√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂. Lots of restaurants and tapas bars nearby. Also the Corte Ingl√ã√\u2022√ñs.Madrid is just fabulous and we had a great time here. A feast of cultural and culinary delights√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>We would stay at Preciados again but not without checking out other beguiling hotels like the Room Mate chain!
