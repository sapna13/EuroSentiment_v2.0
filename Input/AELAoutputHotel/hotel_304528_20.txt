{"text":"Fabulous stay! While I often think of this vacation, I am just now getting around to telling about our wonderful stay at the Westin. We took the Beach Club Lounge package and we found it was an extraordinary value. Included was a wonderful breakfast (with lattes made to order), a buffet lunch, cocktail hour snacks and all the wine (Australian), beer, and fabulous cocktails a person could want. We can not say enough about the wonderful staff in the Beach Club Lounge. They literally catered to our every need. They patiently answered all our questions about their culture and even when I got a little personal they were very kind and accommodating. We spent a little too much of our vacation in the lounge drinking and talking because the staff are so wonderful and interesting.We had dinner at the Beach restaurant and the food was fabulous and the setting very romantic. A live band was playing and they were excellent.Our initial room was beautiful (but smallish) so on the second night we took the offered upgrade (they will ask) and we took the suite, complete with separate dining and living rooms and two bathrooms. It was perfect. The Hotel assisted with hiring us a driver for several day trips and this was so inexpensive we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe it. We went off-site to a Spa (cheap but not air-conditioned) but ended up doing a majority of our Spa activities in the Hotel because of the convenience. The massage, pedicure and body scrubs were wonderful. I would pass on the milk bath next time.The gym was great and when we there, they were in the process of upgrading and moving to a new location, so I imagine it would be even better.The beach was lovely but there are hawkers so we spent a good part of the time around the pool which was kept at a perfect temperature. We never had a problem finding a nice shady spot no matter what time of day.We can not wait to return to the Westin Nusa Dua!!!
