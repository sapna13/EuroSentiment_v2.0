{"text":"'B' good value @ B Hotel Just back from 4 days\/3 nights @ B Hotel - chosen on TT recommendations.Overall we were very impressed with the hotel. It is within easy reach of the airport, especially if you pick up the Aeroport bus (4.5 euros single) from outside the terminal. The bus stops in Placa Espanya and from there it is 5 mins walk to the hotel. You can identify it easily when you get off the bus as there is a huge 'B' on the top of the hotel.The design is very minimalist and modern, we asked for a quiet room at the back, although we were told all rooms were quiet due to double glazing but we didnt want to chance a room at the front as the road outside is very busy. Staff speak good english and were very helpful to us.We had a twin room , clean  spacious, with plenty of storage space for a short break. The bathroom is lovely but rather dark and it took us till the 3rd day of our stay to find the controls for the motorised blind when gives privacy to the shower\/bath! Its on the wall next to the socket nr the sink if you want toknow what to look out for!Bed linen was good quality and 2 nice pillows were provided. Toiletries in bathroom, including, throw away toothbrush  razor with shaing cream, as well as other usual gles  potions.Buffet breakfast was 13 euros each which might sound expensive but we treated ourselves as it was our anniversary.This was served on 1st floor which doubled as business centre (2 pc's with printer - which was out of paper  ink when I wanted to use it to print out our checked in boarding passes!)Breakfast was very good, ranging from an assortment of juices, cereals, dried  fresh fruit, cold meats, cheeses, sausage, hardboiled eggs, tomatoes, cucumber etc Also hot food, scrambled eggs, fried potatoes, bacon and assorted tortillas. Plenty of different bread  rolls, croissants, including custard filled and chocolate ones. There was also a tart, apple\/custard. Toast, jams, marmalades too if you were still hungry. Coffee and tea were brought to table by waiters. We filled up on breakfast so we only needed a snack lunch most days.There is a bar, for having a well earned drink, near to reception, which also serves tapas - if you're there at lunchtimes or early evenings.Placa Espanya Metro is located in the nearby square with at least 8 entrances. A single journey cost 1.30 euros, or a T-10 ticket with 10 journeys for 7.20 is better value, if you are travelling round the city. We found the Metro, clean, quick and efficient. very easy to navigate too. We used the Bus Touristic during the day, which stops in the square. It is a hop on\/off bus which runs from 9am to 7pm. You buy the ticket on the bus. It costs 20 euros for 1 day or 26 euros for 2 days. We bought the 2 day tickets and found they were better than the Metro (which we only used for return journeys in the evenings when we went out to restaurants). It also saved our feet when we just wanted a rest and a ride round! There is a narrated description of the sites using free headphones in at least 8 languages! Just plug your phones in a choose your language.The bus has 3 routes, blue - north, red - south and green - east. The blue and red routes are the most useful, stopping at all the major sites. They run every 10 to 15 mins and there are changeover stops which cover blue\/red routes.With your ticket you get a book of discount vouchers for the majority of the city sites - such as the Sagrada Familia, La Pedrera, Maritime Museum (excellent) Fundacion Joan Miro and many others.I booked restaurants for the 3 evenings we were there before I left the UK. I used www.toptable.co.uk a very useful site, which allows you to book restaurants by email in lots of cities around the world.Overall we would stay at the B Hotel again, a slight compromise in location but with public transport so good, this wasnt a problem and it was nice to have a quiet hotel to get a good nights sleep.
