{"text":"My experience better than most I was somewhat hesitant given some of the overwhelmingly negative reviews written here as well as one from a colleague whom had stayed here recently. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I found the front desk staff to be professional and courteous and they attempted to satisfy my requests. They weren't overly friendly but I found nothing negative about their behavior as some reviewers did.My chief complaint about the hotel is the 26euro\/day internet charge (which is about $40 USD about now). This really is outrageous. I stayed at the hotel for six nights and wasn't about to pay this, even though my company was picking up the tab. I was attending a conference for three days a short distance away and just used the (free) internet access there. On a couple of occasions, I went down to the business center late at night and asked if I could send an e-mail or check my flights. I was told of course. Other people did go and sign up and pay. Had I said I wanted to use a machine for a half hour or more, I suspect I would have had to pay as well.My room was o.k. Beware that the mattresses are very hard, although Islept quite well. I was not bothered by any noise, but I sleep with earplugs anyway :-) The bathroom was quite nice and there was a powerful shower head which I really appreciate. The overflow drain attachment on the tub wall was not secured and dropped out a couple of times - don't know why they didn't fix it - but it didn't bother me that much. The vanity was marble and the lighting in the bathroom was nice. The overall condition was good, but could stand some touching up.The furniture was a bit dated, but o.k. Also, the carpet, although not filthy as some reviewers stated, was a bit worn and a little dingy.I had difficulty turning on the lights when I first entered the room. It turns out you have to insert your room key card in a slot just inside the room when you enter. Otherwise, the lights and outlets are disabled. This is a neat energy saving device that other hotels should adopt. When you leave your room and take out the key card, the lights all go out. (Another advantage is you never have to hunt around your room for your key card before you leave - it's always in the slot).The breakfast buffet (included in my room rate) was absolutely wonderful. Smoked salmon, eggs, breads, fresh fruit, cereals, fresh juices, coffee, champagne!, mineral water, .... I looked forward to this everyday.Also, a similar lunch buffet is also very good. I don't think it was included in my room rate, but the one day I went in there and tried to ask the waitress for a bill she simply shook her head and shooed me away. Nice.I rented a bicycle during the whole stay. The porters and the concierge were absolutely great about locking the bike up every night in the baggage room and getting it for me in the morning. Theyalso were very helpful when the bike rental guy was unable to pickup the bike on time - they held on to it for me to deliver safely to himwhen he showed up later.All in all a very pleasant experience -- but still wish they internetservice was included (and the pool as well -- that was 12euros extra\/day - so I didn't step foot in it).
