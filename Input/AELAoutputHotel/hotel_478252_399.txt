{"text":"A great stay at the Gran Bahia Principe My husband and I booked a last minute deal to the Bahia Principe. We had read good reviews about the place, and honestly, we weren't let down.We were quite amazed at how clean the place is kept. There are always staff cleaning the place in the morning. In general, we found the staff to be very hardworking, and willing to help out however they could.The maid cleaning our room was fabulous. She left little flowers for us in the room, and decorated our room with towel art. We left little gifts and small tips for her everyday to thank her.In terms of the food, we advise signing up for your a la carte dinners as soon as you arrive. Our favorite was the Japanese restaurant. However, the Italian was also very good (we usually ate lunch there).We were also very pleased with our stay because, when we asked to get a room closer to the beach, we were upgraded at no extra cost to us, which allowed us to use the exclusive pool, and gave us free internet (10 minutes each) per day. That was great.Also, when one of the staff found out my birthday was coming up, he gave me a free bottle of rum, and a t-shirt. I thought that was really quite nice.In terms of the beach, it was gorgeous! White sands, turquoise water, exactly what we were hoping for.The hotel also put on entertainment in the evening which, although sometimes amateurish, was still delivered with zeal.All in all, we would definitely recommend this hotel. The only negative we would warn you about is that, if you want to buy something like an art piece, do NOT wait until the end of your stay, or, if possible, do NOT buy from the store at the hotel. We had a salesperson try to rip us off which left us really mad. We told our tour rep about the salesperson and he agreed that the people in that store are horrible. They had even tried to rip off our tour guide at some earlier point. They think, because you are leaving the next day, they can hike up the prices to unreasonable rates, and you will pay because you're desperate. How frustrating!In summary, this is a clean, well-rounded hotel. A very nice place to stay.
