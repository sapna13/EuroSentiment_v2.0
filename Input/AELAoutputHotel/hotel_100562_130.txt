{"text":"Crowded with Conventions, but otherwise OK I often stay in Seattle for business and the last time I stayed at this hotel, I found it very good for the price. This time the hotel was more expensive and I found it just average. Here are my thoughts:POSITIVES:- Location: This place has a great location within walking distance of most parts of downtown Seatlle and has many, many shops and restaurants within two blocks. Also very near Pikes Place Market. - Room: I stayed in the brand new Union Tower, on the 23rd floor. The room was very nicely appointed. My room had a king bed, a huge desk, a buffet table under the TV and a cosy chair. It had nice built in storage areas and a built-in closet all made out of rich,and warmly-stained hardwood. It had a 27 inch Plasma TV hung nicely on the wall. The bathroom was very nice, marble floors and countertops, a spacious shower with decent water pressure and a cool, built-in 3-way mirror.- Bed: This is almost always a given in Starwood hotels, but the bed was very luxurious in terms of the linens and the feel of the mattress. NEUTRALS:- Internet in room was $9.95, however, it was for 25 full hours rather than through noon the next day like in most hotels.- The service was simply average. The person at check-in was not particularly friendly, but wasn't rude . . .just doing her job un-enthausiastically. The bathroom in my room didn't have a blowdryer or the assortment of bath products you normal expect when I checked it. However, I called housekeeping and they sent someone immediately and offered to credit me some Starwood points for my inconvienence. But worst of all, they missed a wake-up call to me on the last day of my trip. Fortunately, I had set the alarm in the room as a back-up. - View: The view from my room was of the side of the building accross the street. The way the hotel is angeled the whole side of the hotel that I was staying on has nothing to see out the window. - Lobby: Very large and since I last stayed there they have attempted to make it more cozy. The lobby is oddly layed out and its quite a walk from the hotel elevators in order to exit the lobby. Its also funny that the first time I stayed here I didn't even know that the hotel had a bar in the far end of the lobby because its hidden around a corner. NEGATIVES:- Very Crowded: I stayed for three days and the hotel must have had three or for different conventions going at the same time. This made the hotel lobby, the check-in, check-out line, the elevators and the entry to the hotel SUPER CROWDED, extremely loud and hectic. - Construction: A lot of construction going on in the lobby and in one of the entryways (which was often closed because of the construction) added to the crowdedness and overall hectic feeling of the hotel in general. - Parking: I hate parking at downtown hotels as it is ALWAYS a RIP-OFF. You pull up at the hotel and the take your car at the valet and NEVER TELL YOU how much its going to be to park. I was in a hurry to check-in and forgot to askthe person at the front desk. When I received my bill, I was shocked to find out that parking was $35.00\/night. That is absurd in light of the fact that you could park a block away for less than $10\/night. I guess I learned a lesson the hard way. SUMMARY:In light of the foregoing, I feel the price ($236\/night) was not worth this hotel and $35 was certqain high for parking. Nevertheless, I would stay there again if I could find it for under $150 and I would park in the lot accross the street.
