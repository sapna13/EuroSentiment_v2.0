{"text":"If you like loud a\/c, mosquitos, and busted doors - stay here I can tell you our honest experience at this hotel. We stayed for two nights. You can draw your own conclusion as to how they beat out the Ritz Carlton, Sheraton, Water Club Hotel, Intercontinental and many other world class hotels to be ranked #2 in Puerto Rico.- We were given a can of mosquito spray to kill the mosquitos INSIDE our room. My wife woke up with 5-10 mosquito bites in the morning and we both got to enhale dioxin fumes from the spray all night. - Our room, #1, is a basement room as in the feeling of a damp cellar. The patio elegantly described in other postings is enclosed by cinder blocks, a bathroom that non-hotel guests use and the janitorial closet. The far side of the gorgeous patio has all of the scooters and bikes available for rental.- The security chain on our door was broken and was not replaced. The normal door lock was broken and would only lock when slammed repeatedly until catching as advised by the staff. There is no safe and they are not responsible for theft. - The air conditioner sounds like an unmodified Cessna 172. Turn it off to sleep and it feels like the suana at the Sheraton.- The TV gets NO english channels. One channel comes in clear and all the remaining four channels are covered in snow.- All of the bedspreads are stained with we only can image what when you look at the reverse side, ewe. Every bathroom towel had stains on them, ewe.- Another posting is correct that the dog doesn't bark next door. They stand across the street to howl instead. It is perfect because there is no alarm clock or phone so you can rely on the dogs to wake you up in the morning.- I can't criticize the hotel for the kids running back and forth in the room above us. What I do agree with is that the hotel is conceivably quieter than staying on the main drag two blocks away. However, since you need to rent a car to get around, I would highly recommend staying at much nicer and far less tourist rip off places on the other side of the island (5 minutes away) and commuting the five minutes to this side to take a look. There is more than ample parking, or heck, take a horse that you find tied up ever 100 ft or so.We did find out from the locals that no one even eats at the restaurants on this side of the island because they are for the tourists. I did enjoy the food at Tradewinds. Otherwise, there are some great road side stands and better restaurants on the other side of the island.Oh, a quick tip if you do stay here. If you lean cross way in front of the tv with the door open and hold your foot on the garbage can, you can get one bar on your cell phone to get a call as reflected from the cinder block patio.Another tip. Island Rental car has the best rental car rates ($60 rather than $85 at other places) and gave us great service. They don't have hotel pickup but the cab ride is only $3\/person to get your car. Everything is only five minutes from whereever you are.If you do the awesome bio-bay trip at night, bring your own waterproof flashlight (it is sooo dark) and mosquito spray. Both are MUST HAVES now that we went.
