{"text":"Great time at the Iberostar We just returned from a one week stay nov 16 - 23. We are a family of 4 and met up with my sisters family of 6. Apple couldn't have made it any easier. There was even a rep at our airport in baltimore who ran us down in security because he got us better seats on the airplane.The DR airport is quite nice and we were quickly whisked on a bus to the airport. Check in went smoothly. We requested 4 rooms together and we got exactly what we wanted - half a building 2 up, 2 down.The rooms - quite nice. One room had a musty smell that maintenance came to fix. Our room had no musty smell. If you've ever been to Mexico you know how hard the beds are there. Not here, they were actually comfortable. The food - I was pleasantly surprised. It was much better than I had anticipated. We made 3 reservations, but it was no problem getting reservations the other nights we were there. We ate at the Japanese, the gourmet, the cajun, the mediterranean and the steak house. I didn't like the Japanese restaurant but the kids all said it was their favorite. It wasn't really air conditioned and a few of us spit out shrimp as it tasted spoiled.My favorite was the mediterranean, but be warned they only have fish on the menu. I had a paella with lobster there that was really good. The appetizers were delicious. The gourmet and cajun were really nicely decorated restaurants and so nice to sit in the a\/c at night. The steakhouse was also quite good. I didn't think I'd like it as the meat tasted different there from what I imagine is probably just the diet of the cows. It was seasoned and delicious.The beach - the sand feels like corn starch. Clean and white and beautiful. Loads of palapas on the beach and plenty of places to sit around the pool. Word to the wise - get to the beach before 9:30 or 10 to get a decent seat in the shade.2 of the girls spent a lot of time with the kids club coming and going and they had a great time. Keila was great with them. We gave all the kids walkie talkies so they could roam around yet keep in touch. It was extremely handy to have.It is a very international clientele which to me was really fascinating. Hopefully you can speak a little spanish or learn a little there. Most speak english, but it's nice to make the effort. For those with children - the beach has topless women of all shapes and sizes and ages. Having 13 yo boys (and husbands) made for some interesting times. The shows at night were really corny, but the star friends are so happy and enthusiastic you can't help but laugh yourself. Plus you're sitting outside in paradise getting waited on.I didn't see a lot of people tipping there and I noticed no difference in service for tipping or not tipping.They are building a new resort next door. I never heard a sound on the beach. Our rooms were right next to the wall and even then it wasn't that disturbing.The entire family, minus me, went on the ATV trip and had a blast. I got a massage at the beach while they were gone. Having been to similar resorts in mexico - the moon palace in cancun and the riu palace in PDC - it is similar, though I believe the food is better at this resort.
