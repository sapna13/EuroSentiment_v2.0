{"text":"Must go to Excellence!!!! Just returned from a 5 day stay at Excellence for our 4 year anniversary. It was truly excellente!!!! I have been studying the reviews on a daily basis before we left for D.R., so I feel I was ready for anything! All of the bad reviews are just from Americans who are used to the Ritz Carlton in Palm Springs, Florida! Remember people, you aren't in the US anymore!!! First and formost I want to address the infamous drive from the airport to the resort. While it is in fact a long drive, we enjoyed every minute of it! You get to actually see the country for 45 minutes. You see how people live, animals, and mountains in the distance. I will, however recommend getting a private taxi at the airport for this drive. We bypassed the bus full of people and went straight to a taxi stand. All you say is Excellence Punta Cana and agree on a price before you leave. Our price was $60 one way. So $120 roundtrip and completely worth it! We were on our way within 2 minutes of picking up our luggage. We didn't have to wait on the bus to load everyone on and also drop people off at their resorts along the way. The roads are also not as bad as the reviews said. Again people, you are in a 3rd world country! Now to the resort! It was beautiful! We booked the Excellence Club Oceanview room. We enjoyed the club ammenities very much. We were on the quiet end of the resort which was nice. The room was very clean. We never had issues with the air conditioning and never lost power. Our ocean view was not a complete oceanview but that was no big deal. We spent all of our time at the beach anyways. The staff is very friendly and some speak english very well and others not as well. They are always cleaning the resort! We were amazed at how much they cleaned!The food was good. Yet again you have to realize that you are not in the US! Some food was different from what you would get here in the states but just keep an open mind and you will enjoy! We liked every restaurant. When you get to the point where you just want some American food go to The Grill. We ate steak and french fries and it was wonderful! They even had A1 for all of us steak sauce lovers! :) As for the gorgeous ocean, yes it is very choppy and rough at times. If it gets too rough there is always a life guard there that will personally come tell you to get out. We loved walking down the beach to the right of the resort(I think they said it's only 300 ft) and the water around the corner is like glass! No waves what-so-ever! We enjoyed this area of the beach everyday. The only negative thing on the entire vacation was the pool float hogs! They would get their floats and keep them at their chairs all day! We saw one woman dragging 2 floats to her chairs so nobody could use them! You either have to be like them and get to the pool early to stake your claim, or just give up and enjoy the pool floatless! All in all we loved the Excellence Resort and would recommend it to any couple that wants a quiet romantic vacation. We are in our mid twenties and enjoyed everything! There were couples there from their early twenties to upper 60's. Just go with a positive attitude and you will have a wonderful time! If you go looking for things wrong then you will probably be miserable.
