{"text":"Truly grand at the Grand What a great place to stay. Quiet location but less then 10 minutes from La Ramblas (although why people want to go there is a mystery as it is dirty,crowded and full of tourist traps from the relatively innocent to the criminal. See other reviews for details of scams and thefts) and Port Olympic. The tourist bus stops right outside the hotel (22euros for 2 days which covers the main city sights). Overall an excellent location.The hotel is chic, cool and welcoming and everything is finished to an excellent standard. It does lack Catalan atmosphere but it scores on quality and convenience and the rooftop views are spectacular. We stayed in a Premier room which had a large king size bed and a marble bathroom with jacuzzi bath, twin sinks and walk in shower. On arrival the jacuzzi bath wasn't working but was rapidly fixed and we were sent wine, water and chocolates by way of apology. A nice gesture.The breakfast was included in our room rate and proved to be a good move. The buffet was excellent both in quality and variety. The restaurant staff were excellent indeed all staff we encountered were very helpful and courteous as you would expect.I travelled with my wife and 5 years old daughter and in this part of the city we felt safe. We previously stayed at the Hilton near Barcelona football ground which is also a safe part of the city. I have to say there are some areas I would not wish to stay i.e La Rambla, Placa de Catalunya and parts of El Raval which all take a turn for the worse at night. Port Vell is on the doorstep with it's shopping mall, aquarium, mini fun fair and restaurants so it was ideal to stroll over there in the evening and have things to do that we could all enjoy to varying degrees. The beaches are about 15 minutes walk away or you can use the tourist bus.The highlight for me apart from the overall Barcelona experience (it truly is a great city) was simply wandering around the Gothic quarter and sampling the atmosphere.We will be back and while tempted to maybe stay close to Passeig de Gracia next time (just to get a third perspective) I think in the end if I can get the right deal again (we paid 200 euros per night including breakfast) I would stay at the Grand again. Make your reservation with confidence.
