{"text":"Comm. Ave. is a work in progress... My daughter is at Boston University, literally across the street from the hotel. My experience stems from roughly half a dozen stays over the last 30 months.Location: Back Bay means different things to relators, visitors, and cabbies. The hotel is a couple of blocks north of Fenway, across a bridge over the Mass. Pike. Road noise is an issue, so you may wish to book Comm. Ave. side to reduce it. Unless you're sleeping in on a weekday. Commonwealth Avenue has a long term construction project at the west end of Kenmore Square. (They took down an old bus depot, and in another five years, they'll put up...a traffic light with three trees?) The hotel's web site is accurate. Kenmore Square is a beautiful stroll, but it is east of the hotel. You'll have a view of Barnes and Noble across the street. Still, the T' (Green Line) is right next door, easy to navigate, and able to get you downtown quickly. Pru Center and MFA are a decent walk.Rooms: Basically two types of room, deluxe and junior suite (they have the real kind, but those price out of the range of almost anyone who actually reads on the Internet). The junior suite is a bed room next to an open sitting room doubling the size, with a full wall curtain you can pull to separate the two. The sitting area has its own tv, writing desk, free Internet, comfortable leather club chairs, and an ottoman. Hall noise can be an issue that could easily be solved if guests actually recalled that they were, well, guests. But then, self-absorption has reached pandemic proportions in our country, so why should things be different in a hallway outside a series of bedrooms? Talk as loud as you like. So what if it's two a.m.? The game's over; you had six beers; we WANT to know what you said to that chick you followed to the girl's room. Service: Many of the employees are hotel school students from BU, trying hard, but not often sure how to handle the off-speed pitch (OK, my last baseball metaphor in the shadow of Fenway), like a request for late check out, etc. There is a support staff contingent from the Dominican who are extremely helpful, despite the disrespect I have witnessed from some guests. The restaurant adjacent to the lobby is uneven and pricey ('Hey, it's Boston, whaddya' expect?'), but on its good days it is a fresh sea food bistro that should probably not try to serve breakfast. Of course, any hotel that stocks L'Occitane in its bathrooms starts ahead of the pack. And they keep a large stock of DVD's at the front desk which you can borrow if you'd like your kids to curl up and watch a movie. The treat? Free goodie bag for the kids to go with their flick.Price: Depends on when you go, dramatically. Junior suite on January 1-2? $195\/night. Same room during Head of the Charles weekend? Add $400. Is $600 (taxes included) too much for a spacious junior suite with free Internet, writing desk, black and white postcard photos of Red Sox of yore? Probably. But the same room, give or take, at the Four Seasons downtown is $1100 (Hey, it's Boston, whaddya' expect?)Bottom line: a reasonable, but lesser alternative to the Four Seasons\/Ritz Carlton options closer to the Common. If you're destination is Fenway or Boston University, this is the ONLY option for upscale rooms, products, and service. Just keep reminding yourself. It's cheaper than the Common, and less crowded than Cambridge.
