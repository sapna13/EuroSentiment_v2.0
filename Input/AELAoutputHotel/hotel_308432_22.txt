{"text":"What an amazing place I loved this hotel from the moment we got there to the moment we left. I stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks while on a holiday to hong kong. The hotel recration facilites were great, the hotel offered tennis, tabble tennis, basketball, snooker, golf, archery a gym and many more. The hotel has a freeform lagoon style pool; which is massive, and also a childrens pool with two slides; both pools protected by trained life gaurds. Just across the complex is the beach which has beautiful gold sand and is also protected by life gaurds. There are plenty of nice places to eat in the hotel; the hotel has four restraunts,bars and cafes, all to a high standard with cheap prices, if you wanted to venture out of the hotel, you can take a short walk (dont even have to leave hotel grounds) to the golden palace shopping centre which offers great places to eat such as ' chilli and spice.' Our hotel room was perfect, 1 double bed and a huge king sized bed. The room contained a large widscreen tv a safe we had 2 sinks a standing shower and a beautiful deep bath. The house keeping were great they made the beds and cleaned the room every day to a very high standard making it spotlessly clean. The hotel it self is very grand, there is marbel every where but it is just the right touch; not to over powering. The Lobby was beautifull, there were fresh flowers, a water feature a lobby shop and many more. As you walked into the hotel a smartly dressed hotel bell boy opened the door and greated you with a smile. The hotel staff were brilliant there was not one grumpyface, they were all so helpfull friendly and looked after your every need. All in all this hotel is an EXELLENT place to stay wheather its for two day or to weeks; this is the place to stay ; yes it may not be situated bang in the heart of the city centre but who wants to be on top of the hussle and bussle of millions of people on Nathon road and any how the hotel offers a free bus servise to the guests back a forward to the city every hour on the hour, so its no hassle at all.
