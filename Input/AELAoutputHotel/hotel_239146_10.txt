{"text":"A very nice little hotel on a quiet street I really enjoyed staying at this hotel for a variety of reasons. Downtown Amsterdam (aka City Centre) is just a little too crazy for my tastes. I preferred being just a little bit out of the mania (read, 'not too close to the dope dealers and porn shops') and in the Museumplein (the museum district). There are families with young children living on this street as it is mainly residential. Tram # 5 was just 23 blocks away and I could get downtown in a matter of 20 minutes.Cab fares are ridiculously expensive in Amsterdam. It cost 35-40 euros to take a 20 minute ride from Schipol to, well, most anywhere in Amsterdam. We were able to take a stoptrein from Schipol to Amsterdam Zuid railway station (15 minute ride), then we got off, bought a GVB Tram ticket, hopped on a #5 train headed towards Centraal Station and got off at the stop named Roelof Hartplein. This costs less than 8 euros per person. Depending on traffic, either the train\/tram or the cab could be faster.All of the staff were warm and friendly. Breakfast is included and it is simple yet good.The rooms are small by US standards. The internet access was fast and reliable on floor above the main floor (Americans would say it's the second floor but the hotel called it the first floor). I was told that the internet was not good on the 4th floor. BTW, there is a small elevator!I would stay here again, and if they were booked up, I would try to stay in the same area ","annotations":[{"endOffset":11,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":7}]}
