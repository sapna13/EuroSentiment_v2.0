{"text":"Great hotel and location I had stayed at the Palace a couple of years ago on business and loved it, so when my wife and I went for a long weekend getaway to Madrid, it was our 1st choice. Check in was easy and the room was great, although last time I had a room facing the front of the hotel, this time it faced the side and at night (near mid-night) we could hear the sanitation workers removing garbage cans.The staff were helpful and we got a good dinner recommendation from the concierge (Asadir Fronton). Otherwise, we mostly wandered around and found our own restaurants so less reliant on concierge. The hotel lobby and rotunda restaurant live up to expectations. The hotel is in a great location and walking distance to many of Madrid's best sites. We took a day trip to Toledo on the RENFE - but suggest that you book tix for the 30 min train ride in advance - there's a travel agency around the corner from the Palace that can do it, as trains were full. One disappointment is that we planned to visit the Prado, esp the new wing on Sun morning, but learned that the museum (maybe all museums in Madrid) is free admission on Sun, so there was a huge line. Instead, we left the line, walked to Retiro Park where there was an interesting exhibit in the Crystal Palace and then to the Museo Reina Sofia. We would definitely stay at the Palace again, although would pay for a city view .
