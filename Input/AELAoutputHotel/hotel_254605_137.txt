{"text":"Almost perfect Extremely convenient location to everything, the hotel is at the southern end of TImes Square and right across the street from an entrance to the Times Square subway station. The rooms were very simply but nicely decorated, nearly hip. The rooms are New York CIty small -- if you're not used to that, you will be surprised. Upon arrival, we were given complementary Saratoga spring water and the staff was very helpful, including looking up something for us on the web. A complimentary continental breakfast is served in the bar in the morning, but it's pretty skimpy -- OK if all you want is a bagel and coffee.There are two negatives that would prevent me from saying the place is perfect. The first is that our room (there are 2 like this on each floor) faced 41st St, and the outside noise level is quite high (the hotel is only 6 stories). When Rent gets out next door, there are occassional street musicians which add signficantly to the noise level, and the hotel is right across from the service entrance to one of the new high rise buildings, so the trash pickup is pretty noisy at midnight or 2:00am. Ask for a room in the back, unless you can't stand your window facing an airshaft.The second negative regards the reservation. All the hotels are doing yield management to charge the highest rates they can, and the rates can change from day to day. I had a 4 day reservation ranging from $309 to $359, made through the hotel, and between reservation time and visit time they lowered the $309 nights to less than $250 (and they raised the $359 night to over $600) on their website. They would not let me keep the $359 night and rebook the others at the lower rate, even though it was all booked directly through them, and I asked them to do this several weeks before arrival. I could have faked them out by cancelling and re-booking the lower nights in my wife's name and maybe having to change rooms, but ended up just leaving it the way it was because my company was paying for it. This is bad business on their part, because I'm coming back in November but booked somewhere else where I know they are more customer-focused regarding reservations.
