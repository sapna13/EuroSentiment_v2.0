{"text":"Perfect Little Hotel The hotel is located in the Latin Quarter, near the Sorbonne and Notre Dame. I had a non-smoking room on the 2nd floor, which was larger than I expected. I had a double bed, desk, large closet, large bathroom with a tub and a chair in the corner. There was plenty of room for me to walk around and keep my luggage, although I'm on the smaller side and a couple may find it a bit too cozy if they plan to spend a lot of time there. The hotel has air conditioning which I used, not only because it was warm, but because I had to keep my window closed at night - there is a lot of activity outside.The hotel was steps away from the St Michel Metro station, and close to a lot of shopping. There are a large number of cafes, restaurants and bars in the immediate pedetrian only neighbourhood. I was travelling alone and even walking at night I wasn't afraid - the neighbourhood is very vibrant and busy.There is a dining room on the ground floor where there serve breakfast in the morning. it was included in the price I paid on Expedia, so I took advantage of it. Everything was fresh - eggs that you could boil to your liking, cereals, milk, yogurt, ham, cheeses, pastries, bread, croissants, jams, honey, nutella (in cute little individul size serving packets), orange juice, coffee, tea, hot chocolate.... They serve breakfast from 7:30 - 10:30 and I'd recommend going early when its less busy.The hotel was very clean. The front desk staff was very helpful and friendly. I was able to check in when I got to the hotel at 9am, which was wonderful. I was able to shower and change before my first day of sightseeing. There is only one elevator and it's small - I used the stairs except when I was carrying bags\/luggage.The only word of warning that I have is with respect to the television. The tv (a small one, by the way) had 17 channels, with programs in French, English, German and Italian. At night, a couple of the channels show some movies\/programs that you would not want your children (or yourself) to see! Beware if travelling with your kids and if they have their own room.Also, the hotel does have a computer in the lobby with internet access, but it was unavailable during my visit. I was not traveling with a laptop (if I recall, wireless access may be available in the hotel), but there was a huge internet cafe a few blocks away, which was quite reasonable.I highly recomment this hotel if you're looking to stay somewhere and don't need to be grand - great location, good value, very quaint.
