{"text":"Nice hotel, some minor issues I was travelling with a friend and we stayed at this hotel during a recent trip to the LA. We found it quite a pleasant stay, though there were a few small issues.The hotel is conveniently located near Hollywood Blvd, the Kodak Theater and Grauman's Chinese theater. Universal Studios is also within easy travelling distance by public transport or taxi. There is also a small group of shops across the street (the pizza place is great!)Upon arrival (on a Friday afternoon) we were unable to check in as we had arrived several hours early. They were happy to look after our luggage while we went and explored the area. We came back a little before check in time (3pm) and sat in the lobby for a while until a room became available. While we were there, some kind of building inspector arrived and from what I could gather, needed to ensure that the hotel was within regulation (something about ceiling height).By the time 3pm came around a room was available and checking in was a breeze.We were allocated a room on the 6th floor but be aware that the elevators only go up to the 5th floor, at which time you need to go around to another set of lifts to get to the higher floors. Unfortunately, the second set of lifts were not working at the time so we went back down to reception and they had to open up the staircase to we could get our suitcases to our room. The elevators were fixed by the time we decided to go back downstairs (about an hour later).The room itself was really nice, clean, modern and comfortable. The complimentary wireless internet service was good, though it did slow and drop out from time to time but comparatively speaking it was better than the last hotel we stayed at.A buffet breakfast was included with our stay and it was delicious! But you have to get up relatively early - breakfast closes at 9 so if you sleep in you'll miss out.During my stay in LA I lost my credit card, so I immediately cancelled it thinking that the hotel had already charged it. I booked the room through the Holiday Inn Express official website www.hiexpress.com and upon booking it says specifically:Reservations require full payment for the entire stay at the time of booking. Fully non refundable. Prepayment is charged to credit card between time of booking and day of arrival and is non refundable.As my card was lost AFTER my day of arrival I assumed it had already been charged and I promptly cancelled it. Upon checking out, I found that this was not the case, despite the official website's statement (which was also repeated in the confirmation e-mail). We ended up paying for the stay in cash which significantly depleted our funds for casual spending.Overall it was a good stay. The staff at the hotel were The hotel staff were polite and friendly at all times. Despite the issues we experienced I would possibly stay there again if I were travelling on the same budget, although if I had more money to spend on accomodation I might try the Renaissance Hotel down the street.
