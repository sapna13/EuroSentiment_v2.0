{"text":"superb choice for Hong Kong This is a great mid-range hotel to stay in for a visit to Hong Kong. As others have already mentioned, the location is almost perfect for Tsim Sha Tsui.....just set away from the busy and noisy Nathan Road but seconds away from Knutsford Terrace. Ignore the stuff about difficulty in getting to the hotel because of the hill......if you cant manage this slope then you really shouldnt be even contemplating visiting HK.Superior rooms are very spacious. Bathrooms excellent with better shower than any US\/UK hotel I have stayed in. I only had the hotel breakfast once; although it is 66 dollars it is convenient. 65 dollars\/hour broadband access is available, although there is a Pacific Coffee Company nearby (on Nathan Rd just as you turn left from Kimberley) that has free internet if you buy a coffee (supposedly.....many people dont).If you do choose this hotel, then dont get a taxi when you arrive at the airport. It is far easier and cheaper to take the Airport Express to Kowloon Station and then get a shuttle bus to the hotel, or get a taxi from Kowloon station to the hotel. Easiest thing is to buy an Octopus card straight away and load it up for use on the Airport Express.The concierge service is pathetic. You will rarely see them and even when you do they go out of their way to be useless.It takes only 5 minutes to walk to the nearest entry point for Tsim Sha Tsui MTR.....again, if this is too long, should you be in HK? Add another 10 minutes for the Star Ferry Pier and you have all the transportation options you need within 15 minutes walk.If you want a boutique\/5 star\/stunning harbour view hotel, then this aint it. For cleanliness, quietness and convenience of location for the budget traveller, this is the best.
