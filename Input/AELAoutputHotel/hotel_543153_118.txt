{"text":"huge telephone bill We stayed 5 days at the casa camper. the service was nice and very helpful. However there were two flaws. One of them is that at the day we checked in at the hotel, we asked how much it will cost to make international calls. The girl at the entrance told us about $1 for every 5 minutes which sounds very reasonable, and not a rip -off price as many hotels are taking. However when we received the bill at the end of our stay, we had to pay $23 for 13 minutes of call time. There were a few calls that no one even answered (e.g. a 3 second call for $0.40 and no answering machine answered).The other issue is that our friends stayed in Barcelona and they came to visit us, and the hotel personnel let them in, while at the end the bill showed $14.10 for this visit. Nobody told us that there is a fee involved for letting our friends in. We should have known this fact before letting people in.Besides these flaws the stay was ok, but the hotel is very simple and the price (235 euro) is definitely not worth the stay. We stayed one night at the marina hotel which cost a little more (280 euros) but was definitely a 5 star hotel. If the free food is important for you, think about all the delicious food that you can taste at the streets of Barcelona. This hotel is nice, but the price is too high for what you get, and for me it is very important to get the real facts before you pay (telephone and friends visit). ","annotations":[]}
