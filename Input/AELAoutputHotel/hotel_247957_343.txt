{"text":"Best Vacation My wife and I spent 7 days at this resort and we are still talking about what a wonderful experience this was. Since the moment we walked in they received us with complimentary drinks and took care of our suitcases. The service was excellent at all restaurants and bars that we went to. We enjoyed so much the lasagna at the Italian restaurant, Via Veneto, and the Arrachera at the Mexican restaurant, La Hacienda. In particular, Junior at La Hacienda, and Santiago at the bars were very friendly and very competent servers. The pool was always clean, with plenty of benches to lay on it, and the pool bar was so much fun. The food was very delicious, we can not forget the restaurant at the beach, which had a buffet for lunch totally equipped with different types of seafood, chicken, meat, vegetables, salads, and deserts. The night shows were very enjoyable, since every single night they had a different show to entertain the crowd. The Piano Bar talent show was so good because it gave people from the audience a chance to show their talent. Miss Flamenco was also pretty good because the candidates were girls spending vacation at the hotel. Last but not least, we would like to say that the crew in charged of beach games and the animation headed by Michael, Williams, Natanael, and Arely is very competent and very likeable. They work very hard at the beach with the sport games given anybody an opportunity to compete. They also ask people to dance regardless of the age and make that person feel special, even if they do not know how to dance. My wife and I would definetely consider this hotel for a future staying. We give it an A+ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":825,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":819},{"endOffset":825,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":819}]}
