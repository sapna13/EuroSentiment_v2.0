{"text":"A Great Find I found this hotel in a New York Times article about travelling in Europe on a budget. Housed in a beautiful old house, this hotel has been magnificently renovated with all the modern conveniences. The rooms were spotless, featured new beds, furniture and bedding, laminate flooring and large well appointed bathrooms. The AC worked great - which was a blessing considering the 35+ degree heat and the fact I had just spent a week in London where air conditioning seems not to have been invented yet. The walls were thin enough to hear movement in the hallways, but I never heard noise from other rooms, nor was there any noise from the street. Another nice touch was the complimentary postcards which featured a photo of the hotel building taken at the turn of the 20th century. The staff was friendly (all spoke english too), the snack and drink machine in the lobby was handy and the over-priced internet was useful (walk a few blocks to puerta del sol and you can find any number of internet cafes that charge half as much). For 50 euros a night for a double room (albeit during the hotel's low august season) this hotel was a steal. Im surprised after being featured in the new york times it wasnt booked solid. Moreover, the location is perfect, the Plaza Mayor right outside the door, and within walking distance (about two blocks) to Puerta del Sol, the centre of Madrid. I'd definately stay here again.
