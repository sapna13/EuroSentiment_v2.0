{"text":"Mixed Experience Got back on Sunday and am missing their beds! The hotel is excellent at what it does and I am glad to say that overall it deserves a high ranking on TA - the basis on which I went with this hotel.Check in was a breeze, although I must add that we arrived at like 4.30am so I wouldn't really expect anything else!The rooms, we first stayed in the Deluxe rooms for 5 nights before upgrading to a couple of suites for the last two nights, were very smart and done to high quality standard. Not sure the suite's are worth the hike in the price as they dont differ enough from the usual rooms i.e. you get more floor space and a kitchen area but the furniture is pretty much the same deal and the standard rooms do it so well anyway. I suppose with a longer stay, we could have appreciated it more. One thing I will stress though, is that the beds are awesome! I am not usually so taken with hotel beds, normally they are good and you can get a good nights rest. But these were off the scale. The down pillows and duvets were just right on the mark for me to the point where I ended up asking where I could get them from!Facilities wise, the gym was nicely equipped, changing rooms incorporating a sauna, steam room and hot tub were great. As was the outdoor swimming pool on the 42nd floor.Restaurants were pretty much what you would expect from a hotel of this calibre and nothing more or less.The Club Lounge was excellent. It was organised and maintained throughout the day and during the night. The massage chairs are excellent for helping to relax after a hard day of sightseeing\/shopping\/conferences! The only real downside for me were some of the staff. They were not rude or impolite or anything of that nature but it seems that quite a few of them struggled with understanding my requests. If I asked for an extra coffee cup, the first response was for them to send up more coffee and sugar. Asked the concierge to help book a restaurant at Disneyland hotel, he gave me a brochure...I thought it might have been down to me but the fact is, the staff in the Lounge were absolutely excellent and I had no problems with them on similar types of requests. Not a great concern as I would be far more worred if they had attitude problems but they didnt.Location-wise, I found the hotel to be excellent. Right in the middle of a number of attractions, it was extremely well served by the MTR (on its doorstep) , its own shopping plaza and nearby parks. The only thing that put me off about the experience was the smells of Mong Kok. Its an 'interesting' mix of sewage, cooking, incense and other smells that can leave you gagging for oxygen.Luckily, this is not the case within the hotel complex but be prepared for it almost as soon as you hit the streets!That aside though, I absolutely loved the place, the hotel was fantastic overall and worth the price.If I am ever back in HK, I will be looking up Langham Place again.
