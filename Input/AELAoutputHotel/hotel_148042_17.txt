{"text":"Nice Place, But horrible Service The grounds and the room were in very good condition. A freindly staff greeted us upon arrival, and checkin went very smooth.Our only real complaint was the overall service. We really expected to get great service and be pampered. That is not what we got. Absolute minimum time to get anything is 30 minutes. When we got there, we went out by the pool and ordered 2 bottled local beers. They are $8 each, and it took 30 minutes to get them. We were 25 feet from the bar, so needless to say the next round we went directly to the bar. Then we tried to order a sandwich from the bar, 45 minutes later our cold sandwich arrived.The next morning at breakfast the trend condinued. I went and ate down the street where the prices were reasonable, but my mother opted to eat a $25 fruit plate. It took 45 minutes, and we had to ask twice where it was, just for a fruit plate.The beach in front of the hotel is in good condition, and they provide chairs, umbrellas, and towels for you to use free of charge. The pool area is also very nice, again towels and lounge chairs are available.The hotel is very close to the airport, so be prepared to listen to them all day long take off. Didnt seem to be an issue at night, luckily we could not hear them in our rooms.Room was in good condition, marble bathroom, and a very comfortable bed.We ate most of our meals off site, because of price and poor service.
