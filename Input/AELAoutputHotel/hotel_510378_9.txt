{"text":"Perfect comfort Firstly, the pictures on the Gaylord Suites (www.CITISUITES.com) site caught my attention, and secondly most of the reviews listed here seemed positive enough to go ahead and book for a week. I can honestly say I am very pleased that I did.Arriving straight from SFO international in a taxi was only 30 minutes at 4.15 p.m. so traffic was not heavy, and between myself and my two companions was only $50, with tip, very good. The entrance to the building feels very Nob Hill and the receptionist lovely. Check-in very smooth and then it was straight into functioning old elevators to my suite. I arrived at the third floor to a clean Hispanic-looking lobby and turned the key. Immediately I was impressed with the clean smell and the space for a single occupier or a couple. Exploring the delightful Art Deco tiled bathroom and small kitchenette leading onto a comfortable queen sized bed in a large living space, not to mention the wonderful walk-in closets, I felt quite at home. Super hot shower, large TV, and i-pod radio alarm clock, only added marks overall.Do not be put off by the negative comments because of the Tenderloin area, just turn left at the bottom of the street, Union Sq. 5 Minutes! I had no problems walking straight down Jones to Market St. if only to catch the tram out of town or to the Castro!Overall, an excellent location for walking around the city, shopping, dining and returning to lounge in comfort before doing it all again. Very secure building; no callers after 10p.m. I have been to SF quite a few times and have no hesitation in recommending Gaylord Suites for singles or couples. I am going back in July with friends to stay there again. If they keep up this standard, watch this space.Ian, Edinburgh.
