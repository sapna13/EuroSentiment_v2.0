{"text":"Chesterfield Mayfair - Service like no Other Stayed at the CM for 7 nights, the first 3 on business. As we booked about 20 people into the hotel plus used a conference room for 2 days we received an excellent rate, otherwise may not have been able to afford this hotel due to very poor exchange against CDN $.Hotel selected by exec assistant in London, but was happy to see it ranked so high by Trip (which I now swear by as the definitive hotel reference site in the world - yes you heard it hear.)The CM staff cannot absolutely do enough to make your stay the best possible. We requested a room with two beds, and although we were upgraded to a junior suite (sweet) the bed was a double that was not split. They had just upgraded the room and converted two small singles into a jr suite. In a few moments staffers were in the room fixing the bed.The room had so many amenities it's hard to list them all. Many bottles of fresh water were made available daily, each evening a complementary hors d'oeurves were provided (smoked salmon; quail eggs), and also newspapers. There was more.Like all hotels in Europe, rooms on the small side, even the jr suite. My only negative is that the rooms at the CM seem to be a bit overdecorated and a bit too much stuff crammed into them. The staff are incredible, and the concierge will do anything and everything to assist. You will do best to take their advice on local restaurents and the like. They are the best!I would caution you on booking rooms that face the next door courtyard, on Friday or Saturday nights as they often have functions there (it's a very classy club of some sort), and the music can go on to 11:30 at night. We had to request a move of rooms due to this, which the hotel was able to accomodate right away. We were lucky they were not 100% full, which they can be.The location could not have been better, and what you could not walk to (which was not much), you could easily tube it via Green Station. Breakfast is highly expensive at 18-20 GBP per person, which is about $40 CDN, and quite absurd at that price. My wife found an excellent place for breakfast two blocks away on a small side street where you could get a perfectly great eggs, back bacon, toast and coffee for about 5 GBP. Look for Le Strada, in a side street just off Berkely Square. There is a Starbucks right on the corner. I have no reservations highly recommending the Chesterfield Mayfair, it is spotlessly clean, very quite (when no parties next door are going on), and has exceptional staff. Pictures on the website and are representative, but always make the rooms seem larger than they really are (in all cases, not just here.)
