{"text":"Five Fantastic Nights in Punta Cana My husband and I just spent 5 great nights at the Occidental Grand Flamenco All-Inclusive Resort. From the moment we arrived, we fell in love with the resort, its accomodating staff and great food. It was our first time doing an all-inclusive and we were a bit apprehensive about the quality we'd receive, based on reviews we read previously online.We were pleasantly surprised to find out that what we read was for the most part, incorrect. Our room was very clean and typically-appointed for a beachside resort. The cleaning women made sure we had fresh towels, a clean floor, made beds, a well-stocked fridge with beer, soda, and water each day. I highly recommend leaving $5 a day for the women; they work hard and do an excellent job of keeping the room tidy and adequately stocked of necessities.The grounds were immaculate. It didn't matter the time of day, there were grounds crews cleaning, mopping, painting, etc. I was ashamed to see that many of the tourists would leave their cigarette butts and\/or empty drink cups on the well-manicured grass instead of dropping the items into the numerous and well-placed garbage cans. The groundspeople worked hard to clean these items up as soon as they would see them.As for food, seeing as it is a beachside resort, was more copius than I could have imagined. We ate mostly at the beachside restaurant, the main restaurant (International Buffet), and at several of the a la carte establishments. The International Buffet, the main restaurant if you don't sign up for one of the a la carte restuarants (you sign up each morning for that evening's dinner), has an excellent and diverse array of European, Carribbean and American fare. They don't offer the same dishes twice in a week, which means you could eat only off the buffet and never eat the same meal. The offerings are fresh and of high quality. A one night offering may include roast chickens being carved per guest, grilled mahi mahi (also known as dorado or dolphin fish), steak, and another fish being served off the grill, tons of fresh and sauteed vegetables and salads, two dessert stations, one soft serve ice cream station, and a crepe station. There was a pasta station with several sauces as well. The amounts you could eat depended upon your appetite. As you finished a course and went back for more, the servers would clear your plates, replenish your drinks, etc. At no time do you feel as if the quality of service or food is less than excellent.The a la carte restaurants offer great cuisine as well, thought I would have to say that the Italian restaurant had excellent antipasti and desserts, but the main courses lacked flavor. The beach itself was amazing. We preferred to spend the majority of our time on the beach, where the breeze off the water, mixing with the lull of the waves and shining sun made it truly paradise. If you're into activities, there are numerous and varied free activities offered on site as well as off site. You can even take a daily 30-minute Basic Spanish class! We don't have kids, but the kids we saw seemed to love the daily kids-only activities offered.I am no expert, but I have travelled extensively through Europe, Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. and also worked in high-class restaurants for ten years. I would highly recommend this resort to anyone who has never been out of the U.S., would like to eat well and enjoy the scenery, and may be apprehensive to speak another language. Although some Spanish would be helpful, the main staff speak English and provide service with a smile. I highly recommend geeting people with at least Hola (Hi) and saying por favor (please) and gracias (thank you) to show you have respect of the culture. It really makes a difference.I also recommend buying any cigars or jewelry on site at the hotel's stores. The staff are friendly, knowledgeable and will work with you to get you the best deal. We checked out the proces we paid versus the prices at the airport and we saved a bundle.-If you do go, please stop in to the jeweler's next to the Cigar shop and say hello to Glen. He's a big Mets fan and is extremely helpful in finding the perfect gift for yourself or someone else.Lastly, go with an open mind. Like anything else, it is up to you as the traveller to determine what kind of trip you will have. Be flexible, open to going with the flow and you should have a great time.PS: Don't forget lots of sunscreen-the sun can be brutal on skin! :-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":663,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":659},{"endOffset":663,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":659},{"endOffset":663,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":659},{"endOffset":2121,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":2115},{"endOffset":2159,"mention":"soft serve","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soft_serve"],"startOffset":2149},{"endOffset":2169,"mention":"ice cream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream"],"startOffset":2160},{"endOffset":2159,"mention":"soft serve","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soft_serve"],"startOffset":2149},{"endOffset":2169,"mention":"ice cream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream"],"startOffset":2160},{"endOffset":2190,"mention":"crepe","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cr%C3%AApe"],"startOffset":2185},{"endOffset":2217,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":2212}]}
