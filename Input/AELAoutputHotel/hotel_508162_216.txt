{"text":"Great place but...... Let me start off by saying that I have traveled abroad many times and this was my third visit to Punta Cana. That being said I broke down the review to give insight on various parts of the resort. I just returned from Dreams Punta Cana on Sunday July 13th. I spent one week there. I overall had a great time and the place is very pretty. The one negative is they over book the hotel which I will get into later.Check In: Let's say it didn't go well. I had booked a VIP 2 bedroom suite and they sold it out before I got there. The staff was confused and at a loss what to do. They showed me various other rooms not getting the concept that is not what I paid for. I had myself, my wife and three sons (9,6 1 turning 2) and they tried putting me in a honeymoon suite with fold out beds and crib. Eventually we accepted a pool view w\/ two connected rooms which where very nice and they gave me five free nights for a future stay for my inconvenience. Not bad.Concierge: They are useless unless you need something done in your room or need a bell hop. Remember they work for the hotel and if there is a problem with a booking like in my situation you will get no where fast except seeing various rooms. My suggestion is book through a travel agent\/travel service such as Apple Vacations or Travel Impressions. We used Travel Impressions (VIP Travel) and they were great. From transportation to setting up tours. Sharon who is a sweet English woman helped me settle my room dispute has major pull at the hotel. One speaking with her and my problems were over.Grounds : The hotel itself and grounds are beautiful and are well manicured. There are flowers, palm trees and ponds every where. You will definitely get a lot of nice picture shots here.Beach: The beach is nice but the bad part is that it is on the ocean side which has waves and current. If you are looking for calm\/crystal clear water like Grand Cayman you will be disappointed. However if you walk to the left past the water sports by a few feet it is much nicer. The waitress service on the beach is very nice and they are serving all day. There are also a lot of lounge chairs unlike many other resorts and you can always find a chair.Pool: The pool is the crown jewel of the hotel. It is massive and the landscaping throughout the pool is very pretty. The pool bar area which is right by the beach and Sea Side Grill is gets packed fairly quickly due to the location and the fact the entertainment staff hold a lot of activities here. The middle area is much more accommodating for people who just want to relax quietly or read a book. The top area of the pool is more kids friendly with the iceberg climb (my kids loved it). There are floats available but not many so bring your own or you can buy in the gift shop for like $10US. The chairs by the pool go super fast so you will have to reserve them early. I hate doing this but it is just how it works by the pool. If you wait to after breakfast you will not get one..I guarantee it especially the huts (covered with bed style).Food: the food is good for the Dominican Republic and much better than the other resorts I stayed at on the island. It is not United States cuisine. You are not going to get New York level food. But overall very good. I like the Sea Side Grill the best.Staff: very friendly and mostly helpful. The entertainment staff is great especially Mickey Mouse (little crazy) and Fifty Cent. The best is when we told them in passing my little one was turning two while we there. They actually told us to go the night show and sit in the first row where they brought my son on stage sang to him and gave him a cake. That won me over.Overall I recommend this hotel but just make sure you are covered with a travel service. That is my only complaint. If you have kids you will love it.
