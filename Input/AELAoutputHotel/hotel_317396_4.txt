{"text":"Great value I had never been to Hong Kong before and was a little anxious to be landing in a large unfamiliar city alone. I wanted to stay somewhere that was central and safe. I definitely made the right choice with the Evergreen! While definitely NOT FANCY, it was clean, safe, and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. I got the airport transfer and that was good too, as I was worried about finding the hotel because I arrived at night. The Evergreen is VERY well-located for public transport and for seeing a lot of the things Hong Kong is renowned for (eg. markets)I was grateful for the free breakfast. Again, this was hardly what you'd call 'gourmet' food but it definitely did the job and there was plenty of it- as I was trying not to spend too much money, it was a big help. The internet was really fast and there always seemed to be a free terminal whenever I needed to use it.My room was pretty basic. The bed was quite hard and I got a little cold at one point and had to ask for extra blankets - I think maybe the air conditioning was up too high. And I had a lovely view of a brick wall out my window. So, not exactly glamorous!Overall, I would say if you're looking for a place for a romantic getaway or a luxurious relaxing holiday, then the Evergreen is not for you. But if, like me, you just want a clean and convenient place to store yourself while you're asleep so that you can get out there the rest of the time and explore the city, then definitely consider it.
