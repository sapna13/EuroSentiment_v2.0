{"text":"Great Hotel but Transitional Neighborhood I travel extensively for work, and stay at Marriott-brand properties about 125 nights a year. I've learned what to expect from these hotels.This Courtyard is one of the nicest I have stayed in, anywhere. From the outside, it's really beautiful and upscale, MUCH moreso than you'd expect from this brand. The lobby and pool and also really beautiful.My room was standard-issue Coutyard 2007, meaning lots of creamy wallpaper, attractive furniture, and a nice bed. The bathroom was also great. The room was sparkling clean.Overall, the property itself is terrific....BUT, step off the property and it's a different story. It's located in one of those neighborhoods that realtors politely call transitional. Looking out of the hotel in one direction is an old factory that looks like it's been abandoned for decades, the back of a Best Buy in the other direction, the hotel parking lot in a third direction, and the back of an old Howard Johnson's in a fourth direction. I got lost a few blocks from the hotel, and when I called for help, the front desk person asked if I was next to the projects. Next door to the hotel is a really nice, new Power Center mall with a Target, Best Buy, Olive Garden, supermarket, Applebee's, etc. The convention center is also a fairly close drive, especially if you learn the back route to get there.It seems as though the city has worked hard to redevelop this area, but the hotel and the adjacent strip mall are about the only bright spots for many blocks in all directions.Loved the hotel, but the location kills the place. What a pity.
