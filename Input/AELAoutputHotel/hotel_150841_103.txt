{"text":"Great Week Went to the Iberostar Bavaro with my boyfriend. Overall a great week. The room is huge and the bed is really comfortable. We liked the couch on the balcony. Check in was fast, I asked for a room near the beach and got a perfect spot, just near the pool and the beach and far form the construction work.Food is all right but we both got sick. We went to the Grand Palladium last year and the food was better there, they had special themes everyday so the buffet varied a lot. The buffet at the Iberostar is pretty much always the same everyday. The grounds are superb!! They also have many birds all over the place, flamingos, peacocks... There is a coral reef just in front of the hotel we went snorkelling there and it was awesome! So exciting to see all these exotic fishes. The beach is just perfect, the water is cristal clear, not much seaweed soft white sand.. They also have jacuzzis at the spa and it is very relaxing we went there almost everyday. Pool at the Bavaro is nice but we went to the pool at the Iberostar Dominicana. It doesn't have a pool bar but the set up is much more fun. You have access to the 3 iberostar resorts so it's worth checking it out.The people working there are very friendly, we had a nice service everywhere we went. Some bad things: The animation at the lobby is super loud and you can't really enjoy your time there if you are not interested in the shows. The drinks are not really good even at the lobby. Usually you get better drinks at the lobbys but not there. A pina colada is just a sweet slushie with some rhum. We saw a cockroach in our room. We went to complain at the lobby and they sent somebody right away. She sprayed the entire room and we did not see any more after that but it sure broke the magic. I know just one is not too too bad but I chose this hotel for the good reviews and because I did not see any reviews of roaches, so I was really disapointed to have one in my room.So that's about it, I hope this review helps.
