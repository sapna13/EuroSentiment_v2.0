{"text":"Brilliant hotel, shame there's no pool though. The easiest way to the hotel from the airport would be to take the free shuttle from Kowloon station. Unfortunately this shuttle is infrequent and doesn't run during late hours, so we took a taxi which whisked us there within 10 minutes.This hotel looks fabulous on the outside as well as on the inside. Located along the busy cafe-filled Kimberly Road and directly beneath trendy Knutsford Terrace, the hotel is in a comfortable in-between if you're looking for a weekend away without busting the bank to stay on Hong Kong island.The service here is good, proven especially by the restaurant staff who still served us despite being in the midst of shutting down the breakfast counter. The breakfast itself was average, but came inclusive with the rooms - I only stayed for 3 days so it wasn't quite enough time to get sick of the food.The rooms are very clean and perfect for maximum of 2 people (if more than 2 make sure you book one of the deluxe rooms!). The bathrooms are teeny but very well decorated. Absolutely love the shower's sparkly floors and the rain showerhead! View was nothing to speak of but if you really wanted view you'd have to pay a bomb at the intercontinental.Proximity to TST MTR is good which makes travelling anywhere easy!All in all a great place to stay apart from the lack of a pool - but on a weekend trip who has time to swim anyway?
