{"text":"quiet paradise my wife and i as well as my brother in law and his wife just got back from the princess and thought i would write this while it was fresh o in my mind In one word terrificwe arrived late in the day half hour by bus ,check in was fast and efficientgot our luggage to our rooms in quick time and went looking for food .it was noted that beach bar was the place to go but for whatever reason was closed that night .But the staff told us to go to the main buffet .it had the beach bar menu and was very good and the beer was cold.tired,we went to our rooms and were greeted with a large suite with king bed, fruit basket ,free rum and three cigars.I normally have trouble sleeping in a strange bed but had no trouble here at all,slept like ababy.We were in building 5 on the ground floor and we overlooked the pool,with the bar straight ahead.unlike other people we had no trouble getting the same 4 chairs every day by the pool , usually by 8.30am.the beach was very clean and the sand was soft and pleasant.allways chairs available, and the beds were a nice touch.Though you needed v.i.p. for these it was well worth it.Food the buffet was always with a different assortment, and at night had a new item on the carvery. my only complaint would have a better variety of desserts.of all of the a lacarts we only went to 2 but enjoyed them so much we went twice to both. The tex mex did a great steak, just dont order med rare it came out mooing ,but the corrected it and the chef even came out to check, again great service.mare nostrum is great we had lobster and it was very good.Also the when you are finished you are offered afterdinner liquers the pool bar is terrific during the day ,and i found nelson and fransico very friendly and well versed in mixolagythe lobby bar is nice at night with the animation team getting people involved . a great server there was dayanra? she was always friendly and fast. dont forget these folks live for tips so dont shy.all in all if you wish a vacation that is quiet and laid back, then this spot is for you .
