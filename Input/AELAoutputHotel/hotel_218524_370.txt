{"text":"perfect honeymoon in every way I read more than a hundred reviews of this hotel and was very scared y some of the comments but decided to go nonetheless. Me and my new wife went on our honeymoon and i was expecting the average resort but thought this would just be nice due to the fact that it was adult only. the whole week we had zero problems with the room, the resort, the staff, or any of our excursions. people complain about the drive. it is not that bad at all. its about an hour but you get to see the country. i will admit many parts of the country are very impoverished, have trash scattered, and the drivers there are very courageous with passing but not once was i worried about getting into a wreck. i actually really enjoyed the rides around the country to different locations.  The beach was by far the best attribute here. the whole country is covered in palm trees and the sand is cleaned daily so it is very soft on the feet. unlike other areas in the carribean this beach actually has waves that you can swim in or merely enjoy listening too. another plus is that these are natural beaches. many resorts make their beaches look pretty in pictures but are hideous and muddy in person.i have stayed in many other all inclusive carribean resorts and the beach at the excellence is unbeatable.  The food here was also better than anywhere i have ever stayed. we ate at almost every restaurant and were never disappointed. i recommend the italian or the asian restaurant. When they say all inclusive they really mean it. all the food, including 24 hour room service(fast by the way)is free. The minibar is restocked daily with beer, sodas, water, snacks, and any liquor you want. I recommend the excellence club room. The minibar is upgraded, you receive free movie rentals, you have access to a 24 hour indoor buffett, as well as a better spot on the beaches (2 different styles of beach beds). When i saw they have beds on the beach i was thinking they would always be wet or at least gross. these beds dried very quicly, are cleaned daily, and the cushions were very comfortable. i fell asleep multiple times on these beds. If you are on your honeymoon definitely get the honeymoon package(free with ocean front excellence club jr suite or higher). The dinner on the beach included chapagne, steak, potato, and lobster. on your first night you get flowers, fruit, and champagne. The package also includes champagne breakfast in bed, more than we could eat. And te best part of the package is the couples massage. they first give you a feet exfoliation and massage then they take you to a room together where you can both get a 50 minute full body massage. this massage was excellent for both of us and the spa itself was very nice.  The nighty shows are hit and miss but include a michael jakson show and a circus. while you watch on very comfortable chairs a waitress brings you all the drinks you want.  There are many moderately priced excursions to go on, or you can pay a taxi 80 dollars to take you anywhere you want for 3 dollars. I recommend going to higeuy. This city has a beautiful church, and shopping. or to saona island, the beach is not amazing but the water is very blue and the catamaran ride is fun with included rum, beer, and food. The whole resort was nicer than any (including others that were much more expensive) i have ever stayed at. This resort had excellent beaches, no drunk teenagers, fast service, great food, and wonderful workers. My honeymoon was absolutely perfect. my wife was very pleased and i have never seen her happier. i had zero problems the whole week, that is until i got back to the states and expected equal service at a hotel here.* Mosquitos are here so remember to bring bug spray.
