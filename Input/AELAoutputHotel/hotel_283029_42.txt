{"text":"Fab Hotel We booked to stay at this hotel as a treat for my husbands birthday. We got the train from the airport (20 mins) and then got the tram (either No. 1, 2 or 5), we would recommend anyone to travel this way very clean, cheap and easy to use. We arrived quite early so our room was not ready but they were more than happy to keep our bags for us, we were also offered a free welcome drink which we could have then or later from the bar so we decided to wait until the evening. As the room was not ready we went out for a walk the Hotel is ideally located for the main leidseplein square (5 min walk) where you will find all the main bars and restaurants, and lots of good shops. We had dinner one night at a Restaurant called November which was very tastey and very reasonably priced (would recommend). In the main square there is a bar\/cafe called The Bull Dog which do fab pancakes of all types of variety great for breakfast, You can also get your 'smokes' and space cakes\/hot chocolate!! if your in to that sort of thing from downstairs in the bull dog which is great.Back at the hotel we checked in about 3pm and were advised we had been upgraded which was a nice suprise and our luggage had already been taken to the room for us which was a nice touch. The room was lovely the bed was huge, there was 3 flat screen tv's one for the bed area 1 in the sitting area and 1 in the bathroom. The Bathroom as a spa bath and a rainfall shower which were fab, the room was very clean and modern with all the mod cons, snazzy coffee maker (you need to ask for suger!) ipod holder, telephone, use of bathrobes (free of charge!) lovely fluffy clean towels. We enjoyed our free welcome drink from the bar when we went out that evening so we both had a glass of wine (you could choose anything though!) On my husbands birthday I had put some balloons up for him and left his cards out on show and when we arrived back in the afternoon the hotel had left us a bottle of champagne on ice which was fantastic and another really nice touch!. Unfortunatelty due to the weather we had, we didnt get to use the outside area but it looked really nice water features and great decking would be lovely in the sunshine!.We didnt have breakfast as we did feel this was a little pricey and it was much cheaper to get something in a local cafe.Overall I cannot fault this hotel and the staff are happy to help nothing is to much trouble, we will definately return here.
