{"text":"City Hotel This hotel is too big. Huge check-in for main tower and quite confused to walk about if it's your 1st time.What was great was the Yahoo Cafe that provides internet access if you purchase one standard drink and you can use the internet unlimited. If you get tired, you can eat, drink and smoke in the cafe and then continue your internet surfing again.As the hotel check-out time is at 11 am, you will find yourself 'too free' while waiting for your scheduled train timing. So the Yahoo Cafe will be handy 'cos you can do 'messenging' with your family while waiting to go home.I have no interests for shopping for Yahoo Cafe in this hotel suits me well.I got myself a bigger room that I would have expected for a single traveller and that's just one thing I didnt like about the room - the woman in the picture frame. The 'eyes' kind of weird and i couldnt get to sleep well the whole night.However, I was lucky to get a drink machine just outside my room so it's very convenient.As for breakfast, they have 6 venues as they have many towers and therefore, it was kind of difficult to decide and I ended up with the main tower - ground floor. Food was OK but too crowded and i would want to escape from the place quickly when I was done with my breakfast. What was sick for me was that I have to get my own coffee 'cos the restaurant was simply too big and too packed. ","annotations":[]}
