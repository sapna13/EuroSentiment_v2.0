{"text":"No reservations We have stayed at many Sofitel hotels around the world and are very surprised that this hotel carries a reputable brand like the Sofitel. We have stayed in this hotel previous visits to Bali  whilst it has never been a 5 star hotel, we have seen value for money. The standard of this hotel has dropped significantly and we would find this hotel barely rating a 3 star currently. Contrary to some previous reviews the new hotel complex being built adjacent to the Sofitel does affect the experience. You have a construction site working 24 hours around the clock that is visible (particularly from the pool area), noisy (from half of the hotel rooms) and the hotel management seem to be very reactive to the situation. They closed the pool bar down over the period we stayed there. We received a notification that this was due to the weather however having been a guest at this time of year many times, we have never had the pool bar closed. The breakfast area used to be lovely overlooking the pool  the ocean. Instead breakfast is in a underground room that has been unused for years. There is a musty, damp smell  one morning the ceiling had fallen in. The airconditioning does not work throughout the hotel. If its not the airconditioning, its the phone, or the shower. There is always something broken. All in all, the sofitel has a great location  could be a fabulous hotel. However, a complete renovation with costs not spared is desperately needed....followed by regular maintenance. ","annotations":[]}
