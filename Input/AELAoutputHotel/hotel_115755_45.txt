{"text":"Let Down! Looking at the hotel pictures and wonderful reviews I was looking forward to staying at this hotel. We booked with hotwire and on arrival the receptionist could not find our reservations nor was a room ready. We were told with a sickeningly fake smile to kindly move away from the desk and she would call us when a room was ready. Three hours later no call we went back and were able to get a room. I asked the same receptionist if we should reserve the free shuttle for later on that afternoon into the city she said no just call half an hour before. I called at 4PM and was told it was all booked up until 7.30... couldn't believe it. We ended up paying for a cab downtown there and back. The bedroom was so small there wasn't room to swing a dead cat. The bed was a full size and was only just big enough for the two of us and we are slim. The bathroom was miniscule and it was difficult to close the bathroom door due to the small size and toilet being in the way. Was very claustrophbic and we were happy to leave after two days. Outside of the hotel is run down it didnt look safe and there are lots of transients walking around. My husband said he saw a homeless person buying drugs from a cab driver right outside of the hotel. The only decent thing was the free breakfast. Oh and the coffee shop closes early and is closed on Sundays. Not worth the money stay somewhere else.
