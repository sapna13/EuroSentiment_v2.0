{"text":"Great Family Retreat A friend recommended us the Hotel as a great family retreat venue. We booked 3 rooms and the hotel took the initiative to assign us a set of connecting room and another room nearby. The edgeless swimming pool at the roof-top was simply delightful. One can just relax and dip in the pool and watch planes flying by. Our little ones were simply amazed by it. You feel as if the planes are within your reach.There's also a pretty koi pond in the hotel premise. We felt it a calming area with trees around it to shade the area.Overall the hotel is well maintained, the service staff were helpful and our rooms were clean, of decent size and the room decor is just pleasing - a mix of simple retro and yet modern chic. The hotel served a large selection of buffet breakfast, which we felt was pampering rather than the usual local items in hawker centre. The seafood BBQ is also a must try. in local seasoning. The sambal to go with the squid was 'shiok'. An activity that MUST go with staying at the Changi Village Hotel is - A day-trip to Pulau Ubin. After we check-in, the family headed to the nearby jetty, took a S$2 bumboat across to Pulau Ubin. We all rented a bicycle each and cycled around the island. There was much to explore and sightings on durian trees were not uncommon. Return after all the work-out to chill out at the hotel's pool. The family simply enjoyed the easy, pleasant, reasonably priced short getaway without the hassle of carrying a passport!
