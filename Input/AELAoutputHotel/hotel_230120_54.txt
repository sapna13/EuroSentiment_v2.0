{"text":"Great location, Perfect Beds I stayed for six nights in a junior suite at the Sofitel Amsterdam at the end of Aug\/beginning of Sept. Here is my synopsis:Pros: The bed. I would venture to say it was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in while traveling - and I travel at least one to three months per year. Best nights of sleep I have had in a very long time. I never heard one outside noise the entire week. Even if there were no more positives, the bed was worth the entire stay.The location. It amuses me that someone would book a hotel within a 5-minute walk of the Red Light district, in a city where smoking marijuana in public is accepted, and then fault the hotel for reminding them of the seedier side of Amsterdam. We walked the city every day for a week and never even happened upon the Red Light District - literally forgot to visit it! And the smoking coffee shops are everywhere in the city - not just on the same street as the hotel.That being said, I found the location perfect for the first-time traveler to Amsterdam simply because it's in very close proximity to many of the places a new tourist visits. It's about 3 blocks from Central Station (walk or pay 15E for a taxi!), it's around the corner from Dam Square, and there is a tram stop directly in front of the hotel - it truly doesn't get anymore convenient than that!The staff. Although I wasn't sure at first, the staff (for the most part) turned out to be helpful and courteous. We were treated with respect and kindness no matter what we asked for or needed to know. As with most European hotel experiences I've had, they don't actively jump in and offer to help, but they are there when you need them. One thing I greatly appreciate about Amsterdam is that most people in the service industry speak perfect English.Cons:The lighting. I agree with the other reviewers that the lighting absolutely needs to be improved in both the bedroom\/living areas AND the bathroom. My friend's room next door was even worse - and that was before two of her lightbulbs burned out.The fitness room. Although it is a treat to be offered a fitness room in a European hotel, this one isn't worth calling a treat. A recumbant bike whose seat would not stay in position, a rowing machine, and a thing to do crunches\/sit-ups. No free weights and no paper cups for the water fountain. It needed an eliptical or treadmill or both!The Internet. T-mobile - need I say more? I spent a small fortune to have access for a week here, then went to Prague and got 24\/7 wireless for free.Other than that, I found no fault with Sofitel Amsterdam, and although I probably would not stay there again (because I always like to try other parts of a city when I come back), I would definitely recommend it to any first-time visitors. I thought it was a good value, great location, and the pros definitely outweighed the cons.I'd like to add that if you are a chocolate lover, you absolutely MUST walk to Puccini at Singel 184. Simply the best, IMHO. It's no more than 10 minutes to walk from the Sofitel.
