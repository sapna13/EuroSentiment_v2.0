{"text":"Palatial comfort at the Sofitel I stayed in the Sofitel for two nights in mid-September. When I arrived at about 10 p.m., I was fairly tired after ten hours of commuting from Dublin through Boston to Washington. The executive in charge behind the check-in desk asked me whether , in view of my lengthy journey, I would like to be upgraded to a suite. I quickly accepted this kind offer without realising the full extent of its generosity. When the bell boy opened the door to my suite (which simply bore an ordinary set of numerals on its door), I noticed a beautiful hexagonal hallway with two beguiling paintings on the walls. I followed him down a long corridor, past a palatial marbled bathroom complete with its own anteroom, into my bedroom which housed one of the most comfortable beds known to mankind.On checking through my rooms ten minutes later, I realised that it was the Presidential Suite and that it also contained two sitting rooms and an office complete with mahogany consultation table and fax machine. Paradise found ! Faced with this Utopia, I asked myself Where's the catch ? But there wasn't any.I found all of the staff in the hotel to be charming, friendly individuals. The hotel boasts a chic bar on the left hand side as you enter the building and the jewel in its crown, Cafe 15, on the right hand side, where I had breakfast on the second day of my stay. It's a bright, airy room with a number of eye-catching paintings. The breakfast was served with panache by a waitress with a broad smile and the good food on offer was consumed with gusto by yours truly.All in all, I had an incredibly memorable stay at the Sofitel in Lafayette Square. It's situated literally five minutes walk away from the White House and the Washington Monument is within easy striking distance. Although I do not expect an upgrade of the same calibre next time I visit a Sofitel, I love their way of doing things and I will return to them again and again.
