{"text":"Pick A Different Hotel Now This was my husband and I, second trip to Puerto Rico. We bragged about the island and invited family with us this time to experience the reason we LOVE coming here. We were so excited about the hotel history and location! So upon our arrival to the hotel we were greeted by the bell hops and taxi people. And we thought WOW they are excited we are here. So as we proceeded to check in to the hotel, the receptonist was very rude, as if we have interupted her evening! So we thought okay she is having a bad night. When we got into our rooms we thought nice lay out. As we started to scan the room we noticed that it was not fully cleaned!! Food was left on the floor, personal items left under the night stand in clear view from previous patron!!!! Carpets were soiled! Bathroom shower curtain what a joke, your better off leaving the curtain open! The curtain was WAY SMALL!!! Every time you turned on the shower it would open!!! The hotel was a meat locker, literally!!!! So for the week we stayed there the maid service came in to do their duties, but they still never picked up personal items in clear view, or the food that was still on the floor. So that only leads me to believe they just do pickup after guests. So I question myself on the bedding?? The visit to Puerto Rico aside from the hotel accommodations was GREAT, many things to do and see! The food was exellent in Old San Juan!
