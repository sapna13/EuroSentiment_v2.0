{"text":"Go to Mexico instead! My wife and I have traveled the world and found the DR to be our least favorite place. We stayed at the Dominicana which is a basic resort  not a 5 Apple as suggested by Apple Vacations. The front desk staff was borderline rude and not helpful. We had problems with our phone and they basically told us that they would not fix it. The staff although friendly does not go above and beyond as was the case at other resorts and cruises we've visited in the past. I spent the 2nd day confined to my room with a stomach virus and a fever with the chills. We ate at the Mexican rest the night before. The food was terrible. We are from the US northeast and admittedly spoiled when it comes to food choices but in comparison to other vacations it was bad! Meats were over cooked and everything seemed to be slopped into a tray. Many times there were no cups or plates and we had to wait before we could eat. Couldn't wait to come home to eat. The room again was basic. The tub had chips in it and rust stains running down. The phone did not work correctly and the air cond either runs on 1 of 3 settings or is off, it does not turn on and off by itself. If you enjoy staying at the beach later then most be prepared to take a cold shower when you get back to your room. The maid kept leaving the sliding doors unlocked not sure if this was on purpose or not. Also be prepared to be harassed by locals to buy their products they are relentless. We took 4 excursions and they were all different. The Outback safari was the only great professionally operated one. The ATV's were fun but mine only had rear breaks and another guy had a flat tire, the tires on all ATV's were nearly bald. Avoid the Saona island trip. The beach at the hotel was much better. Saona island beach was rocky and god forbid you want to relax on the beach, locals will actually wake you up to sell you things. And the massage women just come up to you and dump oil on you and start rubbing you wether you want it or not. BE AWARE OF THE GYM. It's open air and equip is from 1960's and has the rust to prove it. It's above the spa and the worker at the gym lifted up the rubber mats to show us the holes in the wood floor underneath where weights had fallen through. The only saving grace was Bavaro Beach beautiful and fun. If choosing between Mexico and DR, hands down go to Mexico, Riviera Maya was great and Mexicans are much more accomidating! Good Luck!
