{"text":"For the most part GREAT Me and my fiance stayed at Ocean Sand from Apr. 14 to Apr. 21 of 2008. Check in- When they say check in time is 3pm beleive it. They don't get you in till 3pm and not a minute sooner. Rooms are very nice and spacious. We were placed in a backside veiw in villa 9 at first which the veiw was not the greatest at all but requested a move to poolveiw asap and got moved the next day. Much better veiw. Pools are very nice and HUGE!! If you like shade by the pool you usually had to get to pool by 8:30 am to place your towel on a chair. If you don't want shade then there are tons of chairs available. Food is okay. But watch for cleanliness in the main buffet. We saw them on more than 2 occassions grab dirty glasses that had been used by others dump the old drink out and rinse them under water very quickly then pour our drinks in them and serve us. So we ended up asking for plastic cups for the rest of the stay. Staff are very helpful and friendly! Grounds on the resort are BEAUTIFUL!!! Entertainment is your average resort entertainment which is ok. The saxaphone player they have in the lobby on certain nights is wonderful!! Oh and the photographers on the resort take absolutley BEAUTIFUL pics!!! One other thing is keep in mind that this is a very big resort and depending on where your room is there is alot of walking but there is also a trolley that goes around pretty much all day that you can catch a ride on. There are no specific times it travels. So when we were on our way to the lobby and it happened to be right there we took it and if not we walked. But the walk was always nice too because as I said the grounds are beautiful. The spa is very nice and fair prices. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend staying there to others. Don't forget to ask for plastic cups!!! ","annotations":[]}
