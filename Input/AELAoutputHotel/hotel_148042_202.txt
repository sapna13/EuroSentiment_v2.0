{"text":"Awesome Getaway! My boyfriend and I spent the long weekend of Feb. 16th at the Ritz and had a remarkable time! I've read many of the reviews before I left and honestly cannot believe some of the people that have negative comments. Either theyre too old to be traveling and should stay home or they must be very demanding (obnoxoius) people! The hotel is second to none.  We unfortunately were very delayed due to the snow storm in NY and arrived at 6am. We had to wait for our room to be ready but we were compted a free breakfast ($60) and were upgraded to an ocean view suite.  The pool was beautiful but we opted for the beach since there was more of a breeze from the ocean. There were a large amount of children there but I think most of them were in a day camp and even the ones that werent..were no bother. If you like to workout..they offer some good classes which are all included in your resort fee. I ran on the beach one morning which was kinda hard since the sand was so soft but nice nonetheless.  We ate breakfast at the restaurant every morning but if you do not want to spend the $ or do not want the continental breakfast they offer..there is a dennys right outside the hotel. We decided to eat at more authentic restaurants so we tried Baru in Old San Juan and it was delicious. We also ate at this small restaurant called UVVA. Its located at a hotel in Ocean Park (about 5 min away) called Numero Uno. It is just like Pamelas but less known and you can eat directly on the beach. Food was great and it was very romantic. All in all the Ritz was great and coming from NY..it was the perfect getaway weekend trip. We cant wait to go back!
