{"text":"Living Argonaut LARGE We really enjoyed our stay the ARGO.It was a rough start as we somehow found ourselves in the middle of the San Fran Olympic torch demonstration (imagine our luck).Once we arrived, we were treated extremely well, and the confines of the Argo are a peaceful sanctuary to the hustle and bustle going on in this tourist mecca (fisherman's wharf).First tip, valet your car if you have one. This is one of the worst places in the country to find a parking spot and the gougers are always looking for a sucker who will may 65 bones a day for a parking spot.. The 40 bucks you pay at the argo is well worth it. These pro's will literally stop traffic for you.Each day they offer free Anchor Steams in the lobby between 5 and 6 PM. They also offer wine, but since I know nothing about wine, there is no need to go any further. They also provide for you stay a 'snazzy' spa robe. 'Snazzy' being a loose term here that is used in a sarcastic way. These robes are seriously orange\/cheetah prints (how that fits in with the nautical theme i will never truly comprehend) and I think they might be for small persons, because I couldn't even get mine completely on. One size fits all.. i guess..The rooms are nice, especially for the age of the area. We had an ipod doc, nice bathrooms, comfy bed, good linens and all that stuff you would expect for 3 bills per night.Concierge, front desk and bell people were all extremely helpfull.I really enjoyed the chowder rest at the argo, we ate breakfast and dinner there. Room service was ah-ite, nothing spectacular.Across the street is Cioppinos, which is a great restaurant. Scomas is a short walk and has extremely gratifying seafood (and Amstel Light on tap). Drink a pint at the Buena Vista (staggering distance), with a nice view of the Golden Gate at sunset.Watch out for BushMan (the street performer), he will scare the crab outtaya.
