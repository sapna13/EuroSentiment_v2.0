{"text":"Rien a redire Stayed at the NineZero because they had a great deal on Expedia. I have stayed at Kimpton Hotels before and never really enjoyed it. The decor is usually flamboyant and has a cheap feel to itself. Here, the style is very toned down. I stayed here on business but it is a great leisure hotel as well. There is a cemetery across the street where Samuel Adams a buried. On a less morbid note, you'll enjoy Park Street T station with the red and green lines, proximity to Faneuil Hall, Public Garden and Copley place which you can walk to in about 15 to 20 minutes. The staff is very sweet. Always very polite, obviously very well trained. Smiles abound. The one thing that really prompted the 5 out of 5 rating was the room service food. As much as I was not particularly impressed with the breakfast, I absolutely loved the room service dinner food. I asked for a fruit salad which was not on the menu but that was not a problem. A superb salad of very fresh fruit was delivered within 15 minutes. A true delight. I also had the best French Fries in a very long time. Oh, and when I asked for a rare steak, guess what, it was delivered rare! All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. Do not expect a 5 start, this is only a 4* but a 4* with no glitch, a rare occurance in the hotel world.
