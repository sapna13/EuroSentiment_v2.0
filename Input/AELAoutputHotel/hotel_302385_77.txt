{"text":"Just a huge resort that could have been anywhere. During my stay in Bali, I spent 5 nights at Nusa Dua and several nights at other hotels in Bali. The Nusa Dua was a nice hotel...both the room and the beach. However, the hotel did not even compare to the more traditional hotels where I stayed, including Tandjung Sari in Sanur. One could spend a week at Nusa Dua and have no idea what Bali is really like. In fact, this hotel could be in Mexico or anywhere else there is a beach. The hotel is located on a peninsula with several other major resorts (many of which appeared to be nicer). This area seems to have been created solely for tourists. It is not located near anything in particular but an outdoor shopping mall, which only tourists appear to frequent. One needs to take a taxi ride (about 12 bucks or so) to get to the other areas like Kuta or Seminyak. More more Ubud or Sanur.The food at the resort was below average and overpriced. The service was frequently bad. Other services such as internet and laundry were fine, but again, overpriced. I made a couple of short local calls that ended up being very expensive.Overall, the room and hotel grounds are nice, but I did not go to Bali to stay at a hotel that could have been anywhere. You may enjoy swimming in the pool and sitting by the beach, but know that you will not experience Bali.
