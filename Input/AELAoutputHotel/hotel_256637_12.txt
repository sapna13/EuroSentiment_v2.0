{"text":"Great hotel This is the second time we have stayed here, it was great last time and it was great this time too. Rooms are big, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have much of a view but since the hotel is in the city it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really matter. Bed was big and comfortable, large flat screen TV, DVD player. Bathrooms are the big plus in the rooms at the Sheraton, large with marble floors, bathtub and shower. There are lots of facilities within the hotel as you would expect, business centre downstairs had free internet access (4 pc). Great covered pool on the roof too.Staff very friendly and efficient, sometimes in hotels of this size staff can be a bit snooty but in both our stays here we have never found this.The hotel is about 20 minutes easy stroll to circular quay and the rocks, nice restaurants (we tried Zia Pina in the Rocks and although the food was good the staff were rude as they leaned over you while eating) although perhaps not as many as you might expect. Buses and taxis are plentiful if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to walk.We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have breakfast at the hotel (usual high prices) if you exit at the rear of the hotel onto Castlereigh Street and turn right there is a nice place for breakfast - Take a break caf√ã√\u2022√ñ, approx $14 for a full breakfast (not Sunday), turn left there and is a Subway sandwich shop. We wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hesitate to stay here again when in Sydney; we got what we think it a pretty good rate direct from the hotel ($220\/night).
