{"text":"close to excellent After months of reading about DR and Excellence PC, we finally made the trip. June 10 to 15thThe resort is as dramatic as as anything I've seen throughout the Carib. The beach is clean and very pleasant. The property is very nice, We had room 14006, a ground floor, ocean view suite at the end of the property. This worked out great for my wife and I. So great in fact, that I elected to stay in this room instead of taking the Excellence Club room that I had reserved and PAID for - lol.Only down side of this trip was getting to DR. USAir has such a small operation at DFW airport, that asset management is weak at best. Long story short - if it were up to USAir, I'd still be in the rebook line at the airport.An unplanned aspect of the trip was flying into Santo Domingo opposed to delaying 24 hours to fly from DFW to PUJ. I elected to fly into Santo Domingo to save a day of our trip. The cab ride from Santo Domingo to PC was about 3.5 hours and a couple of fender benders - but never the less an experience.Consider going to the Don Lucas cigar company - a small cigar rolling operation. This is not a structured excursion, but ask Johnathon at the excursion desk to arrange a private visit. All considerations - the trip was great and if I need another downtime excursion, Excellence PC will be considered.Last, but not least, I have tons of photos, but none are unique to all of the the other great photos already posted - ","annotations":[]}
