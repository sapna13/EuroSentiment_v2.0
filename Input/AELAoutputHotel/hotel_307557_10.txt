{"text":"Never wanted to leave Puri Bagus Firstly a thank you to Trip Advisor, without valued comments from your members my wife and I would not have ventured this far from Nusa Dua which we have visited on a number of occasions over the past few years. However this trip we wanted to explore the area of Lovina and from the positive feed back from those people who had stayed at the Puri Bagus a BIG thank you.What can I say, the area is beautiful, the people are fantastic and unlike commercial Kuta and coast filled hotels Lovina is just wonderful.Keep in mind that it will take you 2-3 hours to travel there from Dempasar but I promise you well worth the trip and besides lots to take in, feels twice the distance coming back the other way bacause you don't want to leave.The resort I believe has 40 stand alone units , quite large inside and each with out door shower, ours backed on to a rice paddy, short stroll to the main dining  bar areas which overlook the pool. Well maintained grounds and pool, again just a few steps to the beach, Bali Sea. Don't be put off by the black sand, it's only a few feet wide and the sea water is very warm.The local fishing fleet with their array of colored boats is well worth the 5 minutes walk to view and like us catch a few words with the local fisherman. Girls you'll love the spa and not expensive as with local eateries etc. Check out the Belgium owned restaurant in Lovina, meals are well priced and a good wine selection. If in doupt ask the local people, fantastic couple who own the local store on the main road to the resort, can also help in transport. Ask for Darma at the Puri, great guy as with the staff, if you do decide to visit I reckon 5 days will suffice and just long enough to see and do every thing for a complete wind down, enjoy..
