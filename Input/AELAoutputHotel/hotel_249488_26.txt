{"text":"Great Hotel - but expect to spend a lot We recently returned from a six night stay at Las Casitas, and were part of a group of 13 family members that included 3 generations. The accomodations were quite nice, and we really enjoyed the many pools, water park, and Palomino island, as well as the golf course. Some in our party used the spa for massages and hair\/nails as well. No real complaints to speak of, and overall I was very happy with our vacation. The resort is quite large, so depending on exactly where your room is, you can expect to spend 10 minutes or more getting from one part of the resort to another. Since the beach is on Palomino island, it is a bit of an investment in time to get there: walk to the funicular, take it down, wait for the ferry to the island, ride the ferry, and you're there. To be safe, leave 30 minutes or more each way: ferry ride alone is about 10 minutes but you need to be there early to get in line or you have to wait for the next one (they left roughly every 30 minutes). You should expect to spend a lot of money on meals, unless you use the kitchen in your unit to do your own cooking (not my idea of a vacation). For example, at lunch a burger with fries will run you roughly $13-15 and throw in another $6 or more for a frozen drink. Obviously this starts to add up quickly if you have a large group. We were there over the president's day holiday weekend, and although there were a lot of people at the resort, it did not feel overcrowded. By midweek many folks had left to go home. We at at Blossoms at one of the Benihana-style tables, and also at Otello's, the Italian restaurant. Both meals were quite good, in fact I was surprised at how good the food was. The service was quite good in the restaurants as well.Some other tips: * If you plan to go to the island\/beach when the resort is busy you will want to go early so you can find some chairs in the shade either under a hut or tree. * It may be advisable to make your dinner reservations shortly after you reserve your room, again depending on whether it is a busy time at the resort.
