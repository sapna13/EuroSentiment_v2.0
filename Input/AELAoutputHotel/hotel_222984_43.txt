{"text":"Good value for the price I found this room via Expedia but booked directly with the hotel online for a slightly better price. Our one bedroom suite consisted of bedroom with 2 double beds, an en-suite bathroom (the shower head\/pressure was one of the best I've ever encountered) and a separate sitting room with a mini kitchen (full fridge, microwave, plates and cutlery). Each room had a tv and the sitting room had a spacious desk and office chair with free high speed internet. No ethernet cable however but reception had spares available at no charge.The suite is lovely for 2 but was a bit tight for space with 5 of us. We had been relying on the sleeper sofa in the sitting room for which there was no linen on arrival. A call to reception illicited prompt delivery of linens and pillows by housekeeping. Unfortunately only when it was time for bed did we try to open the sleeper sofa to find there was no mattress...just a wooden block underneath the sofa cushions. By then it was too late to request a room change (did not want to pack and unpack at midnight) so we made do by just sleeping on the unopened sofa. The swimming pool is a nice size and there are tables, chairs and umbrellas poolside and a small jacuzzi. There is a free airport shuttle bus pick up\/drop off which seems to be driven by the receptionists of the hotel and runs every half hour. We asked for dining recommendations and were recommended a restaurant 5 minutes drive away called the 84th squadron. The receptionist offered us transport to the restaurant by the shuttle bus and told us to call them when we had finished dining and the shuttle would pick us up. Very nice free service but since obviously they do this outside of the airport pick up\/drop off schedule, it did cause us a wait of around 20 minutes outside the restaurant waiting for pick up. The 84th squadron restaurant was a lovely large cottage style building with good but not great food ranging in price between $15-25 for entrees. The kids and I each had a good size striploin steak for $19.95 whilst my husband had the pot roast for $14.95. The shuttle bus driver gave us a card entitling us to a 10% discount at the restaurant which was useful.The fire alarm went off at around 10pm and a handful of guests including us trundled down the stairs and back to reception to find out it was a false alarm due to someone burning toast in their toaster. We heard from another guest that this was the 2nd alarm in as many days so obviously very sensitive fire alarms or a not so sensitive guest!We did not partake of the free breakfast. The staff are courteous and helpful and I must say the $129 was money well spent for accommodation for 5 of us.
