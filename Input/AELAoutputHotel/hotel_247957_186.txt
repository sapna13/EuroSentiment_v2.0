{"text":"Great week of R  We were a bit concerned after reading some mixed reviews of this resort, but I have to say, we certainly did not experience any issues! We stayed at this resort March 7 - 14, 2008. The resort itself is horseshoe shaped and very large. We were in Building 26 - closest to the beach - which was our request. Our room and I believe the whole building, has been recently renovated and I must say was great! We had a junior suite which was ample room. Our fridge was stocked daily with bottled water and soft drinks, and if you happened to see the housekeeping staff and tipped them generously, there were curvesas (spelling?) (beer) in the fridge daily as well! The rooms were kept extremely clean!The a la carte restaurants - the Grill house which I believe is Brazillian was certainly worth checking out as it was different! After a salad\/soup buffet style start, each following course is served directly to your plate via large skewers which look like swords! The courses keep on coming! You aren't quite sure when it will end! The Oriental restaurant was excellent! Don't miss that one! Beautiful decor, and each course is presented to you beautifully - looks like works of art and too nice to eat! It was excellent and by far our favourite! Too bad it was our second last day we would have liked to go again! The Italian restaurant was not great at all, and I would skip it. My lasagna tasted ok, but looked like it had been made a few days prior and just reheated. My husband's chicken dish looked like something you would serve a toddler. Not a great impression. The buffet was great - even picky eaters surely would find something to eat! It is large and varied! Great pastries in the morning!!The beach - FANTASTIC! Lots of chairs, however, late arrivals - noon or so, may have had some issues finding chairs. We arrived at the beach fairly early in the mornings so it wasn't an issue. Yes they play save the chairs game here - towels etc on chairs and you never see the people actually show up to sit on them!Pool - looked beautiful, very clean and lots of people around them. We are more beach people, so didn't use the pools. Lots of entertainment around the pools, however there was lots of entertainment at the beach too.We were only able to go for a week this time, usually go for 2 weeks, so were very sad when the week was up! Our purpose was to soak up some sun, read a few good books and have great drinks - which we did in plenty!Oh - before I forget and don't want to forget - check out the Taco Bar and the Pizza bar located up the stairs by the Theatre! BEST shrimp tacos you will ever have! Pizza is great too! There is a bar up there as well, so we tending to hang out there in the evening and could watch the shows from there as well! Staff were very friendly and helpful - no issues whatsoever! Yes they are timeshare staff, and they want you to attend their Welcome presentation - which translates to please buy from us. If you just tell them no later, not interested they will leave you alone eventually!All in all it was a great place to go for a week of R  R. No complaints at all. The only critters we ever saw were a few small geckos. No mosquitos, no bugs. We certainly would have no problems recommending this resort and would return again! Any questions, please let me know!
