{"text":"On Second thought, great location . . . . When we first arrived at the Royal Plaza we were a little bit concerned about it's location, the coach from the airport kept dropping people off and we were the last ones, seemingly getting further and further from the action. (Quick tip, buy a return coach ticket from the airport, it's $40 cheaper than buying it at the hotel)However, once we established our bearings the Royal Plaza is in an ideal location to visit Hong Kong and see all the sights. The hotel itself has a very grand entrance lobby, check in was very efficent. The rooms are clean, spacious and have an in room safe. The bathroom was nice apart from the actual bath which if you're under 5ft 5 tall won't be a problem.The hotel is connected to a large shopping mall called Grand Century Plaza, it's right at the heart of Mong Kok in Kowloon and is also home to the bus station and a KCR station. It'll cost $5 each on the KCR to the harbour and takes under 10 minutes, alternatively it's a 35-45 minute walk (doesn't feel that long though as there's so much to look at).The hotel is minutes away from the bird market, fish market, flower market and Fan Yeun St. market.We had a great time and would strongly recommend this hotel and location. It's close enough to everything to make it easy, but far enough away so that the traffic doesn't keep you up at night. ","annotations":[]}
