{"text":"Good location for shows This was our Broadway trip, so we wanted a hotel that was close to most of the shows we were attending. The Westin fit the bill, and we got a good rate. We got an email from the hotel that we could upgrade to a club room, with access to the lounge for continental breakfast and evening snacks for an additional charge, so we did that. What we liked about the hotel is that every employee was very friendly, the beds were comfortable, the location was great, and the breakfast tasty and filling. We did not partake of the evening snack. Now for our dislikes. Part of what sold me on the Westin besides the price was the promise of the heavenly bed and the dual head heavenly shower. After being told twice to come back because our room wasn't ready, we were given a handicap accessible room with a handheld shower, but they didn't tell us that they were assigning us that room. When i noticed the handheld shower and roll in shower stall,no tub, I asked about it. The front desk person assured me that the heavenly part was the shower head, and it was the same on the handheld shower. Needless to say, that shower was just like my shower at home, nothing special. They did offer me a $50 house credit because I was unhappy. My room was not serviced, when I went out at 7 pm, I asked if I could just pick up some towels and wash cloths on the way back. They said that they would have them in my room. At 9:30 pm Housekeeping came by and wanted to clean the room. By this time, I asked her just to leave clean towels. Also, twice someone attempted to enter our room without knocking. We did have the chain on, but the door was actually opened. The second time I jumped up and went to the door to see if I could see who it was, there was no one in sight. It was really strange. In summary, because there are so many hotels to choose from in the area, and lots of them run specials depending on the time you go, the Westin Times Square will not be getting my business again.
