{"text":"Great Beaches!! We heard so many wonderful things about this resort but after staying there, we want to add a few items of interest for future travelers. We booked our trip through bookit.com. We had the Platinum Package which includes bottle of rum, fruit basket, unlimited room service and robes\/slippers. For those who want to stay at a nice resort, for relaxation, quiet nights and beautiful beach views, all inclusive with plenty of variety of food, this is for you.. We stayed in the 4th bldg, on 3rd floor, near everything, our balcony view was beautiful, we could see the ocean and the pool along with the gardens. Food at Fish restaurant was fantastic!! Service there was awesome! Other restaurants were very good as well, however, the a\/c didn't work in most and it wasn't much better at the buffet, always hot, not enough fans. Even the lobby area, with the main bar, was very hot at night, no breeze, not enough fans or ventiliation. Poolside bar was the highlight!! We made many friends there. Pool was immaculate. There were even ducks swimming in it every morning. Spa - a disappointment, asked for deep tissue, got a relaxation message instead. Therapist kept checking her cell phone for calls during the massage, ugh!! Don't go into town unless you want to be mobbed and insulted by vendors who want to take you for every penny. Distance from airport is about 30 minutes, rough cab ride will cost you $33.00 one way, no matter how many people need it. Service was excellent, front desk, concierge, maid, restaurants and bars. We especially liked, Jose, Elvis, Hector, Nelson, Altagracia, Ingrid, Anderson, Emilio. The beach was beautiful, white thin sand, you can walk for miles... awww!! Animation Team - RATING: poor. They should all be fired. They were more interested in their own activities and didn't do their best to interact with the guests. Volleyball games were fun, however one day we were given a damaged volleyball instead of another and we were told to use it, no one offered to get a new one. It was almost like the animation team worked for a 2-star resort... thanks to Fernando, we were able to get a volleyball and start our games again. Best Restaurant - Fish, Worst Restaurant - TEXMEX. Resort stores were WAY overpriced! There was really little to do on this property at night, we went to adjacent resort for shows, disco, etc. We want to say hi to Dave, Tiffany (thanks for the Tiffany Special), Todd, Adrienne, Bob and Terry. Lets keep in touch!
