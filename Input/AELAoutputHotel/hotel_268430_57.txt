{"text":"Three Nights at the Marriott Isla Verde San Juan Our visit to the Marriott Courtyard Isla Verde came at the end of a twelve day vacation in Puerto Rico. Our stay was Saturday, March 22nd to Tuesday, March 25th. It was strange that weekend vs. weekday it seemed like two entirely different resorts. Saturday and Sunday the hotel was extremely busy with a very mixed clientele. Many people in just for the Easter weekend at the Casino and the bars. I can't say I was a fan, too many people drinking in the pool and the hot tubs, extremely loud disco music at the pool, kids waiting at tables in the lobby for their parents in the casino, women at breakfast in the restaurant with curlers in their hair - overall a little too trashy a scene for me. Sunday evening and Monday morning it changed dramatically and became a much nicer vacation type hotel. The beach was nice, however the pool was a little small and in the shade most of the day. My twenty year old son took me down to the casino (I had never been to a casino before) and I found it pretty entertaining-he won $100. quickly at blackjack (on an initial $25 investment). The room was a nice typical business hotel room. Nicely decorated with clean and relatively new furniture and free internet in the room. We were on the third floor (room 322) with a nice view of the ocean over the roof. The breakfast buffet was good and reasonably priced ($13.95). We didn't try the restaurants for other meals. The people at the front desk were nice and helpful. Our express check out was wrong and when I went to check out the computers were down. Maribel assured me that she would take care of it and email me a revised bill. When I arrived home in Boston sure enough the corrected receipt was in my email. The hotel is very close to the airport, virtually on the runway and the takeoffs were very loud out by the pool. The noise from the airport wasn't noticable in the room since the patio doors were double doored (I have never seen that before). Surprisingly the cab to the hotel from the airport was $10. and our cab rides were all over the place in terms of price. Forget about the meters or the posted rates, cabdrivers would set their own price and there seemed to be money changing hands between cabdrivers and bellmen at the hotel. As example the first night we asked for a cab to the Intercontinental (about 4 blocks) and the fare was $10., the next night we went to the El San Juan Hotel (also about 4 blocks) and the fare was $8. the next night we went to the Embassy Suites Hotel and the fare was $10 but the return fare was $7, finally our fare to the airport (3 people, less than 1 1\/2 miles) was $16. The only part of this that reflected back on the hotel was seeing $$$ pass hands between the cabdriver and the bellman. The best part of the visit was that the room was free with my Marriott rewards points. In summary, nice place,nice beach, reasonable price, nice room, nice people. I would go back but I would be very careful not to go on a weekend again.
