{"text":"LOVED LOVED LOVED the Chancellor!!!! We stayed at the Chancellor from June 18th through June 23rd. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. The location is excellent - right in the heart of Union Square. With a Cable Car stop right outside the door and buses within walking distance it is very easy to tour the city with the Chancellor as your home base. I loved the old world charm of the hotel. Yes, our room wasn't the biggest room I've ever stayed in, but it was recently updated and really pretty. The huge walk-in closet provided a nice place to store our suitcases, bags, etc,. without cluttering up our bedroom\/sitting area. I especially loved the glass doorknob on the closet door. It reminded me of my Granny's house when I was little. The bathroom is small, true, but very efficient and ample for what needs doing in a bathroom. The bed was very prettily made with a very cushy white comforterand was extremely comfortable. The Chancellor offers a pillow menu, but my pillows were great so I didn't even consider changing them. 1103 is a corner room with a street view. I know that some people have complained about the street noise, but personally found it added to the ambience of the city. I loved going to sleep and waking up to the ding ding of the historic Cable Cars! I also have to give kuddos to the staff of the Chancellor. They were all so helpful and friendly. I enjoyed visiting with them very much. They were also very helpful when I was deciding on the best possible mode of transportation to wherever I was headed to on a given day. The free internet access in the lobby was a great way to stay in contact with home and I ate more than one delicious cookie that was available in the lobby every day. In short the Chancellor is a GREAT place to stay while visiting San Francisco!!!!!
