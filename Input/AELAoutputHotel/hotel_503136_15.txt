{"text":"Loved this hotel, excellant staff and nice district to stay in Fantastic hotel just north of the Gothic district of Barcelona. I can really recommend this hotel as a great base to explore Barcelona. Overall the staff are friendly and very helpful and the rooms lovely.Note: When we stayed they were re-developing most of the hotel which meant there was no restaurant\/bar or breakfast offered, but the hotel offered an excellant rate to compensate for this. We were advised that we would not experience any noise and as we stayed over a weekend we did not expect any, however around 10am on Saturday morning some building work could be heard, however Sunday was very peaceful.LOOK  FEELThe hotel is set in a building that was built in the late 1800's, and has a very modern and stylish interior. This can come across as cold if your taste's are not for the very modern!.ENTRANCE  RECEPTIONThe entrance is of a quite street in the Eixample district, with large windows to the front and a large lobby area heading to the back of the building.As mentioned above the hotel has a very modern interior but is very stylish, and we were greeted by friendly and efficient staff on the front desk before being shown to our room.BAR  RESTAURANTAs mentioned before, the bar and restuarant were shut for re-development during our stay, so I can not comment on the facilities.For breakfast you can use the local cafe's or the local supermarket near-by (turn right out of the hotel and go down one block before turning left)BEDROOMThe bedroom was modern, clean and quite spacious. The hotel offers a variety of bedrooms, ours was the front with a small balcony (not big enough to sit on though). At the back I think there are bedrooms with a terrace.The bedroom had a double bed made of two single's (which is the norm for this hotel, ask for a double and they will make the two singles into a double for you). The bed was large and comfortable.The room had Air-Con (although the minimum temperature was 17c), a TV with all the usual spanish and a couple of english speaking channels (BBC World etc..), a minibar, desk and chair.Minibar prices were quite average for this class of hotel.Internet access was available, but I did not use this, instead as I needed to book some tickets, reception allowed me to use there computer and printer free of charge.BATHROOMThe bathroom contained a bath and shower in one, although the bath was rather small, the shower was good with excellant pressure and plenty of hot water.Usual supplies of a combined shampoo and shower gel were provided and were of a good quality.The hairdryer was in the bathroom and actually worked (my wife's normal complaint! considering she has long hair)Towels were ok (my usual complaint) if a bit on the small side again!LOCATIONIdeal for visiting the Gaudi designed buildings of Casa Batllo and the Sagrada Familia. The hotel is located in the Eixample district near a whole street of Tapa's bar's.Also you can walk from here to the Old town and Las RamblasPARKINGNot used so not sure if the hotel offers parking.OVERALLFriendly and helpful staff in a lovely building, with excellant access to all the site of Barcelona. If I am visiting again I would stay again.
