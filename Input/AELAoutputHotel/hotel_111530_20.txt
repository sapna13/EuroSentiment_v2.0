{"text":"Service was terrible--Would not stay here again I stayed here for 4 nights in April with a co-worker for a conference. We were looking for the Adams Mark, and drove right past the Sheraton, and finally figured out that it had recently changed names. After a big hassle at the check-in desk over credit card issues, we asked to be in a room near our friends, and a nice front desk man, who was helping our friends, placed us in rooms right next to each other. Very nice. When we got to our rooms on the 16th floor of the South Tower, they ended up being suites! 2 suites for 4 people. That was delightful, as was the gorgeous view. The rooms were very nice and spacious with nice up-to-date furnishings.But the service in the hotel was atrocious. When we got there we had Starbucks coffee for the coffee maker in the room along with teas, cream and sugar, and 2 big styro cups. We had 2 glass glasses and 2 styro drinking cups. Although the cleaning crew left more coffee each day, they only replenished the coffee cups once, leaving us with coffee but no cups, and never brought new sugar and creamer, or new styro small cups, and I didn't trust the cleanliness of the glass glasses. They never brought new toiletries after the first day, and we ran out. The prices for food in the shop in the lobby were amazingly high: $3.50 for a water or a pop. There were pop machines at the pool and on our floor, but they were both empty. The $9.99 internet charge was ridiculous, so we used our laptop in the lobby to check our mail. We could not use the phone system to call our friend's room, or for them to call us. Our cell phones worked sporadically in the building. When we called the front desk, they never answered, Finally another dept would answer and transfer us back to the front desk again. We had to go to the desk and wait in line to ask about checking out. Then wait in a very long line, at least 30 minutes to actually check out and another 30 minutes to get our car out of the valet parking.
