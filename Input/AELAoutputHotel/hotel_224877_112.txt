{"text":"Elegant My wife, myself and 2 1\/2 year old daughter took a long 4th of July weekend down to Miami, we originally had booked a stay at the Ritz Carlton Key Biscayne. We left the Ritz early because of the poor service, small rooms and because the management was requiring guests to wear permanently attached orange vinyl type medical bracelets to access the pool and beach areas. We had American Express' Fine Resorts and Hotels program cancel the rest of the Ritz stay and move us to the Mandarin Oriental Miami. What a wonderful decision that ended up being!!!!The Mandarin Oriental Miami is just simply OUTSTANDING, they truly understand customer service, their 5 star rating is richly deserved. We were warmly greeted and treated as we entered the hotel. When we checked, in our room was upgraded to a Brickell Suite (via the AMEX Fine resorts program), they told us they had other rooms available if it was not to our liking. As the bellman took us to our room, he was careful to point out the fire exits on our floor, certainly a sign of a well managed hotel. One should note that on the higher floors that the fire escape path may actually lead across the exposed roof of the lower floors.The room was a joy to behold, bamboo flooring, a large living space with couches, chairs, TV, guest bathroom, desk and balcony. This was separated from the sleeping quarters by a very nice piece of cabinetry with sliding rice papered glass doors. The bedroom was equally huge with a wonderful feather bed, nice sound system, TV and balcony. The bedroom had direct access to the master bathroom with a free standing two person tub, dual sinks, and separate shower area. The entire bathroom was well finished with a nice Spanish marble. The bed was VERY nice with a soft feather top. The crib that was sent up to our room was just glorious, a wonderful chrome design lined with goose down, our daughter loved it. (certainly much nicer than the ratty wood thing the Ritz Carlton had)The lovely view from the room was of the bay and the Miami Skyline. My wife enjoyed the spa services. The Spa keeps an oriental motif, the lighting is low, the fragrances are earthy. The steam room and sauna are nice, the whirlpool is outside though, by the swimming pool. The showers in the spa come at you from all angles. The spa has a nice feeling to it, it certainly does not have an industrial feeling.The private island is nice too, there is a running path all the way around the island, a playground area for the kids, and a man made beach. Please note however that there is NO ocean access from the beach. If you want to swim in the ocean, go to the concierge and he\/she can set you up with passes to one of the beach clubs in South Beach. The hotel pool is nice, but not huge, it does feature an infinity edge.Dining at hotel was also a treat, first we tried the Sanibel cafe, the food was interesting and the views were relaxing. I suggest trying the mildly hot banana ketchup, and the boneless beef ribs. The service was relaxed, but probably only rated 3.5 stars. The kid's menu was standard fare. The only negative thing I saw at the hotel occurred at the cafe, the sight of an anorexic european woman rubbing her pregnant belly before she lite up her cigarette was unpleasant enough to kill my appetite.We also had dinner the Hotel's 5 star restaurant, AZUL. It defiantly has earned its 5 stars. The food was interesting with a lean towards a seafood bent. The service was just truly gracious. The kids menu is shared with the cafe and again is standard fare and certainly not 5-star.In summary, almost every bit of service in this hotel is spot on perfect. They actually understand what service is, they don't just mimic it. Even as you check out of the hotel, the valet hands you a bag with assort fruits and 2 bottles of water; nothing less than a godsend if your next stop is the Miami International Airport.
