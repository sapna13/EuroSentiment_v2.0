{"text":"First three days were great but then....... We traveled with a group of 8 (6 adults-2 teens). The resort is beautiful and well manicured with more palm trees than I've ever seen and I have traveled quite a bit to the Carribbean. There was a beautiful breeze nearly every minute of the day and night if you were at the right spot on the beach. The beach water was clean but not the gorgeous Carribbean color I expected. I didn't realize this resort is on the Atlantic Ocean side and, as a result, there was quite a bit of seaweed floating around with you. It was promptly cleaned by the maintenance men each day from the shoreline. The food by American standards was good and tasty overall, although we always found the meats to be very tough. Burgers are certainly not what Americans are used to (very mushy consistency). The food from Room Service on the other hand is horrendous (except the pizza). The staff was extremely polite and very accommodating with few exceptions. (i.e. the maid who stole my husband's gold and diamond ring from the night table while he was sitting right on the balcony-she also let herself into the room while he was napping on another occassion-hours after she cleaned the room to leave a survey on the bed) The security staff concluded their investigation within 2 hours (and without contacting her since she had already left the site) and said their investigation was negative, whatever that is supposed to mean. They suggested we contact the local police (yeah right). We stayed in the Suites in Building 7 which we paid a $300 USD upgrade for. The room was very nice and had a beautiful view but was invested with ants. We requested an exterminator from the same thieving maid who assured us that one would come but no one never did. We lived with an inordinate amount of ants for the week. The biggest problem of all was the severe vomitting and diarrhea that every person in our party and on our bus to the airport seemed to have contracted (at least 30 people). We all spent the last 2 1\/2 days of our trip in our rooms taking turns on the toilet. Today is the 3rd day since we arrived back in the US and we are all still sick! 5 1\/2 days later. Our local ER Doctor at the hospital suggested that it is a parasite in our digestive systems. It had to come from the ice or the bottled water. It was the only thing we all had in common. We could have made a fortune selling Imodium but even that isnt working. As we were leaving the lobby for the airport we met numerous other people both Americans and Europeans all complaining of the same thing. If diarrahea and vomitting for half of your trip doesn't bother you, then this is the place to go. The only other complaint is there is no live music at night for dancing. We left on Thurs during the day so werent there for the Beach party which I understand is alot of fun and has live music. That would have been a definite plus. It's a shame that we all got sick, if that were not the case, we would go back there, it was a great value for the money. However, we definitely will not go there again now. One more thing, if topless on the beach bothers you or your children, don't go there, there's plenty of it.
