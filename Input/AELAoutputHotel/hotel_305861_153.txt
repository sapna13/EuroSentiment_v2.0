{"text":"Metropark Causeway Bay, great hotel, great location I recently took my first trip to Hong Kong, from the UK on Oasis Hong Kong, a new airline that's just started up on the London to Hong Kong route.The airfare was only √ä√£¬¢75 each way, plus taxes!!! A bargain that I couln't resist.I chose the Metropark Causeway Bay after reading reviews on Trip Advisor. I wanted a nice hotel, in a good position. Although I've stayed in a couple of Ritz Carltons in my time, I didn't want to pay Ritz Carlton prices. I wanted to see if I could find a hotel with the following:(1). a room with a view (2). inclusive food and drinks(3). a hotel that wasn't too basis(4). convenient locationWell, I can tell you that the Metropark hit the spot on all four points.I chose to have a Suite at $1400HK per night, because it guaranteed a harbour view, and was inclusive of breakfast, dinner buffet and evening cocktails in the Panorama Lounge on the 29th floor. Superb!!My suite was on the 26th floor. It consisted of a lounge, bedroom, a guest half bathroom and a main bathroom with a separate bathtub, and walk-in shower (wet room). In the lounge was a sofa, armchair, a TV and CD\/Radio stereo system. There was also a writing desk with complimentary broadband internet.The bedroom had a very comfortable big king sized bed and a TV.Both the lounge and bedroom had floor to ceiling windows, with stunning views over Hong Kong, Kowloon and the harbour.The food and service in the Panorama lounge was very good.The hotel was only a few hundred yards from both the Tin Hau MTR, and Victoria Park.All in all a very nice hotel, in a very convienient position, that didn't break the bank to stay there.I would recommend it to anyone, and certainly will be going back.Just an additional note: I chose to use the MTR to get from the airport to the hotel, and vice versa. It's a breeze. The Hong Kong rail system is quick, clean and comfortable. The interchange from the Airport Express train at the Hong Kong station, to the Island Line MTR (Metro) train is very straightforward. The journey is less expensive that the Airport Bus, and quicker.My tip: Get an Octopus card from the MTR desk at the airport. It's a card that you deposit money onto. You place the card on a pad whilst entering and leaving the MTR, which then computes your journey and deducts the appropriate fare from your credit. The Octopus Card can also be used on the buses, trams and Star Ferry. Some shops and food outlets let you pay by Octopus card as well. Any credit can be redeemed (less a small service charge) by handing in your Octopus card when you leave Hong Kong.
