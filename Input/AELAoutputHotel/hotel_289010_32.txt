{"text":"Great value, Good location. Agon Opera Hotel, BerlinDate 26th October 2006Reviewer -Trip Adviser Member from Ashington, Northumberland, U.KJust returned from this hotel after a 4 night break, and cannot fault the hotel in any way.I travelled to Berlin for the first time with my husband and 8 year old son, and wish our stay had been longer.From our check-in to departure, the staff were all friendly and welcoming.All the rooms are named after operas which is unusual and interesting.The beds are comfortable, and the pillows are like huge marshmallows which you can mould to any shape you like.I particularly enjoyed the large bathtub which was soothing after a day out and about sight seeing in this historic city.The U.Bahn (underground station) called Adenauerplatz is only 3 minutes walk from the hotel, but if even that is too far away for you, there is a bus stop right outside the hotel door.Breakfast was good and included cold meats, cheeses, pate` cereals, yoghurts, fruit, juices, scrambled eggs, boiled eggs and a multitude of different types of bread and crackers.This was very good value for money.Breakfast is served on the 6th floor allowing a nice view while you eat.We had already read on Trip Adviser that there was no tea or coffee facilities in the rooms so we went prepared with a travel kettle but never used it once!We were out and about all day, not returning until 11.00pm so the kettle was a waste of space in our luggage.There are plenty of bars, cafe's and restaurants within a short walk from the hotel.Some of the shops near the hotel were out of our league, e.g. Gucci, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, but it was fun window shopping.All in all a great hotel for a good price.I would definately return here.A final nice touch is that you can leave your luggage safely in a locked room after you have checked out if you have a late flight home like we did.We were able to enjoy our last day of sight seeing without having to carry all our bags.We flew into Schoenefeld Airport, took a number 171 bus to Rudow U Bahn, got onto a train on U line 7 headed for Rathaus Spandau, alighted at Adenauerplatz station then took the M29 bus in the direction of Wittenburg Platz alighting at Olivaer Platz which is the bus stop right outside the hotel door.If we knew Adenauerplatz U Bahn was only 3 minutes walk from the hotel, we would not have bothered getting on the bus.
