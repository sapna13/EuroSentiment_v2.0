{"text":"Breathtaking Beauty in the Jungle The Four Seasons Sayan, Ubud is one of the most spectacular resorts I have ever visited. It is winning on every level--from the location and design to the facilities and service, this resort raised the bar for me in every way! The breathtaking design of the Four Seasons Sayan has been described previously in these reviews, so I won't go into too much detail on this front. Suffice to say, this resort is a marvel of design, and your room rate is actually a bargain when you grasp the scope of its exquisite grounds and magnificent facilities.I was coming from the Ritz Carlton in Jimbaran Bay, where I had a miserable experience, and the Four Seasons general manager made me a very attractive offer which I jumped at. Upon arrival, and reeling from the sublime beauty of the place, I was transported by buggy down a steep little to my villa. It had its own plunge pool, which I would gaze at wonderingly as I ate breakfast on the terrace in the morning. The airy bedroom was just perfect, with decorative muslin draped over it (no mosquitos in my villa, ever) and little carved knaves in the wall graced with wooden ganeches and carved stone statues. The bathroom was gorgeous and huge, with a soaking tub and shower, and the enormous, walk-in closet was bigger than my own closet in New York. Truly, it was hard to tear myself away from the resort to explore Ubud, as there was so much to take in on its grounds. Stunning terraced hills, the jungle rising up above the river gorge--I could sit outside of the main bar in the open air cocktail banquettes and stare at the sunlight filtering through the jungle for what seemed like forever. Time really stood still during those magical moments.The resort had a wonderful spa, and I received an absolutely blissful ayuravedic massage there, followed by an outdoor shower. I'd been running a low-grade fever for a few days and after the massage, I felt like myself again.The fitness center was excellent, with wall to wall views of the river and jungle, and I also used the library and the complimentary computers and internet access there.A few instances of the Four Seasons' perfect, intuitive service stand out in my mind: 1. each morning without fail, just as I was finishing breakfast, I would hear a knock on my door and two smiling Indonesian gentleman would be waiting to take my trays away. 2. I left the resort at 4:00AM for an early flight and a picnic basket of croissants and coffees was packed for me in a van, along with a pillow and blanket so I could sleep on the way to the airport. Inside the van, soothing classical music played on the stereo.There were a couple of negatives, but they were minor in the grand scheme of things. Dinner in the main restaurant was disappointing for a resort of this caliber. And the entire time I was there, the bar at the pool down by the river gorge was closed. Plus, the pool itself was never in use, so the parasols stayed battened down and the lounge chair cushions were stacked against the wall. The lack of a bar and the generally isolated feeling of the pool area just weren't inviting so I never used it, though I would have liked to. Again, this is a minor complaint, but one nonetheless worth sharing.PS. After I returned home, I received an email from the manager thanking me for staying at the Four Seasons Ubud. I can't recommend it highly enough, and hope to go back some day.
