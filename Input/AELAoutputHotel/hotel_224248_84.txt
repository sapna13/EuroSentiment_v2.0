{"text":"Hampton Blue Lagoon so much better than their Dadeland property Stayed one night pre cruise [Friday 15 December 2006]. Have stayed at their other property last December 2005 and have to say that the Blue Lagoon is soooooooooo much better!Lovely clean and modern room, welcoming and accommodating staff with personality. No complaints whatsoever. Building facilities were clean and well maintained.Used the airport pickup service without any problems - called to let them know we were at the airport and they said the van was on its way. 10 minutes later we were picked up - this was at 9.30pm. Last year the airport van from Dadeland took over 1 hour to get to us, and this was after 3 chaser calls and the promise each time that he was on his way and stopping every Hampton Inn van we saw. Driver had the cheek to argue with us and say we had been at the wrong place and he had been driving around.Add to the fact that Dadeland reception staff were very unaccommodating bordering on rude and indifferent and the actual hotel was a bit tired and our room was very dated [believe refurbishment of the rooms was in progress but think we got the oldest one left!] with the airconditioning very noisy and not very good.So why use Hampton Inn again you may ask? Based on the reviews here on Trip Advisor and value for money - we only really needed a bed for the night, and Blue Lagoon was obviously hitting the spot with a lot of other people.We also had friends who were travelling to meet us for the morning before we went to the ship - driving over 1.5 hours to see us. When I asked the reception if there was anywhere we could go to get a coffee [as I knew that the breakfast room\/24 coffee was for residents] he said that we could use the lounge and get coffee there - I clarified that my friends were not staying at the hotel, but he said that it was no problem. Only a little perk, but so helpful [we are from UK] when time with our friends was precious.After they had left, I had somehow got it into my head the we could check out at 3pm [oops I know NOW, thats checkin time!] so I phoned down at 1.30 to confirm this fact to find out we should have checked out earlier! Again very accomodating and said we were OK till 2pm.Reception organised a taxi-van to take us to the pier. Approx $24 plus tip. All in all a lovely stay and good value for money, especially considering that breakfast is included. Will definately use this one again if fortunate to be visiting again.Finally, regarding proximity to the airport, we were never bothered by noise and our window gave us a lovely view of planes taking off! I wouldn't say it was completely quiet, perhaps a very low drone occasionally depending on the plane size, but certainly nothing to disturb your sleep.I booked via their own website [6mths advance] and kept an eye on the prices - the room rate actually dropped [3mths] so I just amended my booking online. I know they honour their cheapest price but still did the amendment just in case. Saying that would have still been happy paying the higher price as the value for money was excellent, but everyone likes a bargain!Hope this review helps.
