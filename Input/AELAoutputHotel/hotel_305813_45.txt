{"text":"Fantastic Stayed at the Langham in early Sept for 3 nights. Since I was traveling with my wife and 4-year old, I booked a Residence Suite and had pre-ordered a transfer from the airport. This was a great choice. Arrived early in the morning from London and found the transfer desk easily. We were offered cold drinks and a welcome package which was a nice treat. Immediately took our luggage and escorted to our car. Upon arrival at the hotel, were meet by a receptionist who took us up to the Club floor to check-in. Again, offered drinks while we checked in. Was given an introduction to the Club L and the amenities offered in the hotel. Although early, we only had to wait 20 minutes for our room, 3707 to be ready. We helped ourselves to a few espressos in the Club to keep going. Staff in the Club were excellent. Very helpful and always asking about our stay. Most of the time, I was addressed by my name when entering the Club.Our 1 bedroom suite was huge based on HK standards. Nicely furnished with a full kitchen (3 different personal Haagen-Daaz treats in the freezer). We had excellent views although only a partial view of Hong Kong island (don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect great views of the harbor as too far inland). Also included an office and √à√¥√ú bath with a washer\/dryer which was a nice touch. Bathroom was huge with a walk-in closet. Wifi was free for the Suites which was a huge plus considering my last hotel charged me USD35 per day. Breakfast was included in our rate and we had the choice of breakfast in the Club or the lobby restaurant. We choose the buffet breakfast in the lobby which was excellent and full of choices. The Langham is connected by an indoor bridge to a huge shopping mall with lots of food choices and a supermarket. We tried a few of the restaurants as our son was jetlagged and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to go far. Also provided access to the MTR which allowed us to easily travel around (I had lived in HK 10 years ago so knew my way around).The swimming pool is on the roof and was nice and warm. The gym is excellent with multiple machines and plenty of space.Check out was done in the Club L and again was fast. Car was waiting for us downstairs with our luggage.Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be put off by the Mongkok area. Lots of locals shop in this area and the MTR puts you close to everything. The Langham Mongkok is an excellent choice.
