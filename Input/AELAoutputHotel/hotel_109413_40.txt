{"text":"Beautiful room, elegant and quiet hotel We stayed at this hotel August 9-11 for an event held at the hotel. The front desk allowed us to check in when we arrived at about 12:30 p.m. - probably because it was a very quiet weekend and there weren't too many guests in the hotel.Our room was on the 7th floor - 709, and it was beautiful! Great bed, a good desk where you could actually work, and everything was modern and in good condition. The best thing, though, was the view; we had six (!!!) windows on three sides of the room, so try to get a room like this if you like views and natural light. The wifi was somewhat spotty but we managed okay, had to go down to the second floor to use the business center (which is just one PC) a couple of times.The common areas of the hotel were nice and very quiet - again, probably because there weren't many guests around while we visited. Gym was way nice for a hotel gym: very big, well stocked with towels and water, and quiet both times that I went. The elevators were a bit slow but not too bad, at least for us as we only had to go up to the 7th floor. The surrounding area was completely dead by mid-afternoon and was very deserted on Saturday, so be advised that you will have to go elsewhere for restaurants, nightlife, etc. There is a Neiman Marcus just down the street, however. At least there is a big Starbucks right on the ground floor. I would stay there again if I return to Dallas, but would probably bring a car to get around more easily. ","annotations":[]}
