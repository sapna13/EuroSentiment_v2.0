{"text":"Great price for a spacious room I had long ago booked a trip to New York City for December 25-30 and had made a tentative reservation at the Newton Hotel on the Upper West Side. However, in November I received a special promotional email from Hotwire offering a $179\/night rate at the UN Millennium Plaza. After feeling some trepidation because of a few negative reviews on TripAdvisor, I went ahead and changed to the Millennium. I have to say that my partner and I were delighted with our stay. Unlike the reviewer on December 30, we had a very easy time checking in, perhaps because it was on Christmas Day, and we were given a king superior room on the top floor (38th). The room was huge with fabulous north-facing views of the city. Furnishings were plain but stylish in the Scandinavian style, the bathroom was large, and we actually had a walk-in closet. The staff was very friendly and seemed eager to please. The location, while somewhat off the beaten track, turned out to be the perfect antidote to the horrific crowds in New York between Christmas and New Year's...so the hotel was a blessed refuge from the tumult on the streets. It's also only a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station, so one can easily hop on one of the several subway lines that converge there. In fact, I took the new rail link from Grand Central to JFK airport on my return, and it was remarkably easy (and a bargain at $7). All in all, we definitely would return to the Millennium if offered a similar rate. ","annotations":[]}
