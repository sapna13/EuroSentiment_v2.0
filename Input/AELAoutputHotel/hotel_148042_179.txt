{"text":"Perfection! We've just returned from a four night stay at the Ritz and just can't say enough good things about the experience. This was a celebration of our anniversary and also a 'BabyMoon' as we are expecting our first child. We chose San Juan because it was a safe, Caribbean island that was easy to get to from our home in the DC area. We chose the Ritz because we found a wonderful deal on Expedia and just really wanted to be pampered and relax.Our room was on the Club Level and the staff there was SUPERB! Their professionalism, friendliness and warmth was extraordinary. Their interest in us and desire to help make our stay extra special really made our trip. The Club Lounge is a lovely respite and a nice place to relax, enjoy the beautiful view, and have some light meals. Our ONLY criticism of the Club Lounge would be the lack of variety in food choices. It was the same thing each day for breakfast and lunch and very similar options for the evening presentations as well. It just got a little boring after 5 days. That said - we still enjoyed staying on this level very much and the VIP treatment was a real treat.We spent most of our time at the pool - which is OUTSTANDING! I can't say enough good things about the beautiful setting. There were always plenty of chairs and umbrellas and the staff was readily on hand to get them set up for you and move an umbrella to the location of your choice. We are not sun 'worshippers' (and are shocked by the number of people who are) - so we always picked a shady spot and were pleased with our options. The pool was very spacious and has a wonderful layout that never feels crowded - we were always able to find a secluded (and shady!) alcove to relax in. The rafts they put out every day were a nice touch. And we absolutely loved the pool side grill.... beautiful views of the ocean, friendly and attentive staff and very good food. (Try the Puerto Rican sampler - delicious!!!)Our room was nice - we did not have an ocean view but the opposite side overlooks palm trees and the airport in the distance. We didn't spend much time in our room - but we actually did enjoy watching a few planes come in from time to time. And we NEVER heard planes in our room and the few we heard poolside were not disruptive in the least. Do NOT let this property's location put you off. If anything, the proximity to the airport was a plus to us b\/c it allowed us to spend more time relaxing and less time traveling!Bottom line - we absolutely LOVED the Ritz and would go back in a heartbeat. We highly recommend it to anyone. Enjoy!!!
