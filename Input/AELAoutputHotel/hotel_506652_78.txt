{"text":"100+ positive reviews can't be wrong! B-Hotel has been (almost) unanimously highly acclaimed by most reviewers. Should that give the reader enough comfort? I am tempted to say yes, and you can count me among those guests who really enjoyed their stay at the B. We were there from 28\/12 to 1\/1. Price was ok for the category, except for New Year√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Eve, which was a whooping 85% above the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ low-season rate. Everything positive and negative has already been written by others. I can only add a little:- Location: scary at first sight, because it overlooks a massive traffic roundabout (Espa√Ç??a) which dwarfs the √ã√ë¬∞toile in Paris and the nearby Arenas which are being rebuilt, the rooms are well insulated acoustically, and we got a good night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ rest without earplugs. But don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect a quiet environment after 9am. And yes, you can hear the slamming of neighbouring doors and the chatter in the corridors.- Connections: two minutes walk to the Aerobus stop; one minute walk to the metro, which takes you to the bustling Rambla in less than 10mins without changing lines; Montjuic is in walking distance; I really don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand people who complain.- Facilities: free Internet perfect to check local info; pool was closed (fancy a swim on 31\/12?); lobby stylishly cold; breakfast ok but overpriced for the quality (√à√\u2020√ü?2), which might compel you to overfeed to break even.- Rooms: like so many before, I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ manage to grasp the functioning of the lighting system, but it was fun to try, for a short while! Lesson to be learned: don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ install fancy equipment in your own home. The bed cover looked, in some places, as if it had suffered a close encounter with a cat's claws, but the mattress and the pillows were soft as foam cream. A delight.- Bathroom: the glass cubicle is really not an issue, since you can √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âlose√à√\u2020\u2022?it with shades, once you have found the switch! Part of the game, I guess. The sliding door to the loo (which is enclosed in the bathroom) was missing in our room! If privacy\/intimacy is an issue for the room occupants, the bathroom is sub-par. Shame, because the design is very nice and pluming of superior quality.- Staff: very positive experience. On arrival, we were given a twin, which I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like. Changing rooms was dealt with swiftly.Overall, despite a pricey tag (conditioned by the season) and some minor minuses, I warmly recommend the B-Hotel for a young and\/or design conscious clientele with a mid-range budget.
