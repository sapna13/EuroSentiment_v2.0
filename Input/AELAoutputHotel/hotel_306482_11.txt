{"text":"Be careful when booking this hotel. This is definitely a hotel with 2 personalities. All the rooms are the same small size (smallest I've had in HK - maybe I've been lucky up till now) but the standard rooms are tired and worn out where as the premier rooms have been renovated in the last few years. It seems that the rooms up to the 11th or 12 floor are the ones that haven't been renovated recently and as I said are quite grubby (scuffed wallpaper, stained worn carpets, threadbare furniture, poorly set out tiny plastic bathroom which requires you to step up and over approx 18 into the shower\/bath (etc) ie. generally worn out) and have less facilities that the premier rooms eg. no in room safe . All rooms types I experienced had the same rock hard beds often found in budget hotels. Not a problem for me but may be an issue for others.I got to see 4 different rooms in this hotel (2 standard and 2 premier) so I feel I have a good picture of what they offer.Facilities...They have wireless Internet available for a fee HK$40 for one continuous hour or HK$100 for 24 continuous hours. It is 802.11b so performance is not great. The premier rooms also appear to have wired access available but I did not try that so can't comment.As mentioned above, the standard rooms don't have an in room safe but do have plenty of signs telling you that it isn't safe to leave things in your room. There are safes are reception but this is not very convenient for all things.I used the restaurant for breakfast (buffet) and it was ok but as with all these things if you know where to go there are undoubtedly better cheaper options available elsewhere.Convenience...Yes it is about 5 minutes walk from the nearest MTR exit (Wan Chai A5) mostly along an elevated pedestrian walkway but 5 minutes in summer humidity can be a challenge for some people. Also there is a requirement to descend via stairs after hours which may be an issue for those with some mobility issues.It isn't too far from a A12 Cityflyer bus stop (Stop 5 Academy of Performing Arts) for people coming in from the airport. It cost HK45 as opposed to HK$100 for the Airport Express train but it also takes a bit longer.I did not use the Airport Express bus so can't comment on the convenience of its location. That said the taxi\/cab fare including luggage fee to the HK Airport Express station was about HK$22 so the bus may well not be an issue. There is a bus stop right outside which will get you to Central and beyond. Get the 18 not the 18P as it has more stops in tourist areas. The stop for the return journey is less convenient but still not too bad.Staff...Friendly and efficient for the most part but generally not willing to go too far out of their way to deal with complaints or make the guest happy.In summary...Speaking personally I'd recommend that unless you need easy access to the convention center or must have a view of the harbor and aren't prepared to pay too much for it, other similarly priced options have bigger rooms with better facilities. If you must stay in this hotel make sure you get a renovated room.
