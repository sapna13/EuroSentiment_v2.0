{"text":"Better than Expected - nearly 5 star experience Just got back from 5 nights at the Westin Palace in Madrid. I've stayed in many Westin hotels and this one is almost too nice to be labeled a Westin. The Palace Hotel is a perfect hotel for Americans travelling to Madrid (all staff members speak english) for either pleasure or business. (note the Starbucks right next to the building) The place *could* be converted to a St. Regis if they upped the service levels a notch. This hotel seemed to attract alot of Americans and Brits but still remains a grand Spanish hotel.Pros: Rooms - The RENOVATED rooms are excellent. The decor is absolutely beautiful with fabric covered walls and a terrfic marble bath. The included buffet breakfast was well done and we looked forward to it each morning. Neutral - Service - the staff was friendly and we had no serious problems but it wasn't what you would expect in a true 5-star hotel like a Four Seasons or St.Regis hotel. This is a large hotel and the staff seems a bit overworked - also it is difficult to give that personal type of service you would experience at a traditional 5 star property. Think 5 star property with 4 star service. Cons - Rooms - the UNRENOVATED rooms are actually pretty bad and are more like a 3 star experience. We had 2 rooms one was renovated and was absolutely beautiful - the older one was a completely different room from the older very beat-up unrenovated rooms. Standing in the older room made me feel like I was in a completely different hotel.Bottom line - a well known swanky and beaufiful large hotel in a good location in old Madrid. I would highly recommend this property but with a warning to NOT stay at this hotel if you can't upgrade or confirm a newly renovated room. Currently they are finishing the renovations on the 5th floor - I believe the 7th and 6th floor renovatations are complete. (our 5th floor room was renovated and 4th floor was not).
