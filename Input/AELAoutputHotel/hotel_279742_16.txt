{"text":"Worked for Us We were guests of the hotel from May 16 to May 23 while attending the International Trademarks Association Annual meeting. The hotel was one of many designated conference hotels and our rate and reservation were secured through the conference organizers.Our room was on the first floor-165- over looking an interior court yard used by smokers. On the weekend, we did hear guests chatting late into the night. while they indulged and we did, on one occasion, smell a great deal of cigarette smoke on our floor even though it was non-smoking. The sound of a water feature also located in the court yard, however, was soothing.The room was a little small but adequate. Toiletries, like soap, were in short supply: we were given one bar for both the sink and bath. Bedding was comfortable but towels were thin and small. We did enjoy the large Philipe Starck soaking tub. Tiles in the shower were missing and there was some mold over the tub. An access panel was black with finger prints. The hotel breakfast included in our rate was terrific. The dining room is spotlessly clean and the food beautifully presented and quite tasty. Serving staff were extremely cordial and attentive.Other public areas are a little shabby. The red carpet in the lobby and to the elevators was badly soiled and stained. Front desk staff was very pleasant and helpful. The so-called concierge really wasn't. They provided no assistance with restaurant reservations and dining suggestions were in short supply. The hotel is very well located. We walked everywhere, using transportation only to attend the ICC building.This hotel apears to be a very popular one and is also used for meetings and private parties. On at least three occasions, the bar was closed to hotel guests for private functions. Be aware if this is an issue for you. ","annotations":[]}
