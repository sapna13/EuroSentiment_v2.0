{"text":"Bad experience when i reach the hotel, i was told to be brought up to 16th floor to check in as i'm staying executive. the receptionist called a guy to bring me up because u need the keycard to use the lift. so then we went into the lift together, he pressed 16 and 9. no idea why, he walked out of the 9th floor to continue his work i think. he did not say anything and left, so i asked, 'is this the floor i suppose to be?' he pointed at the 16th floor and left. i reached the executive floor and got lost. nobody anywhere. i wandered for 10mins to find the hidden lounge for checking in. i stayed for 2 nights, twice during breakfast, nobody greeted me, asked me if i wanted coffee or tea, i can see and hear the executive receptionist and butler talking and laughing non stop because they were right in front of my table. i was the only one having breakfast btw. since nobody seems to bother, i just do watever i want, so after breakfast i used the internet in the exec. lounge, i saw minimised blogs of the butler. cos his pics are everywhere. the mini bar in the room is really deceiving. there're only 2 cans or beer and soft drinks, thats all. being executive package, i get free mini bar consumptions and free topping up. it was not topped up at all. i also remembered when i checked in, i asked if i can use credit card for deposit and pay cash when checking out, they said yes, but when i check out, they said sorry, credit card had already been charged. i wrote in to tell them wat i had gone through but to get an email in a non apologic way saying they are sorry giving such bad experience but such experience doesnt mean overall performances for olyimpic chosen hotel. i will only go again for the price, i stayed twice and non were good in any services.
