{"text":"Not convient for morning fliers or those without a car We needed a hotel for the night before our flight home from Seattle after a cruise. Our flight was at 9am and so we figured it was easier to stay near Seatac the night before. The rate was also cheaper than in Seattle city center. I booked on Best Westerns website and paid about $89. for one night.. a Monday night.We arrived at about 3pm at the airport (via cab from downtown because of the flat rate). The shuttle picked us up promptly. We realized as we headed to the hotel that this was the LAST hotel on the Airport hotel strip. We asked the shuttle driver about food for dinner. He pointed out that the hotel restaurant was closed Mondays and that there was only an IHOP within walking distance.Check in was easy with an efficient desk clerk. She asked if we needed a shuttle in morning to airport and we said yes. We had separate flights at 8:40 and 9:00 am. We were told the shuttle runs every half hour on the half hour. We asked for 6:30 for one of us and 7am for the other. The desk person said that the 6:30 was full (They only have one van and it holds 12 people). One of us had to leave at 6am. So if you plan to use the shuttle, this is not the most convenient hotel.I then went to use the pool and spa. The pool was fine (both are indoor) but spa out of order.Next was dinner. I did hear that there was a Safeway nearby and figured we could make sandwiches. It is about √Ç?√Ø mile walk but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ huge so that was backup plan. Room was clean and had nice bed and TV with 99 (!) cable channels.The walls can be thin and sound travels. Ask for quiet room.The business center has three PCS and printer that you can use (when others aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ). Breakfast started at 5am that was good and free breakfast had waffles, hardboiled eggs, cereal and bagels plus juice and coffee. I was pleased.So, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° give it a pretty good rating if you have a car to go eat and if you want convenient service to airport. (I suggested to BW that they have a back up shuttle during morning peak hours). If flying in at night you might be waiting a while at the airport.
