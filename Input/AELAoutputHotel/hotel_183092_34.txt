{"text":"Decent hotel, decent experience I have to say that I read mixed reviews on this website and wasn't sure what to think. So when my husband and I booked a 2 night trip there in March, we figured we would go in wtih an open mind. The hotel is perfectly located if you want to shop. However, it was a bit off for most of the other touristy things - ie. CN Tower, the theatre district, Casa Loma, Greek Town, etc. Most anything else we wanted to do we had to drive to, and with all the construction in the city, this was not always an easy feat. We were welcomed warmly and were given the option to either valet our car or self-park with in\/out privileges. We opted to self-park thinking it would save time overall. For the parking: MAKE SURE to inquire about this at the front desk at check in. We figured they would automatically bill us as other Marriotts do for self-park. They do not. If you don't say anything and get a pre-paid ticket you pay each time you go in and out of the garage, and if you are parked longer than 24 hours, you are charged a premium. After learning this the first time we were charged, we asked the hotel to help us figure out how to get back what the overpay was and do it correctly moving forward. We were told that it was too late, and it had to be done our first day. So no help there.We had to change rooms within the first 20 minutes we were there. The walls were paper thin and we could hear every conversation (and argument) in the room next to us. We called down to the front desk to request a change and were told they would call us right back. I had to call back 30 minutes later, and they had no record of me calling the first time! After I explained it all again, they finally got us another room at the end of the hallway (ask for an end or corner room - it was twice as large), and had someone bring us our new keys. The breakfast buffet was decent - a bit different than other Marriotts we have stayed at, but overall ok. We had a great rate - $159 CAD, which included our room and breakfast. Other than that, there wasn't much to write home about at this hotel. It needs updating, but I will say that they were installing a new fitness room with very much updated (and needed) equipment in it - looked like it would be ready soon for the public. Honestly, if you are going to Toronto and want to be near shopping, this will be ok for you (but so would the Sheraton). If you want to be near the Lakefront, CN Tower, Yonge St, and the theatre district, the Renaissance would be a much better choice.
