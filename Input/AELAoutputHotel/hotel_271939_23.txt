{"text":"Great Latin Quarter location-best bathroom ever in Paris Dates of Stay 20 July-22 July 2008 (2 nights)Great little family-run, inexpensive, clean hotel on Rue Thenard, one block south of Blvd St Germain and one block north of Rue des Ecoles-about 3 blocks east of Blvd St Michel. Excellent location for exploring all of Paris and near many great, inexpensive (for Paris) restaurants. Cute spiral staircase or elevator fine for 2 people and luggage. People at front desk always friendly and helpful and willing to let me speak French. Free internet in phone booth in lobby was great but had to leave door open since it could get stuffy. I don't bring my laptop to Europe so no comments about WIFI, but it is available. Didn't eat breakfast-10 euros looked like a lot for what was offered. We probably would have eaten there, but we slept in late the first morning after arriving late and finishing dinner at La Harpe after midnight and we left for the airport the second morning where we had access to the Air France Salon which provided complimentary breakfast and cocktails\/champagne. HCF is a definite 5 rating on Trip Advisor for Paris. Unless you're looking for the Georges V or similar or need to stay in a different part of Paris, look no further. I can't imagine anything better on the left bank.Room #42-2 very comfortable, twin beds, free safe, flat screen TV, multi-speed fan with 2 windows opening onto Rue Thenard-might be problem if very, very hot outside but would have to be over 30C\/86F at night, I think. How often does that happen in Paris? Noise not an issue when we were there. Extra outlets, if needed, near bed and elsewhere. They have those nasty long, round pillows, but there are good, normal, fluffly ones in the closet-so no pillow issue.Bathroom-best one I've ever had in Paris (I've stayed in many hotels, mostly 2* and 3*) Tub with shower (yes it has a half glass door, but if properly closed by lining up with side of tub and not bumping into while showering, no splatter issue) As in all Paris bathtubs, the side is steeper than the tubs in the US so you have to lift your legs higher. I get tired of hearing people complain about the half glass door and higher side on the tub! Bidet (didn't use), toilet, and sink. Some toiletries provided. Clean towels and restocked toiletries the 2nd day as well-not sure about sheets since I usually just sleep under top cover or duvet.Extras:-we arrived late the first night (at 10 pm), but everything was ready and waiting for us even though the hotel was full (complet) I had emailed the hotel to expect us around 9 pm, but our flight from Vienna was an hour late. Bottom line, they were honest and professional and had saved a quiet room with 2 beds as I had requested.-received wake up call as requested on morning of checkout-younger guy at front desk called Restaurant Le Buffet, Rue des Trois Freres, in Montmartre for me the see if they were open on a Monday evening-they had been closed in the early afternoon when I walked by. Their hours are at their discretion and convenience, they will be open but food-except for the green pepper sauce-and service is great if you speak some French.To summarize, the next time I stay in that part of Paris, I will definitely stay there. The HCF was significantly better than the Minerve or the Familia where I have stayed previously. Those are about the same price and actually about 2 blocks further away from everything.
