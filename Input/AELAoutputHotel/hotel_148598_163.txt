{"text":"Mommy  We just got back from a 5-day\/4-night stay at the Wyndham Rio Mar and enjoyed our stay immensely. We brought our 7 month old daughter and found the convenience of a big resort to be a lifesaver. With her early bedtime we ended up eating at the resort for most of the nights. We thought our meal at Palio was the best. Shima (Japanese restaurant) was good, too, but we ended up eating the appetizer there and taking the rest back to the room due to the baby's tiredness. Aqualuna's food was unimpressive. They bill it as a seafood restaurant but only offer 3 types of fish with 3 sauces and only prepared by grilling. You have to take a shuttle van from the main hotel to the restaurant on the complex but the vans came every 15 minutes so it was no big deal and a nice change of scenery. Depending on your budget, the restaurants are on the pricey side but that's hotel dining for you. (On a side note, the concierge recommended Richie's cafe up the hill from the complex. It has a great view. The food was okay but not fabulous. The owner was very nice.) The breakfast place, Maribela's, was not impressive although the staff was very nice. The bakery by the casino was very convenient and economical. Pros: The staff was super friendly and very accommodating. I kept commenting to my husband how nice they were. (I was amazed since so many places are indifferent to guests.) Random staff members would great you in the hall and elevators. Restaurant wait staff were all very nice as well. Our rental car had a small scrape from the valet. When we pointed it out, they immediately accepted the damage and prepared the paperwork for us. (It was such a relief since I believe many other places would have tried to deny it and give you a big hassle.) Cons: The toilet flush sounds like an airplane flush (i.e. super loud!) When you're trying to keep a baby asleep, it makes you cringe. Also, the clock shone a bright blue that lit up the room in the dark yet made it impossible to read the time. Good for us who did not bring a night light for the baby but probably bad for other folk. I got bit by bugs on the last day at the pool but it may have been a random incident. (I did NOT get bed bug bites as another reviewer commented. Whew! The bugs always seem to find me.) The hotel is set back from the main road and you feel like you're driving for a long time within the compound. The signage could be a little better to get you to the actual hotel building. We did not see that many kids at this hotel but found it to be very family-friendly. They have an iguana feeding everyday that's fun.
