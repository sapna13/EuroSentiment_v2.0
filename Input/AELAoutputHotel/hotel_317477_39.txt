{"text":"Great Great Great As others have stated here, this hotel is simply great. We were three adults in one room and the individual beds were top notch. When you first enter the hotel, you can tell by the immaculate white lobby with its white marble floor that you are in for a great stay. The staff was incredibly attentive and everyone spoke English. Back to the room, the largeness of it along with the huge windows giving us a spectacular view of the city made our visit to Tokyo all the better. It actually reminded me a bit of the infamous Park Hyatt hotel (at about 1\/2 the price!) Nearby, there are plenty of restaurants and convenient stores to satisfy all of your hunger needs. The A\/C controls in the room were the best as I have heard it is difficult to sometimes get it cold in other rooms at various hotels in Tokyo. We actually got it down in the 60's one night during our stay and we loved it in contrast to the hot and humid days we were experiencing in October. The surprising bonus this hotel was the shower. The first morning I came out of the bathroom and said to my travel mates - That has to be one of the best showers I've had while traveling in a long time. Suspicious at first, my roommates announced similar statements once they experienced it. The only negative thing I could say about this hotel (and really, it's not the hotel's fault at all) is that the location is swarmed by a lot of gaijin tourists, like us. There are a couple of other large hotels in the area so dining at night in a small quaint Japanese restaurant is often filled with many other obvious tourists. This is not a bad thing at all√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√™ust a small observation after staying in other areas of Tokyo prior to this trip. If you join the Prince Hotel Club (which is free!) before booking your room, you can get a whopping discount. If I recall correctly, our final price per night was under $200USD (whereas I think it was listed on its own website and various other travel sites at around $350 USD without being a Club Member). Would I stay here again? Yes!
