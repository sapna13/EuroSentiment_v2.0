{"text":"GREAT LITTLE GEM WITH HEART AND SOUL I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Brentwood for a month while consulting with a medical specialist in LA. The hotel was recommended by the Doctor who is located in Brentwood. This little gem of an inn is run by an intelligent, charming and entertaining young couple who live on site.The Inn is a true reflection of it's loving owners. The owners have instilled their values of unending graciousness to the small staff, and there is not an unfriendly face on the premises. At checkin I was greeted by name, warmly welcomed with organic teas and fresh baked cookies and instructed on the best places to dine that night. along with what I should do the next morning. (including visit the local farmers market, a one block walk). Both of the owners who frequently man the reception area and the two young staff members treat the positon as a cross between a 5 star consierge service and the best tips from a true local. I don't think it is possible to make a request that the owners have not already anticipated and provided for.Due to the friendliness of the owners and staff the lobby is the central gathering place for this Inn. The lobby reflects the warmth of the management with dark hardwoodfloors, catherdral ceilings, a stone fireplace, comfortable furnishings, the LA and NewYork Times for leisure perusal, and a wireless MAC computer for visitor use. -Mornings are spent over muffins, croissants, fruit, juice, milk, coffee and teas in this lovely setting or outside on the stone patio wifh seating and a waterfall for a rather zen like atmosphere.The rooms are small but cozy with great beds, an abudndance of pillows, fabulous linens,. The wood beamed catherdral ceililngs make them feel more spacious and the lighting is very thoughtfully designed. This hotel under the guidance of it's young owners recently underwent a major renovation and more improvements are in process. While I was staying at the Brentwood new large flat screen TVs were installed for perfect bed viewing. Knowing that I was a football fan looking forward to the superbowl, the owners made sure my new TV was installed the morning of the superbowl! How much better can serviced get.I understand that new furniture was also in production and may even be in place now. Everything is neat clean and well cared for.The location is perfect, tucked into the residential neighborhood of Brentwood and within easy walking distance to tons of area restruanants and Boutiques.And you could not stay with nicer people.
