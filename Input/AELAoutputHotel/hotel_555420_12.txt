{"text":"I certainly will return to this wonderful place - what a find! Where to start?We had booked an amazingly overpriced villa at Kamandalu which is so far away from Ubud Centre ... We had some dinner in Monkey Forest Road and decided to look at a few places so we could move the next day. My first try was Komaneka Resort as I knew it was a good smart place to stay. Alas, fully booked the next two nights.We walked a few metres North and saw a sign pointing down a well paved  well lit Gng. (laneway) with manicured gardens\/trees. You walk down the Gng. past a restaurant (apparently fantastic but we did not have time to try it out this stay)The staff showed usa Deluxe room and it wasn't being used that night so we arranged for the staff to collect us from Kamandalu the next morning.Nyoman, Cendanas embassador, was waiting for us at 10:00am in a lovely fresh clean vehicle and whisked us away from our nightmare stay at Kamandalu to a welcome relief that is Cendana.Cendana rooms are quite basic. The standard type rooms dont have fridge\/TV - the Deluxe rooms do. But in staying to days we did not really need these two luxuries anyway!The bathroom was massive. The bed comfortable and the room clean.The staff are all very very nice and polite.The buffet breakfast that is included in the tariff is a good standard buffet.The spa centre located in a very tranquil position at the rear of the proprty was wonderful. There are all female practitioners, with one excpetion, Made. I had a very good massage and treatment with Made.The wonderful thing with Cendana is they will (subject to availabiltiy) ferry you ar9ound Ubud for no charge, we of course tipped generously during and at the end of our stay as we WANTED to!!! They will also negotiate the price with airport transfers etc and I thinkits only fair to at least cover the price of the petrol and make sure the driver has water\/food!!!Enough of me -book Cendana - for a moderate price you will not be unhappy - you cannot get closer to the Temples, Palace, shops and market then this little property!
