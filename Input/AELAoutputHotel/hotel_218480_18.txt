{"text":"Great Holiday 8 of us travelled to the Dominican for 2 weeks this month. I have to say I was a little nervous about the hotel after reading the reviews on this website...thankfully they were completely unfounded by all of us that went!!!The service was awesome, especially the staff at the Golf lobby\/pool bar. We were told when we landed that a Dominican minute is a bit longer than a normal minute, and for goodness sake, we were on holidays and not in a rush to go anywhere. The only time the service seemed slow was when someone would push infront of you. The only rudeness we experienced was from other visitors.The food was good...just like anything else, by the end of 2 weeks the buffet was looking like old news, but I was always able to find something that appealed to me. The Mexican and the Steakhouse restaurants were fantastic. The best buffet was at the Caribe.The rooms were huge...between the 8 of us, 4 rooms, we had 14 extra beds!! Only one room was dirty when we checked in, and they were moved right away, no questions asked. Make sure to bring small bills to tip the bellmen that run like mad all day long and keep the room fridge stocked!A few of us did get sick, but remember you are in a foreign country. Pack smart, bring immodium and tums, and you will be just fine.There were a few bugs in the rooms, but once again, its a foreign country with a tropical climate...even your house would have bugs. A couple of us did get quite a few bites, but when we got home we were told they were flea bites and probably from the exursions off the resort. Bring benadryl and calamine lotion.The only complaint we had was there was no where at our hotel to cash in travellers checks. We would have to go to the casino at the next hotel, cash them in for chips, walk around for a bit, and then cash out. Not a huge problem, just a mild inconvience.Also, do everything possible to avoid itravel2000.com. Their customer service is terrible.Overall, had a fantastic time. Do yourself a favor and get off the resort...see how the people live. It will give you a bit of perspective on how minor our problems are!!!
