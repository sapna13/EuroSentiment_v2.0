{"text":"wonderful service for wonderful hotel Me and three of my girlfriends stayed at the Sofitel Feb.23-25 2007. We found a great deal on hotwire.The hotel had some of the best service that I have ever experiences. At check in we found VIvian to be very helpful. She informed us of all the amenities the hotel had to offer, such as the restaurant, souvenir shop, and the computers in the waiting area. The bedrooms at the hotel were smaller than expected, but who cares the room were neat and clean and enough room for 2 adults. The bathroom were very clean and spacious. Both the bedroom and bathroom were modern was very well kept. When trying to find a restaurant or something in particular Daniel, the concierge, was the most helpful. On our first night he recommended that we eat at Bond 45, an Italian restaurant. He took the time to make reservations for us, and the food was great. This was the routine the entire time we were there. However we ventured out one day with out his advice and we regretted it. We went to Fridays on 5th Ave., the service was terrible. The location was great. It was not in the center of time square, however time square was not that far. Maybe a block walk. Overall I have nothing but postive things to say about the service and value of the Sofitel. I would defintely recommend this hotel to others and I will be staying there in the future.
