{"text":"Wow, what a resort, and the beach is second to none.... My wife and I honeymooned at the Bahia Punta Cana Golden Club May 13 to May 20th. First off the airport is the coolest you will ever find, thatched roof, open air, walk out of the plane on the tarmac (very hot). Booked through Apple vacations in St louis MO. Flight was only 5 hours after we left our wedding 6 a.m., yes we were zombies, but very worth it once we arrived. The airport is a breeze, literally from plane to apple bus, on our way in probably about 20 minutes. As soon as you enter the airport you will take your picture with two Domincan ladies dressed up real fancy, you will be able to purchase the 8 US dollars upon departure of the country, by the Gate 4. 10 US for immigration card, and thats it grab the bags and look for you travel company, be warned the bag boys are very aggressive just ignore them. You will drive through extreme poverty on the way about 40 mintues from airport, im talking people washing clothes in buckets, little children walking the streets, its really sad. The drivers now very little english but no problem. You will think there is no way the resort I saw on the internet could be around here, but one small right turn and it is paradise, there is actually 4 hotels in one with Bahia, the resort is HUGE, not so much wide as long, but no big deal trams run non stop, really just no big deal. Check in is a breeze, make sure if you booked Golden Club you have a air conditioned check in of to the left if your facing the main lobby, its Golden only though. We had a lady bring us a drink before we even checked in, awesome huh. Rooms are ready at 3 p.m so wear your suits as you get your towels and braclets right away, basically you a man without a room, everything else is yours, I recommend Booking Apple Clob golden, this means you can use anything in the resort, all pools even premier, all resturants, and bars. Got our room 2104 ( 9 yards from the beach) and had a bag with ballons, shirts, and rum in it on the bed, flowers everywhere, towel animals and what not. Stocked fridge (not very cold, but cold enough), never had one housekeeping or smell or leaking faucets like some reviews had said. You get 6 or 7 american channels on the tv, so there is something to watch if you want to get out of the sun for a while (and you will) unless your domincan, very humid and hot.Beach is absolutely the most clean, clear all around best beach you will ever see. Immaculate, never rained once when we were there, NOT ONCE, sunny pretty much all day everday, got real lucky with that. Pools are huge and clean not as cool as I would like pretty warm but the average temp is 93 right now.The bars are awesome, the pina coloda is my favorite, the beer is el presidente, and Brahma pretty good. There is a drink for every palate, and they have a drink of the day each day, the chocolate monkey, and coco rosso were some of our favorites, The buffets are ok, something for everybody, eat early as the food temps get questionable in the afternoon, the pizza is the best you have, very good. The al a cartes are very good, we ate at japanese El mikado, the mexican El Charro, the seafood El pescador, and the Italian El Cappricio II, the japanese is by far the best, book it twice if you wish, you wont regret. My only complaint on the whole trip was around day 6 and 7 the buffets get a little repetitive, and you are ready for some american food, if this is true for you when your there, there is a Wendys at the airport, so when you leave the country you can get some american food. Night life is not really worth staying up for, they are cleaning the grounds non stop, dance classes on beach and pool everyday, john at the main swim up bar, is the happiest person on earth. Make sure you check the day before departure when your bus picks you up, its about 4 hours before flight, do not pay for another immigration card when you leave, and keep any cash in you pocket and not in purse, unless you want to lose it, they searched all purses. The mishaps in the negative reviews didnt happen to us, couldnt have picked a better resort, Have fun...........
