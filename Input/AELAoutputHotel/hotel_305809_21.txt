{"text":"What a rip off!! My husband and I were coming in to Hong Kong for an exhibition. As we could not get a single room in any hotel, we finally ended up with the one room available at, The Imperial'.I read the reviews and thought, how could a 'three star' hotel be that bad. Well, after staying there for five days, all I can say is that the three star rating has to be only for the hotels location. Location: Excellent: You can walk down the entire stretch and do your shopping. There are seven elevens as well as the Sheraton on one side and the Holiday Inn on the other. The mrt station is just opposite the hotel. Brilliant location.Food: There is none! No room service or restaurant. No breakfast! You have to go out for anything to eat or drink. You can make packet tea or coffee but it is awful.Room: Smelly, damp and hardly any lights. I think they keep the room lights dim so you miss seeing the dirt and everything else. Bathroom: Tiny. But the shower was good. Hot water and basic toiletries.Reception: They hardly smile or speak english. They will write down things for you and help with directions. Overall, only stay here if you don't get a room some where else, or you are going to be out all day anyway. Being Indian, we paid enough for one night here, that would have gotten us a night at the 'Taj' a five star hotel chain from India. Price: Ridiculously expensive for this place.Hope this helps.
