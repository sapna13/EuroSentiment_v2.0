{"text":"Frustrating Vacation Our vacation started with great disappointment when we received our welcome pamphlet it indicated that we were booked at the Catalonia, we thought this was a mistake.. when we pointed this out to our rep he simply told us to go into the bus and the lady will explain everything to us. When we got on the bus and we started talking to a few people it appeared that everyone in the bus had the same issue.. Sure enough the lady came on the bus, she was a Barcelo rep, she explained to everyone on the bus that Barcelo overbooked and they were sending us to another hotel which is was an upgrade to the Barcelo and to compensate us Barcelo was giving us free 7 nights accommendations, we would have to find our own airfare. Well, this did not work for us because the only reason we took this last minute vacation was because we wanted to spend time with our family who were staying at the Barcelo Palace. Soooo, we explained this to the lady and she said that the best she can do is pay a couple days of transportation for us so that we can spend some time with our family. After spending a couple of hours on the bus at the airport , the bus finally left. We got to Catalonia which by the way I didn't like this hotel. To make this long story short we decided to take a taxi to Barcelo Palace so that we notify our family, we knew that they would be worried about us because we were 5 hours late. Sure enough with some hassel from security they let us in, we met up with our family who notified us that we have a room registered waiting for us and the hotel is waiting for us........Three cab fares later, late at night we finally were in our hotel room which we originally booked. WE are now fighting with Barcelo because they will not honor the 7 free nights because we had our room. Meanwhile, alot of the other guests arrived the next day and are still getting the free accommodation's. Between sand flees and mosquitoes bites, I would not recommend this resort to anyone. For the same price we payed here we could have got a much, much better resort with no problems. P.S. some people on the plane coming back said that they refused to go to the Catalonia, so they were sent to the Excellence and Grand Oasis which are top of the line. I am an experienced traveller ( over 20 years) and have never encountered such a mix up, if you read up on the Barcelo reviews you will find out that this is standard for them....Never again.
