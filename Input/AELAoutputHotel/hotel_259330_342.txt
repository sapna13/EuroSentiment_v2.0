{"text":"Beautiful Beach......however...... We went to this resort from Feb 3 - Feb 10 and just arrived home, home sweet home.I checked this website faithfully and tried to be prepared for the worse but hoped for the best. I will do my best to be unbiased with my review.- We had paid for VIP which was suppose to include fresh beachtowels everyday, a larger room and some alcohol in the bar fridge but did not receive any of this unfortunately.- The food is usually covered in sauces so if you have a food allergy it's hard to tell what they cook with.- The rooms are fumigated every friday before flights arrive because the bugs usually start appearing on the wed or thurs.- The beach was absolutely beautiful and the sand was cool to walk on, not hot like Cuba or Mexico.- The beach towel lady is very mean. A little advice... Keep your towels overnight. In the morning send a friend alone or spouse alone with the towels to pick up cards from this lady. Then when your spouse returns wait 10 min and bring the cards back to this lady for fresh towels. They will not exchange towels for towels. Be sure to be alone throughout this process cause they will recognize you.- If your first room has a toilet that does not flush properly, complain and they will move you to a better room with a good functioning toilet and shower.- Be sure to hang the Please make up the room sign on the door and throw the dirty towels in the tub or else they will not give you fresh ones.- Don't expect fresh sheets daily unless you are stripping the bed yourself and throwing them on the floor. Gladys de Jesus seems to use the excuse of not being able to open your room door to make up the room, alot.- Bring chewable immodium and be sure to drink a minimum of 2L a day of water if you have loose stools. Many people got dehydrated from not hydrating enough. Many people were advised to go to the hospital for parental treatment.- The cappuccino at the beach is amazing! Try it!- Get up around 6\/ 7 am to save chairs at the pool or beach (if you want shade)- Juan in La Laguna is awesome. If you give him a couple bucks he will take good care of your liquid needs! lol- Most of the staff is very good with customer service. They really try and make you happy.- The gift shop ladies are mean, beware. We walked past some magnets and they happen to fall off the door and fell on the floor. These lady's are not afraid to yell at you and make you feel like an ass. They run on a understandable You break you buy policy- The ocean is amazing. The water is beautiful and nice and warm. Spend some time in the waves.- Bring some OFF sprizer spray with at least 20-30% DEET. Spray the floor drain in the bathroom and the bottom of the door to keep visitors away. (Not so many bugs in on the 2nd + floors.All in all it was very nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of our lifestyle. If you have had the luxury of travelling to 4 + resorts expect a little less from this resort. The beach, rest and relaxation really saved the day for us. I wish you a great trip! And remember to speak up for what you want, for the most part they try to accomodate your needs. Have fun!
