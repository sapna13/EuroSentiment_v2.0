{"text":"NIce Hotel - Not Amazing I had been warned to go for as high standard of hotel as possible in Amsterdam, I got a good deal on the Schiller which included breakfast, but I could honestly say I wouldnt class this as a 4 star hotel. It was a very nice hotel, the beds were extremely comfortable, we had a lovely (small) room overlooking Rembrandt square, the room had a balcony which was really nice (although you wouldn't spend too much time out on it in feb..brrrr), I would like to see that during the Summer! The noise wasn't as bad as I expected from the square, but definitely if you were a light sleeper I'd say it would be a different story! The toiletries in the bathroom definitely deserve a mention, they were lovely, I smelled like a fruit salad for the weekend!!!I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful, both on reception and in the bar -drink prices are quite saucy in the bar though..you have been warned!! - the lady who served us breakfast was particularly nice. The breakfast was delicious, with a great selection of pretty much everything, and kept well topped up. There was some kind of party on downstairs on the Saturday night, and the music was VERY loud, it didnt bother us too much as we were heading out ourselves, but if you were planning an early night it would have been fairly upsetting! (although who would have an early night on Saturday in Amsterdam??) All in all I would return to the NH Schiller because I have no real negatives about my stay, but I would be looking for a special offer again, as I wouldnt pay 4 star prices for it.
