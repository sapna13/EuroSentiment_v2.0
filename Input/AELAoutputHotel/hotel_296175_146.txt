{"text":"Favorite Hotel Ever There is not much to add to what everyone has already said about this incredible hotel in my favorite city. The location is perfect (convenient yet quiet); the rooms are spotless and modern -- with laptop, 2 flat TVs, movies, playstation 2, 120V outlet,....; and service is the best we ever experienced (way better than 4 seasons and Peninsulas that we have stayed at).This would be a very fine hotel even if their service was only OK, but that is not the case. Fabrizzio, Tommaso, et al are absurdly helpful and just incredibly enjoyable to talk to. They reserved Uffizi and the David, restaurants, and other general suggestions. We rented a minivan to drive Tuscany and then leave to go up to Venice and beyond. It was trivial. They reserved the car. I pulled in front and my family boarded and we were on our way. When we returned, I pulled the car right up to the hotel on its very quiet street and just handed them the keys. (A minivan is obviously not recommended however; people were giggling at me parallel parking a minivan on the streets of Florence.)Overall, great value for an incredible hotel. The only minus I can think of is the one most commonly listed which is the stairs but as a family without any handicapped people, it was not a problem for us -- besides, the staff was incredibly quick and helpful at taking the bags. We just returned home, and I already can't wait to revisit the place. Overall, our favorite hotel we ever stayed at. ","annotations":[]}
