{"text":"Simple and Affordable We stayed at the Hotel Innova the first week of July 2007. The room was a typical hotel European hotel room (smaller room, smaller bath, etc.) The location is not entirely convenient with relation to the major sites. However, if you enjoy walking, it might be ok, I would map it out first. There is a metro stop just outside the hotel which was great for us because after the first few days of walking to everything, we needed a break. The metro is a wonderful tool to navigate through Paris. It is very easy to use once you figure it out after a few times. If you plan on using the metro often, do yourself a favor and buy in bulk. We bought a 20-pack of metro tickets for 21.20 Euro (or there about) when a one-way ticket is 1.5 Euro each. Back to the hotel----house keeping was good. The sheets and towels were changed daily. There is an elevator in the hotel, so getting luggage upstairs was not a problem.We did have a room that faced the street which was quite noisy. However, after a long day of sight-seeing, falling asleep was not really a problem. Also, the windows were pretty sound-proof, but being that there is no air-conditioning, we had to keep the windows open. And don't get the breakfast at the hotel. It is 7 Euros per person. There are soooo many shops you will pass where you can buy delicious and fresh pastries for MUCH less---we would buy 4 croissants for about 2 or 3 Euro, for the two of us.
