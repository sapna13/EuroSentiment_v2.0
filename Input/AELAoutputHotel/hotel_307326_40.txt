{"text":"Great location. We arrived at the hotel via Narita Express that stops at Shinjuku station and easily found our way to the hotel with luggage in toe. There were signs everywhere and you can download the map from the hotel website. We had a room on the 33rd floor with fabulous views over the city. It was spacious and well equipped. Big plus was the internet access that we did not have to pay extra for!! The lack of room service was a plus as it forced us to go out for dinner. Just downstairs in the building and across the road in the Times Square building (12-14th floors) there are many restaurants to choose from but be prepared to use hand gestures and point at the wax food samples in the window. And go early to dinner otherwise you will have to line up (sit ) and wait. The location was great with shops and restaurants close by, Starbucks and Krispy Cremes just outside and McDonalds only a 5mins walk away and the station only a 3min walk. But beware you are on the JR line not the subway line. This is an efficient service and certainly takes you to most of the tourist spots but the subway is faster. The subway lines are located on the street level side of the hotel not the promenade level. The ticket machines do have an English button but basically you have to know how much your ticket will cost - research this on the internet, it will also tell you what trains to catch and at what time. The hotel staff were friendly and attentive. ","annotations":[]}
