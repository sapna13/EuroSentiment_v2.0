{"text":"Amazing Beach My fince and I spent 7 days on this glorious beach. We are both well travelled and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this property. Room:Our room was simple. No frills or such but it was clean and located in the centre of the property. There was never a lack of hot water, fresh towels or clean linens. Food: The food was quite tasty. There was a large selection of food. If you can find something you like... stay home and cook your own food. There are three stations in addition to the large buffet for lunch and dinner. One for fresh fish, another is a carvery station for roasted pork, chicken, turkey, beef etc. and the other a fresh pasta station. In the morning there is an omelet station... your choice of ingredients. The buffet is always stocked with fresh fruit as well. Food is served on this resort from 7:00am to 2:00am as there are several restaurants.... if you can't find something to eat......please!!!!A La Carte Restaurants: We chose, Chines, French (International), and Italian. Surprisingly... we found the Chinese restaurant to have the best ambience, service and food. But all were tasty. The Chinese and Italian restaurant have a romantic feel... the French restaurant does not... the lights are very bright. Drinks: The wine served with lunch and dinner is lacking. If you're a wine lover.... order a bottle at the A La Carte restaurants, they have a large selection and the prices are comparable to home. We enjoyed the large variety of frozen drinks offered.. as well as the simple rum and coke, vodka and orange juice etc. The resort also has a large supply of non-alcoholic drinks during meals and at the bar. For breakfast there is fresh fruit juice, coffee and a variety of tea (Twinings), green, lemon, peppermint, english breakfast, etc. There is soda (major brands coke, sprite, etc) available during lunch, dinner and snacks. Activities: To the people who found nothing to do.... stay home on your sofa and continue to be a couch potato. Vacation is what you make of it. There is always a volleyball game happening, beach games organized by the animation team, kayaking, catamaran, pool games, tennis, ping pong, badminton, daily areobic and stretching classes - all our located outside so you don't have to be indoors. There is also a games room, and a sports bar... what more do you want. Parasailing and tubing is also available but you have to pay for those particular activities. Animation Shows: We only went to one show... and weren't very impressed. We were bored to tears with the lack of imagination and talent... so we left at the end of the show and we didn't return.Disco: Was filled with staff and visitors. The focus is mainly on Latin music but is was fun. We let loose and got into the groove. Staff: The majority of the staff were very helpful, friendly and professional. I did have one negative experience with the ladies in the gift shop but I refused to let two miserable girls who obviously hate their jobs ruin my vacation. I just didn't go back into their shop... their loss!! Airline: We booked our vacation with Sunwing. This was a first time experience for us. We would definitley book with them in the future. The food on the plane was actually edible and the service was great. Our on-site Sunwing Rep Jennifer was so helpful. She even brought me sun tan lotion from home when I was running low... what service. LIke I said, vacation is what you make it. If you want to have a good time you will find a way to enjoy yourself. If not... why spend the money? Stay home and be miserable.
