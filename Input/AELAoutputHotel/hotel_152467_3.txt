{"text":"worst service ever We staid at this hotel just recently and the experience could not have been worse. The service at the hotel is so rude and horrible. At check-in the reception staff permanently dealt with other things and let us just stand there and it took 25 minutes to check in. We had booked for 2 nights - a single and a double room. The receptionist asked us 3 times if we needed 2 keys for the double room (which we needed) in the end we got one key. Both keys were valid for just one night - so we had to get down to the reception again and re-valid our key after trying to open our doors the next day.NH hotel is perfectly located in the Zona Rosa. We disregarded the bad service and booked for one more night. To make sure that we could stay in our rooms we double checked with the reception the evening before our 3rd night should start and everything seemed fine. The next day we went again to the reception and there was Yan, a rude and unfriendly employe - not know how a hotel reception team member should behave and treat guests. She was so rude, told us that we would have to move rooms as she did not know and I told her that everything had been fixed the evening before. She continued to be rude, all of a sudden dealt with one of the bell boys, turned towards some other guests and did not care of us anymore - it was so embaressing. All of a sudden she turned back and asked for the written reservation. We told that we didn't have it with us and she said she would need it. I told her that they didn't ask for a written reservation at check-in neither and that I saw the eveninmg before that they had our additional night reservation. She turned back to somebody else and we had enough and left.The service at the restaurant is horrible too - bad organisation an dthey do not remove the trash and used plates from the tables - chat in a corner. You order som cold milk for your coffee and the waiter enters the kitchen and never comes back. Through the glass window you see them chat with the cooks. Even if you show up late and there are just less than 10 people in the restaurant they still do not clean up their mess and you have to get up and get your own coffee even if there should be a coffee service. The last day we had breakfast somehwre else as I did not want to start the day with so much unprofessional stuff.But this whole ignorance obviously is the hotel 's permanent system.I immediately wrote and email through the hotels website and told them about our trouble and asked to get a contact to management. Can you imagine that even after the second contact we still have no answer? This hotel seems to me without any captain and nearly ship-wrecked - no service - no smile - no care about guests and it will have been our very last stay at a NH hotel!
