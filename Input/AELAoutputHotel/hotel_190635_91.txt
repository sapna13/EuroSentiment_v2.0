{"text":"not really arty - more modern location is about 20 mins walk to La ramblas - right on the seaits 30 storeys high the reception is on the first floor - staff are fabulous - lots of them are doing courses from other countries and work in Hotel Arts as part of their course - very small wages apparently. We arrived and checked in smoothly then led to a room where we were offered a welcome drink and a huge variety of food - excellent! Our rooms were not ready so we decided to go for a walk. Arrived back at 3pm and shown our 2 Executive rooms on the 24th floor. Huge rooms well kept, the hallway off the lifts showed some wear, dirt marks on walls and doors had paint chipped off. Bedroom was separate to living area, 2 plasma tvs with lots of channels, great sound system and shades to make the room dark. At night it got quite noisy and could still hear the sirens up high where we were. Amazing views of city at night and during the day...one in particular of an odd shaped building coloured with red and blue lights that went out at midnight ?!Beautiful bathroom - lots of fluffy towels and robes and plenty of toiletries. A bottle of water and chocolate were left each night at turn down together with on the first night a pair of slippers.Breakfast was included and was outstanding. Lots of good food and great coffee and again service was beyond reproach.Great pool and spa on 2nd floor, didnt eat in hotel restaurant.Barcelona itself is a great looking city but the people dont extend themselves to tourists or at least not to english speaking ones. A restaurant to try in town is 7 Doors - lots of locals and tourists agree!
