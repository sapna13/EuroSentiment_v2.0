{"text":"not a four star hotel We went to Ocean Bavaro from July 27 to Aug.3, 2006 and we had a nice time except that we didn't like the service. It's a nice decent hotel except small minor things. There wasn't hot water between 5 pm till around 7pm but we used to take a shower before that time. Room keys weren't working for almost every other day, so we had to go back to the reception to give us a new one. Beach wasn't really as I expected , we've been to Iberostar before and Breezes in Punta cana but their beaches were a lot better than this one. If you want to walk on the beach go on the left side it's more nicer and cleaner beach. Beach is a little deep and has a lot of seaweed especially after 2 rainy days. Pools were nice and very warm. [--------------------] we didn't like their comments that they gave us every time we walked by. My daughter who is 16 tried to exchange her towel with a new one and the guy who work there grabbed her and kissed her on the cheek....what kind of behavior is this????? Rooms were clean and comfortable except the aircondition had a loud noise that we couldn't sleep at night. Food was average we ate mostly in the buffet and we went to the Italian restaurant which was nice and also Brazilian was good. There wasn't too many Americans or Europeans there, mostly Dominican and few Italians. Any way I love the Dominican Republic but we wouldn't go back to this hotel we would try a different one.
