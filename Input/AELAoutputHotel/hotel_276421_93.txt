{"text":"IFA Bavaro is Awesome!! First things first. The people on this site that are dogging this place are obviously people who think they get the luxury of taking home with them on vacation. Then stay at home! I traveled alone and had a blast. See subjects\/comments below:FOOD: The buffets were decent and plentiful with various dishes,breads,desserts, and fruits\/veggies to choose from so each time you could make up a good meal. The themed restaurants were awesome. My fav was the colonial with the beef filet and shripm salad to start. The pizza buffet was great by the main pool. DRINKS: One word: Mamajuana!! This is a herbal blend fused with rum and honey and you drink it as a shooter. Too many and you are toast in a hurry. The rum drinks were great too and they will mix anything of your liking up with it. TIP: Be nice and drop a $5 spot on the bartenders by the bar closest to your room or near the main pool bar (Gri-Gri) and you will get great service and drinks. Ask for your drinks Fuerte style (strong) and they will hook you up. And please, get friendly and chatty with the staff. The d.r. people are lots of fun and very nice!!ACTIVITIES: The animation staff gets involved in all kinds of interactive things with the guests. Get involved!! You are on vacation!! They are great. This happens everywhere from the pools to the beach. BEACHES: Been around and love how vast and wide the beach is. White sand, blue water, 100ft tall palm trees. Enough said??PEOPLE: I met folks from all over the world. Get busy with the spanish before you go. You just need to know some basics. If I had french and spanish in the bag, I'd have met many more girls as I was traveling as a single but soon had a huge group I was hanging with from all over the world and we stuck together like glue.ROOMS: Some issues but no big deal. A\/C went out but was promply repaired. Drop a $5 spot onto your housekeeper the first morning and tell her you need plenty of bottled water (which is great water\/natural spring and mineralized) and she will hook you up daily. All bad reviews take note: You are in DR not home!!
