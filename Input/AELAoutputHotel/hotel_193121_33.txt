{"text":"Setting the standard. I have recently returned from my second stay at The Milestone Hotel within the last month.I was initially recommended the hotel by American Express (Centurion Card-Black Card), their restaurant and hotel recommendations are generally very good.The Milestone was recently voted the fourth best hotel in the world by a leading travel magazine and I can unreservadly endorse this accolade. London has a comprehensive choice of hotels ranging from budget to some of the worlds best........this is one of the worlds best for customer service. The hotel is relatively small with less than sixty bedrooms, it was built in the 19th century as two townhouses and retains many of its original period features. All of the rooms are totally different but have all been decorated with style and imagination, we stayed in The Royal Studio which was wonderful but our two children (young adults 18 and 20) stayed in a twin room which was equally impressive. During our stay to celebrate our sons 18th birthday, we visited and ate at two other top London hotels, The Sanderson and St Martins Lane. In order to benchmark all three hotels, we asked to look at their respective guestrooms. If you are looking for trendy, minimalist and very over priced, you will love the Sanderson and St Martins Lane, however if it is traditional with sumptious surroundings, don't hesitate in selecting The Milestone Hotel as your choice.I own a business in the UK and have been very fortunate to have travelled extensively on both business and pleasure and can honestly say that this hotel exceeded my expectations more than any other hotel. Like most things in life, quality and service generally come with a premium price attached and The Milestone is no exception to this rule. In summary, this is a premium 5 star hotel that will not disappoint even the most discerning international travellers but prepare yourself for the final bill, particularly if you use the mini bar in your room.If you do stay at The Milestone, you will enjoy exceptional service and a memorable experience that sets the standard for all other London hotels.
