{"text":"Awsome We have just returned from the Gran Bahia Principe in Punta Cana on March 6 th after staying there a week with our kids 10 and 13.I'm a first time writer here and have decided to give a review to help others to become informed...Pros: Just about everything was awesome.We chose a resort using the Air Canada travel magazine and relied on their rating system from 1 to 5 quality of different things to look for in a resort.This hotel was a BEST SELLER which in itself is worth something.The sand on the beach was velvety,it was cleaned every night,the water was warm enough you did not freeze if there was a wind...It was perfect.I could list all the things that are pros but honestly it was a 9.5 out of 10 from every single member of the family so ill move on.Cons: When we arrived to our room the first night at midnight,we had to wait a half hour for the bellboy to go back to the front desk twice so that the reception could give him a room key that was programmed to OPEN the door.We had to laugh after because we had read about that experience here...Not a big deal...People would reserve the long chairs at the main pool and on the beach with there towels really early in the morning...that sucked! I'm on vacation and do not like to have to be rushed to do something,i run around all year,but of course i had to do the same to get a good spot,so get ready to run to the beach b4 breakfast...The vendors at the Pueblo village were a little to rambunctions for my liking,I'm Canadian and do not like to be shouted at to be someones friend,so a firm NO GRACIAS is all it takes to sake them off you. It was humurous standing back and watching the approaching prey be corraled by the first vendors as they walked into the open village,be ready folks,remember NO GRACIAS...lolThere are mosquitos,bring a fly swatter for your room,bring Watkins bug reppelent and be patient to find the mosquito you saw fly by in ur room because they are tiny...We have beefy mosquitos in Canada.Last but not least,when you arrive by bus at the airport to depart the bus driver says on the speakers to wait a second for the bags to be unloaded off the bus before he lets you get out...Get ready...there are a bunch of guys there holding your bags and will not let them go,they ask you what airline and want you to follow them for 50 feet to stand in the line up and then they wait for you to tip them,what a scam...I was trapped to tip them 5 bucks because i had no dollard bills and the guy had change to break a 20...I laugh now because i told my wife that in my single days i would have told them to take a hike with no tip but being a compliant husband that i am i listened to my wife and broke the 20...grrrrr!!! So you must grab hold of your stuff and say one thing NO GRACIAS,NO GRACIAS,NO GRACIAS...Have a great trip and laugh about the mishaps,its part of travelling.. ","annotations":[]}
