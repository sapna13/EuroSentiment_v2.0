{"text":"Great Location, Rooms and Service We began our vacation by staying at this hotel and ended our vacation by staying at this hotel. On both occasions we were very pleased.In all we booked 3 rooms, all were ready when we arrived even though we were late and didn't check in until 4 AM. The rooms were a good size,large if your comparing them to European hotels and average if comparing them to North American hotels. All rooms were very clean, the beds were comfortable and the hotel was very quite. If you are there on business, there are internet hook-ups in each of the rooms and the charge for an hour was $70 HKD and $120HKD for a 24 hour period. If you haven't got the appropriate plug in remember to bring an adapter. If you're not travelling with your own laptop the hotel does have a business centre that charges a little more for internet service than your room.The service in the hotel was fantastic. There is a Martini bar on the main floor that is quite small but good for a meeting place. The hotel has 3 restaurants and the food for the breakfast buffet is delicious. We also had dim sum in the chinese restaurant, located downstairs, it too was fantastic.The location of this hotel was central. We went across the water to Hong Kong Island and it was about a 10 minute walk to the ferry station. Once on Hong Kong Island, if you want to go to Stanley Market you have to take a cab but it was very cheap $120 HKD. Stanley Market is like a big flea market with quite a bit of touristy stuff. I'm glad I went and saw but I didn't buy anything there.The hotel is also very close to Nathan Road, about a 10 minute walk as well. If you want electronics this is a good place to buy them. Very cheap in comparison to Canadian prices. If your looking for watches and Bags, this is the place to be. Just listen for the guys asking you if you want to buy copy watches or bags, their everywhere.Restaurants and places to eat are easy to find, all you have to do is walk around. We had some great meals but also took advice from our Frommer's book on Honk Kong-Highly recommended.
