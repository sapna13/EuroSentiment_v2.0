{"text":"Great value, comfortable hotel Pike Street Suites is a hotel of excellent value, conveniently located, spacious, with many comforts. My husband and I chose this hotel on a 3-day weekend for its location and low price (we paid $119 + tax on Expedia for a 1-br king suite). It had been recommended by my sister. The suite was large, very clean and true to the advertised floor plan. Contemporary furnishings, two plasma TVs, decent lighting, free wireless internet, and free local phone calls. We only used the refrigerator and microwave, but there was a full kitchen for meal preparation. The bed was very comfy, with crisp, quality linens, comfy pillows and excellent mattress. I particularly appreciated the blackout window shades. I did not hear any freeway or road noise from our courtyard-view room, and I am typically a light sleeper. We also enjoyed the medium sized private balcony, which overlooked cherry trees blossoming in the courtyard.The bathroom is average+. Marble counter and contemporary fixtures, but only an average sized tub and vanity area. Nothing terribly fancy, but perfectly clean. The workout room is small but has all the equipment I wanted. It was warm enough to enjoy the heated outdoor pool and jacuzzi, which were cozy but quite nice. There is also an indoor jacuzzi. The hotel is a short walk (uphill!) from the convention center and downtown shopping. Last fall, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt, which is about 3 blocks away. While the Grand Hyatt is elegant and more luxurious, we had much more space at Pike Street Suites at about half to 1\/3 the price. The lobby is still undergoing renovations, but we were not bothered by construction noise. Breakfast-in-a-bag was available, but we did not try it. A conversion to Homewood Suites is expected for later this spring. Hopefully, the hotel will retain its charms.
