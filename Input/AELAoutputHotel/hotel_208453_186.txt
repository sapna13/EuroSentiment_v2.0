{"text":"Hilton Times Square: The best place to stay! I stayed at the Hilton Times Square during the pre-Christmas rush. I got a real bargain on the price by booking directly via the website in September. We stayed from 13th until 17th December (4 nights) in a 2 bed deluxe room for only 1,279.32 USD. This was amazingly low if you take the exchange rate with Sterling into account.The room was spacious (much bigger than any other NYC hotel I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in) and spotlessly clean. We had a spectacular view of the Empire State Building. The hotel was quite festive with a large Christmas tree in the lobby and a Menorah, since it was Hanukah during our stay.The hotel is in the best possible location if you want to be in the heart of the action. Noise is not a problem inside. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat at the hotel. There are many food outlets nearby, including Applebee√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, located on the ground floor of the hotel, which is good for breakfast, burgers, milkshakes etc. The BB King Blues club is located across the street and is a good place to see a live band. The subway station is at the end of the block, making it easy to get to Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ via Grand Central Station. Macy√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ is a short walk down town.Staff members were very friendly and extremely helpful. I asked for information about shipping something back to Ireland and they arranged everything for me, including packaging, without any service charge. I also made use of the safety deposit boxes at reception. These proved to be very useful as I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to leave my laptop in the room safe. When it came time to check out I asked to check out an hour late. They agreed to this with no charge. Closer to the time I decided I would like to stay for another hour and they said that would be no problem but that there would be a small charge of $25. When I finally checked out they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ charge me at all. We also had the free nightly turn-down service with chocolates left on the pillows.This was my fourth trip to New York and this is the best hotel experience I have had yet. (I am particular about hotels!)I will definitely consider staying here again.
