{"text":"Nice little hotel i the heart of town My wife collects owls and when we planned a three day trip to Amsterdam, it was natural that the Owl Hotel caught our eye. While that was interesting enough, it was the reviews on TripAdvisor that decided for us. We were not disappointed.It is in an excellent location, on a quiet street in the center of town, hardly a ten to fifteen minute stroll from the major museums and the entertainment and eating places of the Leidseplein.You can get there easily by tram from the Central Station, if you don't mind a ten minute walk with your baggage. For about fifteen euros a taxi will drop you of at the door.The complimentary breakfast, is a small but nice spread, served in a room overlooking a little garden, where it would be great to sit when the weather allows us to.Its a small hotel but neat and clean with all the basic facilities.The staff were very friendly and helpful.The safe in the room is at ground level inside the wardrobe. Lying flat on my stomach I couldn't read the instructions. Fortunately, they have a lockers at reception where you can keep your stuff.While you cant make coffee or tea in the room, the drinks at the bar are reasonably priced.If you carried a lap top, wifi costs three euros for an hour, (compared to six euros for half an hour at the place we stayed at Antwerp). If you use the hotel's computer, internet is complimentary.We really enjoyed our stay at the Owl Hotel and while leaving my wife was happy to give them an owl to add to their small collection !!
