{"text":"Excellent value We had an excellent stay at the Hotel Nizza in Florence. The hotel couldn't be more central: it's within a stroll of the railway station and Duomo, and within 10 minutes of all the other major sites. There are also numerous snack bars and restaurants on the doorstep.There is a flight of stone steps up to the reception area (no lift, but this was not a problem). There is a lobby area adjacent to reception which has a PC with internet access, seating and a small library. We had room 22 which is on the same floor as the reception area and facing a side street. The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. Neither of us speak Italian but we had no communication problems. One of the owners in particular had good English and enjoyed telling us about his trip to Scotland many years ago.The room was clean and tidy and had everything we needed (apart from maybe an extra pillow √à√\u2020\u2022?but I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure one would have been provided if we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° asked). There was some traffic noise at night but not enough to stop us sleeping - besides, this is the centre of Florence.Breakfast is buffet style (7.30 √à√\u2020\u2022?10.00am): bread rolls, croissants, meat, cheese, jams, cereals, juice and hot drinks √à√\u2020\u2022?simple but adequate. Drinks can also be obtained during the day.I would thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget who wants to be in the centre of Florence. We got a really good deal with Filcoo.com and stayed four nights for 200 euros. I would definitely stay at the Hotel Nizza again when\/if I return to Florence.
