{"text":"Perfect business hotel in Phoenix Just returned from a business trip where I spent 2 nights in Phoenix at the Ritz Carlton. After staying at other, more spa-like Phoenix hotels in the past year, it was a pleasure to be at a hotel that so thoroughly pampers and caters to business travelers. From the moment I arrived in a taxi to the moment I left for the airport, each and every staff member I encountered offered any assistance they could provide to make my trip more productive and stress-free. And, while to a person, they were terrific, none was more excellent than the concierge, Gail Daugherty. What a great person to have on your side to make a road warriors's life easier. I had to make difficult to get dinner reservations at a top restaurant for an important client dinner and she not only took care of me, but called to tell me everything was set up and then after, to check and make sure everything went smoothly. Kudo's to the Ritz management for hiring such an impressive concierge. She truly made me feel that nothing was too big or too difficult for her to accomplish.As far as accommodations, the rooms were typical Ritz Carlton, lots of traditional furniture, very comfy beds and marble bathrooms. While not as up-to-date in style as other hotels (plasma TV's, CD players, etc.,) the rooms were perfectly comfortable with more than adequate room to work and relax.I know that others will prefer newer, hipper properties when they go to Phoenix, but when I have to be there on business, you'll find me happily esconsed at the Ritz Carlton.
