{"text":"Loved the Ritz-Carlton I stayed at this hotel, for one night at the end of August. I'm very fussy but I found the service to be excellent and the room itself was very good indeed. Although it was only a standard room it was large with 2 queen sized beds and lots of lovely big pillows and cushions. The bathroom was the best I've ever had with a lovely big shower as well as a bath.Although the building is modern it has a faux ninteeenth centruy interior but manages not to look tacky. I've stayed at many excellent hotels, including the Crillon in Paris which is supposed to be one of the best hotels in the world, but to be honest, this one was better and the bathrom was in a different league altogether.My only complaint was that the air con wasn't very efficient but it wasn't too hot so this was not a major problem. It might be different in a heatwave though. Also, I was next to some sort of service room which was a little noisy - although not enough to warrant complaining about. The breakfast is in the bistro, a genuine french bistro that they dismantled and rebulit in the hotel, I understand. It's a lovely seeting and although I'm not usually that keen on buffet breaksfasts this one was excellent - one of the best with very good selection of good quality foods.If you're looking for a 5 star hotel in central Berlin and are dont' want a small 'boutique' hotel then you won't do better than the Ritz-Carlton.
