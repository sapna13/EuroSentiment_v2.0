{"text":"Orto De Medici is wonderful We found the hotel quite easily once we'd got the correct road from the station. Incidentally, the station and immediate surroundings weren't nearly as intimidating as we'd been led to believe. With luggage it seemed a bit further than we'd thought but it was ok. The hotel is magnificent, with a stunning reading\/tv room on the first floor. Amazing ceiling and decoration. Off the breakfast room there is a huge terrace, perfect for breakfast  very relaxing in the evenings too for a private aperitif watching the birds or reading a book, writing postcards.Our bedroom was very comfortable with solid wooden furniture, big windows  modern shower room. Fridge with wine, beer  water at reasonable prices, mini safe and a sensible 'green' policy for towels.All the staff were very helpful, courteous and informative, ensuring our stay of three nights was enjoyable and relaxing - important after a long day museum and church visiting. There were four restaurants within a couple of minutes walk from the hotel, three very good - we never got in to the fourth, always some reason why there wasn't a table. Probably their loss rather than ours. Further afield of course there were lots more, but we never wanted to venture too far from what became very quickly 'our area'. All hotels in Florence seemed expensive to us but we picked this one on the internet for medium price and location and we were more than satisfied. If we ever return to Florence we'd certainly hope to stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
