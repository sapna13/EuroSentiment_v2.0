{"text":"Good but a bit sloppy The Hotel Roemer was the final leg of our month-long excursion to Europe. We stayed in room 34, on the top floor which sold itself as a Junior Suite. The room was large and contained a small couch and table, so I guess that might be considered a suite? I'm not sure what the standard definition of a suite is, but for Amsterdam the room was large. I agree with the other reviews that the staff was incredibly relaxed and friendly. Offering a welcome drink seems to be the standard these days, but the hotel has an all-inclusive bar which made the place feel a bit like home. I enjoyed sitting down to a relaxing drink at the end of a very full day. We encountered a couple of problems, which for the price, were inexcusable because from other reviews, they seem to be recurring. First, for the first four mornings, the staff kept asking us for our confirmation to make sure that breakfast was included. I eventually emailed back the reservation to the hotel to clear things up. Second was the way that they handled breakfast. There aren't enough spaces for all the guests to eat at once, which is fine, but they don't have an orderly system to seat people when it's busy. Clearly a foreseeable problem. [We were directed to wait on the couches until a place was available, only to have other guests seat themselves at dirty tables. I was told by the staff that they didn't want to insult these people by telling them to wait, and instead chose to insult the rest of us who were already waiting. (I sound like an old geezer, don't I?) ] All of this leads me to the conclusion that the place is disorganized; management ought to know that the problem exists but chooses to ignore what a few simple changes would fix. It's just sloppy. No matter how friendly the service may be, for $625 a night, I expect much, much better. ","annotations":[]}
