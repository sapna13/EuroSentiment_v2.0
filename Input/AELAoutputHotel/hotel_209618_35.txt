{"text":"Ugh.... This trip was not all bad, but the negatives do out weigh the positives.First, you do need a rental car to get around, but be wary of the drivers, because they will cut across a 4 lane highway without signaling once. On the positive, the hotel is very beautiful and we had a wonderful view of the Atlantic. The staff is very friendly and polite for the most part and the cheesecake was to die for. On the negative side when we checked in at 4:30pm, we had to wait an additional 90 minutes because it wasnt ready. They were filming a Chilean soap opera right above us, so every morning we would wake at 7am to banging and noise above us. I have to agree with the other reviewer that the place felt like it was overrun with locals. It was packing with local business people from Merck and the hotel seemed to cater to them first. Several times, the Paradise Cafeteria was closed off to host their events. On Thursday night, the Merck people had a reception in a conference room that we could hear on the 4th floor. When we called to the front desk, they acted as if they didnt know what we were talking about and told us that they checked with the room right below us and didnt hear anything. Hello? Anyone in the lobby could have heard it. So my girlfriend and I decided to get dressed and join the Merck party. Why not? They were too wasted to care. Their was no conceirge the entire week. We had to enlist the help of local waiters to plan our trips to Cuomo and El Yunque. Be advised that the Blue Seahorse bar closes at 5pm. So if you want a frozen beverage or food and you are by the pool, you have to dry off, get dressed and go inside to the Calypso bar. And the manager reception does not include frozen drinks. The bottom line was that this experience could have been alot better. The hotel is beautiful, but management needs to get on the ball.
