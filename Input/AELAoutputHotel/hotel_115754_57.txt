{"text":"Be prepared to walk! My husband was attending a conference in this hotel, and I came along for the ride to experience Seattle for the first time.If you want easy access to all of the touristy spots in Seattle, this hotel is not a good choice. It is a mile hike to Pike Place market - and this city has its share of hills. It's not too much for me to walk miles and miles each day as a fit 30 year old, but it would be too much for the elderly or very young. There is a hotel shuttle, but the destinations are limited, and reservations are required. I decided not to bother with it.There apparently used to be self-parking here at one time, but no more! It's all valet. Sometimes they are in no hurry to retrieve your car, either. What a pain that is!The hotel lobby is clean and comfortable, and there is a small bar area as well as the breakfast room. Breakfasts consist of a buffet of waffles, pastries, fruit, eggs, bacon and sausage, oatmeal, bagels and other breads, yogurt, milk, and juices. It's repetitive, but free at least!The rooms can be loosely defined as suites. It's about the same size as a normal hotel room if you mentally remove dividing walls. There's a bed area, a bathroom, a couch and chair area, and a sink\/desk area. It's not big by any means, but it's not uncomfortable. Not a bad choice if you know what to expect.
