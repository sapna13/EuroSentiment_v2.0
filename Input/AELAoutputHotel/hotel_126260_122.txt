{"text":"Perfect Location...Best Beds in the City!! Arrived Sunday at noon and room was ready. Stayed till Wednesday 3\/5. stayed on 22nd floor overlooking St Pats. Just past St Pats is Rockafellar (sp?) Center. You can see both clearly and they are a VERY short walk away from the hotel. the photos of the hotel are nice but they do not do it justice. The lobby area is busy but maintains a crisp look throughout the day. Management at this hotel is to be commended for its cleanliness!! The location of The Palace is among the best. You are 3-4 blocks over from Time Square, 5-6 blocks south of Central Park, across the street from St Pats, 1 block down from The Rock...Easy walk to get a cup of coffee and check out the Today show....I know..it sounds goofy but I have to say it was cool having coffee at Dean and Daluca and checking out Ann Curry and Al Roker...More so Ann Curry! There are 5 star restaurants nearby and neighborhood deli's around each corner. Easy to eat for $8 or $80.The absolute best part of The Palace was the bedding. I am not sure what they use or exactly how they get the bed just right but they have perfected it. The pillows are full but not too hard. The sheets are crisp and the comforters just the right weight. The room temperature was easy to control from the bedside table. Another neat feature that is not always found in 5 star hotels is lighting controls for the entire room on the bedside table. This place is hitting on all cylinders. All things considered..location, things to do, cleanliness, comfort, service, and anything else you can imagine, this could be the best overall hotel I have ever experienced.
