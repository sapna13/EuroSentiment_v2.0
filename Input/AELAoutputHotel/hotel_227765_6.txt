{"text":"Could Barely Stand 1 NIght A travel agent selected this hotel for my inlaws, husband, brother-in-law and myself. We were originally supposed to stay there for 6 nights. We arrived to discover a booking mishap - they had put us in a suite, even though the travel agent had sent confirmation that they had booked a suite. (we'll get back to the word suite a bit later) We finally got into our suite and found the carpet on the way to the elevator extremely worn and dirty. Once in the room, we found terribly outdated furniture and the smallest kitchenette I had ever seen. The couch in the front room was coming apart and our remote control was missing the battery cover. (a small detail but gives you an idea of what to expect) I carefully inspected the beds before getting in to find stains on certain sides of all the pillows and hairs on the old blankets under our comforter. I slept with only the sheet - I was too grossed out to cover up with the blanket. We could hear the guy in the next room snoring, using the bathroom, showering, flushing, etc..... The bathroom was gross. We saw mold in spots and I didn't feel much cleaner after I got out of the shower. I definitely think the word suite is a stretch as the one tiny bathroom and small bedrooms with not much extra space for luggage was a pretty tight fit, even for 5 of us. In the morning, we were awoken by the sounds of dumpsters and trash trucks. After suffering through one night, my mother-in-law got on the phone and got us transferred to another hotel. We had to pay more but we were glad to do so. I don't think I could've stood to stay there much longer. Overall - icky. ","annotations":[]}
