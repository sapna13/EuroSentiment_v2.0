{"text":"Just what we needed! Read this and then just GO! I read all the reviews from every site about this hotel and frankly, that was a mistake. I mean it gave us some good tips, but we really needed to just review for ourselves. More importantly, we needed to get away. Just go and enjoy every little moment with R and R in mind. You must really enjoy the people you are with as you will spend a lot of time with them, but this was great with us. I will tell you this for 100% sure: the sandy beaches and the unbelievable four shades of blue waters were worth every dime. I've never seen anything like it. The waves are great to play in and there are no jelly fish or sharp rocks, not even big shells! Just soft, cool, white sand! My advice: (and then you decide for yourself) yes, take singles for tips (about 70 for a four night stay), get to all the restaurants, but be open minded for new and different, (Fuego was our favorite), stay along the beach (we had royal service) and stayed on the end right on the ocean. Only do the Reserve thing if the room is the most important part of your stay. Yes, it has bigger, newer rooms and it has a great jacuzzi, but it's further from the beach. They will try to do the timeshare thing, but they took no very graciously. (IF we ever buy a timeshare, it'd be here). Girls, bring your own personal items including conditioner; boys- bring a camera! There were several weddings while we were there over the Thanksgiving break and they were lovely, but beach walkers practically walked into the ceremony. (Some people have no manners.) Wedding planners- take a close look at music set up. The native men\/ employees are beautiful and kind and totally spoil you! We still miss Juan! Ask for things you need, do it in a nice way and share some dollars! (We had wine, beer, pillows, special baths prepared, cheese and fruit plates) and DEFINITELY do the massage on the beach. You cannot beat the sound of waves while getting a couples massage at the top of the tower.  I wouldn't advise going out of the property- there's really no reason. The horseback riding was great fun, but they treat their horses horribly! They are not in very good shape and the workers assume all we want to do is run the whole time. You do have to go off the property to ride. Overall, after talking to other people about nearby resorts, we felt we got the best deal. It'd be nice not to have to worry about tipping and having the right cash around, but it was also worth it!
