{"text":"Nice Renovations; Bed Type Issues Booked through Expedia, which guaranteed a King Bed. Because I'm wary of such promises when I didn't book direct with the hotel, I called the day of arrival to reconfirm a non-smoking King. The desk agent reconfirmed the bed type, so I felt confident about getting what we were promised.At check it, I saw that the Registration Card also stated Nonsmoking King, so I didn't reconfirm it with the desk clerk - I thought that would be overkill.We found our room - the halls are definitely taking some wear and tear from the renovations, but the room was beautiful - hardwood floors, well-appointed kitchenette, beautiful large bathroom, very comfortable modern sofa and a queen sized bed!We didn't notice the size of the bed until after we were completely unpacked (we were staying four nights), so didn't feel like re-packing and moving, so we didn't ask management to correct the situation. But it was mildly annoying to have taken so much effort, even on the day of arrival, and to have our promised bed type switched out from under us at check in.Otherwise, the stay was nice - good breakfast in the lobby each morning, with hot options in addition to cold. And it was very nice to have the kitchen - we were able to make hot tea and chocolate every afternoon after cold days in Seattle's December weather.We usually stay here because of the excellent location between downtown and first hill. We can generally walk anywhere, and we very much enjoy that.On the day of departure we called to see if the hotel shuttle was available to take us to the train station - I had asked the day before and was told they didn't take reservations and it was on a first come, first served basis. I was told that the van had just left in the opposite direction and wouldn't be back for at least 45 minutes, so we took a cab instead. After checking our luggage at the train station, we walked a block to a coffee shop and were passed on the street by the hotel shuttle!Having stayed here regularly for the last 8 years or so, I must say that the details have usually been handled better than during this stay. These little blips weren't enough to make me move to another hotel, but repeats of the same will definitely make me think about it, if I see similar issues in the future.
