{"text":"Room with breakfast The highlight of the Oriental is its breakfast buffet--be sure to book a room that includes this breakfast in the price! (our special rate from the Mandarin Oriental hotel website included breakfast and late checkout)The rooms we had were in need of some modernisation, although the bathrooms seemed to have been upgraded more recently than the main area. Marble everywhere and a great power rain shower--and above average toiletries. The beds were not of the standard the Marriott and Westin now have made commonplace, although the linens were definitely luxe. TV had a wide range of channels. Service to the rooms was exceptional: fresh fruit left every day and at evening turndown, new towels and free bottled water. The breakfast buffet is huge and the quality like nothing else I've encountered (and I travel a lot). Wait staff have many, many tables to take care of, but do it all with ease and friendliness. I was much more impressed by them than by the reception staff who were very formal and frankly rather slow....Location is very good--a big mall adjoining, the Esplanade theatres and waterfront across the street, and less than 10 minutes walk to a wide range of restaurants including the lovely CHIJMES complex. Taxis were readily available outside the hotel and it's very cheap indeed to go anywhere in the city. I would definitely stay here again and for my children it was a memorable experience of a top-end hotel. This is a business hotel that makes families welcome too and it would likely suit all types of visitor.
