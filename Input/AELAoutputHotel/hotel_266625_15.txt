{"text":"Was Ok-Wouldnt Go Back Stayed at Cocotal Sept 2008 for 2wks and believe me after the 1st week i just wanted to go home-overal there was 10 of us ranging from the age of 65 to my young son who is 2 and also 3 teeanagers.i cannot fault the staff ans food at the hotel, and also the animation, but please please let me warn you about the mosquitos-they bite with a vengance!! all of my party 10 of us were biten all over-the worse seemed to be in the evening. I think somebody must have complained to manager about it, cos the bites seemed to have eased off about 2days before we were due to leave. but for most of a week n half i was basically scratch scratch scatch and nasty marks were left on my legs, arms!! Also the pool bar-whilst we were there there were men constantly at the pool-and believe me they Never got out to go to the toilet-so u can imagine WHERE DID THEY GO TOILET??? il leave to your imagination....i would also like to warn you all of the spiders over there-they are huge! that is the main point which put me off going back to the cocotal.but apart from the above i have expressed the hotel was fab-food brill-the italian, and chinese i particulary enjoyed. and also quad biking was brill, didnt go to the dolphin park as they are cruel to the dolphins so wasnt wasting my money on that...My Son is only 2 and there was nothing at all for him to do they have a park but i found it dangerous, there was a big gap at the end of the slide and it was basically falling apart.The animation team were brill, spaghetti was the main leader of them and my god he was so so funny, also the theatre in the evening have different shows each night-brill aswel, except the 2nd week the seemed to repeat most of the same shows so we were not happy about that as there was nothing else to do, just sit in the lounge area and get bite by mosquitos.
