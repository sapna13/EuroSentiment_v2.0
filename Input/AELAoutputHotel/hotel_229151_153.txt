{"text":"Disappointing - why is it so highly rated This hotel is highly rated and we cannot understand why when you have so much choice in Amsterdam for others.They first proposed room 405 (standard room) which is a very tiny room with no view (there are others like this one actually). You can actually find better in an economy hotel for far less money. We refused the room (they were maybe expecting we would accept it because we booked it on the internet with a discount - why do they have to try it, thinking people are stupid - it is always unpleasant to refuse rooms). We changed to room 415. This room was a little bit bigger, still with no view and had really nothing special. We had to accept it as we were told there was nothing else. We waked up several times during the two nights of our stay. We could actually hear each step of the neighbors on top (what is unpleasant) and more important the hotel was noisy (you can easely hear the neighbors when they come during the night, when they leave in the morning or when they just talk). On top of that, the shower was not working the second day.Globally, we found this hotel very expensive for what it is (especially if you have to pay 250 euros for a standard - basic room) and were disappointed. Of course, the location is good and the bibliotheque charming but this is not obviously where people sleep and rest to better enjoy the city later on. ","annotations":[]}
