{"text":"quite the trip !!!! We stayed there from January 14th until the January 21st. It was a last minute decision just to get some rays before going back to work. We figured for what we paid for, we should not expect too much....Staff: very very friendly and helpful, nice people and hard working. So tip and do not be cheap!!The hotel was recently taken over by Barcelo and compared with other Barcelo hotels it does not qualify as a 4.5 star, more like a3.5 Star.Amenities :Well, as we got into the tropics around 1pm our rooms were not ready and we were advised that there is a water leak in the building. So for now no room with no water !!! We finally got the water back but it was cold most of the time. The 3 days of rain and heavy winds did not help much and with no hot water to take a shower things took a pretty rough turn.Rooms: TV barely worked, not a big deal if you spend the day on the beach, but if the wx turns then i like to watch a show once in a while, fridge was not stocked, always had to request water with the maids, beds too small for 2 people ect. ect....lol :), so if you decide to spend your honeymoon there i would suggest to think twice of going into that hotel or request a suite. Also no working telephone and oh...bring a ringer if you do not wanna sleep in every day.Pool: 3 pools clean and plain nothing spectacular copared with other hotels.Food:Buffet style has 4 a la carte restaurants , in my oppinion the spanish restaurant was excellent.Stay away from the mexican restaurant, you are after all in the dominican republic and if you expect real mexican food then jet over to the mayan riviera.Buffet : After 2 days of buffet we already had enough ...ouch!!! 5 more days of buffet. We are not picky eaters and it was a bit like hit and miss some days it was very good and some days less. Every day Pizza and Pasta in the italian corner.... Not much variety and is very much geared to North Americans and not much local food. Clientele: families with kiz and tonns of elderly people.Beach:white sand but it is not very shallow in front of this hotel and gets deep pretty quick. Can not compare with the maldives or the canary islands but further down towards the Palladium the beach gets nicer and more shallow, but that is also a 30 minute walk on the beach.Animations: The animations team works hard but if you are expecting club med standards that is not the place to be. In this hotel the activities are not on time or do not exist at all even if it is advertised.Shows: The animations team does also the shows at night and the costumes are beautiful as well as the dancing. But once you have seen one show you have seen em all. No variety either like Karaoke ect.Nightclub: was a nice layout lots of latin musicWe got what we paid for and just for a week to lay on the beach and do nothing it is ok, but i personally would not suggest this hotel nor Punta Cana for people who are looking for the trip of a lifetime or honeymooners.Spend the monney and maybe choose a different island in the carribean like turks and caicos, the bahamas or aruba where there is less mass tourism, smaller hotels and a bit a different clientele.ds\/ck ottawa ","annotations":[{"endOffset":266,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":262},{"endOffset":1836,"mention":"Pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1831},{"endOffset":1846,"mention":"Pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":1841},{"endOffset":2721,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2717}]}
