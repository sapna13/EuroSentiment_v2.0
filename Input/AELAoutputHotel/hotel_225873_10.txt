{"text":"Charlesmark perfect for Boston Let's first dispense with the only neg: yes, the rooms are small. But this is a small building and the spaces were very cleverly distributed. It was not uncomfortable at all. Room size is sufficient to crash after walking the city and they are fairly new, well decorated, very clean and I didn't experience any noise problems.Now with the good: This was my first time in Boston. I made the reservations by e-mail for pre and post cruise stays. The e-mail reservation was handled swiftly, as was my re-confirmation request.Price\/value - I really looked around and couldn't find anything better in such a central location. $206.00 is really a good deal for this little jewel of a place.Location - Excellent. If the location was any better, it would probably be ruined. We walked everywhere from the hotel. Steps from the Prudential mall, T-Station, Newbury street, and right next to some pretty good restaurants (make reservations early).Check in - We first arrived around 6:00 Pm on a Friday and the check in process was fast and painless. Nice young lady at the desk. On our second check in, we arrived too early, but another nice young lady took our bags and was very dilligent in informing us when our room was ready. Our bags were waiting for us in the room.Facilities - Nice bar just off the lobby. Great bartenders. Good people-watching outside deck. PC's and laser jet printer available for guests just off the bar. Again, building is small but the elevator is full size.Food - The hotel has an adequate and basic breakfast available for free. There's a Thai restaurant right next door. I didn't try it but the other guests seem to like it. They serve in the hotel as if it were a hotel restaurant, but it is not. There are many nearby eating places, from cheap and fast to very upscale. On busy nights, wait times can be from one to two hours so make reservations early. We tried the Legal Seafoods at the nearby Prudential - overrated. We settled for the Cheesecake Factory also at Prudential (we had enough seafood and gourmet cooking during our cruise). It's the best value as restaurants here are too expensive.Attractions - I cannot emphasize enough about the central location of this place. In two hours, we leisurely walked from the hotel, to the Gardens, Commons, Freedom Trail up to the Quincy Market. We took the T green line back (that sucked). On an evening, we walked around Newbury just behind the hotel. Did I say that the hotel is in the middle of everything?Plumbing problems and such - NONE. Everything worked just fine.Check out - Also painless. We left early for the airport and the gentleman manning the desk was nice enough to help us with our bags and even risked life and limb to step into the street with a whistle and a flashlight to hail a cab from the nearby Lennox hotel for us. Before we had a chance to thank him, he was already walking away. I say this because he did so very professionally, not hanging around expecting a tip or anything.
