{"text":"Great hotel, great location... We visited NYC as our honeymoon and booked the Sofitel on the basis of TripAdvisor reviews.The location of the hotel is absolutely ideal for mid-town Manhatten. For example, Times Square is 3mins walk away, subway stations the same and the Empire State Building is 5mins walk away. The hotel is smack bang next to 5th Avenue for all you shoppers out there!The hotel itself is beautifully decorated. It's style is French art-deco and this is reflected in the lobby and throughout. All areas of the hotel are spotlessly clean and well-maintained by staff.The concierge and reception desk are especially helpful and the free internet access in reception is also very useful. We checked in late on a Saturday night and the receptionist was incredibly friendly and polite. I had put a request in for a 'high' room for our honeymoon and the hotel obliged and even left us a lovely bottle of champagne in an ice bucket up there! A nice touch!Rooms are immaculate and the beds are really comfortable, plenty of TV channels, mini bar, chaise longe etc and the bathrooms are nicely decorated, well-maintained and spacious. The 'turn down' service, where the staff come in at night and prepare your bed ready for you made me smile each night!We enjoyed a wonderful stay at the Sofitel NYC. I can't comment on the food at the hotel, as we ate out for every single meal, but I would highly recommend this hotel for any type of visitor to NYC ","annotations":[{"endOffset":959,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":955},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":955},{"endOffset":959,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":955}]}
