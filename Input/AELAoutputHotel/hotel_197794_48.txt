{"text":"Apparently flowers such as black tulips are rare or impossible in nature ....... Just wanted to write a review for this lovely,friendly,small but perfectly positioned hotel.In all honesty I came across this hotel probably just like you through reading other people's opinions on it and the only problem I could foresee where that a couple of websites and reviews mentioned that this was a menonly hotel.Fortunately this did not stop me from using their contact page to send the owners a mail asking if they were happy for mixed couples to use the hotel and happily the answer was yes.I really would recommend this hotel for adventurous travellers who are looking for something very different but at the same time very homely.The owners are very flexible on everything that matters,like check in times and breakfast times .... which by the way are 10.00am to 12.00,how many times have you wanted that to be true! but they are very careful in explaining security and house rules which is fine by me.We spent most of the second day in our room ( funnily enough,as they are sooo perfect for naughty nights away!) but at no stage did we feel as if we were getting in the way,we were just left in peace.The nice thing was that we were told the best places to visit,where the best restaurants were and loads of useful information and I really cannot understand an old review on here commenting on language barriers or bad staff as it is so not the case!This black tulip is extremely rare ........ a hotel in a bustling and centrally located part of town that makes you feel relaxed and at home but also allows you to be as adventurous as your imagination will take you..... we fell in love with Amsterdam and I blame this hotel !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
