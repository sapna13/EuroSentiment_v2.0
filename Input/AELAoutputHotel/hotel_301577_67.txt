{"text":"Reliable - good 4 star option This was my second stay within 12 months at this hotel. Admittedly I booked it because it was the one of the cheapest and best options available to me. The Singapore Airshow was on - which means that hotels are running at 95%+ full - so the rates relect that. I paid $350++ SGD which converted to $411 AUD. this is not cheap and you could normally stay at the best hotel intown for this price - but rooms were really at a premium. I guess what I am saying is BOOK AHEAD!The hotel is very well located - on a MRT station (cheap and so easy to use this transport), and is also on the river at Clarke Quay - so there are plenty of dining and touristy options for you. There is also a shopping centre next door - great for quick lunch, or some retail therapy - I can also recommend the pedicure at the Anthony hair salon.The room was a bit daggy - but very clean, with all that you need, and a large bathroom.There was a note saying that the hotel was doing a refurb - which I guess it needs decor wise - but I didn't hear any noise. One bonus was that I was able to check in at 10am and sleep off some jet lag. Check out was 12noon - but extended to 1pm.Staff were very friendly and helpful.Pool and spa were both very good.I would recommend this hotel to all - the rooms aren't super flash - but the room size, staff, location etc all make this a really great option - cheaper than orchard area too.
