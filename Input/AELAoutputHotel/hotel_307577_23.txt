{"text":"Fantastic! We (me, husband, 13yr old and 7yr old daughters) for 10 nights in July and loved it.The hotel grounds, pools and staff are superb. Our rooms were clean and comfortable. We stayed in the Garden Wing (near to reception) and would be happy to do so again. The Spa is out of this world, we had free jet lag massages and thought we had died and gone to heaven!Our only complaint is that the drains in the bathrooms smelt really bad, so we always kept the doors to the bathrooms closed (as one does anyway, so not really a problem). We did tell reception about this and the smell did improve (drains cleaned out perhaps??) but did not disappear altogether. Having said that, this was our only complaint and frankly not a big enough problem to ask for a room change, remember Bali is in the third world so one shouldn't expect western standards on everything!!The hotel beach was lovely, even when the tide was out the kids went wild looking at all the starfish, hermit crabs, shells etcetera. We didn't swim in the sea, the pools were just too good!!Shopping in Sanur was great, although more expensive than Kuta. In fact we found the stall holders less pushy in Kuta so preferred to shop there. Restaurants in Sanur were also more expensive but we really enjoyed eating all over the place, Kuta included. In Sanur we particularly enjoyed the Wayan bar and grill. The beach front restaurant in the Puri Santrian was outstanding although expensive (by Bali standards, but hey, that is what you get when you eat in a hotel).I have already recommended this hotel to just about everyone who asks how our trip was. I would gladly stay here again, although I would ask to check out the bathrooms first. This hotel only has a 3 star rating, I think it is the bathrooms that let it down, also minor things like towels being old and not very soft, poor internet access etc. I couldn't care less about these sorts of minor details. What is important to me is the hotel surrounds, location, pools, staff and cleanliness and comfort of the rooms and on these points the hotel more than delivers. If you are looking for all the extras that a luxury 5 star hotel provides then this isn't the hotel for you. If you are a family or a couple on a bit of a budget looking for an above average hotel then this is the one. I hope this helps, we chose this hotel based on the outstanding reviews we read here!Enjoy!!
