{"text":"A detailed, real, description Here is a detailed description of what you get at the Carabella. I wouldnt go back myself but if you got a great price in the 600$ range than I wouldnt discourage you to go if yo are prepared for a 2-3 star not 4 star hotel.Lobbycomfortable with a bar in the lobby that is open in the evening. At least at this bar they give you a glass not a plastic cup for your drinksRoomsThe rooms are in need of renovations but were kept clean although you still might find a cockroach and bugs. We had to change rooms because the frist had a very large leak in the bathroom. We got a second room with just a small leak. The shower depening on the time of day and the room had very litlle hot water. The air conditioner worked well and was quiet in the second room. There is a mini fridge with a large bottle of water in it and it is replaced everyday. The sliding doors do not lock and the screen doors dont work. After taking to some guards they said the place is very safe. The safe cost 10$ per week. You have to ask for a remote control. There are two english chanels one movie channel.BreakfastAmericn type foods, eggs bread hams and cheese lots of fried meat, fruit smoothies and only 4 types of fruit. Coffee is terrible. If you want a decent tasting coffee get the double espresso in the vending machine.LunchThere are 10 hot dishes to choose from and usualy fried meat two types of pasta, make your own fajitas, rice and a traditional meat dish. There are two salad bars. The desserts were good usually 5 to choose from. At least 5 of the hot dishes were not edible.DinnerThe same as above, a fried meat of every type of animal inc. fish. I found half of the dishes unedible. There is a make your own pasta bar which was good. you choode the ingrediants you want and the sauce and the chef mixes and cooks it on front of you. A la carte resturantsThe grill\/seafood resturant was very good everybody enjoyed there dinners thereThe mexican resturant was goos but spicy and upset out stomachs later.The Italian resturant had good pizzaThe beach bar has ice cream hamburgers hotdogs fried fish and french fries.DrinksA lot of cheap brands alcohol, the beer was good the mixed drinks were too sweet and they didnt use any fruit in any of the drinks. The pool bar was not manned, empty and not usedThe grounds and beachThe grounds were very pretty and kept clean. The beach was small, with nice sand and nice clear water. If you want to sun tan do not go to the beach there wre too many trees and most of the beach is shadded. Lot of charis no matter what time of day you goThe pools The pools were fine small but comfortable. Lots of chairs.The shows and BarWe didnt get to any of the shows as were were travelling with a 3 yr old and a 1 year old. But everyone one enjoyed the shows and the bar. The staffThey were frendly but almost none of them spoke English. When our room needed repair someone came within the hour, when we asked for another room they were helpful.
