{"text":"So so We are a family of 4 (2 girls 7  9). We were booked there for a wedding (everyone from outside SF stayed there) but I wished I was in another hotel. It's expensive for what it is. The rooms are so so. The walls were covered with ugly grand dad type pictures with cheap cheap gold frames that didn't match one another... We had to call the from desk as the fridge key! (yes fridge key) wouldn't work. They said just pull the door from under. So why need a key? Someone in the party had the handicapped room, with the funny shower and seat. They were not pleased. We asked for a wake up call that never beeped (same for my in-laws). The printer (just 2 PC) in the so called business center was broken. their best feature were a collection of antique typewriters and bakelite phones. Room furniture looked like itt came from garage sales, drawers didn't slide smoothly, there were only 5 coat hangers. I could hear people flushing and all the stuff going down the pipe. The guest next door kept his alarm clock beeping for 2+ hours from 5.30am, 3 days in a row! I complained the first time, the second time and the third time at check out. They did NOTHING but slipping a note under the door! If I was management, I would have relocate the noisy guest or chucked him out. Hhey they were gracious to give us 40% off for the 3 days it happened. the TV was just an old crt and the menu was barely readable. when I asked the desk how to watch the news,they said it's an old system and they were going to replace it. But! The paid movies, a whopping $9.95 were very easy to access... and there wasn't any child safety (for porn). It was our first time staying in an hotel in SF, and when we realized tons of other hotels were 1mn away, it made us grinched. ","annotations":[]}
