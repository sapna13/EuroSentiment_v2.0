{"text":"Amazing experience I booked a double room at the Monterey Ginza because it was included in a vacation deal, without really knowing what I was going to find. Me and my husband enjoyed an amazing time there from the moment we arrived. The service was great, with a very polite and helpful staff, although a little Japanese knowledge is useful since their English-speaking skills are not that great. They can say good morning and enjoy your stay, but when I asked them to recharge my MP3 at their computer's USB, they were kind of lost, just like the time when I tried to ask them to call me a cab: I ended up doing that in Japanese. As far as location is concerned, it just couldn't be better. You are minutes away from the main hubs in the terrible hell of the Tokyo subway, so it's really easy to travel with as less connections as possible, and the streets around the place are crowded not only with shops but with great cozy, Japanese, low-priced restaurants, as well as the best of all: two convenience stores opened 24 hours a day right in front of the hotel doors, so you can buy a banana, a face mask or a bottle of water whenever you need to.We had a double room and it was fully equipped with anything from a big kettle to a proper hairdryer, and a flat-screen TV, although the closet was kind of small for our 10-days stay. The bed was great, and the bathroom had anything you could ask for, from hair clips to a warm WC seat!! We didn't have breakfast or any meal included so I can't provide an opinion on that, but my guess is the restaurant was good from what I heard from other guests.There are internet facilities free of charge in the reception area, which was great for us since our cell phones didn't work while we were there.We spent a night away at the Hakone National Park and we couldn't wait to go back to the Monterey Ginza, we ended up calling it home, because that is exactly what it felt like.All in all, it was a great experience and very affordable, I would truly recommend it to anyone.Virginia ","annotations":[]}
