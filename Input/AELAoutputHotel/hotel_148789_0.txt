{"text":"Great little hotel! We stayed at the Lazy Parrot Dec. 19-21, 2008.  Front Desk - The desk clerk was very accomdating and helpful. In fact, she even loaned us beach chairs for the beach. She was eager to give us directions and answer our questions. She is an asset to the Lazy Parrot!Room -We had one of the basic rooms located in the front of the hotel. The room was clean but is nothing fancy. It had a small porch area (no view or anything) and a refrig and microwave. It was fine for our needs. We only slept in the room. We did not have hot water one evening. However, there is a hanyman on site who immediately rectified the problem.Breakfast -The hotel offers a free breakfast in the area right off the pool. We got fresh coffee every morning instead of having to go out looking for it. It was a great perk!! Also, the breakfast area is staffed so the coffee is always fresh and area is clean.Pool -The pool is small and was very, very cold. The wirhlpool is not heated. We did not use either because they were so cold. However, the area surrounding the pool is very nice. Bar -We got drinks two different nights from the pool bar. Both nights, the bartenders were slow and not friendly. The first night (Dec. 19) we attempted to ask the bartender some questions about the Rincon (I think his name was Rex or Red) and he had no interest in speaking to us. We had just arrived that day and had a number of questions about where to snorkel and what beaches to go to. The last night we were there, Dec. 21, there were a number of people at the bar. It appeared to us that they were employees of the Lazy Parrot and their friends. All were getting free drinks (or at least it appeared that way) and here we were paying full price for ours (which were not cheap). Also, there was a small infant and a small child sleeping on lawn chairs in front of the bar and the parents (who looked like employees or friends of empolyees )were drinking at the bar.Overall -The Lazy Parrot is a nice little hotel. It is in a good location and is clean.
