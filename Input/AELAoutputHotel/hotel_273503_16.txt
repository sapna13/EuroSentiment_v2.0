{"text":"Budget hotel, try your luck! I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with my husband. Advantages: Cheap  mostly clean (although some mould on the bathroom floor in the corner). Good size rooms. Well located opposite the main train station in frankfurt, in between the river and the main shopping  business areas.Disadvantages: very basic, no minibar as advertised and if you run into any problems you probably won't get good service. On the second day of our trip the toilet stopped flushing (Saturday evening) and after the manager came up to see it he said we would have to stay in the same room for the second night because they were fully booked. Also they made no effort to move us to another hotel and pay the difference. Believe it or not he suggested that we use the toilet as it was and used the shower water to 'push' our 'stuff' down the toilet... The room I stayed in (412) was dated and a lot of things didn't work (the shower didn't work unless I continously pressed the button - a bit difficult to co-ordinate). Saturday night was very noisy- couldn't sleep from 1-4am because of the street noise even though we were on the back of the hotel. Breakfast was very basic - white toast, sausages, cold meats, cereals and spreads. I paid about √ä√£¬¢45 per night including breakfast which would have been ok if the second night was not ruined by the toilet issue.Go there expecting good value for money only if nothng goes wrong.
