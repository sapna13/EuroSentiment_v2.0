{"text":"Nice Resort. Kids club was disappointing. We are a family of four including two boys aged 7 and 3. We had a very nice time at this resort last week.To quickly reiterate the plus points - Resort is huge, beautiful and well maintained. Rooms are large. Powerful air conditioning. Very nice beach. Very nice pools. Four buses\/shuttles are constantly running and are a huge plus given the distance from the beach to the lobby. Very friendly and helpful staff. The buffet had a large selection and was generally good. But, after reading all the raves here, I was a little disappointed. Just remember - quality is difficult with about 1000 guests per meal ! The fish dishes were very good. My wife is vegetarian and she had limited choice. Even dishes which could be vegetarian (soups, rice dishes, etc.) usually had meat broth\/sauce\/pieces in them. The cooks also did not seem to have an appreciation for cooking with separate utensils on the grill. Luckily my wife is not picky, but some of the vegetarians may want to consider this carefully. The restaurants were good. The decor was nice. Service was good. But, the food choice was limited. The japanese food was what is called Hibachi style (atleast here in the US) - and was mediocre.One thing that disappointed us was the kids club. We reached it at 10am (starts at 9am) and there were just two kids there playing video games. The staff just sat around looking bored. The pools were well designed for kids but none of them had a pool slide. My kids had a good time in the pools and on the beach since they play with each other, but parents hoping to involve them in group activities may want to consider other resorts. One exception - little kids enjoyed disco at 8:30pm.During our stay, the crowd was mainly canadian (about 50%) with spanish\/french\/ british making up most of the rest. Very few americans.You can get by with english. Most of the staff speak atleast 3 languages. But, sometimes they baffle you. One server at the restaurant could not understand water ! We learned a few common spanish phrases and always eventually did manage to communicate (exaggerated gestures help!) but when you are having a perfect afternoon, a difficult session can be irritating. Just consider this before you choose a 5 star DR resort.Overall, we had a wonderful time. Usually, when we visit a new country, we try to get some local history and culture. This time, we never left the resort for the week (i am not counting the beach walk and snorkel trip) and completely insulated ourselves. We enjoyed it and wished that we could have stayed a few more days.
