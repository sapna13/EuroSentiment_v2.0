{"text":"Great Time in Boston My boyfriend and I just returned from our weekend stay (Dec. 28th - 30th) in Boston and had a great time!Hotel InfoThe hotel staff was great and we had a room on the 6th floor in the corner that was nice and spacious. It also had a fridge and free internet access which was perfect for us. Very convenient location, which was close to T train station and restaurants (some were expensive). We also like to go dancing so we suggest checking out Saints right down the block from the hotel. Additionally, with the fridge we went to grocery store (Shaws)across the street to get juice and snacks.The breakfast is a bit expensive ranging from $10 to $15 so we preferred to eat cereal in our room (hoping to save some money) or get something in the area.The workout room (not a gym) is a bit small but my boyfriend was able to get a workout. It just can't hold more than 2 or 3 people.Where to eat?We love to eat and had a lovely lunch at Osushi (some of the BEST sushi I have ever had). I would suggest going to Chinatown (you can also get cheaper souveniers at a Washington St store on the way to Chinatown) or Chilli Duck for malaysian or Thai food. Also you can get good seafood near Quincy Market while visiting the freedom trail.All in all, I found Boston very similar to New York and look forward to visiting again.
