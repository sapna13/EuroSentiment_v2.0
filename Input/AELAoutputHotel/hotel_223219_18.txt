{"text":"Great hotel in a not so great area. Got this hotel on Priceline for $109 a night, which seemed like a fair price for a 3* in Downtown Seattle. The hotel definitely has its pros and cons. PROS: Pretty elegant lobby (as far as Holiday Inns go), incredibly polite and helpful front desk staff, clean and modern rooms, microwave and refrigerator in room, free internet in room, excellent shower pressure, restaurant on site (which I didn't try, but it looked very nice), cheap parking.CON: There is only one con, and it's only a con if you do not have a car with you during your trip. Sadly, the location of the hotel is somewhat inconvenient to downtown Seattle. It is in very close proximity to the space needle, but there is a busy highway next to the hotel, so you have to walk completely out of the way to get to a crosswalk. Overall, it is about a 10 minute walk to the space needle, which isn't too bad, but the walk to the rest of the downtown attractions requires more time and energy. For example, to walk to Pike Place Market is between 25 and 30 minutes. It helps that there is a monorail at the space needle that can take you downtown for $2 each way, but unfortunately it stops running at 11PM, so for late nights walking is your only option. However, the whole time I was there, I never felt unsafe walking around even at night, so the walking can be good if you have the energy.Overall, obviously it would have been nice to stay a hotel closer to downtown attractions, such as the Sheraton, but this hotel was also much cheaper and still had very high quality rooms and service, so I would recommend it for travelers with a car, or enough endurance for the walking.
