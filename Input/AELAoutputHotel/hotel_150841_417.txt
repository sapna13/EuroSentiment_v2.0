{"text":"2nd Time at Bavaro, Great as Before Just got back from the Iberostar Bavaro, this being our second time at the resort. Went with my wife and sixteen and ten year old daughters. Everybody a great time.Rooms: we requested and received two recently renovated right next to each other near the pool and our room couldn't have been better. The revonated rooms have a new bathroom, probably new furniture, new lighting, coffee maker, and iron. No mildew smell whatsoever. Short walk to the pool and beach. The TV had CNN, WGN, ESPN, ESPN 2, TNT, TBS, Cartoon Network, Disney, and Showtime. No shortage of stations. Only drawback is lack of storage space in the drawers.Pool\/Beach: Both outstanding. Never felt crowded at either place, and rarely had trobule finding a chair. Food: Very good. Always lots of food around with high quality. On New Years for dinner they had giant lobster tails, both hot and cold, shrimp, pig, etc. Everything's a high quality, and the flavor and spices are very good. Ate at the steakhouse, Japanese, Cajun, and Seafood and all were OK. Again, I can get a better steak or sushi in Chicago, but the food here was above average and defilintely was satifiying.Grounds: absolutely gorgeous. They are always spotless with perfect landscaping. With everything lit up at night, its a quite a sight to see.Entertainment: While not Broadway calliber, the shows are fun and the staff tries hard. Best shows are those with audience particiaiton where they make the contestants look like fools.Workers: best part of the trip are the people who work at the resort. They are always happy, and can't do enough for you during your stay.Only negative is the workout equipment in the gym. It definitely needs to be repleced. Had the same compliant last year, but it looks like they didn't do anything about it. All in all, a great place and would return.
