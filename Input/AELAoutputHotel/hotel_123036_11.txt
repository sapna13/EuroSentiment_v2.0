{"text":"Nice Hampton with wonderful beds! During our Pac NW road trip, we were only able stay 1 night at this property but will be sure to return on another occasion. At the end of our vacation, our stay in Seattle was to include a visit to the Space Needle, 4th of July Fireworks, the Ballard Locks and possibly Pike Place. Since we are Hilton Honors members and always enjoy our Hampton stays for the comfort and hot breakfasts, it was our first choice. We could have stayed DT but the Seattle Center was only a short walk from the hotel and given our short time here it was the best option.The front desk was helpful in providing directions to the fireworks display at Lake Union (within walking distance) and recommending a nearby restaurant (McMinneman's) where we had a nice meal beforehand. Our room had the most comfortable beds that are the hotels signature selling point. Our daughter wanted to stay another night just to be able to sleep in the bed again! Our only disappointment was not with the hotel, but with the Space Needle b\/c they stopped selling tickets at 8 pm the evening of the 4th for a private event. This was pretty much our only opportunity to see the view with clear skies as we were leaving early the next day. We eventually went up in the am only to see a cloudy view. This inconvenience also cut into our morning plans to visit Pike Place so had to skip that and hit the road to go home. We will definitely return to the Hampton Inn for the convenience of the location; hospitality of staff and most importantly a great night's rest.
