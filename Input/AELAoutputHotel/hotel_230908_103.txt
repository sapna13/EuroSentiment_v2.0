{"text":"Not as bad as other reviewers made out Having read the other reviews on this website, I felt wary about being booked into the Eden hotel. I was expecting a filthy, noisy place with rude and arrogant staff. It may be the fact that my stay in Amsterdam was a competition win, and therefore I did not pay a penny for it, but I really did not find the Eden hotel that bad.Admittedly, we had to wait several times to be served at the check in desk as there were only ever 2 staff on, but they were friendly and always apologised for the delays. The concierge was also very helpful.The location of the hotel is fantastic - just around the corner from Rembrandtsplein, and a short walk to everywhere else. If walking is not your thing, the bus and tram stops are abundant and everything is easily accessible.Noise at the hotel was simply not an issue - this was probably because our room was on the inside of the building rather than overlooking the street. This meant our view from the window was of a brick wall - but I didn't go to Amsterdam to stare out of my window!The room could have been bigger, and the bathroom was just tiny! It meant a serious case of manoevuring around the toilet to get into the shower, but it was clean. The windows in the room would not open, which I found very odd, but the air conditioning unit worked so I don't suppose it mattered much. I had to request the tea and coffee making facilities, and the concierge brought me a tray with a kettle and plastic cups on, and they were a little stingy with the amount of coffee  tea provided. However they did produce more on request.Breakfast was plentiful - a large variety of breads, cheeses, meats, eggs, bacon, jams, cereals, fruit and yoghurt, as well as fruit juices, tea and coffee. The bar area, 'Garden of Eden' was also quite nice, overlooking the river, and the barman friendly.Overall, the hotel is in a good location, but is of average standard. If you are looking for somewhere more luxurious to relax in then Eden is not for you, but if it is simply somewhere to sleep and eat breakfast then go ahead as the location is brilliant.
