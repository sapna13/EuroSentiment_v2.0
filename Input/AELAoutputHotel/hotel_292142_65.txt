{"text":"Fabulous Affinia Dumont stay We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 6 nights and had a really great stay. On arrival at around 1.30pm, the receptionist said that they had a room on the 4th floor but that if we were willing to wait an hour or so, they would have rooms higher up in the hotel. We weren't sure what the benefit of this was, but she explained that it might be a little quieter away from the street noise. This was great, we went off to lunch and came back to a room on 19th floor. Our studio room was large (particularly for Manhattan - we've stayed at 70 Park Avenue before - a wonderful hotel, but tiny rooms), with an enormous bed, a desk and a fully equipped kitchen. Not that we were intending to do any cooking - but ideal for buying and storing your own beers\/wine in the fridge and making hot drinks in the morning (and for bringing back late night pizza after a Broadway show!). The room was impeccably cleaned each day. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable and went out of their way to make sure guests had a good time. There's a full range of gym and spa facilities which we didn't get a chance to make use of as we were out exploring NY and getting our exercise by walking, walking, walking........ The hotel is perfectly place in Midtown, making it easy to get around on foot to most places. We would definitely recommend this hotel and would go back and stay there.
