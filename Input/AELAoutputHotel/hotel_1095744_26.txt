{"text":"Wedding at Bali Mandira We held our wedding on the 19 of August in Bali Mandira. The location is superb, right by the beach. The weather was wonderful. All the staff were very helpfull and warm. Half of our family stayed in the superior room and we stayed in the suite room. We like how the rooms are laid out in this hotel because its less intimidating than other big hotels. The superiom room was standard, the bed was comfortable and i put A for the cleanlines. All the facilities in the room were working so we had no problem with that. The suite room was lovely. It had a huge bed, spacious living room, dining table and also spacious bathroom. It had a jacuzzi BUT, it has no warm water.. what a shame. It also located in the open air so there were many leaves from the tree, a little bit uncared for. Although we met one staff who clean our room and as soon as he knew we wanted to use the jacuzzi he said, he will clean it and he did. The pizza in the parasol restaurant was lovely. The food at our reception was yummy. Everyone loved it. The flower arrangement was beautiful, all fresh, no complaint at all. everything was perfect, also the weather. We also had a great photographer. If any of u want to look at the photos, go to www.ourlifesadventure.com not many photos there but we gonna put more in the near future.CheersPrast ","annotations":[{"endOffset":952,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":947}]}
