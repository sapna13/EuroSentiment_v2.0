{"text":"Hawaiian Hospitality We stayed at the Hyatt from September 23-27. We had booked a package through Pleasant Holidays and had ocean view accomodations on the 24th floor Diamond Level. This floor is available to book only through Pleasant Holidays and has restricted elevator access. If you have any security concerns, this would be a big plus.Our room overlooked Waikiki Beach on the Diamond Head side. The high level of the floor combined with facing the less busy side of Waikiki meant that we heard almost no street traffic - only the sound of the ocean and the happy noise people make playing on the beach. The lanai was large enough for two comfortable chairs and a small table. Our lanai received morning sun, so it was very pleasant to sit in the afternoon and evening watching the surfers and swimmers and enjoying the view of the ocean.The Diamond Level had been recently refurbished and the room was beautifully decorated in subdued Hawaiiana. The beds were comfortable and the linens were crisp yet soft. The bathroom area is quite small, but they have done their best to update the fixtures and counters. There is a single sink set in a granite countertop. The furnished toiletries were very nice.We were impressed throughout our stay with the fine level of service. The valets were quick in getting our car, the front desk personnel were helpful and welcoming at check-in, the housekeeping staff greeted us with a smile and an aloha when we saw them. Our package included a daily buffet breakfast and the restaurant staff greeted us by name and welcomed us every morning.Given the comfortable accomodations, great service and superb location we will definitely be back to the Hyatt soon.
