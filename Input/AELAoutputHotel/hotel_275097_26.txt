{"text":"Nice Hotel, Good Location After reading some of the reviews, I was a bit aprehensive and thought I maybe should have booked another hotel, but we had a great stay! We arrived at about 11:45am so expected to be asked to check in later, but no, the rooms were ready for us and reception was very helpful ensuring that our party was roomed close to each other. Our room was more spacious than the others as we had an accessable room, but all were clean with a lovely bathroom and a wide selection of 'bit and pieces' including toothbrush\/paste and razors, which are useful with todays security restrictions, and these were replaced daily. The linen was crisp and clean and the rooms were well tended - they were also very warm - too warm for my husband but great for me!The breakfast offered a huge choice of continental items plus hot buffet and if ordered at the time of booking you get a 50% discount which makes in extremely reasonable for what is on offer - including cava\/bucks fizz if you wish it - I didnt but kept thinking about it! The pool area is small, and because of the marble\/wood mix can get slippy at times, but that where the complimentry slippers are useful. The pool itself - well, yes it is small, but is beautifully lit with changing lights for a relaxing feel. There is a seperate room with jaccuzzi in - big enough for 4 comfortably, 6 makes it 'intimate'. We were lucky that on our first visit both pool and jaccuzzi were empty, which meant our group had exclusive use, on our second visit only a couple and there baby were swimming so we jaccuzzied then swapped, as did they. There is also a sauna and a small gym. So plenty to occupy if it is busy.The location of the hotel is good, being near Gracia area and placa Catalunya and also the bus stops. The hotel is also good for business users with not only free wi-fi throughout but it has 2 computers on the 1st floor with free internet access too.All in all an excellent stay and when we return to Barcelona (hopefully in the Summer) we will return to this hotel.
