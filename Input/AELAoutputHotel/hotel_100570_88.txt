{"text":"stay in the north tower for conferences I stayed at the Westin Seattle for a conference, and had a very good experience generally. I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews, but it was a lot nicer than I expected. The room was pretty clean, if a bit worn. There was what appeared to be an old oily stain near the chairs, but it seemed like it had definitely been vacuumed, etc. and they couldn't get it out, and everything else about the room was very clean. I liked the two shower heads in the shower, and the bed was comfy. I used the workout room every day, and it had good equipment but was very busy. If you don't have meetings, wait until after rush hour. :) The meeting rooms had a strange layout because of the round design, but were adequate. The food was better than expected. The front desk staff was fine, nothing special really. The meeting rooms we used were all in the north tower, so I felt bad for those staying in the south tower as it was not as simple to dash up to the room between sessions. The lobby was a nice gathering place. Concierges were nonexistent in the evenings, but books were available. It was a very convenient location. Take the airport buses since they are a lot cheaper and the cabbie wasn't much faster and had run the wrong card (how he had it I am not sure) so we had to re-do it, and he tried to overcharge me for the ride (almost as if the gratuity was included).
