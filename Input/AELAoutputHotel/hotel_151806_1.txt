{"text":"Affordable Safe  Isla Verde - Booking this Hotel was very convenient and affordable on the Howard Johnson Hotel- Carolina website or call [--], (car rental, ext. 2017). (There are promotions going on over the summer so check it out.) The Hotel staff were all very, very helpful at meeting our every need. Although there are hotels across the street, we still have views of the ocean and from the 10th floor restaurant Fontana di Roma you have a beautiful view of the turquoise waters and the city. Do not miss this Italian Bistro with excellent breakfast and dinner. The owner Carlo Picchetti pulls out all the stops to ensure that you ( your loved ones) have a wonderful dining experience. My daughter celebrated her birthday while on vacation and Fontana di Roma provided us succulent meals (I had the osso bucco) on lovely china and the waiters were very attentive. After the meal a chocolate mousse cake with strawberries was brought out and the waiters sang Happy Birthday (opera style). This experience will remain a treasure for us all. The Hotel is right across the street from a walkway to Isla Verde Beach (just 5 minutes to San Juan). Nicolas at the AAA Allied Car Rental Service in the Hotel was very fast, easy and convenient. Overall our trip has been a wonderful one to remember. The maps provided helped us travel all over the island (gas is just $1.01USD) while coming back to our Home away from home. I highly recommend this hotel. -RLeite  family ","annotations":[{"endOffset":902,"mention":"chocolate mousse","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mousse"],"startOffset":886},{"endOffset":907,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":903}]}
