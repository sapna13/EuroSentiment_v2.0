{"text":"Great Hotel, Horrid Room Service The Lenox is a gorgeous hotel in the perfect location. Boylston Street in Boston is the heart of the city. My wonderful, romantic, precious boyfriend booked this hotel for a romantic New Years\/30th birthday surprise for me. We attended a wonderfully festive and delicious 7 course dinner gala at the Top of The Hub for NYE, and spent two days enjoying the Lenox's amenities; we also took in a Blue Man Group show on NYD. We came across a few problems, however during our stay. First, beware of booking a Junior Suite: They boast having wood burning fireplaces, yet very few of them actually do. It was my 30th birthday, New Years Eve, (they were well aware of both!) and we booked several months in advance, yet we could not be accomodated with a fireplaced room. Strike one.The room was unneccesarily gigantic, therefore not allowing for proper climate control. The massive walk-in closet and bathroom were sub-arctic when the room itself was a smoldering 70*. Strike two.We ordered room service for breakfast two days in a row, bacon eggs toast and coffee for 2 people: $184 later, and one hour after eating (my fault) cold, runny eggs, I became very ill. I have been sick, with a so far undertermined foodborne illness (so far called a GI bug until my test results come back), still 6 days later. I contacted the hotel manager who referred me to the person in charge of the food and beverage department who never called me back. Stike three.The bathroom was clean and the sheets were clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was well-appointed. Thr free WiFi access and bottled water were pluses. The list of freebies for guests was impressive including bath salts and cufflinks to borrow in case their guests have forgotten theirs.The only reason I would not recommend this hotel is because of their ridiculously overpriced toxic food. I am not sure who they have working down in the kitchen, but they need to be fired immediately; I understand that food is a catch-22 at most hotels and restaurants, but this is their business! The hotel itself is absolutely gorgeous, clean and well worth the double-priced room rate in comparison to other beautiful hotels in the area, if simply for the gorgeous reception area including a magnificent fireplace and guilded crown mouldings. The beds are comfy and the tv is a pretty nice flat screen model. The valets and bell-people were fantastic.I truly enjoyed my stay, minus the intestinal infection I got from the room service, and the ruined birthday plans because I've been chained to the commode for going on 6 days... By all means, stay at the Lenox; JUST DON'T ORDER ROOM SERVICE!!!
