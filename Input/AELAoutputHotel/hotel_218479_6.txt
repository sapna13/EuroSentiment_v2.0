{"text":"Had a Great Time but the Small Things Bugged Me I was in Barcelo Bavaro Caribe Beach for 7 days (8\/12\/08 - 8\/18\/08). Let me start by saying that I had a fabulous time at Punta Cana and I loved the Barcelo Resort. The Resort itself is so huge and there is a lot to do that you'll be busy the whole time.Check-in for me was great and quick. While I was waiting to check in a staff member came by with Welcome drinks. Once we were checked in, a guy came by to take our bags to the room. I was happy with the state and size of the room. Every room has a balcony with a garden view and it was great. The hotel itself was so nice and loved the look of it. The beach was so beautiful and the water was just great. No waves and the water was warm the whole time. I took some great pictures but I will provided the pictures at a later time. I will tell you this much, please be ready for the sun to burn you if you don't protect your skin with sunblock.The pool in Bavaro Caribe Beach was the best out of all the pools in the resort. There is a section which goes down to 8ft deep, great to do cannon balls. LOLNow for the real dirty, I loved my stay but it could have been better. The one thing I kept saying was, the hotel would be great if the rooms were updated and the staff at the buffet exactly did some customer service. The real age of the room could be told in the bath b\/c items that were sliver was turning colors. The bath towels should have been white and they were off white. The buffet in the hotel which was Buffet Orquidea, I had to ask for water the whole time. Once I was done with my first plate of food, and got another plate, I had to request for the first plate to be taken away. I could say tha the service at this buffet sucked. I wansn't too happy about that. Another concern I had was on the weekend, locals would come to the hotel and stay for the weekend. The locals were so loud, and would leave cups in the pool or on the edge of the pool all over. The staff members didn't move fast enough to remove the cups they left. Also, the resort is All Inclusive but if you want to eat or drink in the Bavaro Palace, you couldn't b\/c it wasn't part of the package. In order to enjoy the Barcelo All Inclusive package, you would have to stay at the Barcelo Palace b\/c then you can eat at the French Rest. Chez Palace, DR Rest. Rincon Dominicano, Sea Food Rest. Rest. La Brisa, and the Rest. that has food from Spain, La Fuenta. If you wanted to eat there you had to have the Barcelo Palace All Inclusive, otherwise you would have to pay $20 or $30 dollars to eat at the Rest.I did enjoy eating at Steak House in Bavaro Beack, Italiano Los Pinos in Caribe Beach, the Buffet Mirador at the Bavaro Casino which shares a kitchen with La Fuenta (hint, hint) The service in these places were great. We were unable to eat at the Rest. Mexico Lindo b\/c the hotel is being re-done. The Bavaro Beach should be done by December of 2008 and would be the hotel to stay at b\/c it will be updated and modern. I saw pictures of it and thinking of return Feb. 2008 and staying at Bavaro Beach.Overall, I loved my stay at the hotel and resort but the small things were bugging me. Would I return, yes but I would stay at Bavaro Beach. I say go, enjoy, have fun and to my ladies  gays, enjoy the hot men in speedo. (OMG!!! hot bodies in speedo, got to love that view.
