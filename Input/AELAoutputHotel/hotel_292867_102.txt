{"text":"Great Value at a Great Resort I just returned from the Caribe Club Princess, our 9th stay in Punta Cana. We have stayed high end (Riu Palace Punta Cana, Secrets) middle (Iberostar Punta Cana and Hacienda Dominicus, Sunscape the Beach and the Grand, Riu Bambu, Melia Caribe)...I had a group of 23 with me. This was the only 4 Apple in the Dominican we have visited. Having sold it many time and having had happy clients I was not worried., even with a few bad reviews.All I can say is I had 23 happy clients with me even with Tropical Storm Noel at our resort the first few days. This resort had quite possible the nicest and most accomdating employees I have ever dealt this!! The staff is wonderful and people make the place! A nice resort with unhappy and unhelpful staff does not cut it with me!Rooms were fine, clean and nice, and very spacious.Service-Beyond all expectationsFood-good everywhere we went, buffet and ala carte.Beach-SUPERB!!Entertainment-great at the beach and pool, the 2 evening shows I went to were okay, but that is not my thing to begin with...Several of my repeat clients could not figure out why the resort was not rated higher-and quite frankly neither could I. My new clients who had never done all inclusive loved it also. One friend who NEVER returns to the same resort, said she thinks with this one she might break her rule, she would like to return!There just was simply nothing to complain about...as a TA I am always looking for things that need improvement, and really they are doing it right at this resort. Some fans in the lobby, cause it gets warm would be nice, and better lighting when you go to the theater...would be all the fault I could find!This resort offers fantastic value for the money ","annotations":[{"endOffset":66,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":62},{"endOffset":140,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":134},{"endOffset":733,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":729}]}
