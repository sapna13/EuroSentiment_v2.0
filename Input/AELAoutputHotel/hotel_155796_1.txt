{"text":"OK place, but didn't clean my room the first day The hotel is in a good location because it is close to the bioluminescent bay and close to good beaches. It was kind of hard to find because their address did not come up on the GPS, and they did not have directions on their website.We stayed in room 214. It was fine, although the first day we noticed ants on the floor. We stayed three nights. On the first day we were gone all day and came back and our room had not been cleaned. Just after 4pm when we arrived back, a housekeeper came by and asked if we wanted the room cleaned. we had been hiking all day and just wanted to nap, so I sent her away, but it was pretty annoying that the room was not cleaned before 4pm when we returned. The room was cleaned on the 2nd day.They gym is great!We tried to get towels to use to pool but they were out, so we had to go spend $30 at Walgreens on beach towels. Neither the pool nor the front desk had clean towels for us to use. The Mexican restaurant on site was ok. The guidebooks say it's great and that locals come from nearby to eat there, but it was kind of bland and definitely not authentic Mexican. The margaritas were very sugary. We also attempted to try the seafood restaurant on site. We were seated around 8pm and wait for about 20 minutes for someone to take our order. In addition, our order was taken AFTER a couple that arrived AFTER us. We both wanted the sancocho, but they were out of that. My husband wanted one of their pork entrees, but they were also out of that. At that point we decided to leave. We did drive two minutes down the road to Rosa's Seafood, which was AWESOME. We had a great waitress and the food was great and we were taken care of right away. If you stay at Fajardo Inn, you should definitely venture our and go to Rosa's, and NOT eat at the onsite restaurants. There is also a chain restaurant in Fajardo called Pollo Tropical which is very good. Fajardo also has lots of grocery stores which we found to be helpful for cutting costs. We bought breakfast food and ate in our rooms instead of eating out and bought wine\/alcohol there to further cut costs. The beach at Luquillo is a must. We spent the day and rented two lounge chairs and an umbrella for $20. There are seafood kiosks and drinks nearby and they are inexpensive. The parking was $3 and a bracelet to use the bathroom all day was $1 per person. We had an awesome day there.
