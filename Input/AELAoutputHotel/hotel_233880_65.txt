{"text":"Great hotel, great location, great value I will simply reiterate what many of the other reviewers have said: this is a wonderful hotel, and doubly wonderful given the price and location. My wife and I were there for a week--I was at a conference--and we booked a 7 night special on Bookings.com for 99 Euros a night. Our upgraded room--part of the package, I think--was absolutely HUGE, on the seventh floor with large casement windows that opened onto the street. The room and furnishings were spotless and contemporary, as was the entire facility, the bathroom large and user friendly. Another couple we were traveling with booked the same deal and their room was just as nice, with a small balcony that opened onto the interior courtyard of the hotel. By far the biggest and nicest hotel room I have stayed in in Europe, where small and over-rated is the norm, in my experience. The hotel charges for in-room wifi but has a computer--with printer, no less, for free--in the lobby, and also has free wifi in the lobby so you can just bring your laptop or other device down there and check your mail. Location is outstanding, one block from Friedrichstrasse and close (2 blocks) to both Stadtmitte and Kochstrasse U Bahn stops. (If you're there for a week, buy the 7 day U Bahn pass for zones A and B for about 27 Euros--you'll get more than your money's worth.) Easy walk to both Potsdamer Platz and the Tiergarten. If you're a runner, a great loop is Postdamer Platz\/Tiergarten\/Brandenburg Gate\/Unter den Linden and back down to the hotel. Hotel service was excellent with the exception of the bar staff, which was average at best. (The hotel has a very nice wine garden, and seems to do lots of events there.) We did not do the 18 Euros per day breakfast, which seemed a little pricey, so I can't comment on that; there are several good coffee and pastry\/muffin places nearby--one two blocks north on Friedrichstrasse and one half a block north on Charlottenstrasse--and that's all we want for breakfast. All in all, a great hotel and wonderful stay--definitely the best I've experienced on any European trip, which includes many cities over the past 15 years.
