{"text":"The All-Inclusive Costa Del Sol Comes to Bali. The hotel itself is okay; I quite liked the layout of the main building - the bar, the restaurant and lobby gave the place a pretty good feel. However, once you get to your room you feel a little disappointed, its not done particularly well when you consider other hotels for a similar price in the area (The Novotel, two doors down absolutely destroys this place for a similar price) and ours smelt a bit. The pool is spacious and warm but you soon become aware of the feel of the place...If you like to lie around a pool for two solid weeks chatting to other Brits and Germans abroad who race out in the morning after breakfast to nab a lounger, fill up on the limited all-inclusive rubbish and swill the cheapest, nastiest beer known to man and venture out of the hotel only to the shop oppositein search of a three day old copy of The News of the World then get down there; but you may as well go to Torremelinos and save yourself a fortune. The place felt cheap and the service was pretty poor - I tried to get stuck into a game of volleyball but felt like I was intruding on a staff game as I was bossed about and pretty much laughed at as I got to grips with the game (of course it was an off day - i'm usually superb) but as I and my fellow German volleyball amateur left the session we couldn't help but sense their relief as we left all the staff going hell for leather at each other on the court.In all, the Costa Del Sol in Bali - get out the South to avoid such a feeling or if you just want to chill in quality surroundings book into the Novotel just two doors up - as I said, it makes this place look like a Costa Del Joke.
