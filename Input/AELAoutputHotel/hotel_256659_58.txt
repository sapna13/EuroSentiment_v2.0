{"text":"Best Hotel in Sydney!!!!!!! We stayed at this hotel and it left such a good image of the westin Brand that I have booked the Westin at Times Square.When we checked in at the hotel at 6 in the morning expecting to be told that we could not check in till 12 o'clock. We were told that are room was ready for us to check in.Because we came to Sydney in August the hotel was full and we were told that the only rooms they had left were smoking rooms, which we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ to keen on, but we took it as we were too tired to wait until people checked out that day. As we were in the lift thinking in are heads what the room would smell like. When we go to the smoking floor and the lift doors open we had the first surprise the hall didn't smell like smoke!! What a bonus!! Once we found are room and opened the door we couldn't believe that the room we were given could have been a smoking room!! The room was clean no ashtrays anywhere and the room didn't smell like a smoking room!! That was fantastic and the third surprise we got was when we opened the curtains! We had the best view of the hotel!! When were looking directly onto the clock face, which was fantastic at night as, it lit up at night. The room we had was massive 2-queen size double bed and a massive TV. The bathroom must been the best bit of the room as the bath has a large glass window so people could look in on you when your in the bath. Wrong!! There is a switch that you can press and a large screen comes down from the ceiling and covers the window so you can have a bath in peace. The hotel offers umbrellas in the room so you can take them out when it rains like it did the first day we were there.Shops and Restaurants are in easy walking distant from the hotel.I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody coming to Sydney, as this is the best hotel that Sydney has to offer.
