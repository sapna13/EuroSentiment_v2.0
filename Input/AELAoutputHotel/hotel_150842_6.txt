{"text":"Excellent The customs and immigration checks were dealt with quickly and efficiently. We cleared the airport without much delay. The trip from airport to the hotel was only about 40 mins and the check in was smooth and fairly quick.The resort was much bigger than I had expected but was none the worse for that.The rooms were very comfortable without being luxurious. The maid service was second to none and the room was left spotless everyday. The arrangement of the towels,although trivial I suppose, had to be seen to be believed. We left the maid $2 US a day tip, but others in the party didn't and got the same service.The restaurants were well staffed and the food on offer was great in quality and variety. It was presented on smallish dishes which were replaced regularly and so there was always fresh food available. The service was good and friendly.We ate in 3 of the specialist restaurants and they were all good.The bars were all well staffed and there was never any delay in getting served. The drinks weren't watered down and there were convenient bars on the beach and in the mainbuilding.The pools were extensive and kept spotless and although there were a lot of children about it wasn't too rowdy.The beach was fantastic. Clear seas, soft white sand and not a stone or rock to be seen. There were plenty of shades and loungers. It's quite simply the best beach I've been on. There were no hawkers or other pests and so it was easy to relax. There were a lot of topless women (and some should have known better!) which shouldn't be a problem but if it will offend don't go.Max and the boys at water sports were really helpful and the catamarangs were great fun. The night time entertainment was quite good fun, but you could take it or leave it.The place is a bit like United Nations, and there is a wide mix of nationalities there. Again that didn't detract from our enjoyment at all.We went on the Tropical Storm trip and I would thourougly recomend it.The only downside was that almost half the hotel was undergoing refurishment. The work went on un-noticed and didn't affect our stay but the resort was full enough. It wasn't too crowded when we were there, but I can imagine that it could be when all the rooms are occupied.I would go back tomorrow if it was going to be the same as the last trip, but I would hestitate if it was going to have 30% more guests.One note of warning regarding Punta Cana Airport. They were red hot on excess baggage. The UK end didn't mind the odd Kilo over but in Punta Cana they charge $20 US per kilo excess and no exceptions. While we were checking in two couples on adjacent desks were charged $80 and $100 respectively. Next time I go I'll take a couple of Kilos less than max to be on the safe side.
