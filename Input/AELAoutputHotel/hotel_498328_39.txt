{"text":"Quirky This was my fourth trip to Berlin in under 2 years. And my second stag weekend. This time, we decided to go for a cheap and functional hotel (and the fact that all the fancy ones were booked out for the Treaty of Rome anniversary celebrations).The first excellent thing about the place is the location, across the road from the S Bahn station. This gave us good access to all the sights. The hotel may claim to be at Postdamer Platz but in reality, it is one stop further south. This wasn't a problem as we were still fairly central and only a 15 minute cab ride back from Mitte in the late evening.Check-in was fast and efficient. The room were ready on our arrival at 1045, so we were able to move in straight away. The room rate doesn't include breakfast and we didn't try it so, I can't comment. The bar was fine and drinks were available into the small hours.We had a 3 person room with 2 occupants. The room was huge, with lots of storage space and basic facilities to prepare beverages (a sink  a fridge). One large double bed and once single. There is a separate WC and bathroom. All smart, clean and obviously pre-fab. This didn't matter as the hotel did maintain a quirky character to itself.Internet access was extra and at a ridiculous price but I'm getting used to this in most hotels.Would I go again? Possibly; there are a lot of hotels in Berlin and it isn't difficult to get something a lot more sophisticated for less than 50 Euros more. I would, however, recommend it to people who are on a strict budget. ","annotations":[]}
