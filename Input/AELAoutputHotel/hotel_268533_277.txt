{"text":"Lovely hotel with over the top decor I go to San Francisco twice a year and nearly always stay at Stanford Court. I found the Argonaut to be a lovely alternative. The service and staff was uniformly friendly and helpful. The public rooms were spacious and attractive. My room was quite long and narrow, but still of reasonable size and very very well appointed. I had an inside room facing the other side of the hotel so bad for view but great for quiet. I had a very low rate so I would not complain about receiving a less desireable room. And I'll pick quiet anytime! On the flip side, the walls seemed rather thin and one evening I could very clearly hear the t.v. in the adjoining room. Luckily, this happened only on one night. The nautical decor in the lobby was cute, but in the room, it was really rather jarring. There were wide stripes on the walls, with a border of stars all around, a very large mirror, maybe 8 feet in diameter designed to look like a porthole, etc. I personally found it unattractive, but as I said, the room was very well appointed and comfortable, and I really don't care much about their decorating. Wireless and wired internet access was free which is a nice plus. I didn't eat a real meal in the restaurant, but I did have breakfast in the hotel which was nice and the selection of wine by the glass at the bar was good too. I LOVE the fact that it is a few short steps to the Buena Vista! BV is a better choice for breakfast. On balance, it was a very nice hotel and I would consider it again - although I might still end up back at Stanford Court!
