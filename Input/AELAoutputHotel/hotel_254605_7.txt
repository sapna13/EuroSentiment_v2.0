{"text":"Great Stay at Hotel 41 Just got back from NYC and had a wonderful stay at Hotel 41. Check in was a breeze, was upgraded to a 'superior' room upon arrival. Lobby was very clean, lots of info at desk, can rent dvd's if you want. Very friendly.Yes, the rooms are small, but VERY clean, had everything we needed for the amount of time we actually spent in the room. We usually stay at the Hilton New York (sold out), so it was a change to be in a room so much smaller, but at the end of the day, it was fine. I would, however, be curious what a regular room was like... ours was superior and folks... it was small.I brought earplugs with me as I was a little concerned of street noise being steps from Times Square, but didn't need them. Even on Election night!! Window is double paned and has a great roller blind that blocks out the huge Red Lobster neon sign across the street. Only noise issue was heavy feet above us, but not complaining as it's an old hotel and to be expected.Continental breakie until 11am was simple but nice. Nothing wrong with a cup of coffee and a bagel to start your day off.As noted in other reviews, location is good. Central to everything.My only complaint is that we could smell smoke in the room - either coming through the vent in the bathroom or the aircon. We just opened the window for a few minutes to air the room out. It may have been minor, but neither of us smoke, so it was noticable for us.We didn't eat at the hotel at all, other than the breakfast, so can't comment much on the food.I would consider staying at this hotel again.
