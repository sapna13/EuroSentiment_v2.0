{"text":"late 60s design masterpiece with great service On my first trip to Japan, I wanted to stay somewhere with traditional character and style. Since I was on a business trip, I also needed the place to be organized and efficient. I was incredibly pleased to find that the Okura succeeded on both counts. The style of this hotel goes beyond anything I've ever seen, anywhere. Every single room and bar is an example of the best of mid-century modernism-- beautiful clean lines without being cold and sterile like newer luxury hotels. The Japanese element of the design is very strong, adding a traditional peacefulness to the modern lines. I ended up having a ball at this hotel just visiting all the different bars and feeling like a chic 1960s James Bond covert agent. If you are a fan of classic modern design, enjoy the company of unpretentious but distinguished older people (not too many hipsters at this hotel, though they'd love it if they knew about it), and have an appreciation for vintage, you'll love this hotel. As everyone else has said in the reviews, the service is excellent, the dining is good but expensive (probably not more so than other hotels in this range), and the location is convenient to metros and central Tokyo. The only thing I didn't like about the Okura was the gym\/spa-- I found the steam room\/sauna space awkward and unrelaxing and the temperatures all wrong. I visited a few other hotels while in Tokyo and they all seemed to be soulless and tacky compared to the Okura. The Grand Hyatt, for example, seemed so pretentious and new and boring that I couldn't wait to leave it to get back to the Okura's authentic charm. ","annotations":[]}
