{"text":"Wonderful trip! What a wonderful trip! We just got back on April 20th after a 6 day stay. I can't say enough good things about this resort. The grounds were so beautiful, the staff was so good to us and treated us like family. The Animacion Team was fun and entertaining. The beach was absolutely gorgeous! Crystal clear warm waters. The waves were fun. The sand is so soft under your feet and there is a nice breeze most of the time. It rained one day while we were there but not until in the afternoon. The food was good at every restaurant we ate at. I liked the Pescador the best and had lobster there. The best drink, I think was the Coco Loco, yummy! We had the VIP package, and was well worth it. We stayed in the 5000 block. Very nice room, good air conditioning and the bed was so comfortable. Fridge was stocked well and drinks were cold. My husband liked the beer. I drank the diet coke. If you like strong coffee you will like their brand. I kept watering mine down. You get used to it after a couple of days though. We didn't do any excursions, our choice, but had plenty to do and mostly we just wanted to relax on the beach. Be forewarned though that even if you like seashells and want to buy them from the locals, it is illegal and you may get arrested. I almost bought one before I read in the Punta Cana brochure that it is illegal. Glad I didn't. You won't see any shells on the beach but they have them for sale everywhere. I could go on and on about all the wonderful things at the Punta Cana Princess. If you have any questions please write and I will be happy to help.
