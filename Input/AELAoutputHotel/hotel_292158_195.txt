{"text":"Beyond words, Paradise and pleasures We have visted the D.R. several times, and have never been really disappointed. On that note, we were overwhelmed by this resort. The beach was just outstanding, clean, white, and lots ofroom with many lounges. Security was there, always. No naggingvendors. Beverage service was excellant. The pools were just asoutstanding. Clean, well maintained, and lots of lounges. The pool bars were all first class. We upgraded to a Royal Suite, and it is worth it. Every person we encountered from the resort was polite, gracious, and could not do enough for you. Language is a minor barrier, easily overcome by pointing and showing. It is verymuch appreciated, when you tip. That dollar bill goes a long way in service received, and future amenities. The food was above any other resort we have stayed at. The wait staff at these buffets can not do enough for you, plus remember gratuities big time. The resort grounds themselves were well manicured, clean and just plain beautiful. I've never taken so many pictures of a resort itself. The casino was a blast. I read in Trip Advisor, a suggestion to bring insulated cups for drinks. Absolutely do this.Your drink stays cold,and you get bigger drinks. The bartenders just love them, and remember you by your cups. This was by far the best, most relaxing, and enjoyable resort I have ever been to,bar none. The night before leaving, while enjoying a beverage of choice, we discussed how we didn't want to leave and began planning a return next year. This resort should be rated by the smiling faces, which equal diamonds. A definite 5 Diamond Resort.
