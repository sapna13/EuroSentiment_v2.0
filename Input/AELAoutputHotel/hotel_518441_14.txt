{"text":"a tale of good and bad Positives: gorgeous landscaped grounds in the midst of the paddy fields; beautiful villas; wonderful breakfasts (the home-made bread with home-made jam was delicious); extras such as free mini-bar, free laundry and transfers into town (15-minute drive); lovely spa; fantastic infinity poolNegatives: internet never worked and staff didn't understand why it wasn't acceptable that 50% of websites (including all online newspapers) were blocked by their server; extremely high prices in the restaurant (why should main courses be 2-3 times as expensive as very chic restaurants in Seminyak?); the butler who was a kind of concierge, and was very pushy in getting us to book excursions from which the hotel was clearly making money - this butler often made us very uncomfortable, and was not knowledgeable about Bali and gave us very poor advice which wasted our time and money.Ubud itself has a lot to offer, great shopping and sightseeing and restaurants, but does get very over-crowded and in the daytime is simply a massive traffic jam.All in all, the Chedi would be great if you truly need to get away from it all - staying in your villa, lounging by the pool, eating fine meals (at a huge mark-up but probably still cheaper than London or New York). But the atmosphere is soul-less. You almost never see anyone else (apart from your butler who constantly comes to your door - even entering once without knocking!), and bizarrely there often wasn't anyone at reception which is a bit of a shock when you return to the hotel and need to get your key.Very strange, and ultimately not very pleasant despite all its positives.
