{"text":"Very nice place, had to work to get the room \/ features we wanted After enduring a seemingly endless winter in New York and Connecticut, my friend and I booked a trip to Rincon Beach Hotel on the the hotel's Sterling Hotels website. We reserved a double queen ocean view room online for a 5-day stay. When we arrived to check in, they had put us in a tiny single-queen bedroom with a tiny balcony, with partial ocean view. We immediately asked for at least a king bed, instead of a single queen. They put us into a very small king room that had a badly chipped and rusted bathtub (it turns out many of the rooms in the hotel have damaged \/ rusted bathtubs) and a vanity sink drain that drained very slowly.The front desk clerks (there were two on duty) were very busy talking amongst themselves, and sometimes seemed oblivious to the presence of customers waiting at the front desk. We had been traveling for most of a day to get there, and there was no help from the hotel for us to get our bags to our 4th floor room. They pointed us to a baggage cart (self service?) so we took our own bags to the room. I thought the lack of a porter \/ bellhop was out of place in a hotel that charges over $230.00 per night.At breakfast the first morning, which we had in the hotel's restaurant outdoor patio (nicer place to eat, but the crows will absolute bandits and we had to dodge bird droppings). The breakfast buffet, which cost almost $15.00 per person (before the hotel's obligatory 15% automatic tip added to the bill, but which also does not go to the servers, but rather to the restaurant) was pricey. It was nice, and they had good homemade pastries (some days, depending on which chef was working). The pool was beautiful. However, we were reluctant to swim in its water because the water appeared murky.. perhaps not so clean. There were dozens of people in the pool, including many small children, and adult patrons of the swim-up bar.The beach was beautiful, and the deck chairs were plentiful, as were the complimentary beach towels. The sun and temperatures were great for relaxing and we enjoyed many nice walks on the huge sandy beach.We ended up moving to a newer room the second day we were there, to the double-queen we were promised when we first made our reservation. We had a rental car, so we drove to the Puntas section of Rincon and had several great meals at the local restaurants on the surfing beach side of Rincon. Two great little restaurants were the tapas bar at Casa Islena, and The Rum Shack and Smiling Joes restaurants at The Lazy Parrot Inn on highway 413. We would rate those restaurants right up there with any we've eaten at in our many travels.Some of the winding roads and beautiful views of the ocean made for exciting sight seeing opportunities. Rincon is a great place to go for a slower pace of life than the metro area of San Juan. Be ready for very narrow serpentine steep roads which the locals hog and always seem to blare their high beams.Have fun and bring your sunscreen...get out early as the rains and clouds came around 2ish and somedays never clear until the next morning.
