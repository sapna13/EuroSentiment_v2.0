{"text":"My Favourite Hotel in Japan This hotel is wonderful; Nothing is too much trouble, the food is superb, particularly in the Japanese restaurant, and the views are breathtaking. My favourite view is looking down at Shimbahi train station from the Japanese restaurant whilst having dinner. From 25 floors up it is like watching a model railway set up but in complete silence. Breakfast in the lounge area is also good and there is plenty of variety to choose from. I know that some folks have thought it expensive but it's less than √ä√£¬¢12 which is about par for the course. You can get a continental breakfast at the cafe on the 3rd floor if you like but I prefer to start the day with something substantial. The rooms are very good with just about everything you could need. I stayed here twice and my second room was smaller but still fine. The internet is free but usually not too difficult to get on. There is often very good entertainment in the evening. A good range of drinks and cocktails and a very swish French restaurant. Most of us aren't here to eat French food of course but the Japanese themselves seem to love it.The hotel is on the route of the airport bus and has a stop right outside.The only gripe I ever had was that altough Shimbashi station is easy to get to from the hotel, finding the hotel from the station always caused me trouble, even with a map. A bit of signage would be a great help I'm sure. ","annotations":[]}
