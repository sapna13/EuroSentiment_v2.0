{"text":"An amazing Holiday! Beautiful location. Luxury Hotel RoomsBavaro rooms are bigger with an excellent spa bath - Palace are fresh done but we prefered the space. Very very clean and comfortable.HotelBig but not overwhelming. Felt like a little town. Plenty to do - lots of space to be by yourself or in the thick of it. Beautiful gardensBeachAmazing - white sand, blue sea, blue sky! Can be busy and you have to get there early to get a good spot. (6am) However after lunch you can always get a space where you want.RestaurantsGood Buffets in all hotels. Excellent Al carte restaurants especially the mexican. You never want for food or drink. I'm not fussy with named stuff - its all local and strong. 24 hour sports bar if you want something to eat at any time. I liked the white wine and rose.PoolsLots of them, quieter than other hotels every one tends to go to the beach.SpaLovely excellent massages but can be expensive.TrainIts not that far to walk where you want to go but the heat and full tummies can mean the train comes in very handy.Watersports\/ Sports centreEverything you could wish for. I did the snorkling and the fish come right up to you wanting to be fed. Not as great variety as Egypt but worth doing if your thing. We went rifle shooting, archery, bowls, mini golf and chess. lots of fun - if you like to do sports with others lots was set up around the pools. we prefer keeping to ourselves.GolfExcellent courses but can be expensive.Evening EntertainmentLots of fun stuff went on but we kept to the bars and played cards.If you want to go somewhere really relaxing, beautiful location and like the lap of luxury where you don't want for much this is the place for you. Ignore the bad reviews they concerned me at first when booking. There are more luxurious hotels but you get what you pay for. I would certainly come back to this 5 star hotel.
