{"text":"OK for one night between flights After the excellent experience with another hotel of the same group, the night before in Bangkok, we knew we had to lower our expectations a bit, as this was Australia and not Thailand. One should never compare, anyway, but, secretly, one does nevertheless...Well, the first impression began at the airport, where we waited for 40 minutes in the (already pretty burning) sun, for the hotel shuttle bus to come. We guess, we just missed the one for our hotel, as we saw one bus after the other passing by, for the other 4 hotels, until at last, ours came, too. We considered ourselves lucky that we had brought an umbrella with us, which gave us some shade...and that it was not pouring with rain, because there is no shelter at all for bus stop number 6, which is the one for the 5 airport hotels.Next time we will probably take a taxi, as waiting 40 minutes for a 10 minutes ride, seems a bit exaggerated in our eyes, but all depends on the weather and your patience, of course.The reception staff at the hotel was quite pleasant, the bed- and bathroom clean and functional.We had dinner at the only restaurant, the other being a bar offering snacks. The air conditioning worked well, which means that we regretted not having put a pullover on. We had the choice of a 2 or 3 course menu for either 55 or 65 AUD per person and could chose between half a dozen dishes each time. The appearance of the dishes was elaborated and they were more attractive for the eyes than for the palate. Service was rather slow and we were happy to get out of the cold restaurant at the end. Our overall experience with this hotel is average, but the location near the airport was convenient for our needs: find a clean, not too expensive place, to sleep between two flights.
