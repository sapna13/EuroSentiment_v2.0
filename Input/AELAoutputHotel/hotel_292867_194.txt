{"text":"Horrible! (Terrible!) DO NOT GO THERE! I am a high traveler and not much of a complainer, but I think it is my responsibility to warn you and avoid you the problems of choosing such a poor, yet expensive resort.There were a total of 5 families traveling together (our first vacation together as group) so we had very high expectations and were looking forward to a relaxed 5 days. Little did we know what we were getting ourselves into.Here are things to expect:No towels! If you are lucky enough to have towels, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l probably not want to use them!No beach towels, even if you get there by 9:00 a.m.Foods at their √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªestaurants√à√\u2020\u2022?are less then poor, although when making reservations they always seem to be √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µacked√à√\u2020\u2022?but when you are lucky enough to insist in making the reservation, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be surprised if you are the only ones there.Resort employees are very outspoken of how unhappy they are working there, therefore their customer service is less than acceptable.People at √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øuest Services√à√\u2020\u2022?DON√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©? CARE WHAT YOU THINK!You will feel obligated to tip everyone, even if they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe done nothing for you, since they intimate you that they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l do something to your dinner and\/or service if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ.I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be surprised if you DON√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©? get food poisoning there (everyone in our party did and we are still trying to recover!)Here√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ an inside tip (if you haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√ò read any previous comments, make sure you read the following): BEWARE!!!!!!!The color of the wrist band determines the level of service you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l receive (told to us by multiple employees working there since we are bilingual Spanish\/English). If you are not European, DO NOT GO! They treat you like S@%^! specially if you are an American; you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l definitely get the short end of the stick.P.S. Too bad that even though the beach is gorgeous and PUNTA CANA is such a beautiful location, it is overshadowed by such a horrible resort!!!! ","annotations":[]}
