{"text":"You will love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will love this resort! The resort is really beautiful and gorgeous. The grounds are impeccable and really pretty. It is so clean and pristeen. The staff really goes above and beyond to make your stay wonderful. They always say hi and are so friendly even if they do not speak your language. A smile even goes a long way. We had VIP and we felt it was worth it as you get the extra perks. We stayed in room 5213 and it was great. Our room had a cathedral ceiling and we overlooked the pool and the beach. Our mini bar was stocked at all times. We walked down the beach and the PCP was truely the nicest resort around. The beach is just beautiful and there are plenty of chairs to go around and if you are VIP you get the really comfortable beds as well to use. We usually went to the sister hotel for dinners and entertainment and it was fun. Going there was a snap as it is a short walk if you want or the trams comes every 10 minutes or so that drives you there. The other resort is for families so it is more crowded and has kids everwhere. The PCP is so quiet and serene and you really feel like you have the whole resort to yourselves. We have never been to an all adult place before and it was really nice, you don't miss the kids at all and it is really nice. We would definitely recommend this place and would love to go back again someday. We took the all day excursion on the big truck and went to a sugarcane platation, a private house on the mountain and saw a typical family and we went to a private ranch on the beach and rode horseback on the beach, swam in the ocean, and in the private pools and then they served us all lunch. It was a very nice way to see the real Punta Cana and surrounding areas and it will really give you an appreciation as to what we have in our own homes. The only things that were not mentioned anywhere before we chose this resort was that there are no elevators as in most of the hotels there are only 3 floors. The main large buffets are open sided and not air conditioned so it is hot. We just booked a different specialty restaurant each nite and they are air conditioned and have really good food as well. It gets really hot and humid all the time and I am a sun lover and love to sunbathe and I will tell you to bring alot of sunblock (the higher the better) as you will be looking for the shade as the sun is extremely hot. Also bring aloevera for sunburn as you will need that too as you do get burned even with 50 sunblock on you. Other than that we have nothing bad at all to say about the resort. You will enjoy it! If anybody wants to ask me specific question I will be happy to answer you. My email is linbad2@msn.com. I am sad to be home and back to the grind but I have lovely memories of it.
