{"text":"Loved It... Nice hotel, Excellent staff The accommodations were very good and service was excellent. We were staying there with points, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Initially I was just happy we were able to find accommodations in Paris that could accommodate a family of 4. But both the room and the staff far exceeded my expectations. First the service. Coming from the US and arriving in the AM is an extremely draining experience. No matter how well (or not) you can sleep on the plane. But from the moment we got there I was just blown away by how accommodating they were. For one they let us check in at 9:30 AM. They also provided us complimentary drinks and passes to the Louve. But it wasn't just what they did but how they did it. They were just so friendly and helpful with everything. If I didn't know better I'd swear we were at Disney World instead of a hotel in the center of a major city. The manager greets you while your being checked in, introduces himself and requests you contact him if we need anything. The conciere's desk went out of their way to highlight areas of interest. And I'm not talking about the the tower and the arc. They advised us what parts of the town we would enjoy, where we could find historic churches, what days each of the attractions were open etc. Room wise, it was very clean and well kept. All we could askLocation was very good. Not right smack in the center of Paris but about a 12 min walk to the Arc. But the part I liked about it is it was right near one of their scenic parks. Personally I like spending time in those less tourist focused areas. And as a runner it was pretty cool as this particular park was well suited for running laps (about .5 mile) and a number of local runners were there as well.
