{"text":"Stylish San Gallo Just returned from a very pleasant 3 nights at the San Gallo, we booked a superior room which was on the ground floor at the back with double doors onto a roomy garden terrace. The The front desk and bar staff in the comfortable bar could not be more helpful and pleasant and a good breakfast was served  The room was very spacious with a king size bed, large double wardrobe with full length mirror doors and a fridge\/ television unit, small table and 2 chairs, all comfortable and in good condition. Next to that was a small office area with window onto the terrace and desk and computer point and a door then led to a well appointed bathroom with power shower, all nicely finished. The terrace looked onto the garden which is quite small and hemmed in by taller buildings, so the view is a bit limited. The ground floor at the back is the next floor down from the Hotel entrance at street level.The hotel is in a business area and has meeting rooms and business guests, which didnt detract from the pleasantnessof the Hotel.The location is just on the busy Piazza della Liberta not nearer the train station at the fortezza De Bassa end of Via lorenzo Magnifico as may be indicated by multimapping the hotel zip code. Had I known that I would have got transport from the train station after a long days travelling. Similarly the walk from the hotel to the centre of town although (just 15ish minutes to the Piazza Mercado) might become a tad tedious (especially uphill on the way back) if sightseeing during the day and eating in town. At night, we took taxis (although there are many buses also) to and from the Piazza della Republica and ate at a couple of the many restaurants around and about, the le Poste behind the square was nice as was the outdoor restaurant by the carousel in the square. There is also a good restaurant near the hotel called Alfredo and a couple of really good coffee bars.
