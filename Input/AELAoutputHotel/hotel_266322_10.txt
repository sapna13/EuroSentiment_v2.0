{"text":"Worst Hotel We booked our stay for one night at the Clarendon because we wanted to be by the airport. It was advertised that the hotel was minutes away from the airport. Well it was not very close at all we were about 10 miles away and in traffic it took us about a hour to go that distance. When reading it was near the airport I would think it was just a couple of miles. While checking in we had a guy in front of us asking where a gay bar was. The clerk was happy to assest and tell him about a bar and started giving details about the activities that went on in the bar. His discription was very inappropriate and unprofesional. Once we were done with that experience we noticed the pillows were down pillows. My wife is allergic and called the front desk to ask for new pillows and was laughed at. The clerk hung up with out saying if they would replace the pillows. My wife made a second call and than was told they would have to check on alternative pillows and they would call her back. When called back they could only come up with two pillows. One pillow looked like it was laying in the gutter and the other was over stuffed. The air conditioner in the room did not work with the thermostat at all. The room was like a oven and smelled horrible from the disinfectant. Thank God for a portable fan in the room. In the morning we were afraid to eat breakfast at this place because of the terrible service we were given. ","annotations":[]}
