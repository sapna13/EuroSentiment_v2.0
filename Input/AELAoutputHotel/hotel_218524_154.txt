{"text":"The Perfect Honeymoon!!! Excellence Punta Cana is truly the perfect, relaxing get-away!! We went on our honeymoon August 2008 and had the holiday of a lifetime! The hotel itself is absolutely stunning, set on a idylic beach complete with hammocks and palm trees. From the moment you arrive, you are treated to pure luxury, and the rooms are beautiful, four poster bed and jacuzzi included!! The choice in restaurants means there is something for everyone, I would reccommend 'Spice' which is Chinese and Thai cuisine but every one of the restaurants is worth a visit. The entertainment was better than I expected, with a large theatre in the main building, it was always packed and had a good atmosphere. The Michael Jackson tribute show should not be missed, along with the Circus and Magic Show. During the evening, there is Music Entertainment which includes a Saxophone player and traditional Dominican band. The atmosphere throughout day and night is lively and friendly, but not noisy or imposing. The casino is brilliant, and open until 3am. The staff there are lovely, they can't do enough for you and are all very friendly and helpful. The drinks were flowing constantly with waiter service on both the beach and by the pool. Although there was plenty to do in the Hotel, we did go on a Dolphin Swim excursion which was amazing. Worth doing and reasonably priced at only $120 (√ä√£¬¢60-√ä√£¬¢70) per person. We also booked the Soana Island Trip as it was recommended to us by a friend but unfortunately it got cancelled due to the weather. We also took part in Quad Biking on the beach (at an extra cost of $80 or 2 hrs) which was brilliant, a tour guide took us around the desserted beaches and through the local towns. Another must is the Horse Back Riding on the beach, 1\/2 hour free with your All Inclusive Package. Overall, I would say that this is the perfect Romantic getaway or Honeymoon!! Had a fantastic time, despite a few bad days of weather due to Hurricaines passing by and would go back in a flash!!  Top Tip:Take a good stock of Mosquito spray\/cream. I was eaten alive and ended up having to have an Injection to take the swelling down. Many guests experienced the same problem. If you want everyday sunshine, I would suggest visiting outside of Hurricaine Season as we did loose a couple of days to wind and rain.
