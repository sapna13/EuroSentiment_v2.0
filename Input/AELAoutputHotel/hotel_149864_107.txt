{"text":"Great for kids We traveled for holiday\/New Years 2006 as part of a group of 4 families with kids ranging from 11 months to 15 years. Overall, we had a great trip. We travled with an 11-month-old and a 2.5-year old. Some specifics:* Rooms were a little run-down, but had the basics. There is a small living space with two twin day beds that double as couches, separated from a king bed by pocket doors. We actually switched the furniture around so we would have access to the front door, bathroom and closet while the kids were sleeping or napping. Rooms were kept VERY clean and cleaned promptly. Bottled water is in all the rooms and replaced often. Refrigerator in the room.* Food was very good, better than at nicer places I've been. Esp. New Year's Eve -- caviar, foie gras, lobster, yum! Wine at every meal. Great desserts.* We brought baby food and formula for our youngest, but were also able to find table food for her to eat -- fruit, and they always had steamed and mashed vegetables.* High chairs and boosters are readily available in the restaurants.* Staff was kind and very friendly to kids. English sometimes wasn't the best.* Kids clubs: Weren't crazy about it -- might have been two babyish for her? Plenty of staff, nice clean facility, but our child wanted to play in the pool all day, not color or walk around the village singing songs. Also, the staff's English was difficult for her to understand, and they seem to give out candy as rewards -- my kid had no concept of this. She goes to daycare so is used to a classroom setting and teachers, but a week's time seemed to be too short for her to get adjusted and love the club.* Kids shows were painful for adults but the kids seemed to like it. Slightly violent (pirates or clowns running around playing tricks on each other, pretend kicking and fighting). English was impossible to understand. * Pool: Perfect for kids. The 2.5 year old could walk around most of it and had a great time. Need to get out early and put your towels on chairs. * Beach: White powdery sand, water seemed warm, very calm. * Other activities: We mostly hung with the kids by the pool. The other families and kids did archery, snorkeling, boat trips, sailing lessons and the circus. The older kids didn't seem to love their clubs either, and mostly hung out with the family.* Babysitting: We had a babyitter each night who came to the room after the kids were asleep. None spoke any English at all -- my high school Spanish helped. BUT the babysitters we had were kind, capable and clearly loved kids. Even on NY eve, the latest they can stay is 11:00 p.m.* Doctor: Our youngest got sick - low fever - and the doctor was great. He diagnosed a throat infection and prescribed antibiotics. She got better immediately. Easy to see, spoke great English.* Boutique has pool and beach toys, sunscreen, diapers, etc. All at inflated prices of course!* As a large family (15 people) it was easy to meet up and eat together at the large tables in the restaurant.* Weather was warm and sunny. Only one day that was slightly overcast and slight rain. A couple of rainy nights -- rain only lasted 1\/2 hour max.* Travel was tough. Bad airport on the way out --- waiting 2 hours to check in (before security!) in 90 degree heat with 2 young kids. That plus no direct flights were painful and could prevent me from going back.They do their goofy club med singing at night, but who cares? We enjoyed our time at the bar after the kids were asleep. Overall, a great trip. I can't see why you would go here WITHOUT kids, however. We all had a great time.
