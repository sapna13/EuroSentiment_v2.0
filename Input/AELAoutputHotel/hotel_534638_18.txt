{"text":"Disappointing My husband and I have just returned from a six night stay in Bali. For the first three nights we stayed at the Sheraton Laguna in Nusa Dua (see separate review) but opted to have the next three nights at the Sofitel in Seminyak to be closer to shops etc. I had high hopes for the Sofitel, but I have to say I was disappointed. Perhaps we were spoilt with the Sheraton Laguna, as it was magnificent, but the Sofitel just didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ compare in terms of facilities or service.Upon arrival we had to wait for an hour and a half for our room. There was confusion over whether we wanted twin beds or a king bed, apparently I had asked for twin beds (which I hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ) and they needed to organise another room for us. Not too much of a problem, we just went and looked at the shops, and we had only come from Nusa Dua (half an hour away) but if I had just arrived on a long flight I would have been much more annoyed.Our room was spacious and attractively decorated in a contemporary Balinese style, with a balcony overlooking the garden area. The bathroom was large but the toilet was positioned directly in front of the shower which made getting in and out awkward. Water pressure was low and the water was not always particularly hot.Our first morning at breakfast we arrived to be told there were no tables left! We were speechless! Fortunately they found one and we managed to eat. Breakfast was typical of large resorts with all the usual foods you would expect, but I have to say it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ anything special. Service was slow and many of the staff had a disinterested manner.There were two pool areas √à√\u2020\u2022?one large beachfront pool and a smaller √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√\u2020arden√à√\u2020\u2022?pool. The beachfront pool tended to be very busy and the sun lounges were quite close together so it felt crowded. It also had a very ugly view of the side of the hotel next door, complete with air-conditioning units going all the way up the side of the building. A better option was the garden pool which was much more peaceful and private. The gardens were beautiful and well maintained but most of the public areas seemed a little bit tired and in need of a good clean. I thought Seminyak (having a reputation as being more √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬∂p market√à√\u2020\u2022?than Kuta or Legian) would have a nice beach but in reality it was black sand (which looked and felt like dirt), rubbish strewn and with stray dogs roaming all over it, not to mention the local vendors who constantly tried to get you to have massages etc. We stayed off the beach and stuck to the pool.We had a massage at the spa and again, it was a disappointment. It was more like having a massage in a suburban doctor√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ office complete with a view to the carpark. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe experienced other Balinese resort spas (like the Padma in Legian or the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel) where the spa area was like a tropical paradise, with water fountains and the smell of frangiapanni, but this was nothing like it. The massage itself was very good, but there was no √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æow√à√\u2020\u2022?factor at all.The final straw was our last swim just prior to packing up and leaving. We got to the main pool to be told it was closed as it was too √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëirty√à√\u2020\u2022? I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe it. There are some excellent restaurants nearby. Gado Gado was fantastic right on the beach and great at night. We had a great Indian meal at the The Queen's Tandoor. Also, the Thai restaurant (Wild Orchid) in the resort next door was lovely.If you want to stay in this part of Bali, I think a much better option is the Bali Padma which we stayed at in 2007. It is only a short distance away and probably a similar price, but substantially better in terms of facilities and service. For us, however, we will stick to Nusa Dua and just day trip to Kuta for shopping.
