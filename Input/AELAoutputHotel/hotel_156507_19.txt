{"text":"This was a great place! We stayed at the Casa Gonzalez based on recommendations from here and another travel site. It was terrific! There were a couple of cons (vastly outweighed by the pros), which I will list here:They do not have a website that I could find, so we had to email and call them to make any reservations and changes. Only one person speaks English (Jorge, the Jack-Of-All-Trades), so it's hard to communicate with most of the staff if your Spanish is poor (like mine is!)These are old buildings with no vents for heating\/cooling. Since we were there around Thanksgiving, it got pretty chilly at night, though we were able to get a space heater the 2nd night of our stay.That said, here are the many pros:Jorge was extremely helpful during our stay, drawing us maps and answering all our questions about the city.Since we wanted to split our trip between two locales, Jorge arranged a place to stay for us in Guanajuato, and stored our luggage for free until we came back to Mexico City. They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner for a reasonable fee and everything we ate was delicious. The rooms were clean, sunny and comfy, especially when we came back from Guanajuato: we had a deck and a bathtub!The neighborhood was fun and felt very safe. There are 2 embassies within walking distance, the metro is a few blocks away and Paseo de la Reforma (MC's main drag) is 2 blocks away, which is where most of the museums and Chapultepec Park are located (a 15 minute walk!)We had a great stay. We will be back in March! ","annotations":[]}
