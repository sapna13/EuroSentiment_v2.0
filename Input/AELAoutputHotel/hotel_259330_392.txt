{"text":"A vacation to forget! TWENTYFIVE YEARS we waited for this vacation!When my husband and I celebrated our Silver Anniversary we decided to book our 2nd honeymoon with another party going down to the Dominican Republic (Punta Cana, Grande Paradise Bavaro) to get married (my business partner ) with 27 of her guests....what a mistake.From the moment we arrived we were treated with disrespect, having to lug our own lugguge up the stairs to the reception area. At reception were were told our room was not ready and that we were to be in a room with twin beds. When booking this trip we stressed that it was our 25th Anniversary and that we wanted a king size bed, after much coercion he said that he would see what he could do...2 hours later they said our room was ready, our bellhop walked us to our room heping us with only one of our lugguage pieces, we carried the rest. When we got to the room the maid was still cleaning and mopping the soom, so we waited in the hall. Once inside the room my husband and looked around and noticed that the fridge was leaking on the loor and not cooling properly - the maid proceeded to madly (she was pissed!) take the fridge out and exchanged it with another fridge from a room down the hall.Everything seemed OK until we went to the Buffet to get something to eat - that was the beginning of a very close relationship with our toilet...During our stay...The food is disgusting and totally recycled! It's the same food every day and not many choices, the cheese is left out sweating all day, put away and put out again the next day (we didn't eat it even though we love cheese), the meat is tough, there was cream on everything to mask tastes, the deserts were all made out of mousse, we were told to say away from any dairy products before we got there because their milk is not pasteurized so there was not much we COULD EAT. We couldn't drink either, the glasses were only rinsed out between customers' uses with tap water and reused still wet, there was blue paint on the glasses that came from blue painted countertop and when we complained the bartender (by the way there was only one bartender at the pool to hundreds of guests) got mad and started rambling in Spanish and basically gave us the impression that it was our tough luck and if we wanted to drink we would have to accept it....The staff, Oh My God! - i've been around for a long time and I've never experienced such BAD customer service,-If you want anything don't bother tipping because even when you do it really doesn't get you any better service.-There is no service at the pool, if you are thirsty - get up and get it yourself.- There is no courtesy, you are asically treated like cattle, and there is nothering you can do about it if you don'[t speak their language,- When you go into their gift shop - if you're not a man you'll be ignored and they walk around as if their stoned and don't know what to do.- Towels are few and you are lucky if at the end of the day you have one for your shower.- The beds are not too bad but the sheets stink of cheese!- Nothing is explained to you so if you have never gone to a resort you will have no idea of what to do or where to go for activities.- The so called 24 hour food is a sports bar with popcorn and nachos.- We brought gifts such as toothpaste, soap, shampoo, body lotions, deodorants, toys etc. to leave on the bed for the maid as a thank you even though we never really saw her and we had to call to get towels and wait until the early evening to back to a clean room.Most of our vacation was spend in the lobby with our party complaining and or yelling about the horrendous service and lack of respect and hospitality. You'd think that living in such poverty and given the chance to work and get paid to work in such a nice environment they would at least give us (the paying customer who work for years to be able to go on a holiday such as this) the courtesy we deserve.It would have been nice to at least have the basics to sustain life - food and water...We wanted this trip to be special and memorable - IT WASN'T!!!
