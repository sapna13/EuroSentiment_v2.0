{"text":"We Found Paradise!!!!!!!!!! Hola!! The Punta Cana Princess is the best resort we have been at so far in our travels. We loved it so much we tried to stay an extra week but they were totally booked up and we couldn't stay- we even offered to sleep on the beach if we could stay! This is the only resort we have ever been at where we weren't ready to go home! The food was excellent with a fresh pasta bar at lunch, omlette and pancake bars at breakfast and usually fresh fish bar at the evening buffet. For breakfast they also have yogurt, toast, cereal and all the usuals you would find at home. The 24 hour snack bar makes the BEST hamburgers- even better than I would find at any restaurant in Alberta, Canada. The fruit was always fresh and plentiful and was always my favorite food! The baked tomatoes are very, very good, too!The a la cartes are now reservation-free so you can enjoy them on any night and as many times as you want during your stay. This was fabulous cause when we met new people and wanted to go for dinner with them we could go to the a la cartes for a special meal on a moments notice.The beach party on Monday night is a whole lotta fun even though ours was moved inside due to windy, rainy weather.The nightly shows in the lobby are fun and we went to almost every one. We got to know the Amination team very well so we had fun with them during the day and at the shows at night. We ended up in the show one night, much to my husband's dismay!Kelvin, Danny, Jarol and Celina are a very energetic group of people!!! This show ended about 11:00 and then you could go over to the disco if you still craved more excitement or you could go for a quite stroll on the beach. If you chose to retire then, it was nice and quiet and you could get a good sleep.The staff at the Mare Nostrum Snack bar are amazing! Give a big hug to Serapio if you go there- he bends over backwards to make sure you are taken care of. Daniela is an excellent bartender and will make whatever you ask for, even if she's never heard of it!!We were part of the VIP group and had access to the beach beds. They are fabulous!!!!! Talk about a fanatasy- falling asleep on a bed on the beach listening to the ocean and dreaming of paradise.....and waking up actually IN paradise! There is also butler service on the beach for the VIP's- another amazing perk of being a VIP. There is also a fruit basket in your room, a 26 ounce bottle each of rum, whiskey and vodka and a stocked mini-bar. We also had a little box with 3 cigars in it. There were bath robes and slippers also for us to use. The maids were fabulous and we had nightly turn down. We also had free internet access.The beaches here are out of this world and unlike any we have encountered. It's like walking in icing sugar and the sand never gets hot! Amazing! As you can see, we are very taken with this resort. We have already made plans to go back next January but it will be for 2 weeks this time! Hola!!
