{"text":"Had a great stay We just stayed at this hotel for 6 nights and had a wonderful stay. The staff was very friendly and always so helpful with questions, dinner reservations, ideas for things to do, etc. The hotel itself is not very large, as in the lobby, etc, but it's part of its charm unless you like a huge lobby with lots of hustle and bustle. In fact, the lobby was usually quiet. Our room, I believe we had a deluxe, was a good size- as well as the bathroom. Everything was modern and sleek, and very clean. We only had breakfast one morning in the hotel. It was pricey, as is Paris in general, and it was generally good. The selection was somewhat basic compared to larger hotels we've stayed in but it was still good- the quality of the food was great. There are cafe's nearby- one next door- but they didn't seem to have a full breakfast menu so we walked down to Place Alma and ate at Cafe Corona a few times where we had omelettes, etc. The location is very convenient to the metro and to the Champs Elysees. It is on a large avenue- Marceau- but it's quiet in and of itself without many businesses. You only need to walk a few min. in either direction to find the action, though. It's probably a plus to not be in the middle of the action as far as the noise level too. All in all we had an excellent stay and would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. ","annotations":[]}
