{"text":"Good Hotel, hotel staff were disappointing This Hotel was very nice at check in the staff was helpful and courteous. The room was very nice. The bed was soft and the room was clean. I have a complaint\/ warning about the parking. We chose to park our rental car overnight on our first night there at $35 per night. Then we returned the rental car to the rental company and relied on public transportation the rest of our trip. (On a side note give yourself extra time to get around on the streetcar and and the F trolley- very crowded). Upon checkout I noticed charges for multiple days of parking. I mentioned to the desk clerk that we only stayed one night. She rolled her eyes and said Let me see and called over the Doorman. He stated he would have to call the garage. The Desk clerk then said very cocky Did you TELL anyone that you weren't brining the car back I said I wasn't aware I had to, she then rolled her eyes again laughed at me and said well how are we supposed to know you aren't bringing the car back unless you tell the front desk. I assumed they checked cars in and out as they are brought in and out. The doorman said it was probably a mistake because it showed our car as currently checked in and it wasn't there. The desk clerk begrudgingly reversed the charge and told me next time to tell the correct people about the car. She said it was not the doormans job to charge us it was the front desk. It was sad to end a nice stay this way. Also, I was never told of any breakfast option that was offered, upon reading other reviews I noticed people mentioning it, so you may have to ask. The hotel restaurant was closed for renovation during our stay so I assumed breakfast was off.All and all a nice stay but staff had mixed attitudes.
