{"text":"Great value, new furnishings. My husband and I just returned from a week in Paris at the Grand Hotel Francais. This hotel is a real gem. The rooms are newly renovated and very well planned. Our room was small, but no more so than other European hotels. It had great storage as well as a safe and small refrigerator in the room. The bed was firm and comfortable. The lighting was excellent, with lights over the bed for reading and an alcove next to each side of the bed with an electrical outlet (my husband recharged his phone there each night). The bathroom was clean and new with great water pressure and hot water. It also had plenty of space to put things (very rare for Europe, I've found). This was our 5th trip to Paris and this was the quietest room we have ever stayed in. We were not woken up by road noise which was really unusual for Paris. Our breakfast was included in the room deal we got through Travelocity and the breakfast was so good that we ate there every day. It had pastries, breads, cereals, fresh fruit, meats, cheese, yogurt, etc. The staff is extremely friendly and helpful, too. The hotel is not in the central part of Paris, but is right next to a metro stop and a 5 minute walk to Nation, which connects to many more metro lines. We could easily get anywhere in Paris from the hotel on the metro. This is a great little hotel and a great value for Paris.
