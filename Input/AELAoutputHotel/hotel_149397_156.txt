{"text":"Very good value We took our parents on their 50th anniversary to the Bavaro Princess - 11 people in total. I travel all over the world for my job, and have stayed in many forms of accomodations. Whereas the hotel rooms could not really be rated as 5 star as they are somewhat older and in some of our rooms the bathrooms were a bit worn (our bidet was off its screws and the bath had considerable delamination), I found the suites quite good nonetheless. Large rooms, comfy beds, good air conditioning, nice large private verandas, ample closet space, large bathroom areas. The units are generally well maintained, and every concern we had was responded to very quickly. The grounds and beach are breathtaking and well worth the price in themselves. The natural jungle in the middle of the grounds was a wonderful place to walk and hear the birds. The shuttle service was great, the staff generally accomodating although you do have to watch out for some very lazy staff that say they did things and never did. Improvements could be made in a few key areas - food quality was similar to most resorts I have stayed in, but the beef was often of poor quality and the shrimp were never deveined - a prime source of sickness on holidays. Overall however, the buffets were spectacular and offered a huge choice in which there were always some excellent dishes. The sit-down restaurants - I was not impressed with their restaurant booking process at all and avoided it for the most part. Heard many complaints in this area from other tourists. I highly recommend the Japanese restaurant. Drinks - alcohol was very plentiful, but quality of drinks like daiquiris and coladas was poor.
