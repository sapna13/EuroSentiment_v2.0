{"text":"Pleasant I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore, and I probably would stay there again. The concierge service was reliable, efficient, informative, and thoughtful. The folks at the reception were also helpful, but sometimes the lines are quite long to get to a person--if you need immediate assistance in that case, pop over to the concierge.Your luggage--you might have to carry your own bags to your room and let yourself in when you check in. I only had one bag so it didn't bother me--especially I was not sure how to tip in Singapore and I wanted some privacy, I was glad for this, but those travelling with children and\/or lots of luggage might want to check with the front desk about getting some assistance checking in and out.The room I had (on the 14th floor) was very big and thoughtfully laid out. A big bonus was that there was an iron and ironing board in the room which I really found handy. There is also a hotpot, for anyone who wants to boil water and drink it (or have tea\/coffee in the room). The linen was very clean, white and spotless (and comfortable). The bathroom was very big. The only complaint I have was that the commode had a highly dubious brown splotch on the seat. I disinfected it and put a disposable toilet seat cover on it since I am rather finiky and that put me off.Breakfast is served in two restaurants on the 2nd floor. Those with schedules to keep up should try to go before 8:30am otherwise there is a long queue to both. The staff members at the restaurants were efficient and friendly.There is a shopping mall attached to the hotel, which is fantastic. There are reasonable places to eat in the mall, and from the shopping center you can get to the metro (train, tube, whatever you like to call it). I would stay at this hotel again. ","annotations":[]}
