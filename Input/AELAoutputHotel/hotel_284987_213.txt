{"text":"We are here now - we will never come back! We have been here since this past Sat - we are here now actually - beautiful resort - staff are all very nice and very accomodating. Royal Service is the ONLY way to go here. If you are looking for a beach, which most are in the Carribean, then do not come to this hotel. There is NO BEACH, which for us is a huge dissappointment. Otherwise the hotel is in transition right now from all inclusive to not all inclusive which adds to the confusion around here. For example room service has no prices on menus, etc. Food at Restaurants is very good. Lunch is VERY LIMITED. You can go to the buffet for $25 pp or starve - and the hours are only from 12-3pm. There are only 4 restaurants open to us right now of the 6 advertised. Romatico and Bamboo are excellent. Avocado is ok. But we have been told all names of the restaraunts will change over next week. So not sure how much that will help....but at The Royal Service Lounge you can have continental breakfast as well as complimentary drinks and snacks all day. Hotel is 45 minutes it seems from anywhere. There are no complimentary transfers to anywhere at all. A taxi will cost anywhere from $80-$120 ONE WAY to Old San juan for example. Rental car - plus or minus $60. Make sure you fill up after use of vehicle - they charge $10 per gallon if you don't. There is no night life. To say the least this is a very mellow resort. If you are looking for total isolation and relaxation then great - but if you like a little bit of entertainment - then don't come here. Casino is fun - small - but all you need if you are into that sort of thing. We don't have kids but it does not seem like a place for children if you are looking for a family get away. Just want to say again - staff and service are great - and hotel is beautiful and clean. Just not the place for us. Hope this helps!! ","annotations":[]}
