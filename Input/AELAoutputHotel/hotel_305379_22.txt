{"text":"Don't Stay There I want to report that this hotel was ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I paid $US180 for a room which should have cost no more than $US80 at the most. On arrival at the hotel, there was a sign out the front offering rooms for $HK398!!! There was no one to help with the bags. I complained about the room, but all rooms are the same.The hotel is old, there is paint and wall paper coming off the walls. The carpets are stained. However, the worst thing is the size of the rooms. It is almost impossible to turn around in these rooms, unless you are a very small person, say under 5 feet tall and very narrow. There was one very dark window, a roller blind which did not keep out the light, no tissues, nothing in the mini bar. Bed linen was of a poor quality as was the mattress on the bed. In the room there was no space for the case.I felt that the hotel also posed a fire risk, being so poky and tight.The breakfast was NOT included in $US180!!! The breakfast was absolutely terrible too. It cost $HK55 for a buffet, I asked to have Continental, because all I could eat was toast and tea. That was not possible. There was no yoghurt, virtually no fruit compote, only one jam.In every aspect this hotel is CHEAP AND NASTY. It must be classified as a TWO STAR property.I had booked the hotel on the internet and was required to pay BEFORE getting there. Hong Kong was very crowded at this time. Therefore, I had no way to get my money back and the hotel is just laughing about the money they are making. I hope to spread the word on other web sites about this hotel. It is a disgrace.
