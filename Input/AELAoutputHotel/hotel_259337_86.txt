{"text":"Nice grounds, but bad food We booked our trip to the Palladium mostly on the high rating of this sight, first things first I will it is a beautiful well maintained resort, with a excellent beach, no seaweed no rocks just pure sand. The crowd was mostly French and European, few Americans and some Canadians. All in all I would say the hotel caters mostly to people from France I found the only people who spoke English were the bartenders in the lobby, and the front desk clerks besides that you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e going to have to get by on pointing for what you want.Now for the bad! The resort the beach was overcrowded and beach chairs are scarce if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go early to reserve them with your towel. There are way to many people from the hotel trying to sell excursions (scuba diving, parasailing, snorkeling) and towards the end of your trip it gets extremely annoying when you just want some peace and quiet, it gets a bit old when you can always hear some guy Parasailing, bannaboat every minuet, followed by guys walking up and down the beach trying to sell jewelry and fake cigars. Also this is not the hotels fault but if you like walking up and down the beach you cant go either way without being harassed by other resorts selling excursions, guys selling timeshare, and extremely pushy guys trying to get you to come into there store.I found the food to be disappointing we only went to 2 ala carts then gave up we tried the Asian and the Mexican and after talking with other people they said the other restaurants were worse or no better, so we pretty much stuck with the buffet because at least you knew what you were getting and you didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to wait for a hour to get a seat. The buffet was ok, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ pretty big so you can always find a few things to eat that aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ too bad, (I would rate it just a little better then a Cuban 4 1\/2 star) Our room was great, although I think we got put in a suite of some sort due to the hotel being booked solid, it had a really big bathroom with a hot tub in it which was really nice, and our maids kept the room really tidy and cleanSome Other Good\/Bad PointsThe casino is small few blackjack\/roulette tables and one poker table that is always emptyThere is a shuttle train that goes through all 3 resorts which is handy, there are 2 trains that run frequentlyThe other resorts buffets are just the same as the Bavaro's so you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really get a variety if you wanted oneReef explorer excursion was pretty goodDisco wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ half bad Bars gave out bottled water which was niceBeach towel service is a pain (card type service)Id look into the paradisus or the princess resort just down the way, they both looked a bit more laid back and less congested, and the beach chairs at the paradisus looked comfy they had beds and such you could lie on and tan!All in all I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say I had a bad time at this resort but I was ready to leave at the end of my 7 days.
