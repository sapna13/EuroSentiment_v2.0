{"text":"Davanzati gem of a hotel in a gem of a city We booked this hotel based on the praise it received on this website and the advance praise (believe it or not) did not do it justice. I have traveled to Italy many times, visited Florence several times and this hotel surpassed all of my previous experiences. The only regret my wife and I had regarding Hotel Davanzati is that we were only staying 3 nights. Every facet of this hotel was top-notch. From Fabrizio's greeting at check-in, to his excellent restaurant recommendations, to our wonderful room, we could not have been more pleased. The laptop and playstation in our room was a great bonus and it was nice to be able to watch a DVD after dinner. The comfort of the bed in our room far surpassed any other bed we slept in during the rest of our trip through Italy. The bathroom was also spacious compared to the typical Italian hotel bathroom with a shower that actually could accomodate a normal sized adult. The continental breakfast in the morning was also nice with freshly made capuccino and a variety of breads, pastries, fruit, etc. Finally, we especially enjoyed the complimentary evening happy hour with the light snacks and prosecco. It was nice to chat with fellow guests or just sit quietly and enjoy our beverages. Our lasting memory of our honeymoon in Italy will be our stay in Florence. My wife and I already started making plans for a return trip next year...assuming we can find availability at the Hotel Davanzati.
