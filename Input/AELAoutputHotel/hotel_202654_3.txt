{"text":"Pleasant stay My wife and I, just got back from a 5-day stay at the hotel. In general, we have a very good impression about our stay. The hotel has many advantages: The rooms are very clean, they are spacious, and the bathroom is of excellent quality. Also, the hotel is situated just above the U-bahn Station Markishes Museum. Although the area doesn't have anything special you can do, (apart from dining at an opposite Indian Restaurant - which is not bad) by using the Underground you can go everywhere you want. (Small tip: Buy from the yellow automated machines a 48-hour or a 72-hour Welcome Card (ticket) , which gives you unlimited access to all means of transportation AND discounts to museums and city tours, it's worth it). The hotel also provides Wifi Access (which is NOT free, however) and has a nice sauna and fitness room, which are free to use. The fitness room is small, but still you can work out with no problems. The hotel also provides an indian-style massage, which is very expensive (120 euros for 1 hour). The breakfast is good, however it could still improve. The place where breakfast is being served is quite small, however, so if you go at peak times and the hotel is full, you could have to wait a few minutes before you sit (not very likely to happen, but it is possible). The hotel's staff is helpful and polite. Some (small) disadvantages: Room temperature is very high, and you cannot change it, and the bed is too soft. These are factors that did affect my sleep. At least, you can open the window for some fresh air. In general, very positive feelings about this hotel, you won't regret staying there.
