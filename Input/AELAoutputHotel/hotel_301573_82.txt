{"text":"Too many hookers I frequently stay at the old sister hotel, the Plaza, but could not get in there due to a conference of Insurance firms being held. I was therefore put into the Stamford, my first visit here for many years. Both hotels are located at the Raffles City shopping centre and connected by a ground floor passageway which also enters the shopping centre The check in was good, and staff as ever helpful in the hotel. I had a 54th floor room with great views across both Boat and Clark Quays. The room itself was how the Plaza had been several years ago before they started refurbshing. As such it is a little dated but totally adequate and confortable. A good working desk is provided but the shower and bath combined is looking old. A glass screen to keep water in was fairly useless. I found two problems. The lifts to the guest floors are accessible during the day directly from the shopping centres second and third floors. I did not need my key card to use these, despite having slots available on the panels to use them. As a result I felt security of the rooms was loose as anyone could go up stairs without going through the lobby. Which dovetails with the second point - on my last night, also the last night of the conference, I walked via the passageway to have a nightcap in Raffles which directly over the road from the Plaza. I was approached by two hookers in what I consdiered hotel space, within a minute of each other. I raised it with a member of the Plaza staff as I passed him to get a response of there's a conference on but no other action. Likewise there were several hanging about outside the Plaza. This is a nuisance factor most travellers can do without and a big disappointment as I had not seen this before. Before going back to either Stamford or Plaza hotels in future I will ensure there is not a conference on.
