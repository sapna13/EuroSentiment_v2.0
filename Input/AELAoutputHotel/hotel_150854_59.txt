{"text":"Can't wait to go back My wife and I spent a wonderful week at this resort from Arpil 20th - 27th. We have had the pleasure of staying at some great resorts in Mexico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic including other Riu's and this was by far our favorite. It seemed to offer the best aspects of the others in one resort, the great food of Mexico along with the spectacular beaches found in Cuba. Overall the staff were great and always very pleasant and you were given the sense that their priority was to make sure you were happy at all times.  I can honestly say we had no complaints about the rooms. They were very clean, there were no water issues in regards to pressure or availability of hot water. The air conditioning worked very well, in fact at night my wife had to add the extra blanket provided. The mini fridge was restocked daily so there was never a lack of refreshments including water. To touch on the issue of the hard beds, yes they are firm but not to the point where you are not able to sleep on them or cause injuries as some have remarked. As I mentioned the food was fantastic with lot's of selection. The main buffet was incredible and I cannot imagine what the people who complain about the food at this resort eat at home. There was always a variety of seafood, pork and chicken in addition too some featured dishes of stuffed turkey, prime rib and bacon wrapped fillet's. There was another couple who joined us on this vacation who have been on several cruises and commented that the food was at the same great level. I know I don't get to eat like this on a daily basis! You are given a choice for seating times at the buffet when you arrive however they are flexible and the staff will accommodate you if you would like to change at any point. The beach is amazing with plenty of chairs available, this was the only resort we have visited where we did not have to get up early to reserve them and you cannot beat the service you are provided there. Henry does a great job keeping the drinks coming to you but if you prefer the bar is right at the beach and there was never a wait time. We would arrive at the beach around 9:00am and there were always staff members waiting to bring down the pads for the chairs and tables as well. The resort is a perfect size. The week we were there it was sold out but it never felt crowded and you were never left waiting at any time. This along with the great staff and the service they provide makes me very comfortable in recommending the Riu Palace Macao and I can honestly say to date this is the only resort we have visited that we will definitely be returning to.
