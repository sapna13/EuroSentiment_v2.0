{"text":"Modern, up-to-date, well sized, great location (four stars) I am very picky about hotels. Our budget did not allow for more than 310.00 per night - we were willing to pay that much for a nice room in Paris - for less in Paris you'd get a 2 star hotel at most. We usually stay at 4-5 star hotels, but in Paris the budget had to be reduced to 3 stars because we simply refuse to pay 500 or more Euros per night for a four-five star hotel in Paris! The Ares Eiffel is lovely and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. The hotel would be FOUR stars if it was larger and had a full service restaurant. I prefer the three stars for the price and eat elsewhere!The Ares was lovely. Felt like a smaller boutique hotel. Up to date. Not old and stuffy. The weekend receptionist is overly kind!!! The night staff, a gentleman, is very shy and doesn't speak much - not even to say bon soir. That could be improved. You have to leave your keys when you go out and you have much contact with the reception. The metro is about a minute walking distance from the hotel. The Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ Suffren was around the corner and very good (both service and food). The Cafe Garnelle has a Crepe guy on the street and is very very kind- and has the best crepes! We did those for breakfast often. Hotel breakfast at 15 Euros buys you coffee and bread, basically. The crepes are 3.50 and very filling. Full Breakfast in the area can be around 8-12 Euros. Much better than the hotel option.
