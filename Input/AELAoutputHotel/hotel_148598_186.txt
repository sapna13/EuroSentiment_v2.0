{"text":"Great Vacation! Got back from the Rio Mar about a week ago. Everything was great. We did not really experience many of the troubles that others seemed to have.Our check in was great, we had a corner room facing the rain forest and the view was amazing. Ate at the sushi place on the grounds the first night. it was good, but expensive. Overall, we'd recommend leaving the grounds for meals since there are so many great local places very close.Place to check out:Richies - the best food we had by far. Its 2 minutes from the grounds and has amazing views. Its all outdoor seating. The food is absolutely terrific and we went back twice to try everything we wanted. Highly recommend the Mofongo, Tostones, all of the seafood and the guava\/passion fruit dessert. Richie, the owner, is extremely gracious and a wonderful host. They really took care of us and you should definitely check it out.That leads to renting a car. its an absolute must for visiting this area of Puerto Rico. We got a great deal on hotwire. get one from the airport as the rates at the Avis in the hotel are much higher.The beach and pool areas were great, and there was a nice mix of families and couples, young, old and in between.We hiked in the rainforest one day and that was great. Dont take the hotel's tour, just drive to the visitors center, pay the couple of dollars, and speak to the park rangers. They'll set you up with some good hikes that fit the time\/type you want. If you dont want to hike at all, there are still some waterfalls and really nice views from the roadway that you can pull off at.The hotel has a small casino with very low daytime table limits and reasonable evening limits. There are a few bars and lounges that are nice, but again, very expensive.The concierge staff was excellent and helped out with whatever we wanted.
