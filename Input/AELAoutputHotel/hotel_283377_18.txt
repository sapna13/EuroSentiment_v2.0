{"text":"Great hotel and found a great store for the ladies nearby My wife and I stayed at this charming hotel in Mid July of this year and we had a great time. The hotel is clean and the staff are very helpful. Breakfast was small but very good and the person was very helpful.The hotel is very close to all tourist attractions and everyone is helpful if you have questions. Cost was reasonable and we would definitely stay there again. The rooms are airconditioned which really was comfortable during the hot Florence summer.There is an excellent restaurant not far away il Latini in which the food is great and the ambiance fantastic. The price was very reasonable. Reservatons are a must.Now for the surprise for the ladies. Not far from the hotel, around the corner is a store which sells leather goods, purses and handbags. The store is called Dantesca and is run by a bubbly young lady, Yael, from England and her husband, Marco. They are very accomodating. The store is right across from the Casa de Dante and is the only store on the street. The street is a narrow laneway so you will have to search for it. But ask at the hotel and they can point you in the right direction.The store is a little chaotic as they also manufacture leather goods. My wife found a big selection of models and colours. The purses are all leather and the prices much lower than the m ajor stores. It is a small store, has a large selection and lots of charm. ","annotations":[]}
