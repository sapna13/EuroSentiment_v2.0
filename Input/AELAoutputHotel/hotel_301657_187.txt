{"text":"Top notch hotel in all ways Stayed for almost a week in Tokyo on my honeymoon, and selected the Park Hotel based solely on the reviews posted at Trip Advisor.First off, this hotel is extremely hard to find. Our father-in-law, even with a native car and Japanese navigation system, couldn't seem to locate the hotel and had to ask multiple people in the area. In fact, we spent a good 30 minutes in the vicinity circling around until we found it. The reason was that the hotel is part of a skyscraper, and is located on the higher floors. So the only thing pointing out that there's a hotel there is a small sign that was hard to see from the construction-crowded road.Once there, we took the quick and quiet elevator to the spectacular lobby. The view from behind the check-in desk was expansive, and the lounge was in a very open and cozy area with modern furniture and smiling hotel staff everywhere. Everything reeks of upper-class service and quality. For some reason, the entire hotel seemed to be exceptionally quiet...muffled even. White noise perhaps?The room is typical Japanese...that is, small. For those used to living in large suite hotel rooms in the US, get ready for a shock. Needless to say, everything was spic and span clean, but the actual room was barely large enough to fit the furniture.The TV was really like a 21 flat panel monitor from a computer. What was mildly irritating to me was the fact that virtually all the channels were Japanese. The only English channels were CNN International, CNBC i think and some various ones here and there. To make matters worse, they didn't compensate by offering much pay-per-view choices, nothing like the ones in the US. On the bright side, you could get quick previews of Japanese Adult Videos before they asked you to pay.The bathroom was immaculate with a toilet that required a computer science degree to fully enjoy if jets of water is your thing. Room service was pricey as to be expected. The food was quite good.The restaurants in the hotel were top notch and pretty expensive.The bathrooms in the lobby\/lounge were, to quote my wife, the best bathrooms I've ever seen. For a germophobe like me, Japanese bathrooms are heaven.Part of the Shiodome complex, the building is actually one of a few towering modern skyscrapers in the area. The immediate vicinity are mostly businesses. If you go down to the subway level, there is a 24-hour convenience store with all manners of goodies...definitely not the 7\/11s...we're talking pretty darn good food. On the subway level are some restaurants open only during business hours for some good quick cheap bites. Further along there's a Starbucks and a bookstore\/stationary store.The subway system is quite complex and not for the faint of heart. However, everything is laid out with a logic that the Japanese are known for. The actual subway lines to get to attractions in the city is about a 10 minute walk that takes you through the Shiodome complex and down a subway area.All in all, I'd stay at the Park Hotel again in a heartbeat. And at the deal rate we got ($118 US), it was unbeatable.
