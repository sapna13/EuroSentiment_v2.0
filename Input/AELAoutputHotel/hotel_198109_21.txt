{"text":"Gorgeous hotel We stayed here just a couple of weeks ago, and had an amazing stay. I was a little nervous about it as I've lived in Paris and know what some of the hotels are like! However, we had absolutely no complaints with this one. Our room was very spacious, and recently redecorated in a really nice, funky style. Huge bathroom with a lovely big bath, a nice view over the garden (although this was being done up so was a bit of a mess) and a lovely comfortable bed.We had breakfast included in our rate - it was a very nice continental breakfast, with lots of lovely French bread and pastries to keep you going for the morning! The breakfast also ran until 11am so if you needed a little extra sleep, you could have both. The staff were extremely helpful and polite at all times.Other reviewers are correct when they say it's a short walk to the Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees. The metro is also very close, and there are lots of shops etc in close proximity. The only one (small) complaint I would have is that for one night of our stay, there was a club night on in the bar next door, which meant there was lots of loud music and noise. This wasn't the case for the rest of the stay so I dont imagine it's a regular occurence.I would highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Paris. It's excellent value for money and I don't think you'll do much better.
