{"text":"Good but not great We have traveled to Puerto Rico on April 6-10 2008. I did a lot of research before finally settling with Rio Mar.The only reason why I was not greatly upset about my choice was the fact that I got a good deal on the trip package. Otherwise this hotel is clearly not worth to spend a lot of money.The worst part was the beach. It was flat out terrible. First 2 days they did not even clean it, so it was covered in seaweed and trash. Waves were huge! Impossible to swim or enjoy water. Also, sand was pretty bad. Nothing like beautiful white sand beaches we have seen in Jamaica.Food and drinks were pretty expensive and not that good at all.Basically you have one kitchen just different restaurants (more like rooms). Average price on drinks $10.We had a breakfast once and one dinner (dinner was $90 for 2, cheapest plates). Service was good, though. Housekeepers came in 3 times a day. Room was good and clean, but not tropical or fancy, just standard room. The best thing we did was renting a car. It saved us tons of money and we had so much fun driving around to closest towns and exploring on our own. Plus we saved money by eating off the resort. But honestly, food in Puerto Rico is very boring. I did not try anything I liked more than just to satisfy my hunger.I have many pictures of our Puerto Rico trip. Day one was area near Rio Mar. Day 2 Old San Juan (loved it!!!!). Day 3 El Yunque forest. Here is the link to albums, look under Places, you will see 3 albums from that trip.http:\/\/public.fotki.com\/Dsfotki\/places\/ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":728,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":724}]}
