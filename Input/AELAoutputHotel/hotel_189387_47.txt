{"text":"The Story Behind the Gables These old merchant houses that have been combined over the years to creat and recreat this Hotel make for wonderful reading ijn the Hotel brochure, be sure to do this. Arrival from the train station was quick and the welcome mat was out the minute I stepped out of the car. The doorman greated me and once I gave my name, remember it the rest of my stay. The front office was very courtious and the ladies are very pretty and polite. I had a package sent to the Hotel, it was waitng at reception with my check-in folio. The room assignment was quick and the room was beautiful and unusually spacious for Europe. Plenty of towels and very clean. This location is just a block from the Ann Frank House and in the neighboorhoods, so walking is a must to explore and appreciate the archectecture of the Old World. I had wanted to see the Heinekin Brewery but alas it was closed for renovation. So the Concierge sent me to the Bols Liquor on this Tuesday. Well, my one complaint, Bols is closed on Tuesday. But a great walk and I found a nice sandwich shop and a cold beer during my trek. One thing I do not normally do is take Hotel tours but the Hotel has it's own boat for a nightly canal tour with on board coctails and the Captian narrates the trip. This is worth every euro and I would not hesitate to take it again, especially if romance were in the cards. On my day of departure the Hotel had transport ready for us and we were whisked reluctantly to the airport. If you are on a tight budget this may not be the place but I found it worth more that The Grand Amsterdam, currently a Sofitel, which has previosly been my Hotel of choice in Amsterdam. Stay here and get out and expore this beautiful city and meet the people. Remember take the small glass for beer after foamed and scraped. Have a great stay.
