{"text":"great hotel for a group I was recently in Dallas for a conference with a group which included several college students on a budget. We booked the Springhill Suites for the amenities it offered, such as the complimentary breakfast and free wireless in the rooms. We were very pleased with our stay and the location of the hotel. Our rooms were large with the extra suite area, so we were able to sleep 3 in a room comfortably. The rooms were clean and the beds quite comfortable (although I can't vouch for the sofa bed, since I didn't sleep on it). The hot breakfast was pretty standard, but a definite plus for the group in trying to save a few pennies. We liked the Texas shaped waffles! The hotel had karaoke the night we arrived, and it seemed like everyone was having fun, but it ended before we could get downstairs to it. The hotel lobby is quite small, but adequate, and the hotel staff were helpful for the most part. I did have problems after I returned home with a hotel clerk in trying to get a copy of my receipt showing my paid bill, but she eventually helped me. We relied upon the conference shuttle and the DART station nearby for transportation, so it was pretty convenient to get wherever we wanted to go. We also liked being able to walk to all the restaurants in the West End at night. There were many to choose from, and the students thought the location of our hotel was great. The Dallas Aquarium is practically at the back door of the hotel, and the JFK sites are close by, as well as restaurants like the House of Blues and Spaghetti Warehouse. Others at the conference who were staying in the hotels by the interstate were jealous of all the restaurants and attractions that were in walking distance of our hotel! Overall, it was a good experience and a great value for a group.
