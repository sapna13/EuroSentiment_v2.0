{"text":"Relaxing Beach Stay This hotel is located in Seminyak, which is north of Kuta. This is a good thing. The beach is less crowded with less hawkers. There is still plenty of sand to squeeze between your toes.The hotel itself has a good location. Many bars, restaurants, and shops are within walking distance. Many more are within a short cab ride (less than $3). It is also close enough to walk down the beach to the beach front cafes in Legin. It is also secluded enough that once you are at the resort, you don't here or think about all of the craziness that happens on the streets of Bali.We stayed in two different rooms during our week long stay. The rooms are large, comfortable bed and a nice balcony. Really the only downfall to the rooms are the bathrooms. The fixtures and finishing touches just don't measure up to the rest of the property. This isn't a deal breaker, it is just something to note. The Sofitel needs to throw some dollars at their bathroom.The rest of the hotel is quite nice. The staff is very friendly and helpful. There are two pools one of which has a very nice beach view. There are two restaurants and one bar that serves food. The poolside bar has excellent food and great sunset views.The hotel never felt crowded. You didn't have to fight for a chair at the pool during the day, but the place didn't feel empty either.There is no wireless internet access in the rooms but it is available in the lobby. There are two computers available for guests. All internet access costs $, but it is very reasonable.Bottled water is complimentary in the rooms.Overall, I would recommend this hotel.
