{"text":"Convenient: Yes. Good value: Questionable Even with a facelift inside, this is still fairly basic accommodation with a distinctly 1960s motel feel about it. The price is definitely not from the 1960s!The biggest selling point is the location - literally part of the terminal building! In fact, if you are flying American Airlines, their check-in desks are a few yards from the front door. The main airport parking, the taxi rank and the car-rental pick-ups are right outside.The biggest downside is also the location! Not a very scenic location, nothing to do and nowhere to go, unless you like airport food outlets and the cheesy hotel casino (a couple of rows of slots). We couldn't even see the runways! A flight change meant we unexpectedly had to spend two nights here, and without a rental car we would have been crawling up the walls with boredom!We did try the free rooftop Spa... two hot tubs and some sun loungers with a 10ft. non see-through fence around it. Surreal! With a view of nothing but the sky directly above we bathed to the sound and smell of jets taking off and landing!The rates are inflated to reflect the location. Anywhere else the rates would look like very poor value. The rooms were no better than I would expect from a basic, but clean out-of-town motel. The bathroom was clean and the linen was good quality. The TV was tiny and had a fairly limited range of channels.We had a late evening flight and asked about day rates. Personally, I think $125 for 9am-5pm is ridiculous! At least they put our cases into secure storage for no extra charge. We opted to save the money and sit in the terminal reading! ","annotations":[]}
