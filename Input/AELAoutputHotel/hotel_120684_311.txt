{"text":"Careful here...Read before you book! 7\/20\/06...Just got back on , read BEFORE you book! I compliment the Hotel on Staff and size of rooms...very nice. Our experience within the room is what made us check out early. The walls are truly PAPER thin....meaning, not only did you hear everything they did or said but the WORSE issue was you heard every time anyone flushed the toilet within 6 or so rooms. These are high-pressure units, so at 3AM...the noise is stunning! Cigarette smoke smell entered our room from the adjacent room (everytime they lit up)......I'm talking as though they were smoking in your room. In 30 + years of travel, this was possibly the poorest soundproofing we encountered....SO, I warn fellow travelers who want some quiet, to take this quite seriuosly. LAST..the Lanai's are shaped like a crouissant roll cut in the center (crescent)....there is a huge variance is width from one end to the other. You can BARELY get two chairs out there, must turn sideways to sit down...and if you NOT perfectly positioned on one end....cannot see the OCEAN you're paying extra for. BE SURE you know exactly where your room is located BEFORE paying your hard-earned $$$. This was a horrbile value in my estimation, and we really couldn't enjoy the pitiful patio to any extent......this is something we've always enjoyed in the past. We contacted management, they were very supportive and acknowledged thenoise issue, but not much can be done in when you're sold out.
