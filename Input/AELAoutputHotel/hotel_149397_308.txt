{"text":"Loved it - we'll be back! just returned on 04\/13\/07...loved the resort and we would definately go back. we were upset about the fire and the loss of the restaurants\/bars but once we got there you would have never known. we split each day between the beach and the pool and we were never bothered by ash or noise from the re-construction as others mentioned. the staff was extremely friendly. for those that experienced bad service, try rewarding good service with a few dollar bills - it goes a long way. by mid-week we had made friends with a great waitress Jenny at the buffet that welcomed us and had a table ready as soon as we walked in. we stopped checking in with the hostess and just went directly to her section. within minutes of sitting down we had a chilled bottle of champagne on our table and another one ready and waiting for when the first one was empty. she even brought out a birthday cake and had her fellow co-workers sing Happy Birthday to my father! All this because we were respectful to her and tipped her for her excellent service. the food was better than most other resorts, this was our 5th trip back to Punta Cana. the drinks were good and again if you take care of your bartenders, they take care of you. we had top shelf alcohol and we were not on the platinum club package. the beach is the best around by far. the rooms were spacious and clean. the a\/c could have been colder but it wasn't unbearable. the hot water was sometimes non-exsistant during peak showering times but the cool water feels good after spending the day in the sun. for those that were not happy about the lack of english speaking staff members - you are not in America anymore - you are in their country and should speak their language - just like when people come here to America we\/you expect them to speak english :) we were a group of 4 adults and 1 toddler and we had a great time and would definately go back! go open minded and you'll have a blast.
