{"text":"has become a HK classic I'm in HK very often on business and stay in a mid-range hotel (Bishop Lei, see entry in TripAdvisor) but this time a client paid for a couple of nights in the Shang. I used to stay there many years ago when, after the Asian crisis, rooms were about the same price as the Bishop Lei is now! The Island Shang always used to feel very brash and arriviste compared with the grandes dames of the Oriental and the Peninsular, but it's matured well and has become a real classic. The service, in particular, is off-the-scale attentive, practical, polite, and effective, as only the Hongkies and the Swiss deluxe hotels can pull off.The decor is dress to impress chinoiserie, like it or hate it, but it has scale and grandeur. All rooms are high floors (the middle of the building is offices) so even the Peak view (=rooms at the back) have great views. Nice bathrooms, not as high-tech as some super-5 star hotels, but big baths and plentiful toiletries including bath salts, a great touch. The rooms are big and comfortable, with big desks, and a kettle (hooray!). The minuses are that the internet is very expensive and rather idiosyncratic (had to re-log in every time I opened a new browser window), and the minibar is predictably outrageously priced.The pool was closed for a party one day, and closed for emergency cleaning the next (must have been quite the party!) but the Conrad's 25m pool is one minute's walk away and offered reciprocal usage. Room service was fast and good, and breakfast in the cafe was comprehensive, pleasing the highly cosmopolitan clientele (contrast the almost club-like concentration of middle-aged white men you'd find at breakfast in the Mandarin's Grill Room).But the main take-away is that this has matured into a really classy high-end hotel, with its own character. Paris Hilton becomes Judy Dench... well, not quite, but give it another quarter-century and it'll be there!
