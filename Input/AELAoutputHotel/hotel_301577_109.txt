{"text":"There are many better hotels in Singapore! We stayed at the Merchant Court with two friends for 10 nights in June 2007. Fortunately the large building site directly opposite of the hotel entrance was close to be finished. There is a new shopping center, yes they are still building the upper floors of the adjacent skyscraper, but that does not cause too many trouble.Our rooms were small, not very elegant but clean, bathroom was okay. The Hotel has an official four-star rating, the rooms are more three-star, after my opinion. You always get the impression, that the hotel owner wants to save money, if it is in the bathroom, where the faucet has a water-saver or the hair-dryer has a power-save-button which you have to keep pressed all the time during hair-drying. This is not the style of a four-star-hotel. But the owners are swiss, these guys always knew how to save money and to leave their customers with the feeling of being cheated.Breakfast service was extremely poor on our first morning, table was not cleaned, we got coffee instead of tea, there was no refill and so on. After we complained about that at the reception, service became much better the next days. Breakfast itself was okay but nothing more than you would expect in a four-star hotel.You have to pay for the internet-access, which is also quite poor for a four-star hotel, but you should remember that this is a Swiss\u2030?√\u2020tel, as I explained before.The only real positive thing about this hotel is the location directly opposite of newly renovated, stylish Clarke Quay. Chinatown can be reached by foot, also Boat Quay.To make it short: I would not recommend to stay at this hotel, for there are much better hotels in Singapore, even the other Swiss\u2030?√\u2020tel The Stamford is better, our friends stood there for additional five nights. For a high-class experience I would recommend the hotels at Marina Bay - The Oriental, The Pan Pacific and the Marina Mandarin.
