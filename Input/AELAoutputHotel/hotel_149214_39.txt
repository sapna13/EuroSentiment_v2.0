{"text":"A Mixed Experience December 30, 2006Just returned from 8 nights at the Punta Cana Resort. Overall a positive experience, but an odd one. What follows is feedback that I would have found helpful before picking this resort.Overall: the property is large and beautiful, reasonably well-cared for, a little shabby in places. It is quite laid-back and if you are looking to just collapse and do nothing in a warm undemanding enviornment, then it's a perfect choice.Activities: We did the 2 hour horseback ride which was great - a group of 9 guests are attended by 3 helpful and sweet guides, and we were taken all over the property. The horses are all well-cared for, responsive, and I felt safe, even for a first timer going at a pretty fast pace. Katia, who seems to be the manager ( or one of the managers) of the Ranch is very informative and fun and helpful. However, the activities office, where horseback riding, water activities, local tours outside the compound, bike rentals, golf cart rentals take place, is a difficult and hostile office. Next door to the ranch is a delightful petting zoo, with well-tended animals in a shady welcoming enviornment. Kids loved it, as did their parents.The main pool is delightful, clean and big and with a good vibe. And housekeeping is terrific - very thorough and friendly.Food: A real mix. The best restaurants are Yolla, a sensatonal grill by the Marina, La Chosa, also a grill right on the beach ( their grilled fish is superb ). Bamboo is pricey but fun and tasty and the best service of any of the restaurants. Mama Venezia also has delicious food but sketchy service. Anani feels like a bunch of kids are playing at running a fancy restaurant - disorganized, slow, and overcooked food. La Cana, the main buffet where most people do breakfast and dinner is mixed - main meat courses are quite good, desserts are showy but not so tasty, the fruit is bizarrely tasteless, inspite of it being a tropical location. The worst is a place called The Grill in the newer Toranga part of the resort. Openly hostile service, inetable food, they refused to wipe down the dirty table etc. etc. Downride mean.A few more cons: The air-conditioning in 2 of our 3 rooms was broken and incredibly loud - after repeated calls about it, they finally sent someone from mantenance to the villa at 9:30p when the kids were asleep. Just bizarre. The internet service is ancient and constantly breaking down - if that's important to you, don't come here, it worked maybe 5% of the time. And lastly, the service, or rather the mood of the employees, is all over the map. Particularly in some places, like the Sundry Store and at the Front Desk, it is actively hostile, with the employees basically baiting the shoppers, assuming they don't speak any Spanish.Overall: it's got alot to recommend it but there is a feeling that the money could be better used elsewhere. It's not wildly expensive but it's hardly a bargain either. What I have taken away from the experience is that I would rather spend the same bucks at a nicer place and stay a few less days. Hope this helps!
