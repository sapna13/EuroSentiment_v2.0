{"text":"Okay, but not great... We spent 6 days at the Water Club and had an alright time. The staff is very helpful and the hotel was clean and nice in a very minimalist way that we appreciated. We really liked our room and loved the option of moving up to the roof top pool\/lounge area when it got too windy for the beach (which it did...4 out of 6 days).We are a mid 20s couple and we left for vacation expecting to have a great time...We did like the beach, the weather, our room, and the cute coffee shop\/bakery down the street. But generally, we were very disspointed by the surrounding area. Yes, you can get a great meal at El San Juan down the street (we went to Coco for Caribbean cuisine) BUT it will cost you. Pretty much every place you will find to eat is in a hotel. You will basically spend your entire vacation in various hotels eating, or on the beach.The area is definitely a bit seedy...we are from Philly and are used to a bit of ghetto flavor, but I have to admit, there were several times that I felt unsafe.If you are looking for a long weekend get away and you WANT to eat and sit on the beach and don't care about doing much else, this place is great. We were there for a bit too long and by the time we were leaving we were more than ready to go home. I would reccomend having this place be your arrival and departure hotel on your way to and from Fajardo and Culebra. Staying at the Water Club for your whole vacation is rather uneventful. If the weather isn't great you really will have nothing to do other than visit the other hotels along the strip or sit at the roof top bar.As a side note, we had a great experience with Little Shogun, the sushi bar at Wet. We ate there twice...it was delicious and very reasonably priced.All in all, the Water Club is nice. I would stay there for a quick get away, but not for a major vacation.
