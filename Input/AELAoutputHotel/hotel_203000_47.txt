{"text":"Just OK - but good location The Alba hotel was one of 4 hotels we stayed in on our 2 week trip to Italy. It was just ok.To begin, our room was on the first floor, right by the stair well, so the noise of fellow travelers woke me several times our first night (Wednesday). Our shower door was also broken and leaked water all over the bathroom floor. Thursday morning I asked the staff at the hotel if they could switch our room (prior to the weekend rush) and they would not accomodate us, nor offer any sort of apology. We even had VIP in our booking because our travel agent friend who booked our room there has stayed there before, and booked many other travelers there.While the capuccino was delicious the breakfast was very average. The breads etc. didn't even taste freshly baked. Honestly, the two things mentioned above wouldn't have mattered so much if the staff had been friendly. The only member of the front desk that was accomdating was they young man (I forget his name). The two women at the desk were very rude, and not helpful. One morning we had to take a bus to the airport to pick up a rental car, and the woman at the front desk didn't even know where the bus station was- or wouldn't tell us. We had to ask someone in a coffee shop nearby! When we came back to the hotel on our first night there to tell the desk about our shower door the older gentleman (who didn't speak english) handed my husband a mop and bucket as if he expected us to mop the water off the floor!The good thing about this hotel was its location, price, and the cleanliness of the rooms. I don't think I would stay there again, but if you are looking for a central hotel in Florence that doesn't cost a lot of money (comparitively speaking), and you are willing to deal with some quirks, this hotel is an option.
