{"text":"One of the top business hotels in the world... Had two nights here in late November, third stay in the last three years at this property, and it remains one of my favorite places in Singapore, and one of my top business hotels in the world.Check-in is always crisp, even at 1am. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in both the Grand Wing and the Terraces Wing. Grand Wing is all two-room (living room\/bedroom) Grand Rooms, which are similar to the Dusit Thani in Bangkok, except very, very clean\/modern. Lot of blonde wood and stainless steel. This trip was in Terraces Wing, which is regular single rooms. The room has a large wall-mounted LG flatscreen (I think the Grand Wing rooms are Bang  Olufsen). Bed is in the new Hyatt bedding, which is really nice. Hardwood floors with carpet, marble in the desk area by the window and the bathroom. Desk area is spacious, and is tucked in by the window, with a very nice array of power and plugs and stuff, and large desk surface. Bathroom has separate tub\/shower, and has generic toiletries. The shower has a large √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªain√à√\u2020\u2022?style showerhead in the ceiling. Very clean.The Club lounge in Terraces Wing is not as large as the one in the Grand Wing, but the folks there were just as friendly, helpful and crisp as over there. This is one place where the Hyatt stands-out√à√\u2020\u2022?their people are really well-trained. Breakfast has a very broad spread, and eggs can be cooked to order. Evenings they have drinks and light munchies. Concierge services were well executed√à√\u2020\u2022?I needed help with ground transit in both KL and Bangkok, and they arranged both for me within minutes.Ate at Pete√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Place, an Italian restaurant in the basement; very good, and having an Italian waiter (!) made choosing something different great fun. Have eaten before in Mezza9, and the food was good. Straits Kitchen, their main dining room, is not only an outstanding place compared to other Hyatts, but one of the better places in Singapore. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe taken employees and guests here, and it never ceases to impress them. The location here is a 50:50 proposition. The good news is that it sits at the intersection of Scotts and Orchard, in the middle of some of the best shopping anywhere in the world. Marriott next door, Sheraton Towers down the street, Hilton and Hard Rock around the corner. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not here for shopping, though, it is NOT in either of the business districts.It does sit within 200 feet of the Orchard Road MRT station, which is a quick, clean and safe subway shot to either downtown, Raffles City, or Bugis areas. Taxi rank is as good as any in Singapore. Once the new circle line is completed to Suntec, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be helpful. I stay here because it's a terrific hotel, and when downtown\/Suntec\/Marina hotel rates get outrageous (more and more common), this is a reasonably priced refuge.I would, and have, stayed here on my own money. Another terrific stay here, and I will be looking forward to my next visit.
