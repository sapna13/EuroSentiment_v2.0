{"text":"Still Having panic attacks about the room....ARRGGGHHHHH Oh Sweet Lord where do I start...Normally I'm pretty good with choosing hotels (because of trip advisor ;-) ) However I made the mistake of letting someone else take control this time....The bar reception on arrival was fine...Loud music...Party atmosphere..What we were in Amsterdam for (Only 2 nights thank God!!!) Well I'm not afraid to admit that upon entering our room I did actually shed a tear.We had arrived in what looked like a crime scene...Of which a hooker had been murdered in...The room was dark purple and black...The '4' poster bed had ripped fur leopard print rags hanging from it. When I say ripped I mean they had been pulled from the rungs that had originally held them in place. The '4' poster bed's edges were covered in what can only be described as rough carpet. On the wall a picture greeted us...One of a woman topless and electric wires attached to her breasts...I turn the picture round as not to look at it and found it was covering a 'Punch hole' in the wall...Complete with blood stained edges.The bathroom was a shoe cupboard with a broken washbasin and wires hanging down over the shower unit...(Free electric shocks for one and all!)Needless to say we went to reception and were greeted by a man who had the attitude of a rabid dog...No we were told...They were fully booked and no other room was available. Seeing as we had paid cash as soon as we arrived and were with a group....We had to Stay... I would only ever recommend this hotel to my worst enemy...It's grotty, Smelly, rude staff, The rest of our friends rooms were equally disturbing...With one of them staying in a room that was just as dirty but with the theme of 'lets see how many plugs we can put on the walls' My other friends were staying in a room with painted faces on the wall and a balcony door that did not shut!We paid 110Euros per night for this room, A joke...I have been to Amsterdam 9 times and have always stayed in equal or if not cheaper places and have never come across such a Sh*thole of a hotel!The Club downstairs is good and fun but seriously spend your Euros elsewhere!!!!!!
