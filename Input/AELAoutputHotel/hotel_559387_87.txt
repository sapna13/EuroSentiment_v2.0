{"text":"Love affair at the Hilton After reading several bad reviews, I was a little sceptic I must admit. I am a spoiled traveler, and always stay at top class hotels. The Hilton Diagonal Mar was great! A really, really nice guy at reception made sure we felt very welcome, and the room was gorgeous, big bath and bright room with a huge minibar and lots of amenities. We had sea view and windows in the bathroom which was great:) Really comfy bed, and staff always very helpful. The pool is not that big, but works out just fine, it all looks really good. Breakfast is good and very attentive staff. Next dood there is a shopping mall and some restaurants, and just two minutes away is the metro that takes you to the city center. NO problem at all! the only drawback of staying a little out of the center is getting a taxi home at night..I always got a private car though..it took too long for the taxis to become avaliable:)It's close to the beach, just three minute walk and the area is really nice. The place is kind of the new business center in barcelona, so it's expanding all the time. No construction work anymore, so no problem there.If you prefer to stay closer to the city center, yet close to the beach, hilton diagonal mar might be a little out for you, but for us it was great, we didn't mind spending a little more time on transport. The location is the drawback-the hotel is great!I would def. go back! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":216,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":212}]}
