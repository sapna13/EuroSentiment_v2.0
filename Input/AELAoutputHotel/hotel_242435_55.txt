{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location! We booked this hotel through Pleasant Hawaiian- which was a TERRIBLE experience and I highly recommend you AVOID the company entirely- but that's another story.Pleasant Hawaiian pulled a bait-and-switch and promised us a room level that they did not deliver. Fortunately, the staff at the Hyatt Regency was SO kind and accommodating that they gave us a complimentary upgrade simply because we asked. The room they offered us as an upgrade was beautiful, with a fantastic view of the ocean.Clearly they have paid attention to some of the negative points people have mentioned previously- they had free coffee, refrigerator, irons, hair dryers, etc. in our room. They had every amenity one would expect, including free valet parking (which is an absolute must in a place like Waikiki!).The hotel is VERY large and definitely not your quiet, romantic getaway on the beach kind of place...but if you enjoy being in the center of everything, just steps away from the beach in a beautiful setting- this is a wonderful hotel!The staff was AMAZING- every single person we dealt with was helpful, professional and very, very kind. The room was clean and comfortable and nicely decorated with every amenity necessary. The location is fantastic- right on the beach, within walking distance to every kind of shop, restaurant and close to everything. The only cons would be that the hotel is very large, the street outside can be noisy at night- but we were so tired, we hardly noticed! And the shops and restaurants on site are predictably expensive (but very good!). Overall, we loved this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes to be in the center of everything and doesn't mind the hustle and bustle of the big city! It's no secluded tropical hideaway, but everything you could want or need is right on site!
