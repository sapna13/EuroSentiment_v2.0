{"text":"Great Holiday We traveled to Dreams for the first week in September. Having been to many resorts over the last 4 years, I feel comfortable recommending this resort to friends and family. First off, all my travels to the Caribbean have been either Cuba or Dominican Republic. This was my first summer time get away down south. I find that most of the poor reviews are by those who constantly look for things to quantify the value of their trip. I'm sorry but if a bumpy ride to the hotel made your vacation miserable, please just stay home. If you feel wronged because god forbid you did not get immediate service at the snap of your fingers, perhaps you should just stay at work.What made this a great vacation? 1. Atmosphere - It was a mature resort, large and clean yet a very intimate atmosphere with the tropical vegitation. I have been to the Majestic Colonial but i much prefer the village feel of a resort vs. the palatial feel.2. Staff  People - The staff were happy and friendly. This means happy vacationers. We met so many happy relaxed vacationers. Being gay and on vacation with my partner, we never once felt unwelcome. We dined and partied with many new friends from all over the world. 3. Rendzvous Bar - This was more entertaining than the shows! Plus you could see the shows from up top, Balcony like style. You could get a beer in a bottle. MGD, BUD, Presidente, all sorts - in the bottle which was a nice touch.4. The food was fine. Not 5* everyday but never was it gross. I found the portion size at the al a carte to be sufficient. (It's actually a perfectly healthy serving). Things to be aware of:Beach - My boyfriend got smacked down by a wave and cut his foot on the coral. Yes there are signs. How often do you get to swim in hurricane created waves though? Pool Bar - Drinks are strong.
