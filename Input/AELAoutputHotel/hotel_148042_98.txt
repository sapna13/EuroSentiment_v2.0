{"text":"Great vacation!!!! We recently cam back from a vacation at the Ritz that was absolutely fabulous! I cannot remember being so relaxed for a long time. We stayed in a club floor room, which was WELL worth it! The concierge staff on the club floor are excellent--very friendly, accomodating and attentive--they were truly amazing. And the food that is offered in the club is wonderful, there was always a plentiful display of all sorts of great meals up there and the wine and drinks flowed freely all evening. It was a great place to grab some peaceful time out of the sun or do work on the computer (free wifi). Kudos to the Ritz on a club lounge that is well staffed and well done.The weather while we were in Puerto Rico was perfect. We lucked out as the day we left it was rainy...but we had 7 days of pure sunshine, usually no clouds in the sky and a wonderful ocean breeze on the beach. The staff at the pool and beach were very helpful in setting up chairs and umbrellas wherever you wished when you asked. The first day I just asked for towels and found my own seats but I quickly caught on that you need to ask to have them set up your chairs and then you get vip treatment. The pool wasnt heated and could be quite cool in the am, but heated up by afternoon and was very refreshing. The beach here is BEAUTIFUL--I had never been and was very impressed with the fine white sand and cleanliness and the beautiful waves. One of the best assets of the entire hotel is BLT Steak--this restaurant is SUPERB! WE ate here 4 times in one week and had fabulous meals every time! They have a great bar area--the service was immpeccable and the food fantastic. Cannot recommend it enough.Also, this hotel is within walking distance of other hotels that also have casinos and restaurants (el san juan and intercontinental are 5 minute walk) and some other little restaurants that are casual...so there are options to explore. It is also an easy cabride into Old San Juan for dinner or sightseeing (20 minutes)...dont miss the forts!The fact that this hotel is so close to the airport is a plus as far as I am concerned. You cannot hear the planes from inside the hotel at all and on the beach once in awhile you hear a plane but not often--there is such a breeze and the waves are so high that it drowns it out. But being able to get to the hotel in 5 minutes and a 13$ cab ride is great! Especially when you are trying to get to the airport the day of departure...you dont have to leave an hour before, you know.My only complaint is with the housekeeping service. Sometimes it was great and sometimes terrible, and I just expect more from a Ritz Carlton. One day they just skipped our room altogether even though we had not been in the room all day--we called and they still didnt come for a long time. The turndown service was also very inconsistent in terms of time and what they would actually do. We had to call another night because they skipped turndown and we needed towels and it still took them a half hour to get towels to us. There is no button on the phone for housekeeping which struck me as strange--you have to go through guest services so I dont know if the chain of communication is very good. Anyway, this is the only area I think they need to work on.So, if you want a peaceful, easy vacation that has an island feel but is easy to get to and you dont need a passport or foreign money...this is a great option!! Cant wait to go back.
