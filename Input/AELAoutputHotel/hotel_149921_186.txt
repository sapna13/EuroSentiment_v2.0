{"text":"Not Happy with the Caribe Hilton or San Juan We just returned from San Juan, stayed at the Caribe Hilton, June 2nd thru June 9th. Had to change rooms 4 times requested the Hilton Towers and they put us in the main building it was very old and and dirty tub was moldy and there were holes in the walls and ceiling. Asked to be moved 2nd day, we were moved to the towers 12th floor it was nice much better room and an excellent view. Got up next morning to find check out papers from the room when I called front desk they said that the room was booked and we would have to move. We were moved to the 5th floor construction all day and no view, went down to see manager and he could not understand why the moved us but said he would put us in nice room. Finally in nice room but each time we were given a room we had to wait till 6pm to get in the room. My husband said good thing we had suitcases with wheels cause he said they got warn out from moving. The showers were nice BUT in every room there was mold on the floor they could use some clorox to clean them. I didnot find the people in San Juan to be friendly, everyone spoke Spanish, it is very expensive. All the fees they add to your room is crazy, plus to get a cab anywhere it was $15 each way and they tell you its not safe to walk. I did not find the beach to be very nice, I did think the pool was nice. If you eat breakfast in the restaurant it is over priced and the service is very bad. I feel this Hotel is more for business travelers and they are more receptive to people coming for conferences. I guess all in all I will not go back to the Caribe Hilton. We actually tried to book a cruise out of San Juan the first Sunday we were there but the change in the airline ticket would have cost us another $1,000 so we decided to stay and make the best of it. There is no place like the Radisson in Aruba, way way better....
