{"text":"Hard Rock - great! We recently returned from Bali and had 5 nights at Hard Rock Hotel with our 15yr daughter\/12yr old son. We had a Superior room with 2 x king size beds. Basically a nice hotel room, not a lot of room but did the job, couldn't have spent much longer in it though. However, pool more than made up for it. Best pool we have ever seen anywhere, kids had a ball. Never had a problem getting a lounge, one day we rented a cabana for $14 (hotel dicount voucher), normally about $20. This was fantastic, had 2 day beds, ceiling fan, phone (for ordering meals\/drinks), lovely relaxing day, Need to book this few days in advance though and wish we had booked one for other days even if we weren't there the whole time. Towels for pool are provided Great location if Kuta is your thing, very close to shops and restaurants, used laundry in Poppies Lane, hotel laundry expensive. Breakfast was magnificent, plenty of variety and never had to wait for a table despite going different times each day. Reception Manager and staff were fantastic and organised transfers to our villa after 5nights and gave us late checkout so we could watch AFL Grand Final on our last day there. Got invited one night to cocktail party, was free drinks and lovely nibblies for an hour - took full advantage of that! Put kids to bed one night after dinner and came back down to listen to band  have more drinks, great band each night but drinks pricey. We bought lunch couple of times from the bakery, great salad rolls for about $3-$4, only needed half each  we took them to pool with us.Rooms were cleaned daily and bottles of water supplied, once we explained we had 4 people, not 2, we then got 4 towels replenished each day. Didn't use the spa facilities, bit pricey compared to out on the street. We did Waterbom from here (walking distance) and Bali Baik Ride so had 2 full days out. Would we stay again? - only if it moved to different location LOL. Kuta way too busy for us but loved the hotel and facilities.
