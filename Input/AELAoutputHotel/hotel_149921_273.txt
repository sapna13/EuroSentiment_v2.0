{"text":"Had a great time My husband and I stayed at the Caribe Hilton August 23 √à√\u2020\u2022?August 28 and we had a wonderful experience from the time we stepped out of the cab until we left. We were immediately greeted by the bellman and the front desk staff was courteous and helpful. We were upgraded to a Lagoon Villa room. The room had a small balcony (no room for chairs) with a nice view of the lagoon and the ocean. It was brand new, clean, had a comfortable bed and very nice bathroom. On Saturday morning there was noise from the air traffic at the little airport nearby-but it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bad. It was a little bit of a walk to get to from the main hotel, but we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind. The pool and hot tub near the Lagoon Villas and was a great alternative for when we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel like walking to the main pool. This pool was quiet and we usually had it to ourselves. The Villas also had their own front desk which we used to check-out, call cabs, ask questions etc. Every hotel staff person we came in contact with was friendly and courteous-even passing in the halls people would say hello and good morning. We ate lunch at the pool grill, breakfast at Palmera√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and had drinks at the lobby bar  pool bar. The food prices were expensive-but it is expected-any hotel has expensive restaurants. The lobby bar didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem to have enough help some nights to wait the tables, so we usually ended up ordering directly at the bar. The drinks were good and fairly priced.The main pool was very nice. It was crowded on Sunday, along with the lagoon. Most days we opted to sit in chairs that were on the ocean (on the sidewalk leading to the fish pier). The fish pier was great; it was neat to be able to see so many fish so close without snorkeling. We were not overcharged for anything. The resort fee of $20 was a little annoying-but since we had such a great experience and paid 1% sales tax the whole time we were in PR, I got over it. The hotel is in a great location, we walked to Old San Juan one day, took the bus most other days. We also walked over to Condado a number of times. Being New Yorker's - we felt the cabs were expensive so we only took them at night.I was nervous because I had read the negative reviews on this site before we left. We had no problems whatsoever. We would recommend staying here and would stay again in the future.
