{"text":"Beautiful hotel, but disappointed with management We stayed at the Langham in June 2006. It was part of a trip booked by a children's wish organization, as one of our three children is in remission from cancer. Her wish involved a shopping spree and show in Boston, and the wish organization booked the Langham for our weekend. The location was great. The public spaces in the hotel are beautiful. The suite was nice. We ate brunch in the hotel and enjoyed excellent service and good food. Our complaint stems from our initial arrival at the hotel. We are two adults and three children. We were told by the wish organization to identify ourselves as the wish family to ensure special treatment. Well, we felt we received sub-par treatment on our arrival and our wish child felt badly, as she was old enough to notice.Our room was a two-story\/family suite. Downstairs was a sleep sofa\/sitting area and half bath. Upstairs was the king-size bed and full bath. We needed a cot for our third child, and called the desk to request one, although they should have known we would need one. We went out to dinner, and returned to the hotel to change for the show. Still no cot. We called the desk again, and left for the show. When we returned at 11:00 p.m., there still wasn't a cot. We called down again, frustrated, as we had three tired children. Meanwhile, we opened the sofa bed and not only was it unmade, it was littered with potato chip crumbs. Needless to say, we were very upset and called down again. Finally, the night head of housekeeping came up with a cot and clean sheets for the sofa bed. While he was very apologetic, we feel the hotel dropped the ball. We were not expecting special treatment, but we were appalled that our needs were so blatantly overlooked considering the organization that booked us and the reason we were there. We hesitated complaining to management, as we did not pay for the room and felt awkward. However, when we returned home, we filled out the hotel review form with our experience and checked off the section that asked a manager to call us. No one ever did. Maybe it was just a bad night, but an acknowledgement and apology would have gone a long way. While our child's wish weekend was not ruined, we feel management dropped the ball during a very difficult time of our lives.
