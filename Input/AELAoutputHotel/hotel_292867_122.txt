{"text":"Sorry, I dont speak Italian. We spent in this hotel barely 2 days of weekend, taking voluntarily temporary assingement form our Occidental Flamenco Hotel due to overbooking. And theses 2 days reassured us how lucky we were choosing Occidental originally.The only good thing was a room. Clean spacious and bright, we ended up in Junior suite what was very comfortable having 2 children with us. No problems with any bugs\/mosquitoes reported here by others. AC working great, 2 decent bathrooms etc.Main problem was food. Can only say about main buffet and beach restaurant. After spending prior several days in Occidental Flamenco, we found food in Caribe Princess mediocre. To make it worse, they have serious problem with bugs and flies in buffet area. Literally dozens of flies walking over tables, sometimes we felt like eating @ barn.On top of it, the waiters there are... well, problematic.. Dont count on any decent service in buffet, be prepared to serve yourselves with drinks, otherwise you could end up dehydrated. Waiting half an hour for drinks , coffee or anything is a norm, not an exception.The beach area was OK. Had to reserve the palatas very early in the morning. Its also very crampy, the lounges are so close each other its sometimes hard to find a way between them.And, till we came in, had no idea it is so heavily italian oriented hotel. Kinda funny being greeted Ciao, not Ola by most. Did not bothered us at all.After spending 2 days in Caribe Princess, we could only truly appreciate the service we received in Occidental Flamenco, where we enjoyed far superior quality and overall satisfaction.
