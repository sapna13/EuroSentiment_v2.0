{"text":"Not what we have expected We booked our vacation through Travelocity where this resort is rated 4 stars. Let's just say that the resort is more like 2 stars. The only good thing about this resort is the beach. Other than that, it's nothing to brag about. We are not picky travelers, however, the room needed an extreme makeover. Loose outlets where wires are exposed, tub  shower fixtures loose, dirty tub with dead bugs in it and toilet which works on its own schedule. We asked for a queen size bed but got 2 double beds. One of the mattresses and sheets had an awful smell to a point that we threw the mattress out into the hallway. One day, the maid just decided to let herself in without even knocking!?!?!? The staff is not very friendly. During mealtime, you would not get a glass of water or coffee until you were finished eating. Not very attentive. The gourmet restaurants are a joke and are only opened one at a time! We waited 45 minutes for our appetizers! The resort has one of the hip night clubs in the area. When we were there several famous DJs were performing so all of their groupies came along and were extremely rude and ignorant. They would scream in the middle of the night walking back to their rooms drunk, etc. If this is your thing, you'll have fun. But if you are going with a family in hopes to relax and enjoy yourselves, this is not the place to be. Try the Gran Bahia Principe where we stayed last year and had a WONDERFUL time. Also, beware of the vendors (Allegro) on the hotel's property who will try to sell you an excursion and then a timeshare\/club membership for $21,000.00. The main buffet was OK for breakfast but horrible for dinner. The beachside buffet had a good variety of food and we found it pleasing. The only good thing about this resort was the beach.
