{"text":"very relaxing I was very impressed with the whole vacation from the very begining. After some of the reviews I read I was a little upset after I booked the vacation. As soon as I left my home everything went smooth, the airport, the transfer to the hotel, the check in, ect..... not one complaint. We did have to wait 1 hour for our room, but were allowed to use the facilites. But that one hour is NOT a complaint. The one thing I was a little schocked about was the 10.00$ tax(entrance fee) to the island. It was no big deal paying it, but I did not know about it. EXPEDIA never mentioned that to me. The food was good. There is enought to pick from if you do not like everything. The Italian was very good. The pools are fabulous. Always clean.  The beach is one of the best I have ever encountered. The water was crystal clear and the sand was soft. The rooms are clean, and plenty of space. The only thing that I could complain about (not a big one) is that the bath rooms need to be updated. They are very clean, fresh towels every day, but some areas of the shower were rusty, and the the tile needed grouting. Now I can live with all of that. To me that is not really a complaint, just a suggestion to fix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The staff were very friendly and helpful. I was very impressed with the security. At night there was security guards walking all over. I was there with my sister and my 2 girls (4 women) so it made me feel very safe to know the security guards were there. I will go back there with my children, they had a blast. I got to relax and read. It is nice that the kids can get there own food and drink. I did not have to wait on them at all!!!!!! I felt safe enough to let them go to the room or other areas by them selves. It is a place I will definetly go back to. ","annotations":[]}
