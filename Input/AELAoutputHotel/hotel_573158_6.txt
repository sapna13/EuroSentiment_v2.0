{"text":"reasonably priced hotel away from touristy areas Just completed a 2 week stay at this hotel Nov\/Dec.Contacted directly with hotel manager months ago via e-mail for a little under US$90\/day for a harbor suite (20th Fl) with partial harbor view (partly blocked by tall building in front). Picked this location (Western District) because have seen this hotel previous year and also very familiar with this area in HK. And thought price was extremely reasonable for its value and not looking for 5 stars hotel which can cost several hundred US per night and not really planned on spending a whole lot of time inside the room anyway.Before I start, lets preface for anyone who is considering this hotel, location can be a challenge or wont be a challenge depending on how one views it. For me, it is not. Being able to speak Cantonese obviously is a plus but not entirely necessary since I've seen plenty of Caucasians in and out of this hotel and staff and concierge do speak enough English to guide you. As far as convenience to transportation I thought it is not a problem at all. Tram station eastward to Sheung Wan (1st MTR station) is few steps across the street on Des Voeux Rd and take only 5-10 minutes to MTR subway. And trams run frequently towards pretty much the entire north side of HK island. Taxi is also available either ask hotel staff or wave one down on the street and cost is relatively cheap to get to Central for example. But I've used exclusively the Tram (HK$2 each ride) to get most part of northern HK Island since I wasn't in a hurry and used MTR subway if I need to go fast or access other part of HK.Arriving from airport to hotel I used Airport Express train which cost $160 for 2 on a promotion (25 minutes to Central below IFC and just few steps to taxi station) then about another HK$25 cab ride with all luggages to hotel. Have considered using either A-10\/A-12 bus but to save less than HK$100 with all luggages it wasnt worth it. (But heard that bus ride would give a good view along the way towards HK Island during that one hour ride).Meals: didnt use any in the hotel and checked out their breakfast buffet (under $60) and it was standard Western fare, not huge spread. I prefer to explore the neighborhood which has plenty of choice for local cuisines of all kinds and very inexpensive but good. For westerners, that maybe a challenge since most of these places don't have English menus or English speaking staff. However, a short $2 tram ride will bring you to Central where there are plenty of choices (Starbucks, MacDonalds, Fairwoods, most Western hotels etc) with more familiar cuisines available as well as fancy ones that can be found in IFC, Pacific Places etc. or across the harbor in Ocean Terminal, Nathan Rds areas hotels etc.Beds: opinions differed here depending on person. Yes the bed was more firm than many hotels in the US but I didn't find it to be uncomfortable. The room was adequate in size for HK standard with bedroom and sitting room partitioned off. TV is in the living room. Shower was a cubicle (spaced age) design kind of like in a cruise ship. Again, not looking for 5 stars luxury here.Internet was available on 3 rd Fl where breakfast buffet was. Rate at HK$25\/hour or $45\/3 hours. Staff are quite helpful and knowledgeble if asked.Elevators (3) are a little small especially have many luggages to carry or during check in\/out time. Otherwise no problem there most of the time.Neighborhood is on the older side of HK and can be quite charming if one is looking for what HK used to look like and access in and out that area to other part of HK is really not a big problem.
