{"text":"Ok, I guess I booked this hotel and in general, was satisfied. I wasn't over the moon - I cannot say that it's one of the best 5* hotels I've stayed in ... because it wasn't! The room was small (and I'm from the UK and don't expect massive rooms when I go abroad). I've stayed in 4* hotels in the UK which have bigger sized room than the one I was given at the Barbizon.However, size aside, the room was clean and there was an ample supply of complimentary toiletries (including file, sponge, razor, toothbrush, shampoo, conditioner and the list goes on). The hotel was very secure - you needed to use your swipe card to activate the lift. Just another point to remember - I had booked for 3 nights, but the guy at reception was new and only activated my swipe card for 2 nights. Thankfully I noticed this before we left the desk to go to our room. Otherwise - I'm sure there would have been problems so make sure you take 2 copies of your booking print out.As far as location goes - it's great! It's right in front of Centraal Station (look slightly to the left as you walk out). The Red Light District is just behind (far enough so you don't hear the crowd at night) and Daam Square is a 10 minute walk away. However, I was given a room over looking the main road on the second floor. Whilst the view was great - the traffic noise wasn't! They don't have sound proofed windows so make sure you ask for a room that's high up! In summary - this hotel was not what I expect from a 5* standard. Location was superb and the room exceptionally clean. The hotel has some original features too from its ancient times as a palace. However, the traffic noise was a big issue for me. As I was there for only 3 nights and generally very tired after walking all day - I could put up with it. However, I don't think this hotel will be my first choice if I were to visit Amsterdam again.
