{"text":"Luxury, courtesy and the best hotel I've ever visited. My friend and I stayed here for 11 nights in a twin room. It was small but beautifully furnished and the staff could not have been more helpful and efficient. From the moment we walked into the Reception area we were treated like honoured guests, nothing was too much trouble for the staff. From the lift ladies to the pool attendants, they were a delight. Halfway through our trip, on a public holiday, my friend became ill and needed the attention of a doctor and an injection. The hotel arranged all this for us and we had an english-speaking doctor at our room within 2 hours. The facilities at the hotel were wonderful, the roof-top pool was perfect after a long day's shopping and the restaurant breakfasts were fantastic. The location of the hotel was great too. We had been to Hong Kong before and knew that the MTR (like the Tube or the Metro) was clean, easy to navigate and wonderfully convenient - the station for the MTR is at the bottom of the shopping mall which ajoins the hotel. So you can get off the plane, on to the train and go to your hotel within an hour. The mall was open late (shops in HK often don't open until around 10am but stay open till about 11pm) and the food courts there were fantastic. The concierge was also very helpful with hints on good restaurants to visit and information about opening hours and travel choices.We saved up for our trip for years and we did worry that our expectations would be too high for any holiday to live up to. The Langham hotel exceeded all of them, from the DVD player and the complimentary water, to the delicious room service burgers when we got hungry in the middle of the night, to the doormen who translated for us with the taxi drivers. I plan to return to HK in a couple of years, I'll be staying here again. (In fact, I've stayed at another Langham - Auckland - since and it is just as delightful.)
