{"text":"Nice hotel, a few issues We spent four nights at this hotel. We chose it on the basis of all the great reviews on TripAdvisor - I've found this to be a reliable way to choose hotels around Europe.The Plaza Tour Eiffel is well-positioned, very smart, and clean. The bedrooms are comfortable, well designed, modern, and the plasma screen TV was great. The staff were mostly fine (not outstanding) except on the first night. We arrived pretty late after a long journey. I checked the menu - room service until 2.30am. So I called down as it was around midnight. The reply I got was: If you want a drink, you'll have to come down here and get it - I'm not coming up to the rooms. To me this is unacceptable. If there was some legitimate reason that room service was not available that night, an apology for this, and a suggestion that i collect something from downstairs myself would have been no problem. The other issue was that our room was like a sauna. The hotel staff tried to fix this when we brought this to their attention. It was not fixed so we lived with it for the whole stay. Despite it being January, we had to sleep with the windows wide open which makes it very noisy in the middle of Paris! Overall I was disappointed (and insulted!) compared with many great stays at other hotels across Europe and the USA. I would personally not stay here again - especially given the pretty high price we paid ~210 Euros per night.
