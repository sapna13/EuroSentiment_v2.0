{"text":"it deserves its great reputation My wife, her sister, husband and I stayed at Jurys for four nights from 15th November 2006We booked the hotel solely because it was the top rated hotel in Boston on this site. We booked using a website called travelax which compares the prices on lots of different sites. It saved us √ä√£¬¢140 over Jurys own site which promises its prices cannot be bettered.I have stayed in hotels all over the world and can honestly say that this was as good as any I have stayed in. The hotel has all the amenities you could want (except maybe a pool). The rooms maybe not the biggest but you would have to be very fussy to complain about the size. The beds were extremely comfortable and all rooms had a good hairdryer and an iron and ironing board. They also had a free safety deposit box. But what set this hotel apart from the others I have stayed at was the staff, we checked in with Kimberley she was polite and certainly made no difference because of the way I had booked my room. She was genuinely friendly and made a point of saying hello when ever she met my wife or me. But the person who really made our stay was Richard the Concierge he was knowledgeable, friendly and patient. He made all of our restaurant reservations and even phoned around various shoe shops to try and find the Heelys for my daughters. We went to the Cheers Bar and they DIDN√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©? know my name but when we got back to Jurys the waitress in the bar said how was your day Mr Green that said it all to me. . To sum up this is a great hotel made even better by the staff. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":194,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":188}]}
