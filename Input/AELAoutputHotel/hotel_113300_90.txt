{"text":"Omni Staff is First Class I stayed at the Omni July 13-15 with a friend I hadn't seen in a year - we had a room with two queen beds. I had booked a superior room since we were also celebrating our birthdays. Our room was right across from the elevator, which I wasn't thrilled about, but didn't want to change. The room size was nice, the bathroom and its amenities was gorgeous. I am a Select Guest member, so we received cookies and soda upon check in which was a nice treat. Turndown service was great. The concierge, Randy, was very friendly and helpful, and I think because he made reservations for us at a particular restaurant, we each got a free glass of champagne upon our arrival at the restaurant - nice touch! We checked in on a Friday, and, as others have said, there was some outside noise on Saturday. But I guess you need to remember that the Omni is not in a newer building, thus, sound-proofing is not so modern there either. The location of the hotel was perfect for what we wanted - close to MoMA and shopping. After returning home from the trip, I was e-mailed a customer survey from Omni which I filled out, including my disappointment at having a room across from the elevator, and I received a personal phone call from the Manager of the hotel, which was above and beyond what I would have expected. The Omni Berkshire's customer service is superb, and I do plan to stay there again when I return to NYC. It is a hotel with great personal service, which I defnitely appreciate.
