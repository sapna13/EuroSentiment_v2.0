{"text":"The Dirty Dozen Plus One Brockville Ontario Canada First of all our flight was great (Air Transat) very friendly staff on the plane. It was our children's first time flying and they made them very relaxed.ROOMS-Our room wasn't ready when we arrived but we were there before the Check-in happened so we just got ready and took the kids to the ocean and the pool and stopped on the way for a drink. When we got our rooms they were all different, and very clean. We were all pleased with our rooms.POOL-It was beautiful, there was alot for everyone to do around the pool. They kept you going all day. Juan Carlo's and his animation team were totally awesome. Our hats go off to them, they work very hard to keep everyone happy and occuppied. They deserve a raise.OCEAN-It was breathe taking, we walked it everyday morning and afternoon. We got alot of walking in. It was very windy a couple of days and we had sand dunns instead of snow hills which didn't bother any of us.FOOD  BARSWe ate at 3 of the 4 restraunts. We enjoyed 2 out of the 3. The Japaness was excellent. The larger restraunt and smaller one had a great choice of food. Our kids enjoyed the Pizza and Chicken bar out by the pool. The kids thought it was great to go up and order just what they wanted and not have to pay for it. The swim up bar was a hit also.ENTERTAINMENT GROUP-We can't say enough about this team. They are hard working people and look like the enjoy what they do. That really made it fun for our kids on the trip.All in all we would recommend this resort to our friends and family and to those that read these reviews it is what you make of your holiday that makes it fun.
