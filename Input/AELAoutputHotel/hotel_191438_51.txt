{"text":"We're going back it was that good Stayed at Hilton for 4 nights just before Easter and very impressed. Arrived on overnight train from Paris and called in at 8.30am to drop off bags but were taken straight to our room by seriously friendly staff and were unpacked and on the streets by 9am. The hotel is an old Four Seasons and a cut above your normal Hilton. We travel a lot - business and pleasure, everything from basic bed and breakfasts to five star hotels - and the bedroom ticked all the boxes as did the public areas - don't really understand some of the more lukewarm comments about this place! Breakfast is a more than generous buffet spread and sets you up for the rest of the day - well worth trying to book the pay in advance bed and breakfast package. Pool more than adequate - remember it's not a leisure centre it's a hotel. View over Gendarmarkt while you're eating breakfast is fantastic - very difficult to beat this breakfast room location. Just around the corner from Checkpoint Charlie and the old East Berlin has got to be the best part of Berlin to stay in. And an underground right outside the hotel front door - well one of them - just be careful to go up the right steps - there's loads of exits from one underground and you can end up several minutes walk away from the hotel if you choose the wrong one! We're going back in October with our 14 year old daughter.
