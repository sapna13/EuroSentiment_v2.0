{"text":"Our favourite, affordable, pied a terre in London We have stayed at The Sofitel St James many times and just love it more each time we go.We have tried many 5* London hotels but Sofitel SJ is the winner for us. Yes it's a big hotel but the staff are so well trained they are hard to fault for eg upon arival we were a little early for check in but were given complimentary refreshments in the gorgeous Rose Lounge whilst we waited 10 mins before we were shown up to our room.Our room was as comfortable as ever with a gorgeous bed and lovely fabrics. We had complimentary fruit and water waiting for us and all the staff we encountered went out of their way to be hospitable and accommodating including the porter who whisked our luggage up in no time at all.We found we had no language problems I am glad to say.The bathroom was deco inspired and was very easy to linger in with delightful French toiletries as you might expect.. Dining in Brasserie Roux is highly recommended as it is both very affordable with a set price menu of √ä√£¬¢25 for 3 courses including 2 glasses of wine and extremely good French food.Breakfast is quite expensive if you haven't bought an inclusive package but well worth the investment if you have time to linger. If not Mario's 5 minutes away is the perfect spot for an economical start to the day with wonderful coffee.The atmposphere is always buzzing when we are there and we always star spot  because we have never stayed there without being in famous company usually actor's or television presenters, which is a fun pastime. The hotel always has magnificent flower displays and over the Festive Season the lobby was quite beautiful.The atmposhere over New Year was super and is it any wonder with it's prime location to view fireworks from St Jame's park and on the route of the great fun New Years Day Parade, just by the commentator for prime views. It's location is simply the best in London for us, 2 mins away from the beautiful St James's park, 10 mins from Buckingham Palace about 7 mins walk to The National Gallery and Fortnum and Mason's as well as all the beautiful little shops in the arcades in and around Jermyn St . We even walked back from the Royal Opera house on New Year's Eve because of road closures and it took 12 minutes.Sheer bliss at very good and affordable prices.
