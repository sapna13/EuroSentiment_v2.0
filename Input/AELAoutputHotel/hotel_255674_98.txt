{"text":"an excellent hotel defined by the way they handle a mishap. Me and my husband had just had our anniversary in this hotel.We had a wonderful experience due to the friendly hotel reception and his efficiency to handle our episode.We had a free discount voucher from a friend as a presentand book using the price list stated in the voucher.I was a bit worried at first when the reconfirmation email came a week ago. Despite the fact that we've booked since November LAST YEAR and confirmed that we are staying in the Opera house view (when we went to website reconfirmation page),  the reconfirmation website this time stating that we staying in City view room, which is the downgraded room ! When we called, we were told that with the price we are paying, it should be a city view room.but when we booked last year when the old price was still on, and the voucher still valid until April this year.Luckily we still have the old print out that stated opera house view, thus we can proove our booking.The gentleman in the reception handle our case with no drama. Friendly and cheerful, he promised us to give us something better. and boy he did.. he upgrade us to executive suite.it was a nice surprise after worrying a few days. Eventhough it wasn't opera house view, it was a sydney bridge view , which is nice watching the people crossing bridge during the 75th birthday .All the staff seems friendly and efficient. the concierge and bell desk etc.Our room is nice, clean, modern had a spa, just sweet.Although the light seems a bit funny in our room, with the ceiling halogen lights not working in the lounge room, yet there are too many lights in the bathroom that ALL light up with only 1 switch , thus we can't choose which ones we want it on. seems a bit of a waste of electricity.anyway... that was just being picky of me.overall, i really recommend this hotel due to the proximity to the centre of attraction and transport. We went there by train ! only 5 min walk to the hotel.Had a nice Latin food and Salsa lesson at 'Vivaz' at the rocks (only friday and saturday night). and the rocks market open saturday and sunday daytime.It was a lovely weekend.we would like to come back again.We would like to thank the receptionist (I can't remember the name , but he's the nice ethnic indian guy)He really made our anniversary memorable, and make overall positive image of Marriott in general.
