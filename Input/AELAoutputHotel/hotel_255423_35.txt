{"text":"adequate accommodation My biggest complaint was that they advertised they had a gym and they have one piece of equipment that I think could do a couple different exercises, when it was working. What a complete disappointment! There is also a small shoebox size pool that I wouldn't go near. There is a gym a couple blocks away that costs $18 per day. The rooms are dark and old. They were clean. There was a kitchen counter type thing with a sink along one wall and when I went to wash out a few things in it, the faucet came off. There was an electric kettle but the cups were so filthy I had to wash them before I could use them. There was a safe in the room, which I used, fortunately. As when I left to go somewhere - I came back 1\/2 hour later to pick up one more thing and found my door to the room wide open with no one around. NO ONE. My laptop was sitting there, my suitcase, etc. I locked up and complained at the front desk but no one seemed too concerned but me. They said they would look into it and get back to me (never did) but that it was probably the maid and she'd gone to get something. I asked if they always leave the doors open when they go to get something.... I didn't like that at ALL.The location - in the pink area as one woman discribed, was great for me. I prefer, as a woman traveling alone, to be in a more gay part of the city. I feel safer where as she obviously has a bit of homophobia. There isn't a train station real close but I don't mind walking. There is internet access in the lobby. Room service or a bar and restaurant downstairs and down the road (very close to oxford st), markets nearby, laundry nearby - actually not a bad location.Hope this helps. Not a bad place, just don't expect much more than a 2-3 star place. And there is NO gym. ","annotations":[]}
