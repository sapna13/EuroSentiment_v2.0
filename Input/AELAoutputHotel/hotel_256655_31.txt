{"text":"The best kept secret in Sydney We stayed here for three nights at the beginning of our Aussie Odyssey, and the final night before we flew home. I made the booking by emailing directly to the hotel, and they were fantastic, everything I asked for was delivered, a fourth floor room with a balcony giving views of both the Bridge and Opera House. Unfortunately we never met him, but many thanks to Damien Kelly for making our holiday so special. The location is super, smack in the heart of The Rocks. Close enough to the tourist centre, bars, cafes, shops, and restaurants, but just far enough away from the hurly burly for a quiet night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sleep. Circular Quay is five minutes walk away so every possible form of transport, including the airport train, is right there.As well as the balcony, our room had a double bed, plus plenty of space for the sitting area, dining area, and fully equipped kitchenette. The room was clean, well fitted, and the bed comfortable, the bathroom had a bath with shower. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat at the hotel, but only because we were out so early and back so late each day.The hotel has two pay-per-use internet machines, and a wireless network that didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work at all when we were there. The Rocks tourist centre also has an internet caf√ã√\u2022√ñ, and offers 30 minutes free wireless access for laptop users.We felt the location and standard of the hotel was excellent value.
