{"text":"Lovely Hotel We stayed here for 4 nights after 5 nights in Tanjung Benoa.This hotel is very special. The lagoons all around are spectacular, and there is always somewhere you can go for a peaceful swim.We opted for a lagoon access room, which was beautiful. Located in the same block as the imperial suite I think it was proabably one of the best rooms in the hotel - especially location wise. Request this block if you can.Our rate included breakfast which I would opt for if you can. Very good selection, and although not the best breakfast we have ever had (try the shangri-la in Kuala Lumpur for that!), it was still nice.In the day we would lounge on one of the covered bales, looking out to see. With no hassle from beach sellers as they are banned here.This is also close to the Bali Caollection Mall which has all sorts of 'boutiques' and a few restaurants. Other than this there isn't much in the Nusa Dua area, so be sure to go check out Kuta, especially for the best exchange rates in the Kodak shops. Put simply, in the hotel we were quoted 16900 for √ä√£¬¢1 UK, in the Bali Collection 17300, and in Kuta 18,000.My one complaint about the hotel is the price of drinks and food. They are in a very cheap country, charging extortionate prices. Simply unacceptable. This means the restaurants are always dead at night as everyone goes elsewhere.By the way. Book this direct at [--]as you will get a much better rate than anywhere else.All in all a very good 5* hotel ","annotations":[{"endOffset":579,"mention":"shangri-la","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Living_Shangri-La"],"startOffset":569}]}
