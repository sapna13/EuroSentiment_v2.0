{"text":"New York Palace was fantastic! My husband and I stayed at the New York Palace for four nights on the first leg of our annual holiday. This was my first time in New York my husbands second time. The New York palace lived up to all expectations, large rooms, first class service and we were lucky enough to get a room overlooking St Patrick's Cathedral which was a bouns. If you like steak then we had the most fabulous steak situated next door to the hotel, i think it was called Morrello and Porchello's this was one of the best steaks that I have eaten, however a word of advice don't order a starter as the steaks are huge double the size of any that I have had in the UK. I can't tell you what breakfast was like at the hotel as we eat at deli's which were great value.I highly recommend booking a show in advance of your trip. I decided to book for Mary Poppins 6 months in advance and we got really good seats - the show was excellent! I also recommend the Rockerfeller centre the view from the top is amazing.  We also did a helicopter tour which was ok rather expensive for what you got. If we had went to the Rockerfeller centre before the helicopter we probably wouldn't have bothered with the helicopter and saved ourselves $300.There is so much to do and see but if you are going to visit New York then I highly recommend the New York Palace as the place to stay.
