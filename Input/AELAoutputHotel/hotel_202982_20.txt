{"text":"Horrible Albani Florence We stayed at 4 and 5 stars all through Italy, this place is like a 2 star or worse! We booked a suite, $400+ a night, we didn't sleep all night because you could hear the cars and trucks so well that it was almost like they were driving through the room! We even had our ear plug in, but when the street cleaning vehicles came through the room....that is how it sounded, we took the ear plugs out and had to laugh or we would have cried. We were exhausted the next day because we didn't sleep a wink! Now that is not all (unfortunately)....we brought our laptop so we could get online and send emails and communicate via skype. Their internet service is a router and it didn't work, we had to get online in the lobby....it didn't work and I talked to others with the same problem. While I was trying to get online, the bell man actually asked me to MOVE because I was using a table and there were people in the lobby in chairs near mine that ordered drinks and didn't have a table to put their drinks on.....I was suppose to move my laptop someplace else and give them the table, yet I was paying over $400 a night???? So rude, after the sleepless night and the experience in the lobby, we checked out early the next day. Spend your money some place else....there are plenty of other nice places to stay in Florence, don't waste your time and money!
