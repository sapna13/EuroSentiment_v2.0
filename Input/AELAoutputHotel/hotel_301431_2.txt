{"text":"Touch of Class and Elegance My husband and I stayed at Regent Four Seasons for about 5 days during the Telecoms Expo Event last June 2008, all hotels are fully booked that time. We are very well received by hotel staffs ,they are very accommodating,I find the hotel very unique in its architectural design,there was so much art and functionality ,and I find it still modern with a touch of class and elegance. Rooms are big with a very comfortable bed and pillows they change bed linens everyday and its very clean.The bathroom is big enough with toiletries and they have a service in the afternoon that will change your towels and clean the bathroom.When we booked we are given certain priviledges like unlimited use of internet service,and pressing of clothes.The mini bar is very well kept with ice service at least twice a day.Complimentary teas and coffees are placed in an elegant box like a treasure chest full of different varieties of teas ,coffee and sugar to suit your taste. They also give 2 bottles of water twice a day or depends on your needs.I liked the cleanliness and security of the hotel.key cards are needed to use the elevators Location is very accessible considering its near Orchard road,there is a mall walking distance from the hotel where you can dine and shop.Taxi service is not a problem ,It is walking distance to the next metro rail train station.We loved the place, satisfied with the service and we will definitely be back here.
