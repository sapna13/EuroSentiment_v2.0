{"text":"Deserves to be No. 1 The Ritz Carlton Berlin deserves the No.1 ranking in Berlin. It is one of the few hotels we have stayed in that manages to get everything right.The entrance is very impressive √à√\u2020\u2022?sweeping double staircase  elegant d√ã√\u2022√ñcor. There must be a very happy marble salesperson somewhere. Prompt  efficient attention from the Front desk.Our king bed room on the Club Floor (10th) was large, comfy, luxurious and well-appointed. The bathroom is something else √à√\u2020\u2022?acres of marble, separate walk-in rain shower, separate loo, two basins and large comfortable tub. Topped off with a beautiful orchid plant and Bulgari toiletries. There are some really good modern touches, such as electronic control centres for lights, curtains, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëo not disturb√à√\u2020\u2022?indicators, next to the bed.The Club lounge is on a par to our previous favourite at the Fairmont in Boston. Very plush and comfy, with food almost constantly available  very attentive bar  drinks service. The breakfast spread was lovely √à√\u2020\u2022?loads available at the buffet, including probably the best bacon  eggs we have tasted at a hotel anywhere.Apart from the luxury, what really sets the Ritz Carlton apart from competitors is the level of service. The General Manager should be commended for the uniformly excellent service across the entire hotel. Friendly, professional, unobtrusive service at all levels. An example is that we were brought complimentary glasses of water in the lobby whilst waiting for a friend without even asking. Costs the hotel nothing, but makes a real difference. Another is that the Club lounge staff remember guests√à√\u2020\u2022?beverage preferences at breakfast. Otahuna Lodge in New Zealand is the only place we can think of that competes on service. The location is very good. Although we always find Potsdamer Platz a bit soulless, there is no doubt that it is a very convenient central location. Excellent transport links with U-bahn and S-bahn services directly across the road.We highly recommend this hotel. We visit Berlin regularly, and will make sure we stay here in the future.
