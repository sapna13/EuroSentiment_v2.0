{"text":"Wonderful stay!!! Mother\/Daughter team just returned from our stay at the Barcel√ã¬\u2022? Bavaro Caribe Resort and we had a fantastic time (January 17-24, 2007)! This was our second all-inclusive trip and our first trip to Punta Cana. It is simply a paradise on a Caribbean beach - nothing compares!Here is what we can say about our stay in a nutshell:- House Keeping: rooms were very clean (bedding, bathrooms, etc)- Hotel service: we had the shower head break off the wall on us. As soon as we told Guest Services, they were on the phone and the entire fixture was replaced immediately)- Pools: all pools were very clean- Daily entertainment: fun to watch and listen to at the Caribe (aerobics, water games, dancing, volleyball, bocce ball - you name it!) The hosts were FANTASTIC! WOW...- Nightly entertainment: excellent time to wrap up your evening! Great laughs and some excellent meringue. Shows seemed to move throughout the resorts, so stay put to avoid duplicates.- You could save your time\/money to miss the Tropicalissimo show at the Casino, as it was Vegas cheesy, not great dancing and your beverages cost you money- Buffets: we did try the buffets at each resort and all were good... preference = Caribe.- Italian restaurant (Caribe): good food\/service- Steakhouse Restaurant(Beach): basic steak house... nothing GREAT, just good- Grill Restaurant(Golf): La Uva is a TERRIFIC place for your afternoon lunch (only open until 5:00p) Salads, CALAMARI and pizza are wonderful and you are RIGHT on the beach in the sand under huts- Mexican restaurant (Beach): you can order from the menu or there is a buffet which had EVERYTHING and was amazing!- Drinks: good everywhere - I sure wouldn't call them watered down as some had mentioned- Restaurant\/Bar Staff: people were friendly and helpful- Brush up on your basic Spanish! English is NOT dominant there - you can certainly make due, but it is so much easier to have the basics- Resort Access: very easy access to everything on the Caribe resort as well as all resorts ** the train is great (every 15 DOMINICAN minutes)- Beaches: all of the beaches were beautiful (Caribe = larger\/deeper, Beach = nice and covered in palm trees).- Tipping: bring your $1 bills - tipping is the way to go! Approximately $1 for buffets, $2 for restaurants, $3-4 for the maid service, $5 each night will get you good drink service!- Shopping: down the beach just past the Barcel√ã¬\u2022?'s, there is a market which had everything - a must see and good prices\/bartering!TOURS- Bavaro Runners: a rocky ride and long day but simply a perfect way to see the Dominican Republic countryside and the people (sugar cane field, coffee\/chocolate farm, ocean, horseback riding, kids, cave) ** bring your school supplies\/treats for the kids- Marinarium: we went in the morning and it was a little rough. Being novice snorkellers, by the time we were comfortable, it was almost time to go. Advanced group did go out and had a great time. It is a RUM boat that then takes you along the coast line - great way to spend an morning\/lunch! The hosts were awesome!I hope this review helped you understand the Caribe and the other Barcel√ã¬\u2022? resorts!
