{"text":"DO NOT STAY I stayed in San Juan Beach Hotel for a weekend in September 2008. The hotel is very modest, the room furnished with very old furniture and curtains with holes, but considering the star rating I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect anything more. That is not the point. The point is that the hotel service is absolutely horrible. From day one my friend and me had nothing but problems. The entrance to the beach was locked. It took them one full day (and that is after our repeated requests) to open the door. But the highlight of the stay was the professional camera disappearing from the room without a trace. We left for a couple of hours and upon our return, the camera was gone. So was the old mp3 player that was inside my backpack √à√\u2020\u2022?so whoever stole it went through my stuff! Well, even if these items were not stolen by the hotel staff, they were definitely stolen by someone who had access to the room key since the door lock wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ broken. We reported the incident to the hotel personnel immediately, and that is when the nightmare started. First, I was told that the hotel had nothing to do with it and that upon check-in we signed a paper according to which the hotel is not responsible for valuables stored in the room. But even so, some concern would be nice. Instead, the person we were dealing with was extremely rude. He introduced himself as Frank. I was insulted by him when he that maybe I did not have a camera and was making it all up (however I even had a user√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ manual to prove the fact). I asked if it was possible to check the system (since the key is electronic) to see when the door was opened\/closed. To this Frank responded that I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have an electronic key (an outright lie). When I showed him the electronic key in my hand, he said it was not possible to check the system (the manager the next day told me that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what they were doing). The only thing that Frank did for us was to call the police, who did not speak English and he translated for them (so I am not even sure about the accuracy of the translation). To cut the long story short, the service at the hotel was absolutely abhorrent. Oh yes, a curious observation: the cleaning personnel were using Wall-Mart carts (why would a hotel use a store cart?). Do not stay there unless you want to be insulted and want your belongings stolen. Expedia (through which we purchased the room) on the other hand was very helpful. They promised to investigate the incident, and, even though they were not directly responsible for the theft, issued a voucher to compensate for our inconvenience. ","annotations":[]}
