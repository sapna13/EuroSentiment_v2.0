{"text":"Small rooms, okay location We were supposed to stay at another location but had to switch last minute. So we didn't have a lot of options as we were driving at the time. I happened to have this hotels information so we contacted them to see if they had a room for 5 nights. They said they did, but we were going to have to change rooms a couple times. So we decided to go there at least for one night and then figure things out. When we got there, there was no parking nearby and we had to wait for someone to come pick up the car from the parking garage. My husband waited outside for around 15 minutes. The hotel does not have anyone to help you with your bags, so you have to lug them into this very tiny elevator. The staff the night we arrived were very nice. We were just happy to have a room to sleep in. The room was very tiny. We were tired and hungry and they didn't have a restaurant. Unfortunately, there was not much right around the location so we had to walk for a while to find something. The great thing, was that we had internet access in our room so we were able to figure out where we would go next. We checked out the next day and went on our way. If you don't mind a small room without many amenities, it is not a bad place to stay. ","annotations":[]}
