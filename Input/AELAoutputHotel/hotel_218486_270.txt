{"text":"My best friend and I loved our stay at Ocean Bavaro!! Well my best friend and I just got back from Punta Cana yesterday night, but we really wanted to write this review to let everyone know we had a great time!! First of all both my friend and I are seasoned travelers (mostly in the Caribean), we booked this vacation about a week before we went, and really had little knowledge about Ocean Bavaro. When we got home from booking our vacation we were a little worried about some of the ratings and comments people had made about our resort, however we were optimistic and went ahead. First I will get out of the way the FEW complaints I did have. We arrived at the hotel at around 12 o'clock in the afternoon exhausted. We were informed that we would have to wait until 3pm to check in, however our room and most others were ready around 1:30-2:00pm. In the meantime we were told where to change and given plently of drinks and food. Our room was very very cold and if we turned off the air conditioner the ceiling would drip from the condensation, but we found a happy medium and that problem was resolved. The rooms themselves were ok, no peeling paint, but the shower heads were a little flimsy, and the water pressure dies off in the afternoon, so take your shower or bath at night or in the morning. Some of the male staff were a little to flirty, but that was tolerable and...expected. Now for the postiives, the food was amazing, DEFINETLY book the resturants, espically the Italian (get the steak it's amazing!) The pools were very nice, no construction on either of them when we arrived, but there is construction near the ocean, out of the way. The ocean is beautiful the sand very white and clean. No peddelers to harrass us, and many many loungers with shade if you want. Lots of activities to keep you busy if you want to stay out of the sun for awhile. The staff is very very friendly and we made lots of friends even though we speak very little Spanish. There is a small store to buy more sunscreen, chips, souvenirs etc, but it's a little on the expensive side. The resort itself is spectacular very clean and beautiful, day and night! I would definetly suggest this resort for anyone who wants to have a good time relaxing or partying, this resort offers the best of both worlds. We are definetly going back next year!!!
