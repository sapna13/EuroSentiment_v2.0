{"text":"Terrible experience I would like to shear with all readers the Terrible experience we went through in this resort. We arrived to the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar section at approximately 1.30 AM on February 07\/08. Unfortunately, we were not too impressed with the initial greeting that we received at this resort. We were told to go to the biding √à√\u2020\u2022?Villa√à√\u2020\u2022?64 on the second floor and look for room 64206 and 64204 ( we were two couples and traveled together )To our big surprise only two doors on the floor had the number tug .....in order to found the right door we had to play a guessing game: trying √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥ur door card√à√\u2020\u2022?in different doors ( At 1.30 AM ......).We were told that √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áecause we arrived so late √à√\u2020\u2022?the restaurants are close..... and if we like to get something to eat, we will need to call and order room service. We called room service, ordered some food for 4 persons √à√\u2020\u2022?and after waiting 2,5 hours the food finally arrived ....... The order was mixed up ! We received not the food we ordered .... But for 4 persons we received only one fork and one knife ......was late and we went to sleep. In the morning we started to unpack the luggage - another surprise: the safe was loose and not attached to the wall ....... I called to the express service: the answer was √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬Æait in five minutes the person will be to fix this problem√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?this repair took to resolve all day long ! When I complained to the customer service they told √à√\u2020\u2022?you did not had to wait in the room√à√\u2020\u2022?.....Next day after our day on the beach my wife told me that her make-up is missing. After double checking all our belongings, we went to the customer service desk and informed the clerk Victor about this incident. Victor told as not to worry and he will get back to us next morning..... Next morning and during all day √à√\u2020\u2022?nobody contacted us! My wife went again to the customer service desk, this time she spoke to Erika. Erika specked to Victor and told to my wife that by next morning action will be taken and reported back to her...... The next day is over √à√\u2020\u2022?no further responses! My wife was pretty really upset, went to the customer service and requested to speak to the manager of the customer service. The lady that called herself manager, told my wife that we need to fill-out a special report, go to the room with security guards √à√\u2020\u2022?then she will resolve the problem..... We did all what she requested and next day she approached us in the lobby and told as that the investigation did not bring any results: they searched the locker of the cleaning lady and could not found any-thing...... ( after 3 days ......? ) She advised to proceed with our travel insurance....By this our poor experience was not over : next day TV stopped working √à√\u2020\u2022?took two day to fix it ....One day after, when we wanted to get in to the room √à√\u2020\u2022?the card did not open the door √à√\u2020\u2022?we forced to walk to the lobby, wait in line for 45 min. ( there was a line of not happy gests ! ).Completely upset √à√\u2020\u2022?I went to the manager of the customer service and told about all what happened √à√\u2020\u2022?she promised to contact us in the morning (before our departure) √à√\u2020\u2022?nobody did !I am disappointed with the customers are treated in a five star hotel and strongly would advise to stay away from Bahia Principe Ambar !
