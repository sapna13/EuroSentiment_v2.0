{"text":"Loved the staff and resort!! Perfect honeymoon\/Vacation I just want to start off by saying a special thank you to our Wedding Co-ordinator Lisbeth, who setup a magical and special ceremony for us and provided us with something we will never forget. She is a very sweet and helpful person who will go the distance in making your wedding day special.I would also like to give Mariel a special thanks, who helps out with the entertainment at the resort. She is a fun and sweet person who knows how to get the fun out of you. Whether it was volleyball on the beach, or dancing at the disco tech, she was always around sparking a great time and a fun enviroment. She made our honeymoon\/vacation very fun and memorable.As far as the rest of he staff and resort, we have never had such kind people cater to us like this resort has done for us. The staff was wonderful and the resort provided teriffic food, especially at these restaurants, Chez Abbelle, Barcelona, and Toscana. The beach and pools were very relaxing. Everyday at this resort, there is something new to do, from water sports, to horseback riding, to ATV riding it was fun. There is also a drink of the day everyday and nightly shows in the lounge (which I have heard are the best in all of Punta Cana). My favorite drinks there were Coco Loco and Dirty Monkey. The Coco Loco is a real coconut and the bartender will chop an opening on the top right in front of you and make a drink from the coconut milk, it is delicious. But don't have more than 3 or 4 or else you will be in the bathroom for the rest of the day.; ) If you like bananas and chocolate the Dirty Monkey is your drink. In a nut shell I highly recommend this resort. It is perfect for couples and relaxing. I will definitely go back.Thanks Excellence!! ","annotations":[]}
