{"text":"outstanding stay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My family was on vacation to celebrate my parents 62 year wedding anniversary. They met and married in 1945 and came back to Seattle to celebrate. I read the reviews about this hotel on the tripadvisor website and decided this would be a perfect place for my parents to stay in style. Starting with my initial call to make the reservation I was very impressed with the staff on their customer service and knew the hotel was the #1 pick for us. Upon arrival (free parking) we were greeted by friendly smiles and a wonderful staff (baked cookies too). I requested a special room with a view for my parents... I was not disappointed. The room was on the 5th floor with a view of Mount Rainier. The room was huge! We started calling it the apartment while we were there. I love the layout of the room...double closet the best! My mom loved the Starbuck's(24\/7). We all enjoyed the winetasting and breakfast was fresh. We used the Spa cart and DVD cart -what a nice perk for free! We didn't use the free shuttle, but it was nice to ride the town car back to the airport for only 35 dollars. The workout room had a variety of new equipment\/free weights to use-it was very clean. Speaking of clean... the place was immaculate! I slept on a pullout queen sofa and it felt like a regular bed...no lumps, bars or backaches.I want to THANK each and EVERY STAFF member at this hotel from the front desk, housekeeping, breakfast and wine tasting servers, and everyone else for making my parents 62 wedding celebration one that they will never forget. It was amazing and next time we are back in Seattle, I will not hesitate to book my room with the WATERTOWN HOTEL-#1 HOTEL IN SEATTLE.
