{"text":"Bloody Brilliant I'm not sure why it took me so long to write this review - My friend and I stayed at Hotel Cram in September last year for a three night city break and had an absolute ball. As creative professionals, we fancy ourselves quite picky about where we stay, and only booked the Cram because we got a fantastic deal on Tablet Hotels (it had only just opened). When we got there we were delighted - The glass entrance leads into the lobby where every surface seems to be shiny and brilliant. The bar is something else - a myriad of textures and shapes, not to mention the FABULOUS mojitos!The tantalising of the senses continues into the bedrooms. Ok, they aren't huge, but we found our room more than adquate for our needs. The bathroom was excellent, the shower ran the full length of the wall and there were plenty of lighting options meaning optimum make-up appliance. The only downside I would mention was that the bathroom door is see-through (ok, frosted but you can see everything that's going on) and without a lock. And the loo is beside it. We found it quite funny but I don't think I'd feel the same if my boyfriend had been there and not my best friend!A highlight was the roof terrace where we enjoyed a midnight swim on our last night and wished we'd thought of it sooner. Although at the time we stayed there the decking was not completely finished, and there were several workmen during the day who's oggling cost the Cram it's full 5 points.I would love to go back again to experience the Cram in all it's completed glory, if only to see The Most Beautiful Man In The World TM again at reception.
