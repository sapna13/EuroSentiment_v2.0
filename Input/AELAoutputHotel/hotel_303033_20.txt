{"text":"Palace and Suites are great, resort rooms are below average We just came back from 6 nights in Bali. It was the last leg of our trip to SE Asia. When we first got to Ayodya, we were amazed at how beautiful the lobby, entrance, and landscaping was. The grounds really are spectacular and are very well maintained. We had booked a Deluxe Oceanview room. When we got the room, we were very disappointed. The room was quite rundown including the bathroom. There were 2 single beds when we had explicitly asked for a king\/queen. There was no oceanview. We complained and the manager, Ms. Putri, told us that all the oceanview rooms are obstructed view because the hotel is shaped in a U form. Obstructed is not the word - this is a con - do not bother with oceanview - you cannot see the ocean at all. When we asked about the king bed, she simply had a staff member join the beds together and put a sheet on top. It was very frustrating. We asked to be upgraded to a Palace room but they didnt have any. After 2 more days of complaining, the moved us to a suite for a charge of US$15 per night. It was well worth it. The suite was really nice, marble floors, pool-side view, couch on the balcony. Really lovely. The overall service was average.The resort itself is quite good - nice pools, and spacious grounds. However, because the grounds are so massive, it does take a while to get to the beach area. Not a huge issue for us though. The breakfast was good - quite an extensive variety. The only thing was that on the last day, there was a lot of fruit flies around the carrot bowl and the staff did nothing about it. As for the beach, its okay. Bali is not white-sand beaches. There was no garbage but quite a bit of sharp coral that washed up onto the sands. The water was gorgeous though - we swam everyday. It was also easy enough to get sunbeds which was nice. The checkout was fine except they tried to charge us for consumption of the mini-bar when we hadn't. We actually noticed this scam in a couple of the other hotels in SE Asia. They dont check the mini bar carefully and then try and charge you for it at check out. The other thing to be wary of is that the hotel will always try and offer you their own transportation when you ask them to order you a taxi. You can negotiate with them but I prefer to use a metered taxi. Overall, if you are going to stay at the Palace or one of the Suites, then book Ayodya. If not, then its not worth it to stay there. On a side note, they are planning to renovate all the rooms - so maybe the standards will go up in a few years.
