{"text":"Good deal for the price!!! Although I would not consider this as a 5 star hotel as publicized. You get what you pay for. This is a good place if you like drinks, as a Peruvian I am too spoiled with food as we have a great variety. The food is a little bit greasy for my taste but is a bufftet so you can't go wrong. I love the fresh fruits and juices in the morning (I still miss that). The drinks were strong so I can't complain, as others said... if you want a pi√Ç??a colada, ask for alcohol otherwise they won't add any. The shows were ok... done by the same employees and they were at all times friendly. I enjoyed playing voleyball most of the time getting to know people (mostly nice europeans). The rooms were always cleaned with alcohol included in the room and fresh flowers in our towels. I wish we could have rented the room closer to the beach as we had to walk a bit. I would say 5 days is good, since the food is repetitive and although there are places to eat a la carte they are still the same buffett with some variations. Other than that I loved my stay and I wish I can come back again, it was so RELAXING!!! ohh another thing, we made the mistake to take a taxi from there to Santo Domingo... the ride I tell you it is horrible, they charged us $135 for a small car withouth A\/C (should have asked before-it was arranged by Hotel-Bed). Honestly not much to see in Santo Domingo, we could have stayed longer at the Riu... Thanks for the comments here, it really helped!!!!
