{"text":"Bellissimo !! I have just returned today from a week long trip to Venice with my mother and my two sisters. We stayed in the junior suite at Ca' Dogaressa which accommodated four people, the room was very spacious, clean and comfortable and the decor was of typical Venetian style. As we had a room with a canal view every morning as we opened the shutters the light poured in to the room, the sounds of the water in the canal and the daily ringing of the church bells was like something from a film it was so atmospheric. It was so nice to come back every day to the warmth and tranquil surroundings of Ca' Dogaressa  Paulo  Daniele were extremely inviting and very helpful at all times and encouraged us to use our limited Italian vocabulary which was nice. We noticed that the Venetians were generally happy to hear us attempt to speak a few words of Italian even if they were just Grazie Ciao Buongiorno etc.... When you choose to travel I am a firm believer in experiencing the food and culture of whatever country you are in and in this case the phrase when in Venice do what the Venetians do was very fitting. Every morning we had a very healthy continental breakfast which was served by Paulo  other very friendly staff, the breakfast consisted of fresh coffee  orange juice, brioche and yoghurt's which made a change from the Irish fry up. We ate very well for lunch and dinner and could not fault any of the restaurants that we ate in most which served delicious fresh fish and pasta, one word of advise is go looking down the little alley ways and also wherever you see locals eating you will know the food is good. The Ca' Dogaressa is in the quiet Cannaregio District which is a pleasant short walk to the busy market areas and is very central to all amenities including the water bus which brings you to wherever you want to go in the city and I must add it was great not to have the usual traffic and fumes. I could go on and on about what an amazing place Venice is and how friendly the people are but all I can say is it is a wonderful place to visit and we will definitely be back again and we will surely be staying in Ca' Dogaressa as this beautiful hotel added to the enjoyment of our holiday it was a pleasure to stay there and I would highly recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting Venice !!!
