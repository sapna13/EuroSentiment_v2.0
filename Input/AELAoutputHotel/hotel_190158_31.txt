{"text":"Great Location We stayed at The Carlos V in February for 5 days. The choice of City was decided by our teenage daughter , the hotel by both parents having reviewed comments on this site and the fact that we had used this Hotel chain before.The staff were always helpful and welcoming - I liased with them beforehand and booked a pick up from the Airport. We tended to use the Hotel for breakfast , as most guests did. The breakfast was extra - but good value. The eating area also had free internet access as well.We were a bit worried beforehand having read comments about the noise - but we never felt it was a problem. We requested a quiet room when we booked the room and that is what we were given. The room was a bit cramped for 3 people but it was never a problem. I did have to request extra pillows on our arrival and they were rapidly provided.Madrid is a busy, vibrant and welcoming city - The hotel is on the doorstep of Sol so you get a sample of the atmosphere straight away. The hotel is within walking distance of many tourist attractions but if you need to use the Madrid underground it compares very favourably to other Capital Cities.There are plenty of eateries - we found a Spanish chain called VIP good value for a family of 3. There are several within a 10 minute walk of the hotel.We intend to return to Madrid and would have no hesitation in using the Carlos V again. ","annotations":[]}
