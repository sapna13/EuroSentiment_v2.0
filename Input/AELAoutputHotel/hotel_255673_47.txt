{"text":"Great experience at the Sydney Marriott during a holiday period! I stayed at this Marriott on Dec 30 and 31, 2006. Amazingly, with no hotel rooms available in the city on New Year's Eve, I was able to get this 5-star property on Dec 31 for Marriott Rewards points (so if you're looking for a New Year's Eve hotel room next year and have Marriott points to use....)!My 14th floor room had a nice city view over to the mountains and a huge triangular soaking tub (not whirlpool spa, but it was the size of the typical spa tubs found in Marriotts in the US). I found it to be a great retreat from the bustle of the downtown Sydney CBD (central business district.) Hyde Park is across the street. The hotel has a rooftop pool which, when I was there, was generally not crowded. It's near the Museum cityrail underground train station, and a 20-30 minute walk from the restaurants and shops at Darling Harbor.Staff were very friendly. As someone else mentioned, the concierge service during my stay was TOP NOTCH, up there with the best I've ever experienced in a hotel (the other great experiences were also in Marriotts, and this is largely why I prefer the brand.) In particular, Mark was very helpful to me.Internet costs an amazing $24.95\/day AUD. You're probably better off using one of the $5\/half-hour public machines in the business center, or getting out of the hotel to use an even less expensive Internet cafe (they're plentiful in Sydney) unless you need the security of a personal connection on your personal notebook.Full breakfast (hot\/cold) was $32 AUD, which isn't the greatest value in the world, but seemed in line with most meal pricing in Sydney. Since Marriott breakfast buffets are good fuel for a busy day of touring or work, even if it's a bit much, I recommend it.They were also nice enough to store most of my luggage for a few extra days between checkout and my departure from Australia, while I visited with a friend who lived on one of the northern beaches.I'll definitely stay there again when visiting Sydney, and I recommend this property to others.
