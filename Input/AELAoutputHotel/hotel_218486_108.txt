{"text":"Persistence Pays! I stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach in Feb of 2008. I went with a group of 15 friends, and all of us had a great time, with a few exceptions. Out of all of us, the only complaint we had about the rooms was the lack of hot water. We found this problem could be avoided however by returning from the beach early to shower. We also had a very difficult time with the front desk staff. We tried four different times to get a key for our safe, and eventually we just gave up. That was my biggest mistake of the trip, as I had cash and a bank card disappear from my wallet that I had kept in my room. This also happened to two of the other three girls I was sharing a room with. Now although my vacation was somewhat overshadowed by this theft, I still had a wonderful time. The beach was absolutely gorgeous, there were plenty of chairs available, and there was always lots to do. The entertainment staff at this hotel are awesome. They grabbed all of us out of our lawn chairs to play beach games each day, providing for some of our favorite memories from the trip. The band that played each night was entertaining as well, and all of us loved the nightly 10PM shows. The food left a bit to be desired, but I definately would make reservations for the restuarants on the property. I have to admit we weren't thrilled about having to get up at 7am to stand in line, but it was well worth it. The italian restuarant was even able to accomodate our entire group. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone looking for a great vacation at a great price, but no matter what, make sure and get the key for the safe no matter how many times you have to go back and ask for it!
