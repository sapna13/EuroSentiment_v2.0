{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic Just back from a five day stay at this hotel and I can definately say it is by far one of the best hotels I have stayed in .  The level of service from all members of staff from the reception to house keeping was second to none - nothing was too much trouble . In particular a guy named alex was so helpful in recommending resturants and always really nice and polite. The hotel itself has a nice relaxed and genuine feel to it aided by the excellent staff .A handy pack with maps and information about places to visit was given on checkin . The room we stayed in was on the 18th floor , very spaceous room with excellent views ,a useful kitchen with a fridge and coffee maker , lots of storage space, a safety deposit box and air cond .The room also had an alarm clock which again was useful - especially adjusting to the time change . Beds very comfy and showers excellent . Even though the room was high up , traffic noise wasnt a problem , you couldnt hear a thing . Rooms serviced every day with fresh towels , linen and toiletries . There is a nice bar , the barking dog next to the hotel which we went into a few times for drinks before we headed out , nice cocktails and very friendly staff .  The shop next to the hotel has everything you would want , we got breakfast stuff here one morning and sandwiches another . The Murray hill diner is nice as well for breakfast \/lunch although does get very busy and very warm but the food excellent value . There is also a larger supermarket\/pharm on the opposite side of the road handy, for water as they do the 4 ltr bottles .We used the sub way which is a few minutes walk from the hotel and got taxis back later at night to the hotel . On check out we where able to store the bags and a gentle man by the name of nelson was very helpful in arranging a taxi to the airport . The computer in the lobby is comp for printing the boarding cards and checking in . When the taxi arrived to the airport I was very surprise to find it was a streached limo which was definately worth the money and a nice way to end the holiday .  All in all this hotel is definately worth every penny and I would recommed it to everyone .
