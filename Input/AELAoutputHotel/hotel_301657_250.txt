{"text":"Fantastic!! My wife and I picked this hotel on the basis of the ratings and reviews on Tripadvisor, and we were NOT disappointed.Room: The room we had was smaller than the typical North American hotel room, but you quickly become accustomed to it; it is Tokyo after all! It was super-clean and had FREE high-speed Internet access. Also, the room and the hotel, in general, were super-quiet; even the elevators were silent.Friendly Staff: The hotel staff were some of the most friendly and helpful people we have ever encountered at a hotel anywhere. One evening I called housekeeping to request an ironing board; no sooner had I put down the phone, then the doorbell rang. The front desk and concierge made restaurant reservations for us, and provided us with maps. The hotel kept our bags over the weekend, when we took a side-trip outside of Tokyo. Everyone at the hotel understands and speaks English.Location: We thought the location was really convenient. I actually appreciated that the hotel was in an office district and was removed from the bustling shopping and entertainment districts; it was a nice refuge at the end of long day of shopping and sight-seeing. There is a convenient underground concourse that connects the hotel to the Shimbashi train\/metro station; it is about a 15 minute walk from your room to the station, and you never have to go outside. From Shimbashi, you are just two stops from Tokyo Station, which is the main Japan-Rail hub for the bullet trains. Directly beneath the hotel is the Shiodome metro station. This stop is on the Oedo line, which also has stops at Roppongi and Shinjuku; you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even have to change trains.Getting to\/from Narita: You can take the Japan Rail train from Narita to Tokyo station; then take the JR line to Shimbashi station. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e adventurous and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ√à√\u2020\u2022?have a lot of luggage you can try to navigate the underground concourse to Shiodome Media Tower; just keep looking for the yellow and black English signs that will point you in the correct direction.Food: We took the advice of other reviewers and grabbed croissants and yoghurt for breakfast at the French-themed bakery (I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ recall the name.) in one of the nearby office-tower concourses. There was also a Starbucks close by (I think it was in the same building.).Fish Market: You must visit the fish market, and you must do so before 7 a.m.! You can indeed walk to the fish market in about 15 minutes with a good map. I could on√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2020ut basically if you are looking for a clean, quiet and modern hotel that is close to transportation and has extremely friendly staff, then stay Park Hotel. Whenever we return to Tokyo we will only stay at Park Hotel.
