{"text":"Beautiful, unique hotel and very romantic What a great find!! This hotel is not your typical hotel. We had a wonderful stay, from the time my husband and I arrived via taxi from the airport the bellman, Luis was there to assist us, with our luggage and a smile. After check in, Luis, showed us to our room and showed us where everything was, including the ice machines, pool and hot tub, wine reception venue each evening and told us about each of the resturants within the hotel. The room was very comfortable, cozy and clean, and decorated beautifully. Each room has flat screen TV and Bose radios. The hotel has a nice wine and cheese reception each evening on the patio which is very nice to sit out on and relax , and the view is exceptional, it overlooks the San Juan Bay. The pool is small but very nice and serves its purpose and you could not ask for a better panoramic view of San Juan.There are plenty of lounge chairs and sitting room in the pool\/hot tub area. I can not say enough good things about El Convento, its not your typical hotel but is a very nice and unique place to stay. My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights for our honeymoon and they had a beautiful flower arrangement, champagne, and chocolates waiting in our room when we arrived from dinner our first night. The hotel is in a great location, close to pier, in Old San Juan and shopping, great resturants, the forts all within walking distance, the hotel will even assist you in arranging tours to El Yunque Rain forest, the Phosphorescent bays, etc. Venus and Carlos, in reservations, were very helpful in assisting me with my reservations. You will not be disappointed. We will definitally come back here to stay again.
