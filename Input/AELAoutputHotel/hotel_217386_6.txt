{"text":"We really enjoyed our stay! Well let's see now...Having read some of the reviews on here, I was really quite anxious about going to the Riu. However, everything was absolutely fine!1. The two lifts worked perfectly for the entire week we were there. Ok sometimes we had to wait a few minutes, but that was not an issue for us. (Patience and all that!) We also used the stairs quite a bit as only on the 5th floor.2. Definitely glad we paid extra for an ocean view room - well worth it. We looked straight out over the pool to the beach\/ocean beyond. Lovely.3. The breakfast was nothing short of amazing. I can't even begin to list the food that was available. The choice was fantastic and could rival any 5* hotel I'm sure.4. All the staff we spoke to were very polite and helpful, particularly those behind the check-in desk. We had no problems at all.5. Location - ok so it is not on Ocean Drive and yes it is a little bit of a walk, but the boardwalk is lovely and it took us about 20\/30 minutes to get into the main restaurant area. In the evenings we chose not to walk along the boardwalk, but along the main streets (out the front of the hotel) which again took about 20\/30 minutes. We thought it was a really nice stroll before dinner, but if you are not into walking or find it difficult to walk for this amount of time, a taxi cost $7-8. This price is for coming in the other direction (centre to hotel) but I presume it will be the same from the hotel to Ocean Drive.6. The rooms could do with a little updating - new carpet, more contemporary bedding etc, but we don't go on holiday to stay in our hotel room. It was very clean, and got cleaned thoroughly every day too. Also fresh towels daily if needed.7. If you like a bit of retail therapy... we visited Aventura Mall by getting the 'S' bus straight outside the hotel. Definitely worth it!! The mall is fab with a huge selection of shops and a cinema complex. It cost $2 each, one-way and takes approx 45 minutes to get there. The buses come along frequently so you don't have to wait too long for one.We really enjoyed our stay at the Riu. Would possibly look for something nearer Ocean Drive next time, but would not hesitate to go back here.
