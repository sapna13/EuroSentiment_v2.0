{"text":"Keep this one on your list... Since we stay in Sydney as a family at least once a month we've ended up with a few favourites over the years. Our current one, since the view isn't such a high priority any more, is the Hilton. Although, as mentioned previously, the rooms are a bit small, they are very pleasantly fitted out. Ignore the rubbish about Sydney's first 6-star hotel which was bandied about at the opening and just expect a modern, friendly, efficient hotel with a decent splash of Sydney style in its public areas.Our kids love the breakfasts and Glass restaurant is a great space. I was surprised to read the negative reviews about the evening food.... we haven't tried eating there but Luke Mangan, the chef, is very well known and you'd expect a good feed.Everything works well, the staff are friendly and genuinely helpful and parking, whilst expensive, is a breeze despite the location right in the very centre of the city. My only criticism is that the pool\/spa area is a bit stark and unwelcoming. It could be much better with warmer lighting and some more comfortable seating around the pools. The gym area is very good.If I was after a view I'd go for the Park Hyatt, Shangri La or Four Seasons (amongst others) and we are also regulars at the Sir Stamford at Circular Quay, but the Hilton is now firmly established in our hotel address book. Make sure you get a good rate, though, the rack rate is fearsome but the wotif.com deals are usually much less frightening.
