{"text":"Had a lovely relaxing time lorraine and colin from Norhern Ireland Well I just dont know how you would possibly please some people they were obviously born with silver spoons in their mouths.This was a fantastic resort. I would be particular when it comes to clean and this in my opinion is as clean as any hotel I have ever stayed at or cleaner. The staff are so friendly and will go out of thier way to make your stay as nice as possible. Yes this is a big resort but that was so nice you did not feel enclosed it felt like a wee town which is what Im used to living in a small town in Ireland. The beach was georgous and yes you could always find a bed sometimes a little further back from the water but no problem. The food was fantastic my favourite restaurant was the Steakhouse and the Japanese was really entertaining.The drinks were good once the bar man got to know you the rums became larger. You have to try Mamauana thier local drink ummm lovely.No loud noise at night as the entertainment was far enough away and if you went there all drinks were still free.One thing I have to say who said the Brits were loud, obviously these people have never met Canadians they are the loudest people ever. Its like they have to be heard over every other person around them. It can become kinda annoying when you are just dropping off on the beach after a late night suffering with a hangover and some loud person sits near you.Met some lovely people there hello to you all.So if you go have a brill time as we did.Oh one last thing we flew with First Choice and this was indeed an excellent choice everything was perfect.Lorraine ","annotations":[]}
