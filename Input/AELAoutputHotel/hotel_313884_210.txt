{"text":"Garden of Eden This resort is the very best we have ever stayed in. My husband and I stayed here from 9 June - 15 June. We are in our mid 40's. The staff is friendly and helpful and the resort is kept as clean as a hospital. Checking in was only a 10 minute stop and checking out was even easier. Eat at the Ala Carte restaurants and you can make up to 3 reservations at a time. Men must wear long pants to these restaurants. Buffet areas are open to swimsuits, shorts, skirts, tank tops and wraps. Buffet food is pretty good with a different variety at the Casabe and pretty much the same everyday at the Mare. Mondays is when they do the beach buffett but it rained and it was cancelled. I really suggest upgrading to the VIP status. The rooms and beachside beds are worth it alone. VIP's also get a 20 minute massage and 1 hour of motorsport use (although this only consists of the banana boat ride or a boat ride to the sunken ship (which is just a rusty ole boat). Only problem is that the 1 hour ticket can only be used once and the banana boat ride only lasted 15 minutes. You do not get a credit of 45 minutes. The same with the internet use. You get an hour pp but must use it all at one time. Our one off resort dinner (free for VIP's) was at the La Cava. This meal was absolutely fabulous. My husband had the NY steak and I ate the grilled lobster tail. A lot of food. The beach had about 30% topless women but most are European so no biggie. Only the American men seemed excited about it. Same at the pool. Swim up bar was a nice addition. I recommend this resort to anyone looking for a laid back place to enjoy one another. We can't wait to go back.
