{"text":"Fabulous Wedding We went down with a group of 25. Let me start off by saying that many of us have been to all inclusive resorts before and found this resort by far the BEST!!!!.I've heard people complain about how large the resort was.It was a very nice walk every morning for breakfast. It was not that large at all. They had trams that ran every second....we never had to wait for one. And for the other people that complained about the speed of the trams....you could honestly walk faster than they travelled. And most times we did walk from the beach to the lobby bar. Maybe 5 minutes. The food was fabulous, yes not always the hottest, but fabulous. We ate at the Japanese 10\/10 an amazing show, Le Gourmet 10\/10 best steak and lobster around, Brazilian 4\/10, The Garden Grill 7\/10, Mediterranean 7\/10. I would recommend the first two. Check out the menus that are posted outside of the restaurants prior to booking. Especially if you have children. Just a note that all of the restaurants on the 5* side have a dress code. No shorts for men \/ womenWe paid the little extra to be gold club, well worth the money. We were checked in on the bus....everything was taken care of. And we all had rooms close to the beach. Well worth it!!!!The shows that are offered every night are great. We had a blast at the karaoke bar most nights. Tons of fun. All ages are permitted in the club. So this was great for our younger guests. Beach chairs were never a problem for us. At anytime of the day we could head down to the beach and manage to round up enough chairs for our entire group. We NEVER went down bright and early to reserve chairs...this wasn't needed. Our tours were great. The Bavaro Runners was an amazing family tour. The only downfall is that almost no one speaks English. Not usually a big deal, but this makes things a little difficult when you're there for a wedding. Our wedding co-ordinator Gabby was amazing and translated most of our requests. Our wedding was truly the most amazing day. The flowers were incredible!! I did get my hair done at the resort. I do agree with another member...my hair was not the greatest and she did it many times. But I have to say that it was probably better than I could have done. Just not the same as what you would get here in Canada.I had the tram let me off prior to the gazebo and we walked up the path....everything was perfect. Try and remember that you are in another country and that maybe you should learn a little Spanish prior to leaving. This would have helped a lot.All in all I would recommend this resort to everyone. We all had a great time and have all commented that there will never be another holiday like this one ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1094,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1090},{"endOffset":1094,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1090},{"endOffset":1094,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1090},{"endOffset":1383,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1379}]}
