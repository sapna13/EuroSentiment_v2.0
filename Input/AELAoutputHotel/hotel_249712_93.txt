{"text":"Great hotel - Mediocre staff We booked direct with the hotel and got an executive room which was spacious, with a great bathroom though the view was poor. The breakfast in the executive lounge was good, with friendly staff (sometimes) just enough for a days sightseeing. The Shula's restaurant was fantastic and the meal well worth the cost, staff were very attentive too.Be very careful with your belongings - I left my bag in the hotel bar in the early hours of the morning (when there were only a few residents left), it was tucked away in a corner not in view. The bag wasn't handed in, even though the bar closed shortly after we left and i noticed it was missing before they re-opened. The bar had been cleaned but the bag wasn't handed in. When I reported it to reception they were not particularly interested and didn't even tell me to contact security. My husband went back later as he was less than happy about losing the cash, credit cards and my camera with all our pictures on from sightseeing in New York and Nashville for four days. Reception were more helpful this time and contacted security and the Bar Manager. We were told the Manager would contact us when he arrived in and had spoken to the cleaner, he never did and we had to keep on going back to ask security, going back over the details every time which when your trying to visit a city in three days is a waste of time. Losing the debit and credit cards almost ruined our trip as we were unable to do everything we planned as we only had the cash that my husband was carrying, fortunately we'd pre-paid for the hotel room and our passports weren't in there or we would have been stuck!Great centrally located hotel with the sort of staff often found in large cities.
