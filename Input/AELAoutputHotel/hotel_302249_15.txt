{"text":"Nice hotel, but a bit overpriced I booked an Oceanfront villa through Amex since they said that if an upgrade was available, I would be upgraded. When I got there, the villa front desk (it's different from the regular front desk) told us that the upgrades don't apply to villas. So we ended up staying at the villa we booked. The villas is in front of the ocean, but so is a bunch of other villas, which means that if you walk forward to see the ocean, you can see into the other people's villas and vice versa (not much privacy here). The so called plunge pool is not really a pool but a size of a jacuzzi which was a dissapointment. The inside of the room itself was really clean and nice, but not too big compared to other villas of Bali (had a bedroom, living room, walk-in closet, nice 2 person bathtub, shower etc). When we checked in, the butler drove us to the villa and told us to simply dial 0 to reach him. When I tried that, I always got the hotel operator and nobody could really tell me how to get in touch with my so called private butler (all they said was they would relay any request I had). Also, I was a bit surprised that many of the staff didn't speak English that well (if you asked for anything out of the oridinary, I had a hard time making them understand). As far as the grounds of the Ritz, there are lots of resuturants, pools, a private beach (nice, but lots of rocks so watch out) and activities to keep you busy. But the impression I got, was that in the main areas outsides of the villa area, it was a bit noisy and too many people to call it a relaxed atmosphere. Also the resturant prices are a bit pricy, but since the Ritz is away from everything else, you are baisically forced to eat all your meals here (for example a drink I had at the pool cost about $10). Also the grounds are nice for sure, but it doesn't have a Bali look to it. I felt like I could've been in Hawaii or Thailand and it would still look the same.Besides the resturants, some other prices that kind of surprised me:1) No free internet. They have wireless in the villas, but they charge about $10 \/ hour for it....ridiculous2) When I asked for transportation back to the airport, they told me it would cost me $30. I called a cab and ended up paying $7.I would've expected some these costs, but when you are already paying about $700 \/ night for the villas, can't they give me free interenet and a ride back to the airport as a service?Most of the staff was nice, but compared to some other Bali places, I felt that the friendly spirit that I love Bali for wasn't there.Overall I would have to say that for the price I was paying, I would've expected more and I wouldn't stay here again.
