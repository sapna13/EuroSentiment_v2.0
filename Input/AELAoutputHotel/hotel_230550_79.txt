{"text":"Great base for exploring Berlin! Wow! What can I say, this is such a well-located hotel for exploring Berlin! It is located metres from both the S  U-Bahn's and Alexanderplatz seems to be a 'main' station for many of the lines in Berlin so you can get to most places without needing to change trains!I've just come back from Berlin after staying 4 nights in this hotel with my boyfriend and have to say we were both more than happy with it. We got a good service at reception, the concierge was very helpful and they can provide you with the Berlin WelcomeCard should you wish to use that whilst over there.We were on the 26th floor and had magnificent views!As others have mentioned, the toilet\/shower facilities may be a touch different to what you expect but we were fine with the arrangement - for those that don't know, its an area within the bedroom that is sectioned off with frosted glass around it and so although you can't actually see the person, it may not be appropriate for those that don't know each other quite as well!Breakfast was included in our rate and it was quite a spread! Something for everyone! Yes it was busy, it's a big hotel at the end of the day, but not so much so that we couldn't find a table and there were many people working and they really were efficient at clearing tables etc!I genuinely can't think of any faults with the hotel, it delivered all we expected.We had a late arrival and this wasn't a problem with the hotel and also our flight home was not til early evening and they have an area where you can store your luggage safely until you need it which was at no charge.Overall, I think this hotel should definitely be considered to all those wanting to explore Berlin!
