{"text":"Beautiful hotel A brilliant location, we walked down to it from the main station but got a taxi back! The cobbled streets are a pain to drag suitcases over! All in all we had a lovely stay at this hotel, we visited it with 2 friends. Their room was bigger than ours, the window faced an inner courtyard which they found quite noisy as they had the noise from 3 other rooms surrounding the courtyard. Our room faced the rear of the hotel so no nice views for us, plus it was tiny. If I was to stay there again I would request a room with a view of the canal.The staff were very polite, place was spotlessly clean. There was complimentary coffee, tea, drinking chocolate and cakes, biscuits and fruit in the reception which was a nice touch. We didnt eat in the hotel as the street behind it is full of fabulous restaurants. Plus breckie was expensive at √à√\u2020√ü?4 per person. We walked to the flower market every morning for food, which was great and only a 5 minutes walk.The hotel is in a great location, 5 mins walk from Dam square but in a lovely quiet area. Would recommend it.The only bad part of our stay was the cleaners were very noisy, they woke us every morning at 8 - 830 slamming doors. Plus the morning we were leaving there was drilling and hammering going on in the hotel from 7:30am which was a total pain. They could have waited until a bit later to start making noise like that!! We complained and were offered a complimentary breakfast which we declined. But this probably almost never happens we were just unluckly.We paid 140 Euros a night for a double room... not bad for a 4star smack bang in the middle of Amsterdam ;-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":447,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":443},{"endOffset":643,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":637},{"endOffset":648,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":645},{"endOffset":648,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":645},{"endOffset":668,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":659},{"endOffset":678,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":673},{"endOffset":688,"mention":"biscuits","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Biscuit"],"startOffset":680},{"endOffset":732,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":728}]}
