{"text":"Quite good value, outstanding view Stayed for 2 nights in an Exec Level Room on the 24th floor (2406 I think), this is important because the view was just outstanding- the even numbered rooms had the harbour view.Check in was in the Lounge on the 29th floor, this was quick and efficient. The actual room was great, had a very clean and modern feel, did I mention the view? The room was spacious with twin beds as requested. I like the starched white comforters\/sheet combo as opposed to a blanket or bedspread - it looks and feels much more contemproray and clean. The room is divided off from the large bathroom by opaque glass\/door which I also love the look of. Pillows were feather but I think you could request an alternative. There were robes and slippers provided also. The bathroom was well appointed with a great separate shower as well as very deep bath. Double sink and hairdryer and lots of good towels.There was a lounge and comfy chair and coffee table within the room- also clean and comfortable. A flat screen TV and CD player also furnished this area. A large desk ran the length of the room and a computer with comp internet was in the room.The mini bar was very mini- just enough room to squeeze some milk into. A kettle and pretty average tea\/coffee was supplied but there was no complimentary water - a bit odd I thought.We had a fruit platter delivered on arrival.The perks of the Club Level were quite good although I think we were spoiled with our previous hotel (Regal Kowloon). The evening snacks were not plentiful - often the dishes were empty for some time, there was also a fairly limited range (compared wit Regal Kowloon), drinks were served on request. Breakfast was included as part of the Exec Level deal, it could be had in the Lounge or resaurant downstairs. We opted for the cafe- it was just OK, glad it was included.Staff were all helpful at every level, our housekeeping staff were very nice.We used the hotels shuttle service to the airport. The location was great- lots of litlle shops\/food outlets and the metro. I would definitely saty again.
