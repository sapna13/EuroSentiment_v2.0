{"text":"Comfortable and Charming Oasis We spent 2 nights in Mexico City at the end of a beach holiday. It was the week leading up to Easter and the City was hopping with Mexican families on holidays. The Four Seasons was our quiet oasis of calm to start and end the day. I booked the basic room (including breakfast) and it was lovely, overlooking the courtyard and on an upper floor. The view was outstanding and the room very quiet. Beautifully finished and furnished, we had everything we needed to unwind and refresh. Breakfasts and dinners were superb in the courtyard. The food was excellent and beautifully presented.(We ate one night at Pampano, a fish restaurant in the Polanca, which was very good but we preferred our dinner at the Four Seasons) for freshness, atmosphere and variety. Because the weather was cool, the hotel used the outdoor gas fireplaces and heat lamps to keep the patio invitingly warm. The exquisite gardens, outdoor sculpture and fountain added to the ambience. We arranged a driver\/guide for the day through the hotel, Raymondo, and he was excellent and truly made the day. He picked us up at 9:30 AM and took us on a wonderful tour of the city amidst all the crowds and traffic, always finding the perfect parking spot or dropping us off out front and then returning to pick us up. We then drove out of the city to the Dolores Olmedo Museum and gardens. Raymondo skillfully interpreted the Diego Rivera murals for us at the Palace and the paintings and sculpture at the Olmedo museum, adding so much to our enjoyment and understanding of the art, architecture and social\/political context. At the end of the day we had covered so much territory and sites. The private tour was worth every penny. All of the staff are excellent, friendly and very helpful. When we went to check out the computers were down so we were not able to see our bill on leaving. The only surprise is the charge they add for every taxi you take from the hotel. Although we always payed the driver and included the tip, the hotel also adds a surcharge, which we found surprising. Loved the hotel and location and would highly recommend it. Worth a splurge!
