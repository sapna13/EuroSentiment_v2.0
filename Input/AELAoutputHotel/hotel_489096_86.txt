{"text":"All Around Excellent! World Tower is an excellent choice! I had read many of the reviews on this site before booking my recent two-week stay with Meriton Reality at World Tower. My stay, in a one bedroom on the 36th floor, was truly excellent. I should mention the following:1. The apartment was spacious, very nice, and like new, with great balconys, furntiture, etc., and they provide more than enough clean dishes, pots, etc to make great use of the apartment while there.2. The room service I received was excellent. Daily they tidy up and provide more than enough new dishwashing and laundry detergents, towels, etc., and they often cleaned up thoroughly which even included doing any dishes that needed it at that time.3. The amenities were superb. I used either the gym, pool, sauna, or whirlpool every day and they were always available and had great views.4. The location was ideal. World Square at the ground level and beneath has lots of restaurants, markets, other shopping. I was also just a short walk to Darling Harbor, the Queen Victoria Building, Sky Tower, etc.The only drawback I saw is that parking can be expensive if you want to use a car ($30\/day), no one ever did replace a lightbulb I had twice mentioned was out in my room entrance, and while the elevators are nice they can take some time waiting for one on weekends. All said, I believe it is a much much better value and location than what I saw for hotels at comparable prices. I would stay there again.
