{"text":"Absolutely Delightful!!! I stayed at the Riu Taino on February 20th -27th with my husband, my parents, and my brother and his wife. We had an excellent time at the Dominican. It was the first time I've stayed at a Riu hotel, and I must say it is 'top notch'.Here's my overall review from the flight to the food to the beach:Flight: We travelled with Skyservice. Being 5'10'' myself and my husband being 6'4'', we found it very uncomfortable. The seats were cramped with absolutely no leg room. My 5'0'' sister in law also found it tight herself. Other than that, it was a safe smooth ride to beautiful Punta Cana.Arrival: As we arrived to the Punta Cana airport we got out luggage and boarded our Coco Tours bus in a matter of 20-30 mins - and then we were off to the Riu Taino.Hotel: The first impression of the hotel was the size. It is pretty grand - including it's own street 'Caribbean Street'. As we got there at around 11:30, we were informed that the hotel room would not be available until 1 p.m. - they informed us that we could leave our baggage there or within their office and go and have some drinks and lunch. We arrived back at the front desk at around 1:15 and our rooms were ready. The busboy helped us take our luggage to our rooms.The Room: The rooms were 'ok'. Despite being a little dated, it was extremely clean. There were always clean linen, towels, etc everyday. They even made some cute ducks? or was it snakes? - not sure, out of towels and the little red flowers located throughout the hotel compound. There's a safe deposit box in each room. Each safe had a separate barrel; therefore, it would be impossible for anyone to break into your safe. The fridges were always stocked with cold beer and soda pop - and the 4 litre jug of water. There were never any roaches, ants or other insects in our rooms.The Beach: Absolutely beautiful. That's the reason we visited Punta Cana again. You can walk for miles along the beach and visit the other Riu hotels. The Food: My favourite part! Being from the Caribbean myself (West Indian) we enjoy a little spice in our food. Breakfast, lunch and dinner were exceptionally great. We visited one of the a la carte, but it happens to be a buffet as well, so it wasn't much different. The main buffet suited us just fine. We were served fresh seafood almost everyday. From lobster, crabs, calamari, fish, shrimp, you name it! One day they had stewed beef and rice - delicious. The desserts were plentiful - from pastries, to cakes to freshly cut fruit. My favourite was the sour sap and papaya. The Pizza: I've had pizza at many different resorts in the caribbean, this one is my favourite. The cheese pizza is absolutely delicious.Overall, the Riu experience was absolutely great. I would definitely return to the hotel in the future.
