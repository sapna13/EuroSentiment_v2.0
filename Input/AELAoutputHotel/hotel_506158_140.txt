{"text":"Hotel 1898 - Luxury and Location We recently returned from a trip to Spain, including Barcelona, where we stayed at the Hotel 1898. We had read several reviews of this hotel; most were positive, some were not. We would absolutely recommend this beautiful hotel for adults travelling without children.The hotel's central location on the La Rambla was perfect, and after a busy and crowded day signhtseeing, the hotel's quiet and sophisticated interior was like a calming oasis for us. Although we did not eat in the hotel, we made use of the luxurious roof deck, with its pool and deep upholstered chaises (in some cases, as large as full sized beds) to read and relax. The sunsets were glorious from the roof and the roof bar served fabulous cocktails. Yes, the drinks were pricey, but certainly in line with a hotel of this quality.Our room faced a side street off La Rambla, which was great since there was a three-day festival going on during our stay, resulting in huge crowds and lots of activity. Although our room was a bit small, it had a high ceiling and luxurious appointments. We were especially impressed with the lighting and dimming control system and how well buffered we were from the noise outside. Our stay cost us $2,200.00 USD for fournights and five days in a Superior room.We had read previous reviews which were critical of the hotel's staff. We found the staff to be curteous, friendly and very helpful.Since we were arriving in Barcelona early in the morning, the hotel made arrangements to have our room ready for us earlier then the normal check-in time, secured our luggage and made a safe available for our use. With reference to the safety within and without the hotel, the staff stressed using the room safe for our valuables and being aware of the people around us in the streets while touring the city. We never had any problems or felt unsafe in Barcelona. Our favorite place to eat a light and scrumpous breakfast was Escriba, only as few blocks from the hotel. Be realistic about prices since the US Dollar is weak compared to the Euro. Expect to pay around $30.00 USD for two mini quiches, coffee, bottles of water and one (fantastic) chocolate croissant. You should make dinner reservations for popular restaurants or expect to wait until 10:00 p.m. or later to have dinner. We would suggest purchasing the one or two day tourist bus pass which provides an excellent overview of the city. You can get off and back on the bus as often as you like during a twelve hour period, allowing you to visit sites of interest for as long as you wish.Barcelona is a city not to be missed, especially if you appreciate fantastic architecture, both old and new.
