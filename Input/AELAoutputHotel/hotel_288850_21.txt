{"text":"Abysmal service The Dorint Sofitel advertises itself as having every facility, but what they neglect to mention is that they require a deposit before you use anything. It's probably the worst hotel we've ever stayed in. It's not terribly clean, and the staff are rude.When we checked into the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√\u2020aving paid for our night's stay and breakfast in advance√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√∂e were further asked for a deposit of √à√\u2020√ü?0 before we could use any hotel facilities. We paid this. Then we made about four short international calls and were informed that those four short international calls had used up our deposit, and asked to come down and pay them more money. We said we would not like to, since we were exhausted after a long flightand not sleeping the whole night as well as the whole day, so could someone come and collect the money from us? After all, the hotel advertises itself as a super-luxury four-star hotel. The staff and the managers I spoke to flatly refused to send anyone to collect the money and were in fact rude, saying that since other guests had cheated them, we would have to pay the penalty for that. So, for instance, if you want room service, and you don't happen to have a credit card, you have to first go and pay a deposit at the reception.What I completely fail to understand√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√ëespite having travelled all over the world and stayed at a fairly large number of different hotels√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√§s how any hotel can get away with such extreme rudeness and disregard for its guests. I've never encountered this before. The whole attitude of the manager was that the hotel was doing us a great favour. Is this because we had already paid for our stay and therefore they felt they could behave in any which way they wanted? I don't know. What I do know is that I booked this stay in this hotel with the expectation that it would have all reasonable facilities and they would not treat me as if I were a criminal-in-waiting, especially when I had consistently and constantly paid what they had asked them for, and was in fact willing to comply with their requests for yet more, only asking them to fulfill their part, i.e. provide good service. Is it not misleading and inaccurate to advertise oneself as a four-star luxury hotel when one is not willing to provide good service or be courtesy to one's guests? Had I known of these policies, I would never have stayed at their hotel, and I strongly feel these policies ought to be outlined on their Web site so that any traveller can make an informed decision regarding where they want to stay, and not be duped into paying a large amount of money for services which are then considered to be pending payment regardless. In short, what they are saying is that they will not cheat us, while we will certainly cheat them. ","annotations":[]}
