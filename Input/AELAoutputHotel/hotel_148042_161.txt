{"text":"The Best I have been to Puerto Rico five times, and I have stayed at several different hotels, the Hilton, Mariott, Westin, and the El conquistador, and I am convinced that the Ritz Carlton is truly the most magnificent.  The staff will go out of there way to make the trip enjoyable for you. And even will remeber your name. I think the service alone exemplifies the level of elegance of this property.  The lobby is fantastic, simply beautiful, and features a very uspcale casino. Concierge was very helpful, it is my suggestion that you make reservations with them for Pelican Dumas.  The guestrooms are a normal size, but have a special Ritz touch to them. The bed was very comfy.  On the grounds there is a magnificent pool, two tennis courts, and a full spa. And best of all the beach is probably the best in puerto Rico and only steps away.  At night the Ritz is a little dull, however, its location affords its guest to be able to walk to nearby hotels that are much more lively. But if you want to have a quiet relaxing night the lobby bar is great, and the casino is also fun.  Overall, this place caters to all of its guests, it welcomes business\/leisure travelers, is great for families or couples. What separates this property from all others in Puerto Rico are staff who really pamper their guests, and luxurious accomadations brought to a whole new level. ","annotations":[]}
