{"text":"An Excellent choice for families We just completed a 6 night stay at this hotel. We were a group of six with 3 adults and 3 young children. This hotel was an excellent choice for our family. The location is excellent and easy walking distance to most activities in Honolulu that would interest a family with young children, including the aquarium, the zoo, the beach which is right across the street, plus most activities on the main strip. The units are very large with 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, a large living room, a full dining room, and a full kitchen. It easily accommodated our family. There is also quite a bit of closet space which let us fully unpack. Even with 6 people, we never felt crowded and with 3 televisions there was no fighting and everyone could do their own thing. We had booked a partial ocean view room, but were upgraded to a full ocean view on arrival (thank you to the hotel staff). The view from the lanai, which was also very large, was amazing. A sweeping view of the ocean, plus a great view of Diamond Head to boot. The only annoyance was some noise that came from an air conditioning unit on an adjacent property, but it was not horrible just a constant hum and you could only hear this from the lanai.The staff at this hotel is extremely friendly and helpful and the doormen always greet you with a smile. They were happy to assist or offer advise with anything we needed. The hotel provides fresh towels for the beach, and also beach chairs, mats, umbrellas, inflatable rafts, and sand toys.You just pick these up in the lobby and walk across the street to the beach. When you come back, you just drop them off in the lobby as well, so no wet towels or sandy beach toys in the room. The beach across the street from the hotel is excellent for children as it has a breakwater wall that cuts down the waves. Most other beachs in Wakiki would be difficult for young children or poor swimmers to use because of the rough surf. Free valet parking and free internet access (wired and pretty fast) was also a plus. The lobby was a little dated, and the furniture in the room, was a little worn, but none of this was too bad and everything was very clean. With young children, we don't mind some furntiure with a few dings in it as it makes us less nervous. All of the hotels in Wakiki take a beating because they are right on the beach and people are constantly dragging sand and wet shoes through them. The hotel is currently doing renovations (but we never heard any noise from this) and I understand that the lobby and all of the rooms will be redone shortly. Having use of a full kitchen was great. Its much easier with a large group to have everyone eat breakfast on their own schedule then trying to get everyone up and out. We also saved a lot of money as breakfast is expensive in Honolulu. The kitchen had everything you would need, including an icemaker in the refrigerator door. There are no restaurants or bars in the hotel, as its setup more like an apartment building then a hotel but that is really not an issue. You are surrounded by restaurants and hotel bars all within easy walking distance. We went to The Cheesecake Factory, California Pizza Kitchen, Oceanarium, the Shorebird Broiler, and Cheeseburger in Paradise. All good choices for young children.On the whole I thought this was a very good value and was a better option that renting two smaller rooms at another hotel.
