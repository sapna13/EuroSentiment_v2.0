{"text":"Best Value in Boston's Back Bay When I booked a room at the Charlesmark for $129 per night, I was nervous. How could a new hotel in the heart of Boston's Back Bay be so affordable? After spending a night there, I am still asking that question ... for it was a clean, stylish hotel in a prime location with a room rate that is at least $50 cheaper than anything else I've found in the area.As promised, the front desk attendant told me that we'd have a quiet room on the sixth floor (room 606). The room was designed in a contemporary style similar to West Elm. Design was also functional, allowing for maximum room in a tight space. For example, here was no minifridge; instead, there was a minicooler on a media case shelf that held two free bottles of spring water. Keep in mind that this room spacewise is fine for two people, but you'll have to upgrade to the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ larger room type for a party of three. The in-room TV had hundreds of channels, including Fox Sports stations for at least a dozen regional areas (ex. Arizona, Pittsburgh). XM music channels were also available through the TV ... and broadcast into the bathroom with an adjustable volume control.The bathroom had a stone-like decor and featured a good assortment of amenities, including two lollipops in the toothbrush holder. The water had great pressure and almost instantly adjusted to my preferred temperature preferences.Incredibly, the room rate includes a continental breakfast in the lounge. Several newspapers were available to read as we munched on bagels, fresh fruit, and oatmeal.The attendant was the only staffperson we saw during our stay; she was polite and showed me a larger room upon my request (I was curious to see what the extra money would've gotten us). The size of the rooms made me question the accessibility of the lodging options, but she informed me that there are two accessible rooms on the property.The style of the Charlesmark makes it great for romantics and hipsters, while the price and location of the hotel is a rare find for families and budget travelers. I need to find an excuse to return!
