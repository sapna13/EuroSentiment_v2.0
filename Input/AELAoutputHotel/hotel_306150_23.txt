{"text":"Overrated We booked this hotel based on the Lonely Planet review which listed it in the Top range hotels section. Part of my disappointment came from this - it is not by any means a Top range. But for the price you pay (about GBP65 per night) it seems to be a good enough value for Singapore.Now facts on the table. The hotel is not very spacious, lobby has a reception desk, taxi desk and two benches and that's it. Club dancing music is played there at any time of day. You have to change lifts to get your room, 2 lifts bring you up to the restaurant level (over-air-conditioned - I felt like putting a jacket on every time I transferred from one lift to the other), and 2 other lifts on the other side of the hall take you up to the rooms. The corridor leading to the room was like an industrial building's one - feels like being in a factory (oldish decoration is partly to blame).The room was cramped (we had a Glasshauz room), barely enough space to go around the queen bed. Musty smell that some other people also mentioned. Aircon was too strong even though we put it to +25, so both of us woke up next day with throat pain. Towels seemed to be sitting in the room for a long time as they also had the same smell, which was gone once they were changed the next day, but wiping yourself with hte first set felt pretty disgusting. Also, they left lots of small fibres on your skin, and being a contact lens wearer I suffered some issues with that! Bathroom was OK but quite small.
