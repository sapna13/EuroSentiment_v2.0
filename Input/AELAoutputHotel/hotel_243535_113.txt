{"text":"Never Ever Want To Come Back I usually stay across the street at the Monticello Inn, but since they were booked and the Fusion was a new hotel I thought I would give it a try. From the very beginning (at check in) it seemed that no one really knew what they were doing. The check in process seemed to last for days. The room that I was assigned to was an accessible room. Which was also located next to a storage room little did I know that it also meant that there would be a constant loud motor humming sound\/vibration to my room. Although there is free high speed internet, it's not wireless...so remember to bring your own cord or else be prepared to be charged a fee.The bed was hard, and the room was warm (no AC) so I had to make do with fans to cool my room off. The shower head was broken so a sit down shower was my only option.The valet parking is not actually with the hotel. They work with another company, so they can only guess what is going on with your car. I tried to fit my car into their valet area, I told the bell captain\/concierge who then said that my car would get ticketed if I left it there. Instead of moving the car himself he asked me to move it because he didn't know when the valet service was going to be picking up the car. I had to get back into my car and move it myself...why was I paying over $30 a day for?It doesn't feel as though many of the workers at Hotel Fusion have a clear understanding about what their job is or what customer service means. I really do suggest paying more to stay somewhere else. ","annotations":[]}
