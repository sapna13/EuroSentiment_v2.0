{"text":"had a good weeks stay This is a well loctated hotel if you are in town to shop as its close to the main shopping centres. If you are in town for work there are possibly better hotels for you - though the north-south mrt station is about 10 minutes walk away (in 34c heat.) Conveniently outside was a Starbucks if you want something better than the nescafe they provide in the room though the hotel has a rather nice looking coffee shop too.There were two issues that let my stay down; before i get to them the most important things with a singapore hotel (for me anyway): the bed was really comfortable, the shower was great and the air conditioning worked really well (though the controls are baffling all red and green lights.) Its a hotel well designed for business travelers with power sockets on the top of a large desk and internet access is included with the room rate. There were 3 easily accessibly power sockets in the room; one by the desk, one under the large tv and one under the bedside table. The first downside of my stay was that the internet access was terribly slow even something like uploading a couple of photos to flickr repeatedly failed; and the wireless disappeared completely for the last two days of my stay.The biggest upset was when i dropped something under the bed and had to look under it. There was room service food, pills and general mess which suggests that the cleanliness was more about appearance than substance. That surprised me because to that point I was impressed - the mains even folded my clothes into tidy piles when i left them on top of the desk chair.
