{"text":"Great Position and Very Friendly Staff My and Wife and I stayed at the Argonaut from May 4th to May 7th on our honeymoon, the hotel is in a superb location on Fishersmans Wharf directly next to the Powell  Hyde Cable Car turnaround station. The hotel staff were very friendly, when we arrived we were informed that we had been upgraded to a Junior Suite, number 251, the hotel management also sent a bottle of champagne to help us celebrate our honeymoon, a really nice touch. Our room had a view over the Bay directly looking at Alcatraz, the room was only on the second floor so the view probably wasn't as good as rooms on floors above us. The lounge area in our Junior suite had a tv and dvd player, so did the bedroom, the bathroom had a deep jacquzzi bath which was fantastic. It was a really busy weekend on the Wharf and having read other reports about this hotel I expected noise to be a problem, however, noise was not apparent at all and our room overlooked a busy road and we were only on the 2nd floor so if noise was a problem surely we would have experienced it, the only noise we heard was from the room above where a couple had a big argument and then made up in a natural way, very noisy! I believe the standard rooms at the hotel are small and most complaints probably come from guests staying in these rooms, so i recommend you paying a little bit more and upgrading to higher room grades. Each evening at the hotel they hold a wine tasting gathering at 5pm for one hour, this is great to meet other guests and share stories of your trips and travels. Tips to make your stay extra enjoyable are as follows: 1\/ if you like to dine at the best places then try the number one french restaurant in town Gary Danko, it really is a fantastic dining experience and just one block up Hyde Street from the hotel, advance table bookings are essential, call [--]. 2\/ Enjoy a tour on an original San Francisco Mack 55 Fire Engine, this fun 90min tour for $45 takes you through the streets of San Francisco and then over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausilito, a short stop to take pictures and then back over the Bridge to the City, fantastic value, telephone [--] or go to [--], this is a husband and wife run business and their obvious passion for the job guarantees that you will have a great tour. 3\/ When going on the Cable Car get a muni ticket which allows unlimited travel, the cost is $11 per day or $18 for 3 days, this then covers travel on all San Franciso Cable Cars and Buses, this is great value when you consider that each single journey on cable car will cost you $5. When we come back to SFO we will definite choose the Argonaut again but we will also stay in the beautiful town of Sausilito which is just over the Golden Gate bridge. Book and Enjoy!
