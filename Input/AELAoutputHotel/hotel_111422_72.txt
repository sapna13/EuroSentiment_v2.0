{"text":"Nice Hotel, Good Rates, 'Expensive' Location Let me start off by saying that the Doubletree was an excellent hotel. Why would I give it a less-than-perfect rating you ask? One word: location.The hotel itself was quite nice. Very clean, accomodating\/helpful staff, and welcomed accomodations. The price for the room wasn't as good of a deal as initially thought though. Booked the room in advance for $80\/night, compared to a regular $120. However, the special rates apply to non-suites, which are smaller-than-average rooms that are typically near the elevators. Foot traffic wasn't extremely noticeable, but there were random occassions over the extended weekend where we were woken up by people coming back in for the night.Check-in was a breeze, and the staff was helpful. Didn't balk when we arrived a couple of hours before check-in time, and even offered us a room on a higher floor due to a performance at the jazz club that night. Check-out went just a smooth, and the hotel did not mind when we left the car in their garage for a few extra hours.Two other small quips are that the TV was a small set, and housekeeping comes EARLY (8:30am on Saturday morning), so make sure to put the knob hanger out the night before.Now, onto the 'location'. The hotel sits right off an exit from the Mass Pike, which makes it easy enough to get to. That's where the travel ease ends, though. The hotel is not close to any public transportation. The closest T stop is Harvard Square in Cambridge, which is a $7 dollar cab ride away. However, that requires you to travel through Cambridge on the T before you get back into Boston. The hotel does offer a free semi-hourly shuttle to here, and other destinations w\/in Boston, but it was rarely on-time and it was hard to line up the schedules with our own. Its service also ends early in the evening (schedule says 9pm, but we found it to be closer to 8-8:30). You can request a shuttle at a specific time within the designated operation hours, but you need to give at least 2 hours advanced notice.In light of all of these issues, cabs become your best friend during the stay, but they get very expensive very quickly. You can get to just about anywhere west of Rt. 93 for $20 or less, but the frequency of needing a cab adds up. The cab drivers are well aware of the hotel's ill-fated location, so there will be a bevy of them sitting in wait in the hotel's circular drive.Parking is also a compound expense, charging $20\/night in the garage. A little ridiculous, but actually comparable to most private garages in the city.In all, the hotel does what it can to make its location less of an issue, and otherwise it is a very nice hotel. However, if you are a person who is more budget-aware than most, you may want to keep looking as you consider the 'unstated' expenses of staying here.
