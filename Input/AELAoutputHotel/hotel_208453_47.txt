{"text":"Great Location, Good view, friendly Staff I've been to New York City many times for business and vacations but never stayed in this hotel. I was headed to Canada on business when American cancelled my flight at the last minute. Frustrating after checking my bags in and then getting the flight cancelled. While waiting for my bags I was looking for a hotel to book at the last minute. Many hotels were full. I saw that this one was available so I booked it. There weren't too many options and I was frustrated as I didn't expect to have to book a hotel in NYC. I just flew in for a quick meeting and then was expecting to head to Montreal on another meeting that day.I called the hotel and they confirmed a suite on a high floor. $400 + tax rate. I took a taxi and promptly checked into the hotel. Everything was quick and easy at the front desk and they had my room waiting. A bit strange since you have to take an elevator from the ground floor up to the lobby and then another set of elevators up to the rooms. I had a room on the 35th floor and it was very spacious with an amazing view. Surprisingly it was quiet even though it faced Times Square. The location couldn't be better as you are in the heart of the action. There is an entrance from Time Square or another entrance on 44th Street as well. There is a bar off the front desk area. Nothing super high end but it was busy when I checked in.The room was comfortable with a King bed that was comfortable, a good sized bathroom, LCD TV and a couch and desk. View was great. Friendly staff with no problems at all. Pay to play internet that was $21 per day and it worked glitch free. There are higher end hotels in NYC but this location is great if you want to be in the heart of the action. ","annotations":[]}
