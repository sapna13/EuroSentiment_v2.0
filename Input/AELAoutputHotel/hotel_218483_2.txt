{"text":"Worst holiday ever For the past 2 years my wife and I were told by numerous people that the Dominican Republic was a great place to go for a quiet and relaxing holiday. So we decided to give it a go, and booked the Carabella Bavaro Resort.When we arrived at the Resort, we were greeted by a very polite person at the main desk who booked us in and organised a bellboy to take our luggage to the room. We thought then that this was going to be a lovely holiday. How wrong we were.On arriving to our room, the first thing we smelt when entering, was a musky damp odour. It was in the room the whole duration of the holiday, no matter how often we had the A\/C on or windows open. The room was also very dated, the TV didnt have a remote. The room fridge only had a bottle of water in it, and all the resort information leaflets on the table were only written in Spanish.In the Bathroom, the towel rail was hanging off the wall, the bath had a red stain in it(at first we thought it was blood, but couldnt remove it). The bath and Toilet were also filthy, and the ceiling was falling through.There were 3 pools on the resort, all with a bar, the main pool had a swim up bar. The problem was, that the 2 other pools had bars but were never open, so not many people used these pools. And the main pool was always littered with dead insects and bits of thatch roof from the swim bar.The beach was nice, but always in the shade due to all the palm trees right up to the waters edge.The food was layed out beautifully, but didnt taste as well as it looked. And I fell victim to the dreaded stomach problems towards the end of the week. The so called Pizza parlour, Creperie and Mexican restaurants did not exist. The only place for food was the main restaraunt, or you could get a burger and chips on the beach.Apart from the man on the main entrance desk, the rest of the staff only spoke Spanish, and looked utterly miserable throughout our stay. It might have something to do with, the staff didnt seem to get a day off the the whole time we were there.There was no entertainment in the evenings, so if you wanted to do something after you had eaten in the evening. All you had was the bar. So it was back to the apartments to watch TV which we had never done before on a holiday anywhere.Im afraid the only thing enjoyable was the sunshine, which really was great.We wont be going back to the Dominican Republic again, all because this resort has put us off.
