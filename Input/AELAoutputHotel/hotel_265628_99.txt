{"text":"Very Impressed We stayed at the Sirenis Tropical Suites from March 2 until March 13, 2008. We were very pleased with the resort despite having read some of the reviews. Either the people complaining were at some other resort or they are just chronic complainers, as we did not encounter any of the problems that they wrote about. The ride from the airport is long but it was no big deal. Once we arrived, the check in process was fast and efficient. The bellboy took our luggage to our rooms immediately. The resort is well laid out and definitely not huge like some of the resorts in the Punta Cana area. You could enjoy a leisurely walk to all amenities at this resort, which is extremely well kept and very pretty. The staff are always working to keep everything clean. They are always smiling or singing and never pass by you without saying Hola. The animation staff are fun and you can get involved with their activities if you want or just say no thanks and they will leave you alone. Our adult children joined us for the first week of our vacation. They had so much fun that when it was time to go home, they were very sad. Our daughter's boyfriend had never been to an all inclusive resort and he had the best time ever. He got involved with the activities, had so much fun and can hardly wait to go away again next year. They are already saving for it. The pool was lovely and very well kept. The beach was great too. During the time we were there, the ocean was fairly calm. You could walk the beach for miles in either direction. It is not very developed in this area and the beach is just naturally beautiful. The food at the resort was great. We have travelled to many resorts and this resort has had the best food by far. We enjoyed the a' la carte restaurants but were just as pleased with the buffet. They even had lobster and shrimp at the buffet one night. The beach grill had wonderful chicken but the hamburgers were pretty good too. The resort allows vendors to come in every other evening. We found these people to be over priced and pretty rude for the most part. We visited the beach vendors on either side of the resort and found the souvenirs we wanted for alot less money. I found the vendors to the right of the resort to be a little more aggessive than the ones to the left. We had some good laughs with the vendors to the left. We met the twin brothers Paul and Ramon who have the ATV's, deep sea fishing, etc. They were wonderful to talk to. We didn't book any excursions but would not have hesitated if that was what we were looking for. We walked down the beach one night when the locals had a bonfire going. They were fishing and having a good time. They welcomed us, showed our son how they fish with their water bottle and fishing line. They let my son try it and he caught a little crab. Paul and Ramon are business men who want people to have a good time and feel safe. That is what keeps a good business going. We went back the next day and finished our shopping with Ramon's help. I look forward to going back to the Sirenis Tropical and visiting with the twin brothers again someday. As I said, we have been to lots of resorts and this one is definitely worth a return trip.
