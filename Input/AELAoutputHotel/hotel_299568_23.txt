{"text":"At Best Cheap - At Worst Shabby, Frayed and Old I cannot recommend this hotel unless you receive a substantial discount over the rack rates quoted.My family and I have just returned from a week long stay at this hotel and were extremely unsatisified with the poor mangement and apparent lack of properly trained staff.The hotel is old and shabby around the edges. The beach (as is apparent freom some of the other more balanced reviews) is nothing to wite home about. The beachside consists of a narrow band of sand which is normally covered by washed up seaweed and is located at what can only be described as an extremely busy and noisy water sports centre. The location of the hotel at the end of the Benoa strip is extremely inconvenient if you have to travel into Kuta or Seminyak (we did). Its approximately 40 mins there and 40 mins back whatever the time of day. These things are not the fault of the Novotels mangament but by the same token nothing that they can be proud about.As for the staff, they were pleasant enough and were in some instances willing, however we got the distinct impression they were not properly trained or managed. We took breakfast nearly everyday at the same table (or thereabouts) and normally at the same time. We were invarialy greeted by a different waiter everyday. The same waiters were all present within the outlet but seemingly assigend to different areas each day. To my mind that smacks of incompetant managment since the guest and staff are not allowed to build up any kind of rapport in those circumstances and it is quite often the breakfast waiter who is first representative of the hotel you will see in the morning. It is important in those circumstances to seize the opportunity to make an good impression . Unfortunately the Novotel mangement did not. Another point of irritation was the waiting staffs invariable inability to deliver coffee and milk at the same time. Waiting staff walk around with coffee tea pots but do not (unless requested) think to ask if milk was required. We had to ask for milk everyday and everyday the milk was delivered after our coffee became cold. These are admittedly minor irritations in nature but it is attention to detail that makes a good management team and it is the minor irritations that stick in guests minds upon reflection.As for the pools, they were adequate but there is a disticnt lack of service available. No waiters\/staff were evident to take orders and to make sure guests were properly attended to. We had to go to a nearby outlet each time we needed drinks etc. Again poor management\/training.All in all, the best way to describe this Hotel would be cheap, however at worst, this Hotel is poorly managed, old, frayed, shabby and poorly located.I took some time to research this hotel and looked at the other reviews before we went. I would say that some of the more balance reviews are spot on (with regard to being old, the beach being poor, etc) . However some of the more glowing reviews I would have to view with some suspicion, the glowing reviews bore no resemblance to what we experienced and I have my suspicions that rather than being independant reviews of actual experiences are more like (management) self praise and at worst dishonest.
