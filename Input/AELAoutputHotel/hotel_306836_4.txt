{"text":"Such a dissapointment I stayed in Inna Grand Bali with my fiancee for 2 nights. I was there last year and it was nice, so I decided to return with my fiancee. We were fasting, so when we arrived and the welcome drink was served to us, we thought of saving the drinks for later and asked them to deliver the drinks into our room. The staff at the reception just said No, you can drink it here later. I personally thought it was rude of him. Not only that, we were given our roomkey, and that's all! Nobody seemed to care to walk us into our room, so we walked ourselves into our room.Drawbacks (aside than those mentioned above):1. Uncomfortable and old bed..some of the bed's surfaces were not as firm as the others.2. Small bathroom with a very old tub.3. Strange odor since the room might have been unoccupied for some times (smell of fungus).4. Lousy Pay TV. Not worthy of paying 8 US$..just 4 ordinary movies which were played over and over again.5. Lousy breakfast for those who are fasting. On the second day, they served chicken porridge, fried rice-noodle, fried egg, which were so so (you can get it in any restaurants outside, with a much better taste and much much cheaper price), not a breakfast spread you'd be hoping in a 5-star hotel.The only good thing about it would be the hotel environment, which was clean and green, and that the garden was beautiful. I regret taking my fiancee here, and I definitely will not return again.
