{"text":"Great Hotel, Great staff, All round Big Hitter Stayed at Jury√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Boston from 25th December to 1st January 2007. After arriving at 8.00pm we were met by the staff in a very friendly manner √à√\u2020\u2022?they couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do too much to help. Room was on the 9th floor and very comfortable. Both room and bathroom were of a good size and equipped with all required amenities other than tea\/coffee making facilities which we did really miss, especially with jet-lag on the first few days. The location of the hotel is very good as it is two blocks from Copley Square, and a few more blocks to the Prudential Centre. Newbury Street is also 3 blocks away where the designer boutiques such as Cartier, Valentino and Jimmy Choo located. We used the nearby T station to get around, but when we returned to the airport, we simply asked the concierge to organize a taxi for us. Cuffs Irish bar on the ground floor was very reasonably priced √à√\u2020\u2022?similar prices to outside of the hotel and comparable to UK prices. The staff again were very friendly and helpful. Food was served very quickly and was standard pub fayre √à√\u2020\u2022?if you are looking for anything other than traditional American fries etc then this is probably not the best place to eat, although they do recommend some really good restaurants close by √à√\u2020\u2022?the concierge can make reservations for you. One in particular was Davio√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Italian restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022?just one block away and a really good break from fries and burgers √à√\u2020\u2022?we can highly recommend the tagliatelle Bolognese. We can also recommend the hotel for morning coffee in Il Barista on the first floor √à√\u2020\u2022?much better than Starbucks (two blocks away). Other good restaurants in the area are √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022?appa-Razzi√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?again an Italian restaurant with very good Bruschetta as an appetizer √à√\u2020\u2022?one is enough for two people √à√\u2020\u2022?don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try the calzone though unless you have a poor sense of smell. Kashmir Indian restaurant on Newbury Street was also really good although service could be better. They tried to take away our starter plates before we had even finished √à√\u2020\u2022?this was different from the usual standard in America were we usually end up with our main courses before we have even finished the starters.Hired a car for a few days √à√\u2020\u2022?car rental itself is reasonably priced but beware of Valet parking charges as it cost $40 each night and there was no option of self parking √à√\u2020\u2022?other car parks around were similarly priced.
