{"text":"This resort was easily one of the very best we have ever been at. My husband and myself were at the Palladium Bavaro from Jan. 18th - 25th 2008. The food was very good, and they have recently changed the policy about the a la carte restaurants. You no longer need reservations, and you can go as many times as you please, or you can also go to the buffets, which also change each day, and are also great. The room was very clean, huge bathroom with large two person jaccuzi tub, separate shower, and separate toilet area. Too many bars and restaurants to list.  Service was also very good, with great effort made by all to speak the different languages. Most employees are better in French than English, simply because French is quite close to Spanish. Beach is great , very, very long, and you can literally walk all day on the beach if you don't forget to turn around. My husband finnshed his scuba diving certification there, and the Dolin Dive center was excellent. They are SSI certified, not Padi, but they did have a PADI cert. instructor to sign off on my husband's referal dives. We also both went on the diving trip to Catalina Island and the diving there was good, but not comparable to Cozumel, Roatan, etc. Great for beginners though, which my husband obviously is. We used both Jonathan (husband) and Juan Carlos (me) as Dive Masters, and I was impressed with the safety and security for all concerned. I had a less than pleasant experience with another well known dive company in Mexico last year, so this was a bit of a surprise at how good they were. The resort is very large so be prepared to walk a fair bit each day. There are trains that go around on a regular basis, but if you don't wish to wait, be prepared to walk. After eating way too much good food every day, taking long walks was just what we needed anyway. We will definitely go back, as for the price we paid, and the quality we received, it can't be beat.
