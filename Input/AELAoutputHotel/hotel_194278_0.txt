{"text":"Loved the Artus With my best friend, we stayed at the Artus Hotel for five days, at the beginning of December. We chose this hotel after extensive research and based on reviews. Generally, the hotel met our expectations. Our room √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√™√Øwin bedded deluxe- was small, but we expected that, since most rooms in Paris are small. But its design was clever, and the furnishing well appointed. For two women travelling with quite a lot of things and clothes, the space was adequate. The room was fairly clean, the beds comfortable, the shower lovely, and the temperature delightedly warm, since the weather was very cold. A free PC in the lobby offered no-cost internet access. Also the room had an electronic safe, which is something that I always find extremely useful. As most people in this site mention, the location of the hotel is truly unbeatable. At the centre of Paris, in an area full of shops, bistros and cafes. I would recommend the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºe Relais de l√à√\u2020\u2022?Entrecote√à√\u2020\u2022? the Brasserie Lipp, and the Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ de Flore for its excellent hot chocolate and pastries. Just across the street there is a metro station, and a taxi station. But even for those who like to walk, some of the most popular attractions, like the Louvre and the Notre Dame, are quite near. Finally, I can not agree more with other people√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ comments about the quality of service provided by the concierge Sanjay. This man really enjoys his work and it shows, in the way that he tries his best to satisfy the requests of all guests with the best possible way. We asked his help to book some opera tickets before our arrival, and he even called us to confirm all the details. I have stayed in many 5 star hotels in my life, all over the world, and I can definitely say that such level of professionalism is rare. Also another concierge, Karim, was very polite and I was impressed with his help when I had a small incident, I cut my hand. We will definately consider the Artus for our next trip to Paris.
