{"text":"Great Location and Accommodation The location is great. It's close to everything, Darling Harbour, Aquarium, Pubs, restaurants, China Town, CBD shopping, Fish Market (20 min's walk). Ferry is very closeby to take you to Circular Quay and other beaches. The room was very clean and almost had everything I need. I'm not fussy with the small room size, cause most of time I was not in the room anyway. I got a room in the quiet side with a balcony (room 54). No noise even though the property is located along a main road.This is not a 5 or 4 star hotel (maybe not even a hotel). It's more like a self-serviced apartment. It's very comfortable to stay here, and considering the price I paid, I'm very happy with the overall experience. I think I'll come back again.The only thing not very smooth is the way they charge your account. I booked the room on Medina's website, and I thought I paid for the accommodation already (cause I provided my CC details online). But it turned out that the money wouldn't be deducted until arriving. I had to re-check my CC statement online to ensure I hadn't paid for the accommodation before I provided my CC details again. There is a computer nearby with the access to the Internet. After I checked out and fully paid for my accommodation, the hotel still withheld certain amount of money and release the amount after 5-7 working days. It's quite confusing and takes me a while to understand.But overall everything is cool. ","annotations":[]}
