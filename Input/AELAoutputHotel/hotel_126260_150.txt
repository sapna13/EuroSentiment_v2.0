{"text":"lovely hotel - crazy weather - nice trip We decided to take our 3 daughters to NYC for Spring Break 2007. We wanted this to be a very memorable experience for them with shows, great restaurants and typical kid friendly sight seeing in Manhattan.We even caught a bit of the St. Pat's Day parade the day we left. We have family in Manhattan so that makes it nice to find good, reasonable local eateries and such. We decided on The New York Palace primarily b\/c of location. We wanted to be Midtown, but not in the heart of Times Square (done that - just too crazy for me!) It is located adjacent to St. Paul's Cathedral - a sight we all wanted to visit. The hotel is lovely, quite beautiful, really. Our room requests were met perfectly, something I always try to be prepared to NOT have happen. 2 Adjoining\/Connecting rooms with 2 bathrooms is a MUST for my group (1 dad, 4 women!!) and they accomodated us beautifully. We just could not get the view of the Cathedral AND the room set up we needed but that was definitely fine (I'm alwasy cautiously optimistic b\/c many older hotels just do not have these accomodations which are first come, first served). Our rooms were very spacious - even more so by NYC standards (something we warned our children about ahead of time). A small bath in the very large corner King room w\/a seating area and a large bath in the double queen connecting room. Beautifully, traditionally decorated in blues and yellows - soft, comfy linens, lots of pillows- very clean. Our maid service was lovely and friendly and helpful. Concierege service is some of the BEST we have ever experienced anywhere. Doormen best in the city with helpful tips on subways (a must for my kiddos) and cabs. NEVER had a problem getting a taxi at the Palace. Did 2 shows - a matinee and an evening show. Conierege made great arrangements for us to eat lunch prior to matinee and next door at the FANTASTIC steak and seafood place b\/4 our evening show. Actually, except for our first evening with family and a quick bite of Pizza (the BEST) near Rockefeller Ctr, the Concierege staff made all our dining arrangements and they were wonderful. Would recommend to others Serafina for dinner (Italian-adults and kids will love) as well as the Chinese restaurant around the corner-quite fantasitc! Nice, handy Starbuck's across the street from hotel.We experience some crazy weather - 70s when we arrived, sleet and snow 2 days later - caught in rain and sleet walking to hotel from evening show (hint:if it's raining after a show - you will NOT catch a cab!! take an umbrella - nice big ones offered by the hotel). Had great fun stopping into a Duane Reade drugstore to buy cheap caps and gloves - very handy! We did the girl stuff and family stuff - American Girl Place, Sernedipity (skip this hyped location), Dylan's Candy Bar, Hershey's Times Square, Central Park Zoo, Natural History Museum, Rockfeller Ctr, etc. Skipped Canal Street with the kids (though my oldest has been with me prior to this trip) but quickly passed through China town. So much to see and must return. They LOVED it. The hotel is SO pricy, though, I don't know if it will be in the budget to return to such lavish means. We actually DID experience the $12 glass of orange juice at breakfast in the hotel along with the $10 bagel with cream cheese (this was not room service, but in the restuarant). However, booking with American Express granted us a free lunch in the restaurant which would have also been quite pricy, but was good food. It also allowed us to take advantage of late check-out and was what probably guaranteed our room arrangement as well. Book the New York Palace if you can afford the price tag. You will not be disappointed!
