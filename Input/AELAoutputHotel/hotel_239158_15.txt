{"text":"Good for a cheap stay Ok, the Ronda Hotel. I will say it is probably one of the poorer quality hotels I have stayed in, but I have been quite lucky for the majority of the time. I was travelling with my girlfriend and a mate and we were looking for a cheap night in Barcelona as our plane arrived late.The man at the check out was not in the best of moods and didn't know a word of English, luckily someone was there to help him, though I couldn't understand him he seemed in an extremely grumpy mood. We luckily had a room on the very top floor and it was situated so noise from other rooms wasn't a problem. In the morning some repair men were around and some noise was heard at around 6 am, but apart from that we heard nothing.Not to ramble on, the hotel is in a poorer part of Barcelona, while it is central the surroundings didn't feel as safe the room was clean, very basic but at 51 euro for the night for 3 of us (on last minute.com), we weren't expecting much and was great for what we needed it for. A cheap bed the first night before we caught the train down the coast. We were in Barcelona a few days later at the Catalonia Albinoni, a bit more expensive but a fifty times better hotel refer to review, the service desk there said if your facing the sea, try and stay on the left side of Las Ramblas and from what we witnessed this is true.I woudln't recommend this hotel for people looking for a nice hotel but a cheap stay with clean rooms its fine.Breakfast, we paid 10 euro p.p and it was quite ordinary.
