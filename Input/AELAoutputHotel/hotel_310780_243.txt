{"text":"Clean, Quiet, Comfortable, Great Location! We stayed at the Hotel Europa for 4 nights while on vacation in Italy. Upon arrival, we were pretty tired from the walk from the train station to the hotel lugging our bags and Gassim greeted us with a large very cold bottle of water which we really needed. We stayed in the Rafaello room, number 35 and the hotel was well kept and the room was large and clean. Our room overlooked a courtyard and we could see the very top of the Duomo from our 2 windows. I am a very light sleeper and even though we were in the middle of the city, the room was SO quiet. The location is only 1 block from the Duomo and everything is within walking distance, no subway or taxi needed. We rented a car for 2 days and Gassim helped us by calling someone to pick up the car and parking it for us overnight. Gassim works tirelessly and is extremely helpful. He is always available for directions or restaurant recommendations. Miriam is also very helpful. She made our museum reservations prior to arrival which allowed us to bypass all lines at the Accademia and Uffizi. It is also very nice to have the free Internet service which enabled us to talk to our families over e-mail after being gone for a week. We celebrated my birthday and our wedding anniversary in Florence and the day of our anniversary, Miriam and Gassim gave us a delicious celebratory bottle of Chianti. We thought this was very generous of them.We had a wonderful stay at the Hotel Europa and will recommend this property to anyone else we know who is visiting Florence. ","annotations":[]}
