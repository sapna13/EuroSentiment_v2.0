{"text":"Almost Perfect We were really happy with our choice of Hotel but unless you are only staying a couple of nights (we were staying 8) you must have a parlour\/executive room as the standard rooms are very compact. Having said that, the bathroom\/shower were perfectly adquate. We made a decision to upgrade after a couple of nights as we were staying longer and we were really pleased we did. The parlour\/executive rooms give you plenty of room to spread out and have great views of the harbour - considering the size of the room and facilities it is great value compared to other hotels. It may seem a little far out but don't be mislead - the metro is 5 minutes walk and it takes 10-15 mins to get to Central. It is in a fairly quiet side street - you will never get away from the traffic noise in Hong Kong but this was pretty good compared to another hotel we stayed in. We only ate breakfast in the restaurant once which was fine and thereafter kept it simple in the Panoramic lounge which was free with our upgraded room - only complaint here really is that the selection and sometimes the freshness wasn't great but if you stick to normal basics of cereal, toast, yoghurt and fruit it is fine.I would definitely recommend this hotel - we made maximum use of the metro, the 7,11 is close by as are some other key shops - chemists etc, the staff are young but ssuper efficient and very helpful and despite it being in a residential area it was pretty clean and we never felt unsafe. Only other downside is you might have to wait for cabs sometimes but that's it - we would definitely stay there again. Highly recommended. ","annotations":[]}
