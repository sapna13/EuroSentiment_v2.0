{"text":"Great service I stayed at the New Otani for four nights in early November. The hotel is old and does not have anything stylish or contemporary and looks rather dull, but their service was impeccable. The hotel staff were incredibly polite, pleasant, and efficient.My room was on the 22nd floor in the Tower and had a nice view. It was spotlessly clean. It had a king-size bed, a large work\/dinning table with a chair, a large sofa, a flat panel TV on the cabinet, an electrical kettle, a fridge, and a safe in the closet. Though I had to rearrange the drinks in the fridge to store my own food, they did not charge me any for that. The room was spacious and I thought was larger than the king-bedded rooms at the Hiltons, Sheratons, and Marriotts in major US cities I have stayed at. They provided tooth brushes and tooth pastes, disposable razors, disposable slippers, disposable hairbrushes, and yukatas (Japanese style pajamas), in addition to the regular toiletry and room amenities. If you need an iron and an iron board, you have to call house-keeping and return the set within one hour. Internet access from a hotel room was expensive (2100 yen\/24 hours) and no free Wifi was detected. Room service was expensive, but the portion of the dishes I ordered was pretty generous based on the Japanese standard. Meals at the hotel restaurants were also expensive, but given the great views from the restaurants and their impeccable services I would consider the prices reasonable. If you like French pastries, try Satsuki in the Main building. If you look for cheap eats, try the Akasaka Mitsuke area, to which you just walk 5 minutes from the hotel (exit from the Tower, not from the Main). You can get a map of restaurants in the area from the concierge or you just walk around to see what√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ available.The hotel is located in a nice and quiet neighborhood with good access to public transportation. If you would like to experience the traditional Japanese courtesy, this hotel could be a good option for you. Mind you that the hotel has some designated areas for smoking. If you are sensitive to smoking, you would likely get annoyed by the smell. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend that you obtain the New Otani club membership with which you can receive some privileges and services including free continental breakfast at the club room.
