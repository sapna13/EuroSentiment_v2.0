{"text":"Peaceful Stay in a Hectic Location My girlfriend and I have just returned from a 5 night stay at the Westin at Times Square and cannot complain about the service received or the room itself.Reception Staff - very helpful indeed. For all those visitors using Travellers Cheques, they do not charge to exchange them.Room - Asked for a high room with a view and although not looking at any stand-out feature of NYC, the view was good. The room and bathroom was always clean and tidy. The bed is very comfortable after a long hard day walking and we found there was adequate bathroom space for toiletries, etc. We were advised the minibar was sensitive to movement so don't be too tempted to see what is in there. If travelling from Europe, dont take your hairdryer as they are not as powerful when used in the US plug sockets (as my girlfriend found out!).Only downside was the constant reminder for tips from the baggage handlers and the guys on the front door. We appreciate they make their wages up with tips but do not think the constant reminders are required. Not the best location for food - unless you want fast food but for breakfast there are plenty of coffee shops and other bakeries selling croissants, muffins, etc. (PAX opposite Madame Tussauds is good).If getting a yellow cab back to the hotel, just tell them near the Port Authority Building as not one taxi driver knew where the Westin was!Trip Tips - Do Top Of The Rock at dusk and watch the sunset (we would advise you give it a day or two (if you can) just so you can work out what time the sun sets and then go up after you know). The Grayline bus tours were good (uptown, downtown and the night tour) but felt it became a broadway audition from the 'wannabe actor' guides at times rather than them telling you points of interest (although we did get one older guide who was very informative) and again with the constant tip reminders. We would advise you to prebook your tickets for the Statue of Liberty and get there early to avoid the queues. If there are any students in your party take your student cards if you are going to any of the museums for a slight discount. Use the subway as its fast, cheap and not as scary as you may think. Used Grand Central to get to Bloomingdales and the Brooklyn bridge and both stops bring you out right next to them.Would stay at the hotel again.
