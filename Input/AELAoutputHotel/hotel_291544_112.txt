{"text":"Super, minor irritations A little way away from the Arc de Triomphe, in a rather nice residential (apartments) street.The doorman opened the door to our taxi, was very pleasant and helpful giving a good impression before we had even stepped into the hotel.Reception was polite and efficient. The main public areas are spacious, comfortable and clean. I was allocated room 307.I did ask for an iron and ironing board to be delivered, it was not so I had to ask again in the morning, when it did arrive. Maybe a minor point, but the iron was low quality, and the ironing board even more so, difficult to use.The room was decorated in neutral colours, gold carpet, neutral walls, a very comfortable bed (there were 2 queen sized beds)An important point in hotels is noise, and I can say that it was very minimal, you do not hear doors banging, the street noise is very low indeed, so a good nights rest is assured.The bathroom is good, clean, lots of hot water. A minor frustration is the mix tap from bath to shower, not easy to use, and I always got it wrong and sprayed myself with cold water when trying to run a bath!Minibar in room, which I did not try. I wanted a cup of tea in the afternoon, no facilities in the room so I had to get room service. Expensive, but delived quickly and well.The Purple bar is a nice place, soft candles, good service, free nuts with your drinks. Staff regularly come and check if you need further drinks. The restaurant on Sunday night, late, was quiet so I expected a good and fast service which we got. Tuna, cooked fine, tasty, drinks service as good as could be.Breakfast on day one was great, good and fast service, a good buffet, my only thought that the fresh orange juice is a little tasteless, (diluted down?)Good selection of hot and cold items, quality ingredients. On day 2, a large medical convention hit the breakfast room in 1 go, so a quequ for everything, nobody brought coffee, could not find a clean table so used a dirty one. Checkout pleasant and efficient.
