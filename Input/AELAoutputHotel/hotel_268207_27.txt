{"text":"What a great hotel! We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. After having read some of the reviews, we were a little worried about staying over the weekend (noise), having worn or dirty linens and finding a place to eat. But our fears were unfounded.The hotel is clean, bright and beautiful. The front desk staff was friendly and immediately offered us any help we might need. We were lucky enough to get a room at the end of the hallway with great views of the water, boats, bridges and Boston skyline. Wonderful sunrise\/sunset views and, surprise, a window that opened to let in some of the fresh air.The food at the hotel cafe is great and there are several wonderful restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel as well. I recommend the Warren Tavern and, if you're interested in watching Patriots football, the Ironside Grille. Otherwise, a mere 15-20 minute leisurely stroll over the bridge gets you into downtown Boston where restaurants and shopping abound! (Note though that, for some portion of the bridge, you're walking only on steel grates over the river. That is, don't look down!)The hotel was quiet and pleasant. We had drinks in the lounge every evening on comfortable chairs next to the fireplace. The bartender and waitresses were efficient and friendly. We liked having the option of having the room cleaned daily or not. On the days the maids cleaned, everything was vacuumed, scrubbed and spotless. They even ran the dishwasher and cleaned the microwave while we were out.I can't say enough good things about this hotel. It's a little pricey to those of us who don't travel all that often, but relatively inexpensive by Boston's standards and worth every penny. It was tough to leave and we'll be returning to this hotel again for sure.
