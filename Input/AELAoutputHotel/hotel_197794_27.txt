{"text":"Great Place for Adventurous, Fun-lovers Stayed here for 3 nights recently and had a thoroughly fantastic stay. Located along a quaint canal within a very short walking distance from Central Station, the hotel is easily accessible by train from the airport. You can walk from the hotel to see any part of Old Amsterdam and the metro, tram and canal ferry all have stops just around the corner to take you to the outer city areas. For those travelers who like to pack light, we found a coin-op laundromat a short walking distance from the hotel near the red-light district on Warmostraat. Relaxing at an Amsterdam coffeeshop while waiting for your laundry to finish next door was laundromat nirvana. But back to the hotel...The Black Tulip is everything shown on their website and more, with a great staff and friendly clientele during our stay. We really enjoyed meeting the other guests each morning at breakfast in the cozy common room. The inclusive breakfast here was the best we had of the three hotels we booked on our trip - a good selection of cereals with fresh fruit, pastries and eggs cooked to order. Our room (number 23) was clean and spacious considering all the 'toys' found in this room. Though we are not into the lifestyle that is this hotel's niche, we wanted to try something completely new and different for our 25th anniversary and we had a great time doing so at The Black Tulip. If you can laugh and have fun with a cage and stocks in your room (like we did), then the Black Tulip is the perfect hotel in Amsterdam. It's a great place for anyone who is open-mined and adventurous. Now that we know how much fun some of their 'toys' are, we are planning to return there again - hopefully soon.
