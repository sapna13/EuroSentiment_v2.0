{"text":"Great spot for a vacation We were to Natura Park from June 14 to June 21. We are 2 couples with 2 kids each.Flight with Sunwing was very good. We use Sunwing for the first time and we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l use it in the future too. Got to the resort ~12:30. Had to wait for rooms until 3pm. No problem here. You can start drinking from 12:31. People at the front desk a bit too arrogant but who cares? If everything goes well with the room, you only see them twice briefly. We came here to relax and have fun and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what we did for the whole week.The 2 rooms we got (1248 and 1249 in building III) were decent size with 2 beds each and a couch, good size balcony, a\/c was working excellent, fridge was not working but I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care for that. We don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like surprises so we always come prepared: we got a can of bug spray and 2 cans of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeed√à√\u2020\u2022? As soon as we got in the room I sprayed the room especially around front door and balcony door then around beds. Not that we saw any bugs but for the peace of mind. Every evening before leaving the rooms, we got all of us sprayed with √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeed√à√\u2020\u2022?Food was better than expected: eggs in the morning and 5-6 types of cheese and other cold-cuts, beans, coffee, tea, milk, etc. lunch: either main area or near the beach. In the main area there is more diversified food but near the beach, food tasted better. We tried all 3 a-la-carte restaurants: don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother with Italian, stake house was good but we had to wait 90 minutes for our food. The best was sea food restaurant. Good service and excellent food. We all enjoyed that evening. Resort: It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ like a miniature botanical garden with quite a few species of trees and birds. We really like this resort. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ clean and neat anywhere you look. Weather: A lot of rain on Saturday the whole day and night until Sunday morning. Then sunny all the way until next Saturday when we left.Evening shows (for adults) are good. The shows for kids are non-existent. Michael Jackson show was excellent. Overall, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a very good resort, we had a great time and we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be back here.We have been in about 12 trips in the last 10 years and this resort was one of the best.
