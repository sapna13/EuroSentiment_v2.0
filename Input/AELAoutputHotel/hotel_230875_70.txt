{"text":"Clean and Convenient My husband and I stayed at the Radisson SAS in Amsterdam from 2-4 June. We arrived very early on 2 June, but were able to get early check in. The room was clean and big. We had a view of inside the hotel atrium, which was cool. The room had a minibar (although I would recommend purchasing beer\/soda\/water outside the hotel as the prices were a little above average), kettle with coffee\/tea, iron and ironing board, safe, and the bathroom has shampoos\/soap\/body wash and a blowdryer. The employees were also very helpful with local information. We ate breakfast one morning at the hotel for √à√\u2020√ü?5 for two people, but there was a big buffet selection of omelets, eggs, breads, pastries, cheeses, meats and sides, etc. We also ordered room service one night (again, the prices a little above average), but the food was good and the service was pretty quick.The hotel location was very convenient and in a good, safe area. It was close enough to walk everywhere, we didn't use the tram once, but then again we had excellent weather. It's a few blocks from the Red Light District and Dam Square, but far enough that it wasn't a touristy area. There's also a coffeehouse right across the street.We found an excellent traditional Dutch restaurant, Claes Claesz, near the Anne Frank House. Much better than the highly recommended D'Vijff Vlieghen and half the price for better food, plus on the weekend they have an excellent piano player. Also, make a visit to the Pancake Bakery!Overall I would recommend this hotel even though it is a little pricey, but for me the location, cleanliness and friendliness of the hotel staff were far more important than the price.
