{"text":"A very welcomed surprise Some of the reviews of this hotel were a bit out in left field;We were pleasantly surprised with The Hotel Rivoli. We just returned from a 4 night stay, The location is just 2 short blocks away. The good: Loved the room, we had enough space for a European size room, I thought. Very Very clean. New MongramedLinens were changed every day, they were ironed and felt very clean. Our room overlooked the beautiful pool and hot tub courtyard area. Very peaceful and charming. The breakfast was 5 star, the buffet had hots and colds, and champagne every morning for mimosa's if you wanted it. Served in a beautiful breakfast room. There is a nice lobby with different sitting areas and a beautiful dish with candy, nice touch. The front desk staff were top notch and very very helpful, We adored Massilamino, so charming to deal with. All the staff were gracious and welcoming and were eagle to assist American guests in english.To improve upon: I wish the bathroom could be bigger, it was hard to maneuver, but you get used to it. Every morning at 0700,0715, 0730, 0800, city bells go off and can wake you up,but it actually was different to hear. You really can control the lighting in the rooms which is very smart! in conserving Electricity...we are spoiled in the US leaving hotel rooms with lights on. At the Rivoli when your card is not in the slot the lights will go off in 2 minutes, be prepared!!I really enjoyed our stay there. I could not believe this hotel did not have a higher rating on trip advisor.
