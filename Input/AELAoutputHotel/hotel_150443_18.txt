{"text":"Wonderful stay at the Condado Plaza We were at the Condado Plaza from October 22-26th. We really enjoyed our stay. We had a mini-suite on the lagoon side with a partial ocean view across the street. The room was clean and had everything you could ask for. We appreciated the big refrigerator. The fitness center is very nice and we made good use of it. The pool on the lagoon side was closed during our stay. They were filming a George Clooney movie. Others saw him but we did not. Rats! We usually sat by the big pool with the slide and spent time on the beach. The beach isn't very big but it is nice and the water is calm due to big rocks which were put there to break the big waves. There are many restaurants within walking distance on Ashford Ave. If you're out and about after dark watch your step! There are many holes and curbs that are easy to trip over. I rolled my ankle on a small curb and fell. Now I have a large abraision on my leg as a souvenier. We rented a car from Dollar. I was excited that I found a good deal and apparently so did many other people. The agency is off the airport property so we took a shuttle and then there was a long line to get the car. It took us over an hour to pick up the car. In hindsight we would not rent a car again unless we plan to spend the majority of the trip outside of San Juan. Driving is a challenge in San Juan since the roads\/highways are not clearly marked. We saw a lot more of the city than we planned to. We drove to El Yungue and enjoyed hiking some of the trails. We did get lost on the way but eventually found it. The weather was perfect and the people were very friendly. We would go back to PR to explore the rest of the island. ","annotations":[]}
