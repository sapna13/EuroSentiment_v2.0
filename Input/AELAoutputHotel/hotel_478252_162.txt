{"text":"Hotel Service and Food are less than acceptable We just returned from the Bahia Principe in Punta Cana. It was the worst vacation I have ever had! The hotel itself is beautiful, the grounds are very well kept and clean, there are many things to do on the complex and the beach is AMAZING! Even with all these things going for it, the service and the food made this trip absolutly undesireable. We had a party of 30 and were there for a wedding. We were forced to eat buffect EVERY night as reservations for more than 2 people were unavailable at any of the a la carte restaurants. the buffet was the same bland food night after night. Breakfast often consited of the nights leftovers. The challenge was trying to eat as a group. There are 3 hotels on the complex, if y ou are staying in the punta cana section you can not eat at the bavaro buffet and so on... We arrived at 10:30am, we got the room key at 4:45pm and when we finaly got to the room, it had not been cleaned from the previous occupant!!! the AC was broken and took 2 days to fix, the fridge was broken and took 2 days to fix. We had to call each day for face clothes and the ironing board.When I approched the Mnager to expalin that we were unsatisfied he said that there was a HUGE pile of complaints and there was nothing that he could do for us.Thank God the wedding turned out beautiful....that was a perfect day..however we were stuck with food poisening the next day.I will never go back and do not reccomend this hotel.The kids clud is also not very entertaining for kids up to 6 years old. ( oitherwise they will be bored). ","annotations":[]}
