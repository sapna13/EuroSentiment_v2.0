{"text":"Great Location-Great Staff This hotel is in a great location- easy to walk to multiple locations! It is so close to the hectic Rambla, but much more quiet and calm. The hotel presented very nicely, including the rooms. Our room was very clean, and I am very particular with this! The room had wooden floors-which I love over carpet, does not trap as much dirt, and gives such a cleaner impression!The staff, especially Lucila, were very friendly and accomodating. They even found a fan for our room that we could use during our stay. This helped with the smoke smells, and I guess any noise. The main reason we wanted it was to deal with the warm rooms (no AC allowed in December-all hotels I think).We stayed here primarily because we had two teenage girls with us that we wanted to keep in same room. This is always a tough challenge in Europe. Our room 420 was a great size (419 looked even larger). The nice thing is that it had the sink outside the bathroom, so that the shower could be used while others were getting ready. They set up two extra beds (much better than cots) in the enclave, so we had good separation. A wooden counter ran the length of the room, made for a tighter walkway, but great storage. Good shower, though very easy to flood floor if not careful, due to half door. The 4th floor is a nonsmoking floor, but if you are sensitive, you will smell it.- maybe they can get more fans! The smoke smells are probably my only complaint about the hotel.There are (3) computers down behind the bar that we were able to use, also think wi-fi is available in room. The girls had the breakfast one morning- save the money and go elsewhere!Overall- this hotel was great for the location, the staff and the European feel. It would be a great choice for a family room hotel, and worth the money to pay for the extra space. The staff really sell the place!
