{"text":"Wonderful, just wonderful! As always, our stay at the Ritz-Carlton Isla Verde was just fabulous. From the nicely appointed Club Level room to the ample and continuous food selection at the Club Level dining area to the beautiful ocean views from any floor of the hotel to the courteous staff.....our stay at the Isla Verde Ritz-Carlton was outstanding. We went there to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary and to relax from our stressful business life. Relax we did! Our main goal was to spend as much time as possible by the ocean and the ocean did not disappoint us. The water was calm, turquoise blue and warm. The hotel provides complimentary lounge chairs, towels and umbrellas, all you have to do is tip the person who provides them (contrary to other Ritz-Carltons where we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe had to pay plenty for the lounge chairs and umbrellas). Buying food for three daily meals at all Ritz-Carltons can get quite expensive, we solved this problem by paying a higher rate for a Club level room and this experience was well worth it. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pay one cent during our 4 day stay for any of our meals which we had at the Club Level dining area. There was a great variety of foods ranging from fruits, cheeses, breads, small sandwiches, cold cuts, pates, salads, deserts, all sorts of soft drinks, teas and coffees, enough to satisfy anyone√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ appetite. Do not expect a hot meal at the Club Level area. The view of the ocean from the Club Level dining area was just mesmerizing. Well aware of the high crime rate in PR we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ leave our hotel at all and instead spent 4 blissful, peaceful days and nights at the Ritz. Once our stay was completed, we would rent a car and head inland to other locations but while at the Ritz we decided to stay put and enjoy ourselves. We highly recommend a stay at this property for anyone. We never heard one plane land or depart, no airport noise could be heard from our room.
