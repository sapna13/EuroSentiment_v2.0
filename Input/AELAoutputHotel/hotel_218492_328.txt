{"text":"Good Time at Globalia Overall we had a great experience at Globalia Punta Cana Grand. The airport transportation was excellent. We were transported from the airport to our resort in an air conditioned van in just about 15 minutes. Check in was a breeze. The people behind the counter were extremely friendly and helpful. We arrived at noon and check in is not suppose to be until 3:00, but our room was ready for us when we arrived. Our rooms were excellent! Building 7 is a must. Marble floors, large walk in shower, ocean front balcony, two jacuzzi tubs, canopy king size bed, safe, and a stocked frig all made for an excellent room. One jacuzzi tub is on the balcony overlooking the ocean, very romantic at night. We did have a problem with hot water though. We only had HOT water for one evening shower. The water was warm, but not warm enough to be enjoyable. Our friends that traveled with us and roomed next door to us had hot water everyday, so I guess it varies from room to room. The food was good, nothing exceptional and not as good as a fine dining restaurant in the states, but good. They had a large variety in the Windows buffett. However, the options were the same everyday. The salad bar was great and the egg station for breakfast was wonderful. Refills on drinks were hard to get. You receive a small glass with your meal and have to chase a waiter down to get a refill. My husband walked up to the bar after waiting 5 minutes for his drink, which resulted in the bartender shouting at him to sit down. The desserts were great at all the restaurants. This was the best part of the entire meal. Service was extremely slow at the Beach Garden restaurant. We could not get a reservation until 9:00, so we were very hungry. The tropical salad was great; I highly recommend. And once again desert was great. The day you arrive make sure you schedule reservations to the restaurants to ensure a decent eating time. We scheduled ours the morning after we arrived and the only times we could get were 9:00 and 9:15. We ordered room service one day to hold us over. Room service is included so take advantage. The food was good and service was quick. Pizza and sandwiches were great. All of the pools were nice, however getting a chair is difficult. We never laid by the large pool with the swim up bar due to never finding 4 chairs together, we couldn't even find 2 chairs together. People would put their towels on the chairs to save them, but were never around. This was very annoying. One day there were about 20 people at the pool and no chairs. There are probably 100 chairs total, but most were empty but had towels laying on them. We had no problem finding chairs at the adult pool however. The bartender at the adult pool was excellent. The drinks were great and his up beat attitude was a plus. He would walk around and ask if we wanted a drink and then would bring it back to us, very nice! The beach was nice, seaweed is a problem that can not be helped. However, if you walk to the left of the resort about 10 minutes there is a beautiful secluded beach with clear water and no seaweed. I highly recommend taking a towel and walking down there to tan and swim. We used all of the non-motorized water sports and had a ball. The catamarans were so much fun. We also windsurfed and used the kayaks. We purchased additional excursions. We went snorkeling one day and did the shoppong excursion the next. The snorkeling was a big disappointment. They take you out about 100 yards from the resort and have an area that is fenced in to do the snorkeling. There were several sharks and stingrays, but the guide had to swim down and pull on them to get them to swim around. No tropical colored fish. Overpriced and a big let down. The shopping excursion was great. We went to a cigar and rum shop, an expensive shopping center (Hard Rock cafe), and a flea market type center. We bought a lot of stuff at the flea market, but check the prices on the beach first. Cheap Charlie gave us a lot better deal on our shirts. Overall we had a great time and I would recommend this resort and may even return myself.
