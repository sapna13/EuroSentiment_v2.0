{"text":"Only at the right price I booked vibe as a surprise for my husband to celebrate our anniversary. The hotel was offering a package which included breakfast and a free double CD of chillout music and is decorated in a nice funky style which I knew would appeal to him. It was also nice and close to work so we got a sleep in! The rooms are nicely decorated and look pretty much the same as the website. They are quite large and the bed was very comfortable. We did not find the airconditoning noisy as previous reviewers had mentioned and the lifts were fine. The bathroom was standard. The roof terrace and pool area are attractive and the equipment in the gym is brand new and good quality. Most of the staff were not particularly friendly or helpful with the exception of the bar person and evening waiter. We ate at the restaurant because it looked inviting and it was freezing outside. The entrees were overpriced and a bit ordinary but the main meals were very very nice. I would recommend giving breakfast buffet a miss and heading to one of the hundreds of cafes on castlereagh street. Most of the hot food was lukewarm and certainly not worth the price. Overall I think the hotel is fine if you can get it from a last minute site but really need to lift their game in regards to service and food to be worth the $160 a night they are trying to charge as there is so much competition in Sydney for this price range.
