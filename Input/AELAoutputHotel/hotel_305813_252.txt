{"text":"Exceptional Hotel My girlfriend and I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in October. We booked a club room and based on what we read on tripadvisor, we had high expectations of this hotel. We were not let down...This hotel offers excellent service together with very high standards of comfort and amenities. The pool on the 42nd floor is amazing with unbelievable views over Hong Kong and Kowloon. It is situated in Mong Kok, a really busy place with markets, shops and an unbelievable amount of people. The hotel acted as a safe haven around the madness outside the doors. The room was on the 35ft floor with exceptional views. It was a large double with a fabulous shower and a very comfortable bed. As it was a club room, we availed of the bar offering drink and food all day. It is a real treat when you have been walking the streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon all day and it is definately worth the extra money when booking. The service is very personal and the staff will stand on their heads to help you. The GYM looked very well equipped but I never managed to go. The exercise you get walking the streets should be enough if you plan to take in all the sights.Food in the Hotel was OK. We ate there three times and twice had the buffet. The standard menu in the main restaurant is only OK but the buffet has all types of food catering from every pallet. If you are staying in Hong Kong, this is definately worth a look. You should not be disappointed...
