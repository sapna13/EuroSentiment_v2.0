{"text":"Perfect honeymoon! My husband and I just returned for the Grand Palladium Baravro after staying their for our honeymoon from June 10th through June 16th. It was just an amazing vacation! We had a romance suit and it was totally worth the extra money! There was a huge canopy bed, a large Jacuzzi perfect for two people and the outdoor shower with the hammock was just wonderful after a day on the beach! Plus, we were right on the beach and a very short walk to get food. The beaches are so nice! You just feel like you are in a dream! We spent hours in the ocean and on the beach everyday! The drinks were pretty good! The pina coladas are what we drank all week! Some of the other drinks they make aren't so hot- but your sure to find at least one you'll love. The beer is quite good as well. We thought the food was excellent! We ate at all of the buffets and had 2 a la carte meals. We ate at el arricefe(seafood and steak) and cantina mariachi(Mexican). At both of these meals they had a trio of musicians that sang to each table. They were very good and very kind- we always tipped them well and they seemed to appreciate it. Both meals were excellent. The buffets were great- I especially liked el arricefe for their lunch buffet (opens at noon- others not until 1:00). I didn't care for the breakfast at the Cathedral- I found the food a little bizarre (fried cheese and mashed potatoes for breakfast?) but they always had wonderful fresh fruit and juices as well as French toast and pancakes- which were very good. We missed breakfast a few times, but there is always food at the Sports Bar. Also, you can get an ice cream cone a the sports bar at any time. We took the excursion to the marinarium. This was really nice. We got to snorkel with the sharks and sting rays as well as over the coral reef. Make sure you bring an underwater camera! They charge $40.00 at the gift shop for one and $31.00 on the tour for a camera. The only complaint I have of the tour is that you only spend about 1 hour snorkeling. One hour is then spent in travel and 3 hours are spent partying. this was fun, and they do a really great job, but we would have liked to snorkel for at least half of the time. the trip cost about $75.00 a person and left every morning at 8:20 and then another in the afternoon. We booked through the Apple guide at the resort- Alfredo. The service was very good overall. It was a little strange being among the only people there who spoke English- however, we never had a problem communicating with the staff. one concern: Every day we tipped the maid VERY well. We would always leave her a small silk sack filled with personal items, jewelry, candy, a note thanking her and a few dollars in cash. We hoped our room would be cleaned well everyday. This was not the case. Some days she would only collect our dirty towels and not give us fresh ones. It was like every day she would only clean or remember to do one task in our room. By the end of the week, we started only leave her a dollar or two because we were so disappointed. When we did this, the service actually improved! So I'm not sure what the deal was with that- but it was certainly not a major issue! Overall, great trip! Highly recommended. Few last tips:Bring everything you might need and extra(shampoo, toothpaste, sunscreen) as they are outrageously expensive at the gift shop! Examples: toothbrush $14; sunscreen $20+, small bag of sun chips $7.00!There is only one American outlet in the room- you have to pull out the TV stand to get to it. Take the trolley when you first get there as the resort is very large- that way you will see everything before you start choosing places to go. At the airport we tipped on of the apple vacations bell boys and in return we were on the bus almost a half hour before anyone else as he got us to the front of the lines. Must put in reservations for a la cart right away upon arrival or will get a weird one.Brush your teeth with bottled water- in mini fridge or at any of the bars and restaurantsTo get fridge restocked, put a tip(we put $1.00 a day) in the fridge and a note in Spanish asking for only the items you use. Then he will restock everyday rather then every other.
