{"text":"Fantastic Hotel- A Gem We stayed at the Pan Pacific, Marina Bay hotel in Singapore from October 11th - October 14th. This hotel is right in the heart of the maria square area and is attached to the marina square complex.We arrived at our hotel at 1:30 am due to a delay in UA arrival. The hotel staff was extreamly friendly and warm even at this late check in. We got a great room and our bagged were taken up to our room waiting for us. The room was spectacular! All the ammenities you would expect from a 5+ star hotel. It felt like the spa treatment. The room was comfortable and all international plugs, etc. worked no problem. No adapators needed.The hotel is attached to a huge shopping complex (on of the national passtimes is shopping). We wisely, did not take the package for buffet breakfast as the shopping mall and Suntec city have a variety of places to eat that are substantially lower price than the hotel breakfasts. At night you can also go through Maria Square and get to Glutton Bay. There are a variety of hawkers that set up stalls here where you can sample a variety of local cuisines. Also great for Muslims, as many of the stalls are halal. Take the shuttle bus from the airport it only costs $8 SG per person. You cannot book the shuttle bus back from the hotel, but you can take a taxi. It costs around $21 SG for two people, so a few more dollars than the shuttle bus. If you really want to save a few dollars, then you can go to the Mandarin Hotel also attached to Mariana square, and you can book the shuttle bus from there.Would recommend you also get the tourist card at this mall, it's free and saves you money at a lot of the establishments within the mall. We saved quite a bit of money here!The downside of the location of this hotel is it is a good 10- 15 minute walk to the closest MRT station City Hall. You can walk underground all from the hotel, but it is a bit of a distance.Overall, I loved this hotel. The hotel was beautiful and modern, and the room was fantatic. The staff went out of their way to help us out and answer our questions. They attended to our every need with a smile. I would definely stay here again. Loved it!
