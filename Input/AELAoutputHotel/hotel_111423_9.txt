{"text":"Great location, but some noise I have stayed in a two-bed small room, and I have stayed in a one bedroom king suite. Both the little suite and the two-bed room had clean marble baths, but both bathrooms were rather small. In addition, there was almost no bureau\/armoire space to put clothes. One room had only two middle size drawers available and the other had only one, very narrow highboy.The hotel staff were uniformly helpful, although at least one of the women at the front desk\/concierge had a little trouble speaking and understanding English, and in addition she was not quite up to speed on information about the hotel and its policies.Street noise was a problem, because my rooms were on the street side (Mass Ave or Commonwealth Ave); the solid √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√álackout√à√\u2020\u2022?curtains were great, but, particularly in the very early morning (e.g., 5:00AM), there was a lot of traffic noise and it woke me up every day.The rooms were serviced promptly and well by the cleaning staff.I ate only one breakfast in Clio, the restaurant in the hotel; the food was fine, but not particularly imaginative and on the quite expensive side. Opt instead for the breakfast at the Trident Book Store which is right up the street on Newbury Ave.As is typical of very high priced hotels, there is a separate charge for everything, including the use of the internet in the room. The location is excellent √à√\u2020\u2022?you can walk to Fenway Park, there is a T stop in the next block, and there are lots of shopping and restaurant options within easy walking distance.Bottom line - the staff are great, the location is excellent, bathrooms are nice but small, traffic noise can wake you up or keep you awake, and the cost is high. If money is no object, and you can sleep through most things, this is a perfect place for you. ","annotations":[]}
