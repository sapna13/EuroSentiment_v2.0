{"text":"Get Your Jazz On! I had booked the Jazz based on other's reviews, and everyone's raves about this hotel were spot on!Front Desk staff is friendly, rooms are nice, and the hotel is located 2 blocks from the city centre.We asked for a room above the 4th floor, and barely noticed the subway rumble, and the glass in the windows silenced the street noise completely.We did our share of Tapas, but found a Cuban restaurant about 15 minutes walk between the hotel and the waterfront. I highly recommend this restaurant if you want to eat where the locals hang.. Can't remember the name, but maybe the front desk staff can help.I recommend doing a 2 day pass on the city bus tour. That way you can spread the two routes across a couple of days. It's the best way to get an overview of the entire city. Well run, and great views.We walked Las Ramblas, and found a wonderful pottery store a couple blocks off, that had great selection and price. There are four of these stores in Barcelona proper.Ate dinner one night at the Seven Ports. The paella was good, but I've had better. Still neat to eat in such a historic landmark. They serve four types of olive oil w\/ bread, and one of them was the best I've ever had. Internet access was good, and priced reasonably. The room was clean, and set up efficiently. Larger than standard European rooms.I recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona, that wants to be near the heart of the city.
