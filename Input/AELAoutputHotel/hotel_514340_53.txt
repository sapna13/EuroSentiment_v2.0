{"text":"Would be good with better beds. We picked this hotel as it was close to the train station and had received good reviews on tripadvisor. The walk from the train station isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bad if your luggage has good wheels and you have good energy for it, Check in was easy and our room had a nice European feel to it with lots of gold.Bathroom was nice with lots of tile. Shower is a bit tight, but worked out fine. Room was nice, our only major issue was with the bed itself. Twenty years ago it was standard practice in Europe to have doubles in every room and just push them together as needed for guests. This is still how this hotel operates and it made for two nights with very little sleep. The two twins were hard and had that horrible uncomfortable gap in the middle that kept us mostly apart for our planned two-day romantic trip to Venice. Since I am 6.2√à√\u2020\u2022?(not that tall really), my feet hung over the bed about 3 inches making for even more discomfort. It would be a good idea, especially being in romantic Venice, to have some full or queen size beds. At least a few for special requests, as we did prior to arriving. It is interesting that we have never come across this when traveling in Asian countries, rarely in the states, just mostly older, smaller hotels in Europe and some resorts in the Caribbean. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get me wrong, I am not real picky, just need a comfy bed to sleep without my feet hanging over the bed and unable to cuddle with my wife. I am sure these beds pushed together have worked well for other travelers.The TV gets about 20 Italian channels and one German channel. Normally we don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ watch much TV, but this was a cold time of the year in Venice and we had to return to the room earlier then we would in the warmer months. The owner said we got CNN, but not in our room. Internet in our room was a big plus and we enjoyed that to unwind before bed.Breakfast was limited to Corn Flakes, crackers and croissants, but they made a great cappuccino and latte. They also had O.J., juices and bottled water out for breakfast.The staff was nice and helpful and the location was fine. However, the small hard beds would keep us from returning as we only got about 3 hours sleep our last night while tossing and turning in discomfort. If the bed situation was better and if they had at least one English TV channel, I might have given it 5 stars. Lots of potential for this hotel with a few upgrades.
