{"text":"Excellent value for money My husband and I had a harbour view executive parlour room which was clean, comfortable and spacious with a seperate lounge area. The bed was particularly comfortable and made for a good night's rest, especially as the hotel is quiet. There was a generous bowl of fruit in the room to welcome us.The executive parlour room and parlour suite is good value if you make sure you have a good breakfast in the morning and take advantage of the complimentary cocktails and nibbles served between 5.30 - 7.30p.m. Nibbles included choices such as mussles, sate, crackers, cheeses, dumplings etc - certainly enough to keep you going if you did not feel like going out again, or to serve as a generous apetiser before your evening meal. We ate out each evening so cannot comment on the hotel restaurant.Hotel staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Our first room had a rather strong stagnant water smell, and we were immediately moved to another room and provided with a de-humidifier which solved the problem. There is free internet access in the bedroom and access to 2 computes in the Parlour Lounge (for use of executive room residents only), and another 2 computers in the travel agent office located on Floor 2.Despite the address, the hotel is actually outside the Causeway Bay area, but just a stone's throw from the next stop on the MTR, Tin Hau. It is very convenient to catch the airport express to Hong Kong (Central), then the MTR to Tin Hau. Total journey time approx 40 mins.
