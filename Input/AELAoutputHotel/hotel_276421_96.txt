{"text":"not worth the money We just came back on May 4th, we were down there for a week and seemed to have more problems then anything. To start, the room sucks. The beds are hard and when you sleep is the time that the bugs seem to feast on you. The staff is not the best. IF you speak english they seem to not understand you one moment and then the next they know exactly what you are saying. There were plenty of children around which was not a problem, but the problem that I had were all of the topless women around, I just didnt feel that was appropriate. The food seem to make my boyfriend sick more then anything. After every meal he ate he seemed to be in the bathroom at least a couple of times for long periods of time. The only real nice thing about being down there was the beach, but that really had nothing to do with the resort. There was always someone coming up to you every moment you were not in your room trying to selling you something, even if you told them you had no money. To top our vacation off, the last morning we were there we allowed ourselves an hour and a half to get ready. I had just gotten into the shower and had shampoo in my hair when the power went out. When we called the front desk they said it would be back on in 30 minutes. As we sat on the bed waiting for it to come back on we watch a GIANT cockroach crawl up the wall from behind the mirror. Well an hour later with still no power we had to take water bottles from the maids closet so I could finsh washing my hair because we had to leave and there was still no power. I would spend the extra money to stay at a 5 star hotel. So to those of you who choose this hotel, I hope you have better luck then we did.
