{"text":"Very Nice Resort.... only one thing.... Just returned from my stay @ the Punta Cana Princess from 4\/22-4\/29--- The resort is very nice, always kept clean with tons of workers, working on the landscaping, cleaning the pool, etc. The room was definitely amazing, we had a direct view of the pool, and the beach.. room 5211. I would definitely say to not stay on the ground floor because at night the amount of bugs is crazy, and I would not want the milipedes crawling into my room. The pool was kept in tip-top shape, and cleaned a few times throughout the day. The bars, I would honestly say the nicest people are at the lobby bar.... and at the ebach bar at night.... other than that, some of the people working there looked like robots, even after you tipped them-- I am not expecting a song and dance, but when i order one or two drinks and give 2 dollars everytime I at least expect a thank you. Not all of the workers were like that, there were definitely some who were very gracious to recieve the tips. The Food. #1 I am a New Yorker, who has access to the best restuarants in the world, and I will say that it is nothing like food in the United States. I would say it is decent. #2 I am a vegetarian and there was honestly not much for me to eat... I know people will say oh you could have had pasta.... but when you come from New York, and an Italian family... you cannot eat Tomato Sauce that was made in the Dominican Republic... it tastes like Ragu. There were some things I could eat, which kept me going... They had a very small salad bar, and once during the week they had vegetable soup.... In the A la carte restaurants, I had asked if there was anything they could make that did not have meat in it, and they said NO... so I was a little upset about that because I had stayed at RIU, Iberostar, and Breezes before, and all of them helped me out with my food issues. My fiance said that he enjoyed the chicken that they made daily. Out of all the a la cartes, he said that RIO GRANDE tex mex steakhouse, was the worst because the meat was very tough(he ordered filet mignon.. that is not supposed to be tough), He loved the Chinese! He liked the italian because he had gotten pork filet which he said was very tender. The mexican was very good -- I order chicken fajitas, and just ate the peppers and onions out of it .. they had a very nice taste. You are definitely better off booking all a la cartes. The buffet at the Caribe is huge, but extremely crowded with kids who are sneezing on everything, which is always lovely. overall, I would say is was an average place to stay, 3 stars.... definitely not 4 or 5also, the bavaro shopping mall..... unless you want to be hassled and being begged to come in and check out their stores ... stay away.
