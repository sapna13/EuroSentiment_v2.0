{"text":"Unexpectedly blown away by this little gem... After the fancy chic of Alila Ubud, I didn't really have high hopes for Alila Manggis which seemed like a poorer sister of sorts... But I was actually quite blown away by the tranquil ambience of relaxing beachside surroundings, the warm service of attentive but non-intrusive staff and the general congeniality in terms of the famous SeaSalt restaurant as well as the unspoilt countryside through we cycled through. But here are my short points that i wanted to share... Room -- I totally loved the room especially the two wide and spacious day-beds, one within the room so that we could mess around with our barang-barang and one in the balcony overlooking the pool, the expanse of coconut trees and the sea : ) The external day-bed was especially comfortable place to relax at anytime of the day -- while sipping camomile tea to slowly wake up from sweet dreams, while reading a good book to while away a rainy afternoon or even at night while talking to someone back home... I also liked the convenience that the wash area with the basin was separate from the shower area so that my friend and i could multi-task : ) I also liked the turn-down service and the aromatherapy amenities which helped us to relax.Service -- As mentioned above, I totally liked the service with staff that were pro-active and attentive without being intrusive. They were wonderful to chat with and they were warm in an engaging way! Our snorkelling guide was especially patient and attentive to our needs especially given that the currents were against us : (Pool -- Compared to Alila Ubud, this shallow pool was nothing to wax lyrical about but it was functional in a simple way and it is still a nice pool to lounge around : ) Restaurant -- I thought that the food was top-rated and I liked the blends of east and west that the executive chef had created. The breakfast sets were also very scrumptious although the asian dishes were slightly more appetising on my palate. A suggestion would be to offer the Rice Table as another option to the complimentary Balinese and Western meuns that we were offered. Further, perhaps they could increase the BBQ Seafood nights to more than merely Friday night?!? Suggestion -- To better their maps so that more guests could enjoy the walking and cycling trails -- the latter was especially interesting for us as we roamed about the village roads which were both safe and also inviting with cute village children calling out to us from their schools : ) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":874,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":871},{"endOffset":874,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":871},{"endOffset":874,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":871},{"endOffset":874,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":871},{"endOffset":874,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":871},{"endOffset":1087,"mention":"basin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Basin_Harbor_Club"],"startOffset":1082},{"endOffset":1087,"mention":"basin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Basin_Harbor_Club"],"startOffset":1082},{"endOffset":1087,"mention":"basin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Basin_Harbor_Club"],"startOffset":1082},{"endOffset":1729,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1725}]}
