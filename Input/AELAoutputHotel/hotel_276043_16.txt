{"text":"Cold!!! My wife, son and I stayed at the Berlin Marriott in Potsdamer Platz for a week at the end of March 2008, booking with Marriott Rewards points. Let me start by stating - COLD. Berlin is freezing then, most days 32-36 F highest temp, and snow flurries the first three days. We are SoCal people, so it was a bit unpleasant. Despite the COLD, the location of the Berlin Marriott makes your stay - within walking distance of all the important tourist sites in the Mitte district, and has both U-Bahn and S-Bahn access nearly at your doorstep to take you anywhere and everywhere in Berlin. Berlin by far and away has the BEST public transportation system I have seen, easy to use even if you don't speak German, and it goes everywhere by over or underground train, bus or street trams ( mostly in the older East Berlin areas )! Berlin is historic, with a a history that needs to be relearned and yet their growth out of WWII is also epic. There is so much to see and do, the museums and tourist sites are everywhere and top notch. There is a strong effort for Germans to relearn their epochal crimes and re-connect with the Jewish culture that was so integral to their history, and this is apparent in most of the city and tourist\/historical sites. There was not attempt to whitewash or hide their past, though their approach sometimes seems too clinical, lacking the depth of emotion that the enormity of the crimes deserved. Nonetheless, it was a warm experience, with so much to see and do that despite the COLD we were constantly on the go. And do not forget the warm apple strudel, coffee mit schlag ( with whipped nonsugary cream ) that caps every afternoon's journey around 4 o'clock. So Berlin is a great experience, and I would recommend to everyone a visit. But as for the hotel, let me start by noting I am a big fan of Marriott in general, but was not as pleased with their Berlin offering. The hotel is modern, American style, in the best location 1 block from the U-Bahn subway for Potsdamer Platz, connecting with most of Berlin. This location was in the  dead zone  of the Berlin Wall years ago, and a memorial remnant of the wall is there. The hotel had an unusual odor in the lobby which likely was related to cleaning solvents or deodorant, but was sickenly sweet. A large atrium allowed the odor to waft up to the upper floors where we were. Breakfast was not included, so we did not eat at the restaurant except for one dinner which was average, moderately but not exquisitely pricey, even considering the euro at $ 1.56. There are plenty of coffee shops to get a coffee and pastry\/croissant in the morning. The bedding was NOT the usual new bedding seen at other Marriotts, rather a pillowtop mattress cover over a standard, fairly lumpy mattress. Way to soft and led to Back Pain City. Complaints to the front desk to change the mattresses brought housekeeping who removed the pillowtop mattress cover only. Not sufficient. Room was average size, good view of construction in Berlin, modern good bathroom. No flat screen TV was unusual for this age in a good 4-5 star hotel.Internet access of 20 euro per day was outrageous - thank god there was a Dunkin' Donuts 3 minutes away with Internet cafe access at 1 euro ( not to mention the donuts ). We left after 6 nights having had a wonderful though freezing trip, and with aching backs from the beds. Would I go back to the Marriott again? Likely, because of location,location,location.
