{"text":"Paradisus severely lacking. Stayed at the paradisus for our honeymoon sept. 18-24. We arrived at the Paradisus around 4pm on the 18th and were greeted with a strawberry fruit drink while checking in, in the expansive, gorgeous open air lobby. Upon arrival to our room we found a beautiful arrangement of towel figures upon our bed along with Good night spelled out in flowers. Very nice touch.......until I went into the bathroom and found it infested with ants. I called the bellman back along with the representative that checked us in and was assured it would be taken care of while we went to get something to eat. Upon searching for somewhere to eat we discovered that the place was like a ghost town(not a bad thing) and that the only place to eat was at the italian restaurant. One restaurant open at 4:30 pm? Not exactly my idea of exclusive service and definitely not mentioned during booking or in the brochure. Having no choice, Italiian it was. The food I ordered was not the food I recieved and the pizza was less than acceptable. Upon further investigation I found out the resort was operating at less than 20% capacity. Returning to the room I was disappointed again to find that our insect infestation problem was not addressed. I called the front desk and was told someone would be out immediately. Within 5 minutes a hotel employee showed up with a can of bug spray and a rag and went to work. 5 minutes later he is finished and leaves. The bugs are still there and now the room smells like raid. I call the desk again and voice my displeasure and request a new room, which they take care of in about 30 minutes. No apology, no offer of upgrade, no sort of compensation. Whatever. This review could go on forever so I will condense. For the next 5 days the resort had a series of rolling blackouts which they would announce with a note under your door everyday. This meant no electricity in certain portions of the complex everyday. No electricity means, no blended drinks, no AC, no light to see during the buffet breakfast(which there is only one of everyday), no hot water, etc. I dont know if this is a way to save money when the resort is slow or what but definitely unacceptable at a supposed 5 star resort. Now on to my main complaint. The resort has a claimed ten restaurants open for dinner, with two of them requiring reservations. Every night, and I mean every single night of our stay, a minimum of four of the listed restaurants were closed, and two were actually just one place named twice. Each night there was no more than three choices of places to eat. The worst part was, you didn't know what was going to be closed until the day it was closed. We didn't get to eat at the Mexican restaurant(which we heard was outstanding) because it was only open two nights we were there and we had reservations at the other two restaurants those nights. What a major disappointment. False advertising aside, I feel as if I didn't get the exclusive all inclusive treatment that they advertise and that I paid for. Dont promise me something that I paid for and I expect to get and then not deliver because its the off season, or your not at full capacity. As far as the grounds, the beach, and the pool, absolutely beautiful. Walking to the shops, you may want to mentally prepare yourself for the abuse you will take from the local shop owners(aka vultures) that will swoop down upon you to practically drag you into their shops. Would I ever I go back to the Punta Cana, yes, would I ever go back to the Paradisus, definitely not.
