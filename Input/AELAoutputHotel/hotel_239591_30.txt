{"text":"A more perfect location couldn't be found!! My partner and I are just back from 3 nights in Hotel Principal, Barcelona. I booked the hotel after reading reviews from this site. When we arrived in Barcelona we got the Airport bus into Plaza de Catalunya. The bus was cheap and very quick. We didn't really know where the hotel was although they had provided directions with the booking. But with luggage etc we decided to get a taxi. Plaza de Catalunya is right at the top of Las Ramblas which we could look down. We were smiling when the taxi turned into Las Ramblas because that meant our hotel was central. The hotel is off hospital street, I think it's the 1st or 2nd street off it. Literally 2-3 minutes walk from Las Rambles. The benefit of being a street away is that we couldn't hear any noise from the main tourist area (if there was any). The hotel was very clean and quite modern. The room we had was large with a double bed and a single bed. modern bathroom with powerful shower (always V important!), plenty of storage space and a safety deposit box. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There is even FREE internet access!! Great if you want to check your flight is on time. We were able to leave our luggage with the hotel as we had an evening flight. Breakfast wasn't included in the booking but we paid for it one day - It was good by City Break standards, hot and cold buffet for about √à√\u2020√ü?. The rooms also had air conditioning for those hot summer days and nights. The hotel is very close the metro stop Liceu (On Las Ramblas 2-3 mins)(green Line). The food market is about two streets up. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Principal and would recommend it to anyone. Barcelona in general is quite expensive for hotels but this was reasonable and the location and facilities were perfect. ","annotations":[]}
