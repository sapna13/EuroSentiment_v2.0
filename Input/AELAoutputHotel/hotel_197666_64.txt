{"text":"Deserves it's top 10 spot! Why this hotel fell from its former position of #1 to it's current position of #9 (as of 16\/08\/2008) is beyond me. Maybe #1 was a bit of an exaggeration but it still deserves to be in the top 5 hotels in Paris. Moving on to the actual review, we arrived here on the 4th August at around 9.30 AM, and check in (if I remember correctly) was at 12 PM. We had booked a deluxe room (for 4), a triple room (for 3) and a double room (for 2). The deluxe room was ready which was a bit of a surprise, and the other two rooms required a little more time. As a result, all 9 of us went into the deluxe room, placed our luggage in there and freshened up after having to wake up at 1 AM in the morning to catch our 5 AM Eurostar journey to Paris. The deluxe room wasn't tiny (and neither were the triple and double rooms) but neither was it spacious. With all our luggage in the the deluxe room (9 peoples worth), there was still some room to move around in. The beds were truly comfortable (which was a great advantage as we spent 3 days in Paris and we had to rush to fit everything in therefore we were burnt out by the end of each day), the room decor was excellent and the bathroom was very classy too. They also do a continental breakfast buffet i.e. croissants, pain au chocolat, cornflakes, turkey slices, yoghurt etc. which was 15 euros per person. The breakfast room's decor was also very well done, although the room was smallish. There was a member of staff present, restocking the fresh juices and foods, and she was also very helpful and cheerful.The receptionists (changes in the morning and evenings) were very cheerful and helpful, which was excellent. On two occasions, we got back to the hotel past midnight and the hotel was locked. We knocked and the night time receptionist happily allowed us in. It's also worthy of note that there is an elevator which goes up and down to all floors. The hotel offers a whole range of free services e.g. Wifi internet and it won't do the hotel any justice mentioning them here, it's-see-it-to-believe-it.Overall, it boosted our first trip to Paris from excellent to unforgettable.
