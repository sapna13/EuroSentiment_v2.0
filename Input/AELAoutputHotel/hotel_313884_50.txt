{"text":"Take soft Toilet Tissue If you only read one part of my review...skip down to Illness.Resort in General: It was very beautiful. Grounds were well kept, pool was perfect with a swim up bar, beach was clean white  powdery and the staff was very friendly. Never an issue finding a lounge chair and many tiki hut umbrellas were available for shade. They don't seem to believe in wash cloths so make sure to bring your own or a puff. Rooms were a bit musty so a candle is a great thing to pack.Bar: If you upgrade for the platinum be sure to ask for those premium products. Also, they are only available at the swim up bar and lobby bars. The other bars did not stock premium alcohol. Also, you can't get these drinks after 12 as those bars are closed and the resort becomes a ghost town. They don't seem to encourage socializing. Besides the swim up bar, there were no bar stools around the actual bar to sit around and mingle with other hotel guests. Pina Coladas were like dish water but the Coco Locos and rum were tasty.Food: Only 1 sit down restaurant open per night but no schedule provided as to what it was. We missed our first meal and thought we were going to be on a French Fry diet the entire trip because the food at the 24 hour location was HORRIBLE. Tasted bad, not cold, not hot, mayo on cold meat left out in the heat...just bad bad bad. Fondue was tasty. Italian was less than desirable. Heard Tex Mex was good but never made it. Casabe buffet was the most decent (rice, bread and noodles are hard to goof up). We had one great room service lunch and one wretched room service late night.Illness: Became horribly sick 1 1\/2 days into it. Toilet tissue in the washroom was not conducive for the illness that hits. I say this with humor but I'm also not kidding. I've been to Cancun and Jamaica and always get a touch of an upset stomach but this is something I've never experienced. Almost missed a planned excursion because I was fearful that between the doubled over pain in my upper stomach and the trips to the restroom that I wouldn't make it. Airport waiting and airplane ride were interesting but somehow I made it home. Read this site and found that it seems to be a recent problem at this resort. At the advice from another reviewer I contacted my travel agent and she is investigating it to see if the resort had made and efforts to correct the situation. Traveled with 2 others and although they weren't as ill as I was, they felt it at 1 1\/2 days into it as well. We drank only bottled water (however, it was bottled in the DR so pack some water from home in your checked luggage) but we did have ice in our drinks. I really think it was the food that did us all in. The precautions for food just weren't taken...see the Food section above for examples. All I can say is luckily I was with true friends and they listened to me complain the entire time of this illness without making me feel like a whiner.It's a shame that the food and sickness were such big problems because the resort has so much potential with its beauty.
