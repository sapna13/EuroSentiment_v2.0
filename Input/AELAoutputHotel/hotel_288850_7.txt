{"text":"Very nice hotel ...made my first trip to AMS extreemly esteem I have visited Amsterdam on my last trip to Europe, i have never been to The netherlands b4r. this hotel has made my this frist trip to AMS very memorable and esteem. i liked the hotel from all point of veiw. i have visited The Neatherland as a guest of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and they have arrainged my accomodation for 10 nights in the this hotel. the check in staff was very cooperative and very obliging. they have allowded me to early chack in as there reguler check in time is at 1400hrs. but they allowed me to check in at 0900hrs. Atcually i was booked in Sharaton which is there just in front of schipol Airport. but due to Unavailability of the rooms for all of us in the sharaton they have asked me and my few other fellow guest to stay for 1 night at this hotel but after being stayed here for one night we dint felt to check out from here and to go to sharaton so , we all have desided to stay here only.Here not only front office staff but the restaurant staff was also very humbeld and allwasy smiling. the breack fast room is quite specious and nicely decorated equipped with all the eminities and facility which requiers to serve the guest in betterway.the rooms are also very nicely decorated and maintain.so all n all this hotel is worth of staying and worth of paying( eventhough i havent paid for but still) .after that first saty i have allways asked KLM to book me in the same hotel for next two of my visit to AMS and will allways ask in future also to book in the same hotel.As it is very near to the Airport and not so far from city center. If you want to saty for peacfull yet near to city then i would recommand this hotel for sure....
