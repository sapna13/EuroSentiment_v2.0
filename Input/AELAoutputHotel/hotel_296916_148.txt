{"text":"Enjoyed our stay I booked a 3 night stay at Hotel Jazz for myself and my daughter after reading some great reports on Trip Advisor. We certainly werent disappointed and the tips other reviewers had given about getting the Aerobus from the airport and getting off at Universitat were spot on! It was so easy and quick and at 3 euros 90 each way it was a bargain too. Would probably have got a taxi if I hadnt read this website!The hotel was a short walk from the bus stop and the rooms were modern and comfortable. We had a view of a busy street, but being on the 6th floor noise was not really a problem. The Christmas lights outside made a lovely view from our window. We had a drink at the hotel bar each night before going out but the bar was deserted and we were often the only people there, which mean there wasnt a lot of atmosphere in the place. We eat at Sinatra's (just off Plaza Real) one night and can highly recommend. Also ate at Cellar de Tapas (much recommended on this site), which was very good. On our final night we ate at La Fonda at Port Olympic where the food and atmosphere were fantastic. Would definitely recommend. TAlthough it was the 'poshest' of the three restaurants we visited it actually worked out the cheapest. The hotel receptionist told us we would not get in without a booking, but we secured a table on arrival with no problem. Staff were very friendly and we got complimentary liquers where they simple brought the bottle and the shot glasses and left it on the table with us!The port area was very quiet in the evening (compared to my last visit in September). The hotel location was excellent for accessing many areas of the city and only a short walk from Plaza Catalunya where the open top bus tours began. All in all a very enjoyable trip, although if you are going to Barcelona for the shopping, you may be a little disappointed...we have had much better elsewhere.Go to the Jazz, you will not be disappointed!
