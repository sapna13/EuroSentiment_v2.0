{"text":"4 *- I don't think so! We decided to book Atenea for a three night stay in December as it had received fairly good reviews, was convenient to the metro and provided breakfast. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed with what we found, yes the hotel is very convenient to the metro, but that was about its only positive feature. The hotel is very dated and the curtains and carpets in the rooms could do with a bit of a scrub. Although the rooms had kitchens, unless you bring your own kitchen utensils with you this is not a major advantage. On the plus side the sheets were clean and we were provided with clean towels every day. The walls in the hotel are extremely thin, as well as becoming familiar with our neighbours' (above, below and beside) nocturnal habits, we could also smell smoke from other rooms.Breakfast was a bizarre affair, granted during our stay breakfast was served in a different location from the norm, but this did not excuse the complete lack of organisation. The room consisted of mainly large tables, seated for about 8 people, so we had to share with other groups. On the first morning we had to wait until bowls were washed to have cereal, on the third morning our cereal was soggy by the time we got spoons. The toaster did not work and the hot food was luke warm.Barcelona is a great city, with plenty to offer everyone but if I was to visit it again I would certainly not stay in hotel Atenea.
