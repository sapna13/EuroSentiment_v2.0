{"text":"Bendigedig - the Welsh for wonderful. Where does one start.I think initially I would like to comment on curious remarks from other reviews. Common sense says sun tan oil is more exoensive at the resort and start at factor 30 and work down , there are mozzies in warm climates so take spray with you, it was clear that top shelf drinks were free and was it a surprise that they spoke Spanish; we certainly didn't find that a problem and we're Welsh.When in Rome................Forget the journey from Wales to London etc., we arrived and there was a wow factor at the scale of the place.Reception was a hoot when we were mischieviously told our room was the opposite end to our request. It was spot on, 20 yards from pool bar and 30 yards from beach.We researched and yes staff respond to courtesies and a small tip goes a long way; in our experience better value than the larger tips we give in cities around the world.Our maid was fine as was the room; cistern had a perpetual drip which they worked to resolve.The grounds fascinated me and watching the gardner's was a treat, particularly when they arrived with barrowloads of coconuts.Never thought I would enjoy all inclusive but I did but having said that I fell downstairs four days before leaving so needed pampering and my massage on day 1 certainly improved my mobility.Food - Francia at Hispaniola was a treat and looked after us. We breakfasted there most days and whilst it catered more for carnivores, there was variety. The ommellettes were brill. but after 3 days I felt the pound piling on so gradually through the week my self control improved. It was nicer there when quieter. We lunched there a couple of times but mostly at the beach eatery. We got into the 8am A la carte booking routine which added to variety and did all bar two one of which was a pay for which we didn't do because we did the pay for on the beachat Cafe del Mar and didn't want to spoil the memory. The Japanese is worth trying and great fun and we enjoyed the Asian despite bad reports. Are my wife and I to easy to please, probably not but you have to put things in perspective.Staff were really good and besides Francia, Jose at the pool bar made a real effort to look after custome's and entertain. It's amazing how staff respond to pleasantness.We spent most of our days on the beach , reading, walking, cooling down in the surf and chilling. My bad baxk curtailed water sports but my wife Scuba's and snorkelled off a reef which she loved.Nice touches were a birtday card and a get well card when feeling unwell. Needed a blood test and the medicall centre staff were helpful and no charge for arranging hospital visit.Evening entertainment could be a tad repetitive but so is most of the crap we watch at home on television.Bar staff in main foyer were as good as anywhere and it was a relaxing evening venue.We didn't meet many Brits but had small talk with people from other countries and we saw none of the rudeness reported in other reviews.Shopping at the beach bazaars or outside the hotel can be a bit of a hassle but as long as you get into the mood of haggling it's not too bad. Just don't buy for the sake of it. Had it not been for injury I would have enjoyed sailing but hey there's always next time.Someone mentioned watered down drinks; my head didn't notice that and myself and the Presidente became good friends. Actually the red wine tasted watery but I enjoyed it not being heady. Champagne was fine, not Bollinger but acceptable.We're not posting pics as we have over 400 to choose from.Haven't mentioned stomach bugs yet; didn't have any but we're Welsh and hardy people or is our cooking worse lol.We would recommend this to couples, families, older people ( plenty of shades and beds everywhere ) and from what we saw honeymoon planning was excellent.
