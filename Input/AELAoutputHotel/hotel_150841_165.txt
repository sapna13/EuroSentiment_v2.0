{"text":"We will be back!!!! Two families travelled ages between 55 and 9. Travelled with First Choice. Plenty to do all day long if thats what you want, or you can just chill by the pool. Hotel grounds are beautiful, well kept gardens, pool areas clean. We have stayed at Iberostar Hacienda Dominicus (south of DR by Caribbean sea) and Iberostar Costa Dorada (north of DR) We found the beach on the south of the island the best as the sea was always calm and turquoise blue, Bavaro was our second fav, the beach here lovely soft sand and lovely sea. The beach at Costa Dorada was not so good, dark coarse sand and much rougher sea. The staff were all very helpful and happy and always saying hola. The children could always find food they liked in the buffet which was very good. We didnt like the Japanese resteraunt at all..the service was very poor and slow, and when the food came, it was cold and even still frozen in one case! The Gourmet resteraunt was excellent, by far the best. We went on a Saturday night for the romantic dinner. Given bubbly and flower on arrival. Lovely setting. The Jambalaya (cajun) was also very good, we would rate this our second favourite. We stayed for 2 weeks and managed to get as many speciality resteraunts as we wanted, which for a party of 10 was good, although adults only at Gourmet. We tried the mexican resteraunt located in the IB Dominican next door which we were not very keen on. No atmosphere and food not partically good. It can be difficult to get reservations in the IB Dominicana and IB Punta Cana as they give priority to their guests first and as we were there for Easter, the hotels were at full capacity.The rooms were the best out of the 3 IB hotels that we have stayed at in DR and better than IB Tucan in Mexico. Plenty of room, newly re furbished bathrooms, TV, coffee maker, iron and ironing board. There are intercommunicating rooms available for families. Its best to e-mail in advance and request one. Our friends had requested one but didnt get it on arrival. They were able to move the following day-reception staff were very helpful regarding this.We tended to spend most of the day by the pool and go to the beach around 3pm for a change of scenery and also to enjoy the breeze which was most welcoming. You can walk for miles along the beach. If you fancy taking a trip on a speed boat to the natural pool (about 15 mins away) and snorkelling, we would recommend Pedro who runs a small boat from just by the shack shops to the right of the resort. We were charged $20 per adult and $10 per child for a 2 1\/2 hour trip which we thought was excellent value, much cheaper than booking through the hotel reps. His mate Manuel was good fun too!!The star friends were good fun, especially Oscar, J P and Henry. The shows in the evening were OK, some better than others but quite entertaining. Had a massage at the spa which was good. If you are thinking of visiting this hotel you wont be disappointed. We are already thinking of returning next year. !! Try to remember to tip the staff who dont normally receive many tips, ie the gardeners and glass collecters, they work very hard too!!
