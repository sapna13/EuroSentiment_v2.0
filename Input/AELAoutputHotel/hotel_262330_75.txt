{"text":"Great Staff, Location, Rooms, Loved it! My teenage son and I flew in for a short business trip  to see the parade. To start off, the doormen begin your stay with a warm greeting. The front desk staff are friendly  helpful. The room was amazing. Spacious, clean, beautifully equipped. They do warn you at the desk if you pull something out of the fridge, that you will be charged. If you put it back, they'll credit you. There isn't anything they won't do to make your stay pleasent. It's just too bad we weren't in the hotel, but to sleep. We ordered room-service, which was extremely good. I hate reading reviews, cause it's hard to chose a hotel in NYC. I always wait a month to write a review, incase I had a bad experience. Most people don't. It's easiest to blame the hotel. I'm there every month and try to stay in a different location. This hotel is a hop on the subway to everything. Subway is right across the street. It's right next to Century 21. My Favorite store. The view from our room was amazing. We could see every part of Ground Zero. It was important for me to have my son see the devastion that was caused. Everything was amazing: the bedding, cleanliness, staff, location, all of it. With the exception of the conceierge. He would rather help the business men, then a lady  her teenage son. Don't worry about the construction noise. They put you on a high floor and we didn't even hear it. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1051,"mention":"Zero","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Zero"],"startOffset":1047}]}
