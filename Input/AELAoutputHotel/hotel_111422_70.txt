{"text":"Affordable suite in Boston i just spent 4 nights at the Doubletree Suites and enjoyed it thoroughly. Booked a 2-room suite on line at a very good rate. I was given a high floor suite with a view of the river and downtown Boston. As a Mel Brooks fan I thought the High Anxiety atrium and elevators were a hoot! Front desk staff was friendly, courteous and helpful. I enjoy walking and did not mind the location. It is a 0.9 mile stroll to the red line Central Sq T-stop. There is also a terrific Whole Foods market right nearby (less than a 5-minute walk). The suite does not have a kitchen, just a very small refrigerator and sink, but it is usable for keeping drinks, fruit, cheese, etc. The hotel is showing its age a bit around the edges, but the price is right and makes a good base of operations for visiting Boston. (It does help if you know your way around already- you are not downtown.) The only irritants are the extra charges for parking ($20 per day but with unlimited in-and-out) and the $10 per day for wireless access. I can understand the parking charge-it is Boston after all and parking is at a premium. All the on-street parking in the area is resident sticker only. But there is no reason to charge extra for wireless and most hotels do not charge for it anymore. The hotel includes a restaurant, lounge and jazz club that is a destination for jazz buffs in the area, but was not intrusive during my visit except for a brief burst of noise as the show got out on Saturday night. I cannot vouch for the quality of the venues; I was on the go the whole time and did not use any of them. There is a decent fitness room on site which I used once when the snow made it impossible to run along the Charles. The bike\/running path is right outside the hotel.
