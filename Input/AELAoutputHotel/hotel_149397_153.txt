{"text":"Excellent Honeymoon My wife and I stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon after her sister and husband honeymooned there. It was excellent!We booked the Platinum Package.Upon arrival we got out of our shuttle from the airport and told the Bavaro Bellman that we were Platinum and were immediately put in a trolly with our luggage and taken to the Platinum Lounge. We were greated with a drink and a wet towel. Our room was in building 73 which was 100 feet from the beach and the platinum lounge, and about 200 feet from the pool and 3 of the restaurants.The Room:Our room was very clean, no bugs, and very spacious. All of the rooms at the facility are the same size. The only difference we saw was in the patio furniture we had new chase lounges with cushions while others far away from the platinum lounge had whicker furniture. Housekeeping was great (we left a $5 tip every day). When you leave your room put the green card in your door lock that says make the room please our room was always cleaned between 9am and 10am. Nightly turndown service (a platinum feature) was very nice they remade the bed and brought fresh towels.The Pool and Pool Towels:The pool was nice and the swim-up bar with Julio as the bartender was a lot of fun. The resort has nice pool\/beach towels, and if you are platinum you get unlimited pool\/beach towels. The other guests get one card per person that they turn in for a pool towel and then have to exchange for another towel. If you loose your towel card or the towel it is a $15 charge. Platinum guests also get pool towels left in their room every day. There is only 1 place to get these pool towels so it can also be inconvienent and that is alway were all of the excursion salesmen are so be prepared to asked at least 3 times to buy an excursion when you get a pool towel.The Food:The food was good and we did not go hungry. The buffets offered a wide choice of food and dinner at the main buffet had a nightly theme. There was some evidence of food recycling.A'la carte restaurants:Platinum guests get to make reservations for the entire week at check-in while other guests can only make their reservations for the same day. If the hotel was fuller this would have been a clearer advantage. We enjoyed the steakhouse, seafood house, the gourmet (Licey), and the piano bar. We did not enjoy the Tanuki which was the teppanyaki restaurant. The food at Tanuki was bland the show was very basic. The food at the piano bar (Chopin) was good, but our reservation was for 7pm and the show did not start until 8:30 so we left.The Beach:Get up early - and put your towels under a little hut and then leave. The towels reserve your hut each day and there are not enough to go around. Sign-up often and in advance for the free water sports they were cancelled often because of the wind, so always have a back-up was lost out on sailing because of the wind was too much.The Alcohol:Platinum customers get premium liquor at every bar, but you have to ask because they don't keep it in plain view of all of the customers. Just remember Rum and Coke Imperial The Imperial rum was the best rum on the resort, and never in public view. We bought some off site for $30 per bottle. We asked a bartender and he sold it to us for $20 a bottle. The Dominican wine is horrible and we could not believe people were drinking it; I've had better wine from a box.Room Service:Available 24 hours and free for platinum guests. We ordered a pizza upon arrival and did not like it. We ordered cuban sandwiches and they were good. The menu is lacking because they want you to go the restaurants.Coconuts:If you see a groundsmen climbing trees to gather coconuts or to prune be sure to ask him for a coconut. A $1 tip will get a coconut that was ripe for eating or unripe for the coconut water. Either are great, and we enjoyed them almost every day.In Closing:We enjoyed our stay, but I would guess the resort was only at the most 25% full. If I went during peak season Platinum woud be a must, in the off season the benefits were nice, but not absolutely necessary given the low occupancy. I still would book the platinum for the advantages.
