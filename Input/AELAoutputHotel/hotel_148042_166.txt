{"text":"Great hotel, very friendly staff Stayed here for 7 nights toward the end of June. Was there for work,but was lucky enough to be able to spend a weekend there aswell. Hotel was fantastic and really enjoyed my time there. Hotel is about a 20 min ride to Old San juan, but located right on the beach front and minutes from the hotel. You can also get to 2 large malls within 15 minutes and the Belz outlet in about 30 mins (all dependant on traffic)I had a very good rate, though my company, which for the price I paid made the hotel very good value. I stayed in the normal room, facing the car park area. For about $40 a night I could have upgraded to a pool view, and if I had been on holidays there, I might have done it.Positives- Most friendly and helpful staff I have ever come across. Everyone from security, cleaners, front desk, restaurant staff are all friendly. Actually this seemed to be the trend in San Juan- Room had a nice large flat screen TV- Room was large, clean etc- Room ammenities were from Bvlgari and included everything you could want from shampoo, conditioner, sewing kit etc- great restaurants, especially BLT. Fantastic steak (but you pay for it!)- pool was really nice, easy to get a deck chair.- Right at the beach frontNegatives- not really many. the only one (minor at that) was on weekend afternoons by the pool it is quite crowded. So not a lot of free space in the pool and a lot of noise depending on the crowd.I have read complaints about others about the airport, but this is not that distracting, you get use to it. I did hear the planes from my room, but they are not going when most people would want to sleep e.g. the last one was always around 10:30pm or so.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel, great food, pool, tennis court, gym, beach, and a casino for those interested ","annotations":[{"endOffset":935,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":931}]}
