{"text":"Great week March Break 08Hotel:The hotel was very well maintained. We stayed in building 4. It wasn't the newest or the nicest of the buildings but it was very clean and comfortable for our whole week. Plenty of hot water, towels and water every day.Beach:We Chose Punta Cana because of the beach. It was a very nice beach with enough shade to retreat to. There was no shortage of lounges and it was a busy week for the hotel. Nice enough swimming area. It was the best amongst the hotels in the same area.Food:Food was good. Never had any trouble finding something delicious to eat. I think my only complaint for the whole trip fits in this category. We had to make reservations for the a la carte restaurants. We ended up with a few early meals because it was so overbooked but the 4 nights we ate at the a la cartes they were pretty much empty every night. I'm not sure if people were making reservations and not keeping them? There was no need for us to eat as early as we did or no need for a reservation for that matter. Something small we took note of.Staff\/tourists99% of the staff were super nice and accommodating. Very pleasant and enthusiastic. I found we had a great mix of people down at the same time as us. Everyone was very friendly and easy to get along with. If you're looking for quiet and boredom the adult pool is the place to be. The music, games, and fun are in the main pool. (where I spent my days)OverallI would definitely recommend this resort. I will return if I want to play it safe. Meaning if I don't want to try somewhere new. Can't beat the beach and the drive to the airport. 20 mins (if the guests at the other hotels are ready). I would recommend 7 nights is enough. 10 would be fantastic but 14 would be too much! Please email me with any questions!
