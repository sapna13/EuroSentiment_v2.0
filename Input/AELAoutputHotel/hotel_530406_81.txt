{"text":"Not a good experience at all1 I stayed at Ocean Sand with the wedding party from KDeller. What a terrible vacation. Not only did the things go wrong she listed, but also the following: maintenance took a long time to respond to calls to replace light bulbs in rooms, fix shower hoses that had been slit, and to fix leak in ceiling in room. Average number of calls it took to get maintenance to respond was 5 calls and took up to 4 hours to respond. Our last night there, I had a leak in our room ceiling, pouring water and the gyprock had already started to come down too due to the amount of water coming down. We called 3 times to get someone to come fix it and was told each time someone was already there responding! Ah, no. It took over an hour and the last call I was told to call back in the morning. When I asked why I needed to wait for the morning, I was told that was when I could get the bottle of water I was asking for! I'm not kidding. They thought our panic was for a bottle or water, not matter how many times they were told water was coming from the ceiling. Bed bugs galore in the couchs\/chaise lounges in rooms, cock roach seen on buffet table, food disgusting, no English from staff, not enough staff to handle volumns of people etc.Overall, a disappointment for all of us. Not recommended to anyone to go there. ","annotations":[]}
