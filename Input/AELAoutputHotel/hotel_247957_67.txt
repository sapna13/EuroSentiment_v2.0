{"text":"You will have a good time My partner and I just got back from the Occidental Grand in Punta Cana...I wish I was still there!Again, like many other people, some of the reviews on Trip Advisor scared me half to death! But you will have a good time at this hotel.We stayed in the Premium Club with Air Transat. It's nice because they bring you fresh beach towels and sweets every night. We also managed to get an ocean view room which is always a bonus. As with all All inclusive resorts, by the end of the week, you get a bit tired of the food. We enjoyed the food though. Breakfast is great, can't ask for more...eggs, pancakes, pastries, yogurt, fruit, etc. We realized that the best coffee is the double espresso from the coffee machines. And mangos must have been in season because they were amazing. All the fruit was good.At lunch there is a buffet at the beach and a small buffet by the main pool above the swim up bar. The pool lunch is nice because it's not as busy and you feel that the staff take care of you more. Also, they have burgers  fries which sometimes we craved. The lunch buffet is much like the dinner buffet, something for everyone. Salads, breads, pizza, fresh grilled fish  meats, fruit  sweets. Lots to choose from. We had dinner at the Italian and we were kind of dissapointed. But this should not put you off, because even if you really didn't like what you had, the buffet is open until 10:30 so there is always an option. Also, upstairs above the lobby there is a pizzeria and a taco place. Both were very good, and both are open late. No reservations required. One night we paid extra ($44 USD per person including tax) for the lobster dinner on the beach. If you like lobster, you should definitely go for this. They bbq the lobster and it is so delicious. And it's romantic too.The beach is beautiful...the water is amazing.One tip that I read on Trip Advisor that really helped us was that we should bring lots of small bills for tipping. We brought plenty of 1 dollar bills for tipping the maids, waiters, hostesses and cooks. We noticed that the same people that were serving us for breakfast, many times were also serving us for dinner. They work very hard and it doesn't seem like there is a lot of tipping going on. I would say that the staff are lacking slightly in the area of hospitality, but this could be due to a language barrier or cultural differences? In any case, they do a good job to keep things clean and fun for us. I just kept thinking that we paid approx $1000 per person Canadian for our trip, and there were so many staff on hand...how much can the staff really be making per hour?This is a nice place to go for an escape. If you want to party, watch the shows and meet people, you can. If you want a more relaxing holiday, you can also have that. The resort is so big that you can get away from the comotion if you want.
