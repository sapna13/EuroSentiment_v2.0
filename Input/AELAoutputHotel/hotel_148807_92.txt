{"text":"A wonderful, relaxing escape at the Copamarina... My wife and I stayed at the Copamarina from Thursday through Monday in late January and had an excellent time there.We flew into San Juan, and took the hotel's shuttle to and from the airport. Both trips took three hours (traffic slowed us on the way there and a pit stop to pick up an additional passenger that never showed up slowed us on the way back). At $120 each way for two, it was a bit pricey, but we concerned about driving from other reviews we read. The drive is scenic, and not really that treacherous in my opinion. We'll definitely rent a car next time.And I think there will certainly be a next time!The staffmembers were very pleasant (with a few exceptions) and helpful, and the service was quite good (a little slower than we're use to in the states, but we were on vacation, so no worries)We loved the food and the beach. If you get up rather early, you can likely get one of the three four-post beach beds that are very comfortable and I would recommend that you try to spend a few hours of your stay in one.We did the All-Inclusive package, and were not dissappointed (although my pregnant wife would have liked to be able to take full advantage of the free drinks, she like the yummy frozen drinks sans alcohol). The breakfast buffet made for a tasty start to each day. The made-to-order omelets were just OK but everything else was right up our alley. For lunches, we loved the fact that the waiters that worked the beach would bring food in additon to beverages. The Chicken Quesadillas were delicious as was the grilled Tuna. We generally had a snack at the beach in the late morning followed by a late lunch at the outdoor restaurant. We both gained a few pounds from this trip!Dinner was also quite tasty, although we stuck with more traditional dishes like Filet Mignon and Sea Bass versus some of the Puerto Rican Nouvelle Cuisine offerings. We sat in the resturant the first two nights, and reserved outside tables for nights three and four. Our servers were courteous and efficient, and the desserts were tasty, too.As for drinks, the frozen drinks were very good, especially the mudslide. The bartenders worked hard to please, and we tipped them accordingly. I drink mostly beer, and the selection was pretty good for an all-inclusive place (selections included Heineken, Presidente, Medalia Light, and others) and it was always ICE cold.As for the room, we stayed in an Oceanview room, and it was nothing special, but it had everything we needed. We did appreciate having access to the pool and the beach right outside our door!I played volleyball everyday (beware, the ground is particularly hard on the court), and it was a fun game. My wife and I took out the big water tricycle, and it was a workout. The catamarans looked fun, but we did not take advantage. We went ona snorkeling trip that was fun, but we've been spoiled by trips to Maui such that we were a little disappointed in the number and variety of the fish that we saw.The beach was clean, and well maintained, and there just wasn't much to distract us from our reading and sunbathing. It was, in a word, paradise.All in all, I'd highly recommend the Copamarina to anyone who wants a relaxing trip. We did not bring our 20 month old son with us, but know that we will next time, as the Copamarina seemed like a great place for kids. We wanted to check out the villas to see if they would be good for a vacation with my wife's sister, her husband and their kids the next time around, but they were all booked up.We'll report back when we visit again.
