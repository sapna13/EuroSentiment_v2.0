{"text":"Wonderful hotel for not only quality and location, but price I stayed here, under name alone two years ago, since then they moved next door and are just as good. I came here for an automotive event I worked on Hollywood Blvd which was hdqrtd at the nearby Rossevelt. This is the best hotel I have found which is equally within easy walking distance of the Hollywood Bowl, and the Hlooywood Blvd Strip (Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Hollywood\/Highland complex including the Kodak Theatre, Jimmy Kimmel, etc...) After arriving I had a room with two queen beds, cheaper than a single king, and after asking if I was there alone, they instantly upgraded me to a king room on an upper floor. While they don't have a restaurant, they do offer a complimentary full breakfast each morning. For other meals there is every type of eatery either across the street or down the block. They also offer a refrigerator for anything you bring with you or bring back. There are all of the ammenities you would expect from this level. They offer free internet, printing, a pool, and exercise room. While some of these have a listed closing time they seemed to go much later. It is not a 'party' hotel, mainly tourists so even later in the night it does not get wild and noisy. Very friendly front desk guy who worked afternoons when I was there, we talked a bit and I even ran into him on the street a couple times as we both were coming or going. There is a small 'convienence' store for items you might want.
