{"text":"Top notch stay(s) at the Hyatt Waikiki My husband and I had a three night pre-cruise stay in late July at the Hyatt Waikiki booked on Gold Passport points in the Regency Club, mountain view. The room was large, newly redocorated and had a flat panel tv, as well as a view of Diamond Head and a balcony. The bed wasn't as comfortable as most Hyatts we have stayed at, but we were usually exhausted so it was fine. It was a little dark as it was on the shady side, but cool and comfortable. There was a coffee maker, but we never used it as we had Regency Club privileges. The main pool is very small, but there is a private rooftop sundeck with padded loungers, a hot tub, and free bottled water and towels for Regency Club guests. You can get free backpack beach chairs at the pool to take across the street to the famous Waikiki Beach. The location of the hotel is perfect--across the street from the best action on Waikiki with the beach boys and surfboard rentals. And a thirty second stroll to shopping, from the most expensive designer store to the ubiquitous ABC stores. There's also a good, cheap beach bar for inexpensive lunches and snacks on this beach, called Hyatt on the Beach. We came back to the Hyatt for one night and most of the next day post cruise as we had a red eye flight to Vegas. Although we could not obtain Regency Club reservations on initial booking for this part of the trip, upon check-in we were upgraded to the Ambassador Suite since they could not get us a room near my parents, who were traveling with us. The suite was nearly 1600 square feet, with two huge bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living and a dining room with every amenity, including Regency Club service. Now that's an upgrade! Cary, Mark, and Micheline of the Regency Club staff deserve special mention by name for their outstanding customer service--and I have seen them mentioned on several websites. They all go the extra mile every day for their guests. Cary and Mark's smiling interplay with guests and each other keep the cocktail hour guests entertained. Regency Club includes free continental breakfast in a private lounge and free evening cocktails and snacks. The food and drinks are always great, the service is stellar and it's fun to meet other guests in an intimate atmosphere. Oh, the service....they mailed my postcards for me, they brought me a fresh vegetable tray when they noticed I was looking for more...they gave me a to go cup to take my gin and tonic to the airport...and Micheline recommended tours, as well as checking us out in the Club and arranging for us to stay in the suite until 6 p.m. on checkout day (instead of 11 a.m.) Plus we could enjoy Regency Club hospitality until we left for the airport at 8 p.m. In short, having a regular room at the Hyatt may not be as special ---but if you can swing it, or are a Gold Passport member, I would highly recommend a stay here in the Regency Club. I'm dreaming of the day when I can go back. It's all about the service!
