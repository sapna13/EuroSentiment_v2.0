{"text":"Fantastic Hotel - We will be back Arrived back last night from our 3 night stay at the above hotel. My husband didn't want me to review the hotel as he didn't want everyone else knowing how good it is!!!It has just been taken over by the Peruch family and is run by Matteo with help from Armando, Tomaso, Bruno and Rosalba, and probably others but whose names I didn't get, apologies if I have missed anyone out.We arrived very late on Thursday but had wonderful greeting from Tomaso who helped us to our room, we booked a junior suite with a view of the Grand Canal, and I have to say it is one of the nicest rooms we have ever stayed in, and we travel a lot.My husband had a business meeting the next day but Matteo promised to look after myself and our 10 year old son Sam, he started off by cooking me an omelette for breakfast and Sam pancakes, but breakfast also consists of fruit, croissants, cheese, ham, salami, yoghurt, cereal. Nothing was too much trouble.After a day wondering round San Marco and the Rialto and whilst waiting for my husband to return, myself and my son sat on the Terrace watching the world go by, it was a wonderful experience.Matteo kindly arranged a reservation for us at a restaurant which was fantastic, food and wine perfect, in a perfect square.We had a brilliant l stay and there are many superlatives I could say about the hotel, but they would not explain what a good ttime we had. Matteo is a wonderful host, a great help with advise on gondola rides, restaurants and any others things we pestered him about, even to the knack of knowing when myself and Sam were lost in Venice, finding us and directing us back to the hotel!!I would recommend this hotel to anyone and would go back in a heartbeat. In fact we normally go to the US for a week in Feb, but I think we may be going somewhere else this year!Many thanks Matteo and to all your team for a wonderful stay, you really introduced us to Venice for which we are all very grateful.Lesley, Wes and Sam ","annotations":[{"endOffset":848,"mention":"pancakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pancake"],"startOffset":840},{"endOffset":848,"mention":"pancakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pancake"],"startOffset":840},{"endOffset":898,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":888}]}
