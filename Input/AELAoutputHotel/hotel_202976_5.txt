{"text":"Six Nights, Seven Days My wife and I spent six nights at the Rivoli the second week of June. The rooms were relatively clean, the beds firm but comfortable. Our room was on the courtyard above the pool, and noise could be heard when noisy people were in the pool or courtyard. Don't plan to spend any time swimming, as the pool is miniscule. Could also hear cars go past on the small street (almost an alley) behind the hotel but the windows did well keeping most noise out. The courtyard is a nice place to relax with a drink from the bar. Some noise could be heard from the room above us , but nothing unbearable. Water temperature in shower was uneven at times. A\/C works well and easy to control from room thermostat. When exiting the hotel, be sure to turn right, as going left is a bit seedy, especially at night. There is a taxi stand at the nearby station, and the couple of times we called a cab after spending all day walking was easy, the taxi arriving a few minutes after being called by the desk staff. The bottom line is that the hotel is a Best Western, not a Four Seasons, so keep expectations reasonable. I would stay at the hotel again, and have no qualms about recommending it.Train station around the corner made a side trip to Lucca very easy. Trains are clean and comfortable, but if going to Lucca, keep track of the stops as the Lucca station is easy to miss if not paying attention.Italian restaurant across the street from the hotel is a good, convenient place for dinner. No need to search for good gelato, as some of the best we had was down the street on the corner across from Piazza Santa Maria Novella. Visit Santa Maria Novella church to see some spectacular frescos. Advance tix to Uffizi and David a must, as the lines are ridiculous otherwise. Guided tour of Uffizi was a waste, David was better but both got us in without standing in line forever.
