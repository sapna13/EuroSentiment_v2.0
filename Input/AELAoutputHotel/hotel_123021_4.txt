{"text":"Good location if visiting University of Washington The Silver Cloud near the University of Washington is very functional and family friendly. It has the usual continental breakfast included with the cost of the room common to other Silver Cloud Inns which we find very good. You can basically make a simple breakfast like most of us eat at home: toast, bagels, coffee, juice, yogurt, waffles, that sort of thing. The shuttle service is common to all Silver Cloud Inns and this one will take you to points within three miles of the hotel. We took the shuttle up to the university bookstore (which was big and excellent by the way). Later the shuttle picked us up and brought us back to the hotel when we phoned for it. I noticed not too many people tipped the shuttle driver which I thought was kind of cheap as the shuttle service saved us a lot of hassle if we had taken a taxi, bus, or driven ourselves. Note: the shuttle service at this hotel won't take you to downtown Seattle as it's over the three-mile limit. There is a big shopping center right next door to the hotel with plenty of shopping  restaurants.This hotel is great if you are attending any functions at Husky Stadium. We walked to the stadium from the hotel in about 15 minutes through a very safe area. The rooms are clean and big enough. We were two adults and two teenagers and got by ok with two queen beds and a sofa bed roll-out.There are no spectacular views from the Silver Cloud Inn University like there are at the Silver Cloud Lake Union. However it is functional, safe, and easily accessable from Interstate 5. The staff are very friendly and helpful. It also has free laundry facilities which can be used till 9 P.M. The fitness area is not great and there are no mats in it at all so plan to do your stretching in your room rather than on the hard floor of this fitness area. There are some aerobic machines and free weights as well as a universal gym aparatus. We would stay there again if we were visiting the university or going to a Husky football game.
