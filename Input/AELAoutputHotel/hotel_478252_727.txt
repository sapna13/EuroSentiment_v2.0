{"text":"Would love to go back!! We stayed at the Bahia Principe from April 23-30 and had an absolute fabulous time!!!We were a little nervous after reading some of the reviews, but we honestly have no complaints. You just sit back, and enjoy yourself...put the regular busy life behind you and go at their pace.Of course, there are only a select few staff who speak good english, but they are so friendly and will get you what you need as soon as they can. We had no complaints about the food - we really enjoyed the Las Olas BBQ on the beach (7 different meats) as well as the breakfast (omlettes made to order!). Book your a la cartes right away and familiarize yourself with the resort on your first day. It does seem confusing at first, but it's not as complicated as it looks! We ate at La Gourmet, Las Olas (twice!!) and The Garden Grill. We had the Gold package, which was great...15 minutes internet everyday (which was important to us to keep contact with our kids at home) beach towels in your room, 4 restaurants instead of 3, etc.The beach is fantastic...you can walk for hours (which we did!!). We did not have to wake up too early to get good chairs (with shade). I think by 8 or so it starts filling in which isn't too bad. Shopping in Pueblo Principe was fun! The theatres, shows, etc. were entertaining as well. Remind the bartenders\/waitresses to just give you a little bit of alcohol in your drinks if you are not a fan of strong drinks...they are not stingy with that for sure!! We liked the many different cultures of the guests as well...listening to all the different languages was interesting!Anyway - this is becoming longer than I thought it would be...we loved it, would go back in a heartbeat. We met many people who were there for their second time, all of whom told us, we don't usually go to the same place twice, but we love it HERE. To us, that says a lot!!Hope you enjoy yourself as much as we did! ","annotations":[]}
