{"text":"we will always have Paris... We traveled to Paris at the end of October (me, husband, 2y8m son). I picked Ares Eiffel based on previous reviews (thanks all of you). Last year we stayed at a romantic 4* hotel, in Opera Garnier area, but there are no rooms for families. The Ares location is fabulous, on a quiet street, near the metro station, close vicinity to Eiffel Tower (10 min nice walk on the av. Suffren), 30 min to the Ch de Gaule Airport (45 min during weekdays), 5-6 metro stations to the Galleries Lafayette and Printemps (15 min), 3-4 Batobus stations (25 min) from Notre Dame, 1 h to Disneyland (1 metro + 1 RER).The metro station La Motte Picquet is 1-2 min away from the hotel. There are 2 exits: Village Suisse is closer, but if you want to buy Paris visite tickets you must got to the other one. There are 3 or 4 metro lines connecting to different areas. You cannot ask for more! On Saturday 25 th Oct. there was an antiques market on the street, under the metro bridge. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know about it! So pitoresque and surprising! Quite an experience!The Eiffel Tower is indeed very close to the hotel (better avoid visit the tower on weekends) and the top can be seen around the corner. In front of the tower, accros the street, you can fiind the Batobus station. We decided to take Batobus instead of Bateauxmouches or anything else because it really is like a bus and if my son would not enjoy the ride we could descend in one of the 8 stops. You can buy a ticket and travel all day long, getting on and off whenever you like. We booked a triple room, large by Paris standards, with a 1.80 m x 2 m comfortable bed, 4 pillows (2 soft and 2 firm) and an uncomfortable expandable armchair. Furniture is nice and looks new, the TV is an ok Bang  Ollufsen, the windows are large but you must keep it cover because of the wind blowing trough. The bathroom is practical (2 sinks, 1 shower, 1 bathtub, windows), incredible large, but incredible smelly and cold!!! Cleanliness was a little bit desapointing chapter: we stayed 5 days but they never change sheets. We moved a little the sofa bed and we saw a lot of dust, as they never use the vacuum cleaner in that corner. I expected to have more amenities and the used ones to be replaced. The elevator is not as tiny as in other Parisian hotels (it is enough room for two adults, one child, two big suitcases and a small one!), but is the only one and that is not enough. Stairs are narrow and round (winding). Breakfast is expensive, but poor, so you could choose one of the many bistros on the av. La Motte Picquet. Frontdesk is ok, helpful, childfrendly attitude. Check in was fast, check out too. The night staff should learn to answer to somebody√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ bon soir!They have few nice umbrellas you can borough if it is raining. If you want to have lunch or dinner in the hotel area, there are plenty o f restaurants and bistros on the av. La Motte Picquet and av. Suffren. For dinner you better make a reservation, especially on weekends. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":386,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":382}]}
