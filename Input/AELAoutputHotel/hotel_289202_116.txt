{"text":"Lovely room, even lovelier service I booked at the Antiche Figure on the basis of Tripadvisor reviews, and I'm so glad we did. The Location is great, as the others say, near to the train station and perfect for the water ferries all around. We also upgraded to one of their suites - a junior suite, which is not in the hotel itself but down the adjoining street, tucked away in a very very quiet spot - I slept like a log every night. The suite was a little small, but very bright, with a lovely comfortable four-poster and a massage shower, and for a three night stay, a perfectly adequate size (especially somewhere like Venice, and especially for the price). The best thing though was the service: after arriving very tetchy and frazzled after the airline losing our luggage, we received the warmest welcome I can remember having in any hotel, and given a cup of coffee while the receptionist took the lost luggage report and said We'll take care of that for you, and went off to ring them on my behalf. They kept an eye on the situation and phoned me as soon as the bag arrived (they did - not, say, the airline, who were supposed to) and sounded as happy as I did that it was there.The breakfast is simple but fine, the room (that we stayed in, at least) really quiet and lovely, the location excellent - far enough away to make a difference in terms of price, but easy to reach everything. I can't recommend this hotel highly enough. I've been back 9 hours and already told three friends they should book there...
