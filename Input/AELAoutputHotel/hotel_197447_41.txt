{"text":"great choice I have just returned from four nights at the Grand Hotel Francais. I booked the hotel because of the many good reviews from the tripavisor, and I am glad I did so. The staff were pleasant and very helpful, and the rooms were nicely decorated, warm and cleaned everyday. We also received fresh towels and soap daily.The location is superb, with close metro links. My partner and I used the Nation metro station because it had a number of lines running through, and you could get to a lot of places without having to change trains.The breakfast had a great continental choice, although i don't think I would have paid for it seperately if it hadn't been included in the price as the tarif showed it to be pricey.I would definately stay there again, and recommend it to all travellers to paris who are looking to travel on a budget. You can be assured that you are getting a good quality hotel.A little tip for fellow travellers, the price of beer is really expensive. With the price of a pint being up to 8 euros. However if you go into the little cafe bars in the metro station, you can get a beer much cheaper. Also one of the turn offs at the nation roundabout has a cinema, next door to the cinema on the right is a small bar that had a happy hour between 6-8. The price of a nice pint was 2 euros!! Not sure if that was only on saturdays though because it wasn't open on sunday.
