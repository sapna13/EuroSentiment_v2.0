{"text":"nice hotel Me and my wife stayed in this tulip hotel for 6 nights. In Amsterdam hotels often charge more than they are worth so i chose this hotel mostly based on tripadvisor reviews. I wanted to stay near Damrack so location was perfect. The hotel didnt disapoint me. I was relieved when we arrived and entered a nice lobby with a bar and a nice reception, everything ok. Also, we arrived at 1pm and the room was already ready for us.Clean room, nice bed, small tv with remote but tv wasnt really important, there is a phone with answering machine, window to the front street but we didnt hear noise at night or morning because its a quiet street, nice bathroom with window to the front street too, a nice shower but water pressure was a bit weak, they offered coffee and tea and we could make them in the room. there is an elevator, the corridors are also clean.For breakfast they had diferent types of bread, corn flakes, boiled eggs, youghurt, coffee, tea, cheese, etc.. but it could be a lot better. Dont expect a big breakfast. Staff was nice, all of them.i noticed that some of the rooms didnt have a window facing the front street, but they had a window facing an inside terrace instead, wich wasnt ok for me. if i had stayed in one of those rooms i would probably be complaining here, instead of saying that as long as you get a room similar to the one we got, you will be happy. Its not expensive by amsterdam standards, you pay but its safe, and the location is great, so it justifies the difference in price to similar hotels with not so good locations.I would stay there again.
