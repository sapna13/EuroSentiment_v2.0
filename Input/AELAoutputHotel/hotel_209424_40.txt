{"text":"Still Ups and Downs at the Ilikai Be prepared to be flexible at the Ilikai--keep expectations minimal and you will enjoy your stay. A few things to note - the elevators going down stop ridiculously at many unneeded floors- going up they are OK.The city view room I checked into had a broken air conditioning unit that was noisy and full of ice, dripping water down on the carpet near the bed....but the management quickly moved me to a room that was very clean, comfortable and with a quiet and efficient air conditioner. I am glad I just did not grin and bear it but piped up right away to complain.That first room would have totally ruined my stay.I did not receive housekeeping on any of the 4 days I was there.I had to call guest services for the house man to deliver toilet paper, towels, soap, coffee. He came right away but I felt I was being obligated to tip for these deliveries.This is a bit unusual if you ask me.There are several good restaurants nearby within 5 minutes for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The trolley services are free to go shopping and other tourist places.The concierge was not knowledgable or pretended not to be???... so be prepared to do your own investigating as to how to get places.I think this hotel should receive a 2 to 2.5 star rating. The room rates are affordable but the service is below my comfort zone. I am a fairly flexible person so it really didn't bother me. The room was clean but the service was aloof...more or less self-serve.Beautiful lobby, landmark 60's genre being updated - slowly.Construction still going on next door...from 7am to 5 pm.Balcony windows are good quality and keep 90% of the noise out.
