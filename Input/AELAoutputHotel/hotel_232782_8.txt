{"text":"Great Location! My husband and I stayed here for 5 days in September for our Honeymoon. It is a fantastic location. When we first arrived we were a little disappointed with our room as it was quite basic and I knew that there were superior rooms and staff knew it was our honeymoon as it was on our check in material. The window opened onto a brick wall. We went to reception and asked if we could pay for an upgrade and we were offered a much nicer, larger room at the front of the building (not internal) with a balcony and electric beds (no jacuzzi bath though - these are available in some rooms) which was great.Can't say the gent on reception was very happy about it though! So although we got no 'Honeymoon' frills the breakfast was great, better than I was expecting, a large buffet, and restaurant staff were very nice. Pool terrace on roof is fantastic. Near Tourist Bus pick up to, so an ideal base. TV in room (CNN in English), BBC World in bar, good air con, safe, mini bar fridge, very clean, cleaned every day. Cleaning staff very polite. Only down point was reception again I'm afraid, lady checking us out simply turned her back on us when done, no thankyou or goodbye, was so abupt that we were not sure she had finished with us. I think it is the luck of the draw with reception. Apart from that, good hotel, fantastic location, great city. Would go back. ","annotations":[]}
