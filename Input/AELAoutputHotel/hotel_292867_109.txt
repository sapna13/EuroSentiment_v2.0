{"text":"Definitely Not The Best Resort Out There! My 3 girl friends, and I stayed at Caribe Club Princess at the end of September and to say the least, we were quite disappointed. We are a well traveled group and have been to the DR on a handful of occassions and have stayed at many beautiful resorts. We're a very easy going group in our mid-20s and love to have fun on vacation but I would say this resort ranks the lowest in all the resorts we have ever stayed at. Check-In: We had to wait almost 2 hours to check-in to our rooms. It wasn't even like we arrived in the morning but early in the evening and were expecting our rooms to be ready. We made the most and had a couple of drinks. We finally got our rooms but waited another 45 minutes for our luggages to be delivered to our room. Not to mention, the room was very hot and felt like there was no air circulation in there. Definitely wasn't a good start to our vacation.Restaurants\/Food: When you don't have to cook your own meals, I guess that's always a good thing. Lots of variety but you pretty much had to make reservations first thing in the day for the a la carte restaurants or you'd be out of luck. We ended up eating in the buffet for the most part.Beach\/Pool\/Grounds: Nicer part of the Punta Cana beaches but defintely not enough palapas. The pools are nice but they can use some touch up and needed better cleaning from the debris that accumulates in them.Entertainment: It was your typical Animacion\/Entertainment team with various activities throughout the day and nightly shows. Overall, friendly staff as the Dominican people always are and many of the reasons we love this country. And we love all the cute Dominican boys but we did encounter a couple of them that were to aggressive and way too flirtatious that it actually became annoying - and never had anyone asked us for money so bluntly. Other than that, all the other staff were always friendly and smiling.Overall, the resort attracts more Europeans and found ourselves, Canadians, being minorities amongst the tourists. Not a bad resort but I would never go back. We got a good deal for our vacation package but I would have paid more to stay at another resort if I had known better. I guess you get what you paid for!
