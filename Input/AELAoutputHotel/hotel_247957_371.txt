{"text":"Stayed here twice, never again I wrote a review about our previous stay at this hotel and said how I can't understand why people gave this hotel such bad reviews. Well, now I completely understand. Our first stay at the Occidental last year was great. But the second time around, horrible. We'll start with check-in, it took forever! People kept cutting in line in front of us (not the hotel's fault) but still, we waited in line for a long time. As for our room, it was clean except for all of the little bugs crawling around in the bathroom. We got a notice that they were going to fumigate, but I don't think that ever happened. We tipped the maid everyday, but there were 3 days that we had to call guest services to get bath towels because she didn't leave any. I don't think having bath towels is too much to expect out of a hotel! There was not one day that we had wash cloths. And never any fresh flowers like last year. And the maid didn't even have to make the bed because we brought our own sheets. I think all she did was sit in our room and watch tv because the tv was always on when we came into our room. The food also seemed to go downhill since last year. We only ate in the buffet, and it wasn't impressive. The service was terrible, we'd have to flag down a waiter to even get water. The resort also seemed terribly crowded. And lots of kids......annoying!!!! We walked to the Palladium and to the Bavaro Princess, they both seemed like beautiful resorts and definitely way less crowded. The only good aspect of our trip this year was the beach, always beautiful, and the new roulette wheel in the Occidental's casino. My boyfriend probably won $600 over our week long stay. We had 2 completely different experiences each time we stayed here, and we love Punta Cana's beach so we will probably return, but definitely not to this rat hole of a hotel. ","annotations":[]}
