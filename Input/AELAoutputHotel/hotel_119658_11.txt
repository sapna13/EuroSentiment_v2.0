{"text":"Ideal and very very friendly. Just about everything you read on tripadvisor about the Castle Inn is true. It is15mins walk down to F\/Wharf or 15mins up to Union Square \/ Chinatown area. Simple but sufficient complimentary breakfast (coffee, good orange juice, yoghurt, fruit, pastry, cereal bars) left us satisfied (including 2 teenagers!). Stayed in the 2 bedroom-suite. A little noise from the street, and some noise from the ice machine just outside the room, but with ear plugs in (always travel with them!), had a good night's sleep. San Francisco is an expensive city, and the Castle Inn offers excellent value. Special mention to Varsa, the effusively helpful manageress, who provided all sorts of details about tours and transport. We could not have enjoyed SF as much without her help. There is an excellent Thai restaurant - simple, fast service and great value - just 3 doors away for a convenient meal. In advance of us arriving, we had asked Varsa to book us onto a city tour with Tower Tours including the Alcatraz tour, and I would fully recommend this, because you will get to see the slightly more out-of-town sights like twin peaks, Golden Gate Park, leaving you to explore the inner city stuff on foot later. Don't miss out Alcatraz - it is incredible. Our family really enjoyed US Pampanito too. Different!If I was a millionaire I'd stay in a luxury hotel. But as a family, out sightseeing from early after breakfast until after our evening meal, the Castle Inn is absolutely ideal.
