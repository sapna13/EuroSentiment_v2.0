{"text":"Great Resort - Love the Dominican People!! Returned from the Sirenis February 29 where we had stayed for a week. What a wonderful time we had. We loved it so much, we are returning in April for another week. The grounds are beautiful, the pool is fabulous and the beach is incredible. The people are amazing, so loving and warm. We just love the Dominican people. They are such hard working people who are very caring and do whatever they possibly can to make your stay enjoyable. The rooms are fine, nothing fancy but fine. Our refrigerator was very well stocked daily with water and pop. We loved the beds. I know people complained about them being too hard but for my husband and myself they were fabulous - the best seep we have ever had in any hotel. We love a good, hard mattress. not the soft pillow top that some hotels use. The pillows are another story but we made do with what we had - our girl did bring us more pillows but they were pretty much the same as what we had. The food was good - there was always something at the buffet - no need to complain about the food. The staff fabulous - we particularly loved William who was always filling our glasses with water or wine or coffee in the morning or evening. He was great, always a big smile on his face and everything was perfectAlthough everything was fabulous, when I saw the room, I must admit that I was disappointed and did say that I would probably not return - well I ate my words - I ended up loving it there so much that the room really did not bother me after awhile and here I am looking forward to returning there in April (It sure would be nice though if they did update the roooms somewhat - it would be absolutely perfect!!! I really do like a nice room and that is important to me even though all you do there is sleep and shower but that is just me!!!!!) Here is a link to pictures from our trip at the Sirenis Tropical. Included in the pics are the rooms, restaurants, lobby, etc...http:\/\/travel.webshots.com\/album\/562580684QsaZcJ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1196,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1190},{"endOffset":1729,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1725}]}
