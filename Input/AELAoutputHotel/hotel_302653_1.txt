{"text":"Safety Warning My wife and I had a wonderful holiday here and left on the 26th of November.The staff are very friendly and helpful, as are the local people, it truly is the land of smiles.We thought the food in the hotel was good, with the exception of the asian restauant which was a bit limited.The bar prices are of course high, but that you would expect.We ate and drank mostly at the Bali Collection which is an easly walk from the hotel, although the taxis are amazingly cheap, or the shuttle bus which runs hourly, or if you smile at the driver he will run you back, especially if you give him a tip.We hired a taxi for the day with drver, Ari, lovley guy very helpful and friendly with good English and local knowledge.We can thoroughly recommend this hotel even at the start fo the wet season we could still lay out in the sun but we only saw the mountains once when the low clouds cleared.But the main reason for this post is a serious warning to potential guests, on the evening of our departure I recieved a severe electrical shock when my hand touched the earth terminal of the socket outlet in the bathroom after I got out the shower, this threw me back and caused all the power to trip out in the room plunging us into total darkness.I reported this to the management who sent a maintneance guy along to test it out and reset the breakers.It was obvious straight away that he did'nt know what he was doing, and when I looked into the distribution board I was horrified at what I saw, 3 circuits into 1 breaker and they had used earth cable (green\/yellow) on one.I am currently in discussion with the hotels head office in Spain, who assure me the problem has been rectified, I am not so sure so I urge all guest to exercise extreme caution when in the bathrooms standing on tiled floors or wet bath mats not to touch any electrical outlets or to use any elecrical appliances in there, it became self evident that the wiring in this hotel does not confom the the current wiring regulations, had i been wearing a pacemaker or if I had a weak heart then my wife might be writing this report.I am awaiting a response from them as we speak.
