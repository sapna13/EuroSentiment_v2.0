{"text":"great getaway If you're planning a trip to this resort the first thing to keep in mind is that this is not a five star facility. Five star resorts don't have marble tiled bathrooms with cheap plastic tubs sunk in. Five star resorts don't introduce you to the maid at check in only to change them daily without notice. etc, etc. Five star resorts are also never this affordable. That being said, this is one of the best 3-31\/2 star resorts I've ever stayed at and the price was fantastic. My wife and I and our 4 year old daughter stayed here 4\/5-4\/12 and had a wonderful vacation. Most of the negatives we experienced had to do with other guests. The place was full of French Canadians and Russians, many of whom seemed to have a total disregard for simple manners. I can't tell you how many times my daughter was almost trampled by people pushing and cutting into the buffet, tram, lobby, etc. Oh well, I guess this winter made these people miserable.The resort itself is beatiful and clean. The staff for the most part was friendly and helpful. Some advice:Like others have said, make restaurant reservations early.The club golden upgrade is well worth the extra couple of hundred bucks to be near the pools and beach.Learn a little Spanish. Bring as many supplies like sunscreen with you as the shops are a complete ripoff.The buffets have great food if you look for it. Be adventurous and try something new.Remember that life in the Caribbean moves at a leisurely pace. Don't get upset if your coffee doesn't arrive immediately when you sit down. Take a deep breath, remind yourself that you are on vacation, and enjoy the fabulous sunshine, soft breezes, immaculate pools and beaches, hilarious bartenders and the smug satisfaction that your friends are back home hating life.
