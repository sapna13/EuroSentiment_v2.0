{"text":"Not so excellent Just got back today...My girlfriend and I wanted to see the carribean in January and were told that the Dominican Republic was beautiful at the time we could go, so we heard great things about Excellence Punta Cana and decided to book six days there.We arrived Monday Jan. 8 and were welcomed with glasses of champagne and an amazingly landscaped resort. Our Room wasn't ready yet, so we had lunch at The Grill while we waited, and so began the service problems. Food takes incredibly long at the grill and if you are at the pool all day, or the beach, make sure you bring a shirt and girls, a shirt and skit, or shorts, otherwise they will not let you in.  The rooms was beautiful and had a very nice garden view. Air conditioning worked well and the bed was nice and big. The bath water is real hot too. The pools are beautiful and the beach is as well. The ocean is extremely rough and the rip tide is fierce. My girlfriend and I almost drowned, literally, while boogie boarding. The current is strong, one minute you are in waist deep, the next second, you cant touch. be careful! There are no lifeguards, so if you get carried out, you are S O L! The food, hmm, let me tell you about the food. I am a chef in a very fine restaurant, (no names mentioned), and I was really disappointed .Room service has the the best food and the most punctual service. First meal was at Barcelona a mediterranean restaurant and the food was great; once it got to the table. It took forever to get our food.Next meal was at Toscana(Italian) and that was decent. The cheese is god awful though, anything containing cheese, except the pizza, is terrible. Next meal was at Agave(mexican) which was completly awful. Avoid at all costs, not only does it suck, but the next morning, we felt awful. The best dinner was at Chez Izzabelle(French brasserie) The only steak I had that was actually cooked how I asked. Chateubriand is a reccomended choice here. Don't eat the chicken anywhere in the resort, it's terribly dry and doesnt taste right. The last two nights, we had room service cuz we just couldn't stand it. Breakfast buffet is ok, but the eggs are lethal and made me very ill. The service overall is sub par. The bartenders take extremely long just to make one drink and if you watch them, they'll douse your drinks with alcohol rendering them undrinkable, if not watched, there is no alcohol in your drink at all, just fruit juices. Sometimes you may be completely ignored waiting gor a drink until you give up and leave. Everyone here is tip hungry. They dont want to do anything unless you tip them. Even though you have already paid for all gratutities in you inclusive package. I tipped when I felt it right, but they think you are just going to run the halls tossing out bills and expect you to. The first day we left our maid money and came back to a turned down bed and towel sculptures. The next day we didnt leave a tip and we came back to a room with no towels, no towel sculptures, bed just tucked up and made and nothing special. The rest of the trip was like that, cuz we refused to tip just to get the service we paid for. Every tour you go on, they stick their hands out for tips, always wanting more. It really pissed me off. Tours... We did the atv tour right on the resort and it was a lot of fun. Dont take the dune buggy, it broke down on us and they had to call for another quad for us. It was fun and you got to see the countryside and towns, cave, schools, local streams, a very pleasant trip. SAONA ISLAND!!!!!! An amazing tour out to the carribean side to a small island. White sand beaches, water as clear as anything, and beautiful calm. The weather was beautiful and the island is hotter than the resort area. On the way back you stop at a sand bar to see starfish.The Carribean Festival is a sham! Dont do it, waste of a day and your money. It supposed to be a snorkeling tour, you snorkel for 40 minutes and then screw around on a stupid boat.Overall, We had an ok time, some good, some bad. We would not go back. Things were way better in Mexico at the Spa Palace. I was not happy in the DR and will not be returning.
