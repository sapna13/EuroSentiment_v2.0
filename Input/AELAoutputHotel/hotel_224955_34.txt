{"text":"Hotel Metropolis San Francisco Stayed this past weekend (22nd-25th march) at Metropolis Hotel. Did not have problems locating the hotel, since the Bart stops very close at Powell. Like other reviewers stated, there was a lot of panhandlers around that area. However they did not bother us. We entered the hotel and I was very pleased with the enviroment inside. It was very nicely decorated. We were given our room. Ok size, two double beds, not the most comfortable, but not that terrible. There was a closet, big enough for our bags (it was 4 of us) and our stuff. The room was clean, free wireless, a little fridge, a desk and a nice flat screen TV on the wall. The bathroom is another story. While it was clean and the tub was a nice size, the sink was rather small, and the glass shelf above was small, so we had to keep putting our stuff away. The little bag with ammenities was nice. Housekeeping did a very good job cleaning the room. Also on Fridays and Saturdays, they have a wine reception at the library. That was nice. We did not care for the restaurant on the premises, although we had some cocktails the night we arrived. The place was nice, but we were not sure about the menu. Now, I have to say this. There was a lot of noise coming from the street. Our first morning we were awoken to what we thought it was a trash compactor, but it kept going for a while. Well, it was cement mixing truck. Besides that, car alarms going off.  Overall, we had a good stay. We spend a lot of time on the city exploring and the hotel was just used to rest, shower and sleep. We think it was good, for the rate we paid, $75 a night. Not bad for San Francisco. With the money we saved, we did a lot of other things and we ate very well.  I almost forgot, the hotel personnel was very nice and helpful, specially Elli at the front desk. She gave us a lot of options for restaurants in the area. We most likely will go back to this hotel.
