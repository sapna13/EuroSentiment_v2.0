{"text":"Dissapointed This is one of the Grand Dames of old Miami Beach - but unlike her neighbors, she has not had a big time facelift. She needs one. While the lobby is pretty, and they have recently painted and carpeted - there is a need for a massive renovation here (like that going on at most of the other old gals). This hotel (the old Doral in the 60's) needs a major redo.We we told on check-in that there were no more King beds available, but that they could offer us a room with two queens facing the bay. That was ok to us - and the clerk assured us that these were queen beds. Well, we got to the room and the beds were doubles, circa 1990, with springs that you could feel and hear twanging. At the end of night one, we felt like we were in a I Love Lucy episode where Lucy and Ricky ended up sunk in the center of the bed and unable to get out. We asked to move to another room, but they were sold out.The windows that overlook the bay (and the highway) need to be soundproofed. Rooms closer to the ocean side of the hotel are quieter. Also, the side view rooms are really not bad. We finally changed rooms on our last night there and it was better.The rooms are somewhat shabby, but not for lack of trying to make it look better. The carpet was new and the paint was fresh, but it was sort of like looking at someone who is not aging gracefully - like a 80 year old woman with huge false eyelashes and pancake makeup. The bathroom sinks must have been made for the vertically challenged.It was also irritating that the internet connections were not included - and cost $9.95 a day. Now, I am prepared to pay for internet if I have to - but what really got my goat was that we signed in on check-in at 2 pm, but the internet charge renews each day at 3pm - but that is only if you do a cabled approach. So, we paid a full days charge for 1 hours worth of connectivity. The rules for internet are WAY confusing too. Wireless lasts from when you sign up until midnight of that day, no matter what time. Wired is from 3 to 3 each day. Then to add insult to injury - I took my laptop downstairs to the lobby area - and your room connection does not work there - you have to buy ANOTHER connection for another $9.95. So, I did not do that, but the next day I went to my meeting that was being held in the hotel and there was yet a THIRD connection required if you wanted to connect to the internet from any of the meeting rooms.This is insane. It also does not make good business sense to require that you buy three connections to be able to use the internet in various parts of the hotel. The meeting food was dismal, and they could not seem to keep the fruit flies off of the food. We had a fruit tray for 50 that was just covered with fruit flies - and an evening fancy dinner where I was served some sort of meat masquarading as shoe leather.If you do not return your pool towel and make sure you get a card to that effect, they add $25.00 to your hotel bill. Make sure you get your pool towel cards (for EVERY towel you check out) back to avoid getting charged. This was a challenge for people who came with kids.Check out is 11 am and they do not allow late checkout - although after serious arguing with them, they did allow us, but we had to escalate it up to the manager. The long and short of it is that this hotel needs a major reconstruction, especially considering how much it costs to stay there. I felt that I had to be on my guard at all times for sneaky ways that they tried to seperate us from our money. That is not a way to relax. I would not return here - I would look eleswhere for a better choice.
