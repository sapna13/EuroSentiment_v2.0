{"text":"I LOVE THE OMNI We stayed at the Omni over Labor Day weekend for 3 nights...I had stayed at this hotel before the year before in December, and fell in love with it... From the fresh fruit and refreshing lemonade in the lobby to the nightly chocolate on my pillow. Its all about the details for me and customer service.The Omni delivers. I love the fresh flowers in the lobby,the warm greeting from all staff members, the housekeeper's friendly notes, the rooms...I can go on and on...But I really love where The Omni SF is located. The financial district is bustling during the week, but on the weekends its quiet. The hotel is walking distance from the Ferry Building,Chinatown, and Nob Hill. You could even walk to Union Square. When we went in September, we spent a day in Napa Valley.The concierge helped us book a rental car for delivery at the hotel the next morning.However, when we went to the lobby the car wasnt there.Because it was Labor Day weekend, the rental car company was slammed.We understood and went to go pick up the car.To make a long story short, we ended up waiting 2hours in line, and it ruined the whole day for us.Although it wasnt The Omni's fault, when we returned that night, I informed the concierge and he took care of the valet.Upon returning home, I received the Omni Hotel survey,and let them know about the mishap.I promptly received a response from the hotel's general manager Carmen Serra and she apologized for the inconvenience the rental car company caused us,and refunded the rental car fee back to our credit cars.She also helped me book another stay at the Omni in San Diego for next weekend.I was very satisfied with how she handled the situation...just another reason why I love the Omni! No one is perfect, everyone makes mistakes, but I appreciated their efforts to resolve the issue.
