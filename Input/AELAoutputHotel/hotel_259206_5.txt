{"text":"OK but overpriced?? I stayed here for 1 night recently and the hotel was chosen to suit location and availability on the night. Other hotels in the area were booked out and this was the only place left in the area with rooms. So I paid what I consider to be a high price for what I got. the room was the usual - cheap built in furniture, queen bed, decent linen, postage stamp size towels, standard mass produced toiletries, standard TV with a couple of extra pay channels, mini bar, iron and board, small table etc. As per usual the pillows were flat and uncomfortable.so I had a room at the back of the hotel which overlooked lavendar bay - very lovely view, saw the sun set. The mini bar prices were the usual outrageous prices. the room was spotlessly clean and the bathroom was all in good order - recently refurbished.I have stayed here once before and got a room at the front of the hotel. this was a bit of a disaster as the hotel overlooks milsons point rail station (FANTASTIC for city access) but trains start at 5am and toot their horns when they pull out. there are trains at every 10 mins whilst I was trying to sleep. I went down to the buffet breakfast which was OK - usual stuff - kelloggs cereals, toast, juices, danish, cheese, salami, tinned and fresh fruit. hot food included eggs, bacon, link sausages, beans. tea was really bad!also the carpark was full and I had to park out on the streetaverage business hotel, reasonably comfortable but beware of paying too much ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1221,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1216},{"endOffset":1335,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1332},{"endOffset":1335,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1332},{"endOffset":1335,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1332},{"endOffset":1335,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1332}]}
