{"text":"How Fast Can You Run? This is not a five star hotel, trust me, two stars would be a stretch. Almost everything needs improvement from the facilities (looks like a rinky dink operation), room, food (nothing was exceptional, just ok), management (they make no effort to be friendly or accommodating), activities, in other words, don't waste your time. The first room (faded yellow bedspreads with hard, squeaky mattresses, missing phone off the wall, dirty with ants) we were assigned, looked like it had been rented by the hour, unbelievable. We tried to move to another hotel but this place is so isolated once you get there going anywhere else is a real hassel. They moved us to another room and it was better but still dirty, needed a make-over (dirty seat cushions, dirty floor, grease stains on the walls where people had rested their heads) and crawling with ants. We will not waste your time with more examples, there are much nicer properties with better staff in Punta Cana, if you must go, but honestly, we have no plans to visit the Domenican Republic again anytime time soon and will probably go back to Mexico before ever returning to this country. Absolute poverty, horrible roads (pot holes everywhere or non-existent roads), mosquitoes are relentless, tourist industry is not well developed, not much to see, and the people are borderline rude, their only interest is getting money from you--if you go shopping you will be almost be assaulted. We travel extensively and this has to be one of the worst experiences we have ever had. Go at your own risk, we are sorry we ignored some of the previous bad reviews, they are quite accurate.
