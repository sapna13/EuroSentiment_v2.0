{"text":"Nice and modern, but not the best I stayed here because it was close to a friend's place in Aberdeen and the price was right. I had some concerns about its location on the other side of the island, but the hotel shuttle is only HKD 29 and can take you to central in about 15 minutes. Taxis are not that expensive and there is a bus terminal conveniently located nearby as well.The rooms are nice and modern. What bothered me the most, however, is that I got the feeling this place is really trying to nickel and dime their guests to death (and that they are not doing so well financially). The room desks have this tacky stand of things to buy, such as flip flops, t-shirts, etc. The Web site says the rooms have Hermes soap, but actually they give you a small sliver of house soap, but you can purchase a bigger bar of Hermes soap. The Internet is not free, which is silly considering that Cyberport is supposed to be Hong Kong's high-tech hub. As another poster mentioned, there are no robes and the pool does get crowded and noisy. Adults who want some peace and quiet will be disappointed at the pool (noisy kids everywhere), as well as everyone in the coffee shop being able to stare at them.The price, however, was over USD 100 less for other hotels on Hong Kong, and there is a post office, supermarket and a hard-to-find Starbucks located nearby. Forget the dead mall next door.I only ate the breakfast buffet, and thought it was very well done.
