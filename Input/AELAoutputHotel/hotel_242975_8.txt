{"text":"Not a 5-star hotel, but not a bad hotel either I had never been to Spain before, and stayed at this hotel for a work conference. The taxi driver on the way over told me it was one of the nicest hotels. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not so sure about that. The criteria for √à√\u2020\u2022? star√à√\u2020\u2022?in Europe must surely be very different from the US. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ guessing the Sofia gets extra stars because of its size and ability to cater and hold large meetings? Other than that, I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see what would make it 5-star. While there was nothing wrong with the hotel, in my opinion it did not belong in the same family as your typical US 5-star establishments such as the Ritz or Four Seasons.Hotel: while not 5-star in my opinion there was nothing wrong with my room. Comfortable bed, spacious bathroom (with separate vanity area from toilet, which is always nice if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not staying alone) marble counters and plentiful toiletries. Rooms looked a little old, but all in all just fine, and cleaned thoroughly every day. Small, but no smaller than most european rooms. Concierge service was hit or miss depending who you got at the desk. Cost of food in the hotel is outrageous! Area: If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a central location in Barcelona, this isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ it. There is a tram outside the hotel, but I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ take it so not sure where it goes! There are a few little cafes next door to the hotel, and a giant dept. store a block down. Definitely venture out and buy your water\/snacks outside the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?the walk is worth the cost difference. There is a monastery up the street from the hotel that is very interesting and pretty √à√\u2020\u2022?definitely check it out if you have the time. Other than that, it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem like there was a whole lot to do around the hotel.All in all, the hotel was fine, but if I was travelling for pleasure I would not pick it. I stayed closer to the city center later in the trip after work, and would recommend finding a hotel closer to central Barcelona.
