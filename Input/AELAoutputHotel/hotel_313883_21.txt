{"text":"Great Beach, Nice Hotel, But Overall KInda Bland I stayed at Tropical Princess from April 10 - 17. Overall it's very nice. Hugh lobby. Large grounds (sometimes too large for my likeing) Fantastic Beach. Very nice pools and as far as buffets go - pretty good.You could walk for literally MILES on that beach...... So if a great beach is one of your priorities ---- Punta Cana is a good choice. My room is decent... just a normal average room.... small mini fridge. They supplied bottled water, coke , sprite daily. Had to pay $5 a day for in room safe. The cost was ridiculous, most hotels offer this for free... but u gotta keep your valuables safe,, so u pay. Pillows are okay, some need replacing, The bed was extremely HARD!!!! My back was in muscle spasism, the muscles in my butt and thigh were sore from sleeping on that rock called a bed. I was not happy with the bed.Pools were very nice.. Three to choose from. max of 4' deep and oone end was wade in.... very good for those who take small children.Buffet.. large variety. but it was the same variety every day.... Unfortunately I do not know if it was the water or something I ate but I was extremely sick the last nite there.... Make sure you take Imodium and Gravol with you.. It saved my life!!The grounds are huge. It's a long walk from the lobby to the rooms\/pool\/beach area. Beautiful grounds but my preference next time would be a smaller resort with everything conveniently located closer together. They use golf carts to courier you back and forth you u dont want to enjoy the walk in the heat (and it was very hot!)Overall - not one of my better vacations.. I have travelled south more than a dozen times.... This was the very first time I was ever sick. My preference is Cuba or Mexico over Dominican Republic. This was third time to Dominican, and probably my last for a long time.
