{"text":"Great location, lovely staff, loved the pool bar We stayed in the hotel's two storey room block at the front of the hotel. Our room was big, spacious, had plenty of light and was kept really clean. Toilets are a bit smelly but nothing too offensive, after a few days in Bali you won't notice any difference. As the rooms overlook where the cars came in and out it could sometimes be a little bit noisey but your shutters in your room helped to block out quite a lot.The hotel is pretty old but still well looked after, all the staff especially Budi  Tjok at the pool bar were such good fun and always so polite  friendly, nothing was too much of a problem.Location is great as the resort is on the beach, there's some great sun beds to sit on and watch the sunset with being hassled.The traditional dinner dance food  entertainment at the resort was very good, well worth doing if you'ver never been to Bali before for that cultural experience.Plenty of shops nearby, can recommend Carla's (on the main street)  Casey's (her sister Susie sits outside of the resort and will do a great price on laundry and their place is down a small laneway to the right of the resort) for beauty treatments and the guys at the MBA tourist booking stand very friendly too. Great place for getting handbags and leather jackets - Dolphin Leather on Garlic Lane.Favourite restaurants Norm's, Ketumbar  Neros - good food and really great cocktails!Waterbom Park still a great day out. Went to Casa Luna cooking school in Ubud, a must do experience if you are a foodie. Go on the days when they do the ,market visit, its very interesting. You will learn a lot about Balinese food and want to come home and try to cook it yourself.Bali is always so good to visit and re-charge the batteries. The people are so warm and friendly and they are oftent here year after year. They are so hard working that you want to reward them for all their efforts. ","annotations":[]}
