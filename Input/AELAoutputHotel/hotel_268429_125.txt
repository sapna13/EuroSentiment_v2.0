{"text":"Perfect combo - Hip hotel without the attitude This is a BEAUTIFUL hotel without any of the too cool attitude you might expect from a property with original artwork all over. The staff is friendly but not overbearing, the rooms are very clean, bright, and provide enough space for two people and their luggage spread all over. The courtyard garden is truly exquisite - really a pleasure to walk through and sit in. Coral Princess Inn is a great hotel that is very affordable. There are a few parking spots in front, which is nice because the street parking is limited.Breakfast is everything you need it to be: coffee, juice, pastries, croissants, ham, cheese, bread, cereal, fruit. There is a toaster as well as microwave. The hotel also provide a unique 3rd floor suite that everyone can use. We enjoyed the jacuzzi as well as the pool table. The hotel also has a cute pool. All this in a EXTREMELY well-priced, boutique style hotel.It is literally 1 block to Condado beach which has really soft sand and big waves. Great for body surfing or boogey boarding, You are also around the corner from Ashford Avenue, which is the main drag in Condado. I would recommend taking a taxi (about $13) to Old San Juan for the day and walking around. It is really enjoyable to see the old architecture and forts, and there are fantastic shops there. I really recommend this hotel because it is between Old San Juan and the airport, yet has excellent beaches and won't break the bank while still providing continental breakfast. I will be staying here again, definitely, and so should you!
