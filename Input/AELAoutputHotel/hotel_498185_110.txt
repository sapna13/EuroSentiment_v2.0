{"text":"Loved it, recommend it to all! This is a terrific hotel, well deserving of trip advisor #1 rating. We stayed here for 5 days in the middle of a 7 week tour of europe. My wife and I travel to europe each year, and this was at the top of our list of places to return. The rooms are spacious, quiet, floor length doors to small private balcony overlooking the street, well insulated from outside noise. Bathrooms are awesome, well stocked, exceptionally clean, with great showers and lots of hot water!The hotel is well appointed, beautifully decorated, new, stylish, and in a perfect location whether staying the night or a week. (No, we do not own stock in the place!) Beautiful common rooms, great spa, a wonderful place to come back to after a day of work, god forbid, or pleasure. Very close to the metro, really easy access from the airport.Service? After a discussion about Spanish wines with one of the very helpful people at the front desk, i was astounded the next day to find a bottle of wine in our room, a personal gift from a very wonderful and helpful woman (again thank you!) Maps provided, suggestions made and outlined on the maps, ideas, things not to miss, a very helpful and attentive staff.Spain, for those that do not know, is a smoking country, and Madrid is a smoking capitol. It is very difficult to find restaurants without smoking, and again, the staff were very helpful in this regard. The restaurant in the hotel is excellent, and in line with Madrid prices.It is difficult for me to understand some of the previous complaints about this hotel. I think that sometimes people might just stay home and quit giving the rest of us English speaking people such bad names. ","annotations":[]}
