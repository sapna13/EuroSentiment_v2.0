{"text":"We had a great time! We just returned from Dreams Punta Cana. I traveled with my husband, 11 year old, 9 year old, 7 year old and 3 year old. We were there for 5 days - just enough time. I use Trip Advisor a lot but have never written a review. I am a particular traveler and have been to many, many places. I had read a number of negative reviews about Dreams but chose it because I thought it would be kid friendly. It was! The resort is clean and well maintained. Our rooms were very nice. The food was good - great for the rest of my family- (I am a really healthy eater and for me, it was fine). The older kids had a lot of freedom and I felt they were very safe and they had plenty to do. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I overheard a group of ladies in the airport complaining about their resorts (too big, terrible food, overpriced, lots of drunken revelers, etc.) but I felt that Dreams was very nice and had none of these issues! It is not luxurious or fancy but that seems common in the Dominican Republic. The ride from the airport is long. And most importantantly, do not pre-book your transport with a shuttle service (we used Turinter) that will drop off other passengers at other resorts first or it will be ENDLESS! However, once you arrive, the staff passing you cool towels and chilled champagne will make you forget the ride. ","annotations":[]}
