{"text":"First rate massive resort We researched a trip for our family, my wife's brother's family and my mother in law. A travel agent put us on to the Melia Caribe Tropical and he was absolutely right. We travel quite a bit but don't do a lot of all inclusive resorts. The Melia was far and away nicer than any of the other ones we've stayed at. The price was very good for a 4 star and we read the reviews extensively on Travelocity and TripAdvisor. The reviews are correct that the place is massive. Two large mirror image reosrts combined in to one. Massive but easy to get around if you don't mind walking and if not the trolley is easy and pretty regular. My sister in law had read that the reservation only restaurants are a must try. We went to a couple of them but then decided that we prefered the excellent buffets instead. Easier faster, much more selection and different every night. I live in NYC so going out to restaurants and making reservations isn't that special. the food is essentially coming out of the same kitchens anyway. The bars are great with top shelf liquor. House wine was fine says my wife. Overall the place is very taseful and beautifully laid out and maintained. Our room was large and clean and we enjoyed it greatly. My mother in law's room was nice but did smell very musty. That aside I'd have to say I have no complaints and would heartily recommend the place to anyone looking for this kind of trip. I booked online and for 8 days \/ 7 nights the hotel worked out to be about the same cost as the plane. For me, my wife and 9 year old it was about $3.5k total. Great deal. Enjoy!!!
