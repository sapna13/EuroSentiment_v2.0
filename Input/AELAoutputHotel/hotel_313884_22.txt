{"text":"First Time to the Caribbean We have recently returned home from our first trip to the Caribbean, and our first experience with an all inclusive. We stayed at the Punta Cana Princess Oct 23- Nov 6 and loved the fact that it was small, very clean, very friendly, beautiful beach, staff absolutely wonderful and friendly. We appreciated that it was quiet later in the night, knowing that if we wanted more excitement we just had to go next door to the sister hotels. The Food: We are not picky eaters, and found the food to be good. The a la carte restaurants were delicious, no complaints. The buffets had various theme nights and if you weren't particular on that theme nights food, there was still always plenty to eat with the standard pasta, salad, ect food bars.The room: We were very fortunate to have room 5114, the view was beautiful from our balcony, and we enjoyed it everyday! We could view the beach to the left and the pool to the right. The room itself is spacious and was always attended to thanks to the lovely maids we had. They always cleaned our room, turned down our bed at night and kept our fridge full of water and coke lite, which is exactly what we liked. The beach: Like I said absolutely beautiful and clean. The workers did a wonderful job at keeping it clean, the beach beds were a nice touch. My husband and I enjoyed the long walks along the beach both day and night. When you went left up the beach there were shop sellers and they were pretty good at not hustling you, which was a wonderful change from what we found out when going to the Bravaro Shopping Plaza. We lasted 20 minutes there and caught a cab quickly back, due to the constant barrage of hustling, not something we were at all used to! If you walked right of the PCP there was plenty of beach to walk as well, but beware of the woman selling hair braiding not a pleasant experience either as I so found out, while having my hair braided.Tours: We took 2 tours while there - The Bravaro Runners Safari Tour. What a wonderful day this was. We lucked out with a wonderful bunch of tourists on our safari truck. If you want to see how these wonderful people actually live, what the schools look like, and enjoy a little bit of everything, like seeing a sugar cane field, a cigar factory, where they grow and make coffee and cocoa, go horseback riding then this is the tour for you. The tour guides were very nice and very infomative. Thanks Andy and Adam! Our second tour was Zip lining. We enjoyed this tour as well. My husband had never been zip lining and I think this was a great beginner zip line tour. Having done the one in Mexico in Puerto Vallarta, it didn't quite measure up for me, but still a good tour none the less. The staff: All that we met and conversed with (even though our spanish was very limited) were above and beyond! Very helpful, friendly and enjoyable. We made a few new friends and wish them all the best. We will miss you all! Thanks to Luis, Nelson, Jose Doria, Grisdelda, our lovely maids - sorry didn't catch your names and the many other waiter and waitresses!In closing we would definately go back to this resort, and will definitely recommend it to all our friends and family! We will cherish our experience there and take home with us many happy wonderful memories!
