{"text":"A bit dissapointing We just got back from a long stay at the Four Seasons. We had a great time in Bali but the resort was disappointing. 1. LocationThe resort is located right across Denpasar Airport, so whenever you look out all you see are planes landing and taking off. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ impossible to feel that you left civilization and impossible to feel any serenity. The beach is extremely dirty and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a public beach, the resort doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have its own beach. So its a bit rocky and you have stray dogs walking and its extremely busy with people. We were looking for a quiet getaway, which it isn't. The beach area of the resort is TINY. They have a few sun beds and umbrellas, which doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ always accommodate all the guests. 2. The VillasThe villas are huge and comfortable however the hotel has aged and you can feel that in its furniture and bathroom. The villas are also pretty close to each other so we felt cramped in. 3. ServiceIt was inconsistent. Some days we would have impeccable service and others we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° wonder what had gone wrong. It felt like a nice resort but it lacked the Four Seasons touch. 4. Spa. The spa rooms are extremely small and dark. I had a great therapist but unfortunately the setting was anything but tranquil. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a shame that the rooms don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ over look the beach or the resort's beautiful gardens. 5. The Kids Club. The pool at the kids club is more like a bath tub, and there were no daily activities as promised on the website organized for the kids. The staff is extremely warm, however I guess we were expecting something more like the kids club at the one and only -Maldives- were the kids have planned group activities. The place also needs to be revamped- all the toys are in poor condition. So in summary, not one of our favorite Four Seasons Resorts.. I would highly recommend going to Langkawi Four Seasons or one of their other Maldives resorts before considering this one...
