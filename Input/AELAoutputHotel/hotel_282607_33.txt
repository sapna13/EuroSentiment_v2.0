{"text":"Great Service We booked to stop at Hotel Apsis Aranea for 4 nights after reading the reviews on this website and weren't disappointed. We arrived late in the evening (about 11.30) after flying from Liverpool. As we flew with Ryanir, the airport was a good 1 hour bus journey away, however the bus station is only 6 blocks walk from the hotel. Although it was dark and quiet, we felt very safe walking 10-15 mins. Definitely no need for a taxi.When we walked through the doors, the night porter greeted us by name, knowing that we were checking in late (I had emailed ahead) and were probably also the last to check in. However I thought it was a lovely touch and made us feel very welcome after a tiring journey.We had a room overlooking the front street and the intersection. Although it was quite busy during the day, noise wasn't a problem and was very quiet at night. The decor was lovely - very minimal, white cotton sheets and not a disgusting multi-coloured bed throw in sight! The room was quite small, but we already knew and it wasn't a problem for the two of us.Easy walking distance to Sagrada Familia and the Ramblas - although if you are tired of walking there is a metro nearby. We found it great being a short way out of the main tourist area just simply for the quiet. Plus there are lots of fantastic buildings to admire as you are walking.Great location, great service. No faults.It's also worth mentioning that we didn't sign up for breakfast because the previous reviews we read mentioned the smokey dining room. On arrival we found that it had recently converted to non-smoking! ","annotations":[]}
