{"text":"An Excellent Choice We stayed at the HCC Taber for three nights in June. I would definitely recommend this hotel.We had a quiet room facing a courtyard. Our room was clean, comfortable and pleasant. We were able to get a non-smoking room. The rooms were comfortably air-conditioned and odor-free.The reception area was very modern. Although the hotel apparently has free WiFi, if you do not have your own laptop internet access was fairly expensive. After dark, there is a security guard stationed at the door which increased our sense of safety.Perhaps the best thing about the hotel was its excellent location. The streets around the hotel are very busy during the day but are relatively quiet at night. (I definitely would not want to stay at any hotel located in the Raval.)The HCC Taber is a block from a major metro station that offers train access to the airport. It is situated less than half a block from the start of La Rambla and is a ten minute walk down La Rambla to Place de Catalunya. One of the best shopping streets in Barcelona, Passeig de Gracia, is only one block away (running parallel to La Rambla). This means that there are many restaurants, cafes, pastry shops and clothing stores nearby. The two major hop on hop off tour bus companies both have stops on Passeig de Gracia about 2-3 blocks from the hotel, which was also very convenient.I would definitely stay at the HCC Taber again and would highly recommend it. Excellent value for the price. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1179,"mention":"pastry","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1173}]}
