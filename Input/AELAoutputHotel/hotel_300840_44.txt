{"text":"Not Bad but Could be Better We stayed at the Marco Polo Hong Kong for a week from 10th Sept this year. The hotel was fine, nice  clean and the staff were OK. We'd read some reviews about the staff and to be honest things didn't sound good but we didn't experience anything like that. We found them all to be pleasant enough. My big problem with the hotel was the noise. We stayed a week and it felt like we had no sleep the whole time we were there. There was building work at the hotel, which we were warned about, but it did finish at 5pm every day so it wasn't a problem as we were never in the room during the day anyway but what our tour agent didn't tell us was they were doing building work next door (Marco Polo is part of a big complex called Harbour City and this is where the noise came from). They hammered, drilled and loaded skips and did what ever it is builders do, all night, every night apart from Sunday. We did complain on several occasions but the hotel staff said there was nothing they could about it. We thought we might get a chance to change to a quieter room but the only way they would move us was if we upgraded and paid extra so in that respect they were a bit unhelpful. All in all the hotel was OK and I would stay there again because the location really couldn't be any better but I would make sure that there is no building work going on first!
