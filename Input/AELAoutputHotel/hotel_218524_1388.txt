{"text":"Wonderful experience - October 2006 My husband and I booked our five day stay at Secrets Excellence after extensive research, and reading many of the reviews on tripadvisor.com. For our honeymoon in October 2005 we stayed at the Secrets Capri in the Riviera Maya, and loved it. Our final two choices for Dominican Republic were the Paradisus Palma Real, or Excellence. We choose Excellence because of the couples\/adults only aspect. I was hesitant because some of the reviews were less than positive, but our experience was wonderful. We stayed in an Excellence Club corner suite. I highly recommened the Excellence Club, although many people we talked to did not participate, and still enjoyed their stay. You get expedited check-in\/out, a private lounge from 7am to 11pm, with heavy snacks, free internet, and a private concierge at your disposal.The beach was beautiful, and much better than the beach at Secrets Capri in Mexico, where we didn't get in the water at all. We also liked the pool better, because it bigger, and more spread out. Any previous postings about having to get out early to find chairs are ridiculous, because we never went out before 12:00pm, and always found chairs, either in the sun or shade, at both the pool or the beach. I would, however, recommend that you bring bug spray, as the mosquitos can be quite annoying. I believe this is seasonal, and can vary even according to days, as they were worse for the first few days of our stay, then seemed to disappear. Another couple indicated that there were no bugs the entire week before we got there, and then they just appeared. Maybe it is dependant on rain, as it rained heavily the night we arrived. The only disappointment was the food, which wasn't bad, just not as good as Secrets Capri. We liked El Patio (Mexican) and the private dinner on the beach (at an extra cost, but totally worth it) the best, in terms of food. We did not get to eat at Bordeaux, but most people said it was their favorite. I think the food for the private dinner on the beach was from Bordeaux, though, and we enjoyed it. Overall, I think my husband and I are pretty laid back, and willing to overlook some small mishaps (our room smelled moldy at first, but improved after a day, and the concierge was quick to notice and make sure it was taken care of immediately) for the greater picture, which was a beautiful resort with excellent staff and service. I think the people who criticize this resort are the type who focus on the bad (which isn't much) instead of the numerous wonderful aspects.
