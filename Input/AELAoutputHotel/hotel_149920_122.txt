{"text":"Hopping Hotel My husband and I just came back from Puerto Rico. We had a great time. We usually stay at a Marriott Resort when we travel because we don't like surprises. This particular Marriott was very clean, the staff was very friendly and the location suited our needs. We wanted to be in an area where we could jog in the morning and walk to restaurants at night. It was also a short taxi ride to Old San Juan where there are many terrific restaurants. We ate at The Parrot Club, Marmalade and Sonne in Old San Juan. My husband said he had one of the best Filet Mignon's in his life at Sonne's. In Condado we ate at Ajili-mojili and Ropa Vieja. Ropa Vieja was very good but the staff had a bit of an attitude.This particular Marriott is not up to par with some at other locations(i.e. Aruba and Harbor Beach in Fort Lauderdale). One reason is that the pool area is small and very shady. The hotel just didn't have the same feel as some of the others. It wasn't as fancy maybe.. But the hotel lobby is jumping at night! There was great energy in the place and I loved watching the locals dance! The beach is nice but there is so much construction going on in the area that the view along shore is not the nicest. It's not terrible but there are a lot of cranes in the area. Just face your chair towards the ocean which is a beautiful blue and you'll be fine. The area is being built up tremendously. We had an ocean view room so we did not see the other buildings while sitting on our deck. It's very true about the rough water. A father and his son had to be pulled out of the water because the waves were forcing them up against the rocks.If you are looking for a clean room, with nice amenities in a central location then this is a great place to stay.
