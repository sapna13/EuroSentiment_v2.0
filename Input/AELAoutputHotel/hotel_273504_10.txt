{"text":"A Restful Stay At A Classy Hotel With Character My husband, daughter and I spent an overnight at the Kemipnski Hotel outside of Frankfurt. After reading a review about it and learning it was it was located on a nature preserve, it sounded like the kind of place that would help us relax and get a good night's sleep before our transatlantic flight.We had never stayed at a Kempinski before, but we were so pleased with our visit, that we will definitely try to stay at one again. The hotel was about a 20 minute drive from the Frankfurt airport. We called the complimentary shuttle and it picked us up. The hotel is set on several acres of pretty land. We were given a room with a pretty view overlooking the pond. The hotel is older, but with a lot of character and quite lovely. The beds and pillows were very comfy. There was a fresh rose in our bathroom. We had a complimentary bottle of water waiting for us too. The front desk and the driver were very friendly and helpful. For dinner, we went to their Forest Hause Restaurant and had the most delightful waitress who cooked several dishes according to our preferences. The food was delicious and reasonably priced.The next morning we had a fantastic full breakfast buffet served in their light and cheery breakfast restaurant. The buffet was extensive with delicious eggs, meats, cheeses, home made breads and pastries, fresh squeezed juices and many cereals.All of us thoroughly enjoyed our stay and think this hotel was one of our highlights of our trip.
