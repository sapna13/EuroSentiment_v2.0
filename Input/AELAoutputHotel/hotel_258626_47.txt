{"text":"A hidden gem at the Galleria! First and foremost, I spend a lot of time looking for those hidden deals that can't be beat, especially when I want to book a weekend getaway to Dallas. Well, after booking this property for $65 a night through Hotwire, I can honestly say, dollar for dollar, you will not get a better deal in Dallas, or Ft. Worth, period!Check in was quick and the desk rep was very friendly. We did ask for a bellhop cart during check in and, the hotel staff was slow to respond nevertheless, it didn't bother me enough to file a complaint and we brought our luggage up to the room on our own.This hotel, first and foremost, is absolutely clean, spacious and well-appointed. The suites have divided rooms and the bathroom has an entry from the bedroom AND living room areas. The beds were firm, the four pillows per each double bed were exceptionally soft and the A\/C work wonderfully. High speed access was a snap and the desk work area had two excellent chairs available. The sleeper sofa was also fairly comfortable.The hotel is located near Alpha and Noel St. adjacent to the Macy's entrance at the Galleria Mall. It doesn't get any better than that with respect to hotel properties in that area.My only complains about the hotel were really nothing to sneeze at. You are provided a code which gives you access to paid parking across the street at $6 per day. Second, please be wary of the complimentary breakfast. You are receiving a free breakfast only for those items at the serving area, which are identified as continental breakfast items. Otherwise, you pay $7 per person.Overall, I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Hilton Suites is a winner in my book! ","annotations":[]}
