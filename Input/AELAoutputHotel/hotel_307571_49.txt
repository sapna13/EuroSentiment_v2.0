{"text":"Paradise found!!! My new wife and I decided to spend our honeymoon in Bali and Langkawi, Malaysia. We hadn't been to the Far East in quite a while (I was born in the Philippines, and she has visited Thailand on multiple occasions), so we figured this would be a great opportunity to see some places no one we knew has ever visited. We arrived in Bali on Tuesday 10\/31 and left Sunday 11\/5 for another week at the Four Seasons Langkawi. I did tons of research, reading every entry for almost every hotel in Southern\/Eastern\/Western Bali and in Langkawi. Using Trip Advisor, Expedia, yahoo, Frommers, and Fodors I was able to drill down where I wanted to stay. I chose the 4 Seasons Jimbaran over it's sister property in Sayan because of its location. Sayan is located 2hrs from the airport, while Jimbaran is a 15min drive (and u don't hear\/see planes). My booking was done through Asian Affair Holidays (Singapore Airlines) because when packaged with airfare and transfers, it came out cheaper. Since it was noted through Asian Affair Holidays that we were on a honeymoon, we got preferential treatment. When we arrived at the 4 Szns, we were kindly greeted with a cool but brisk ginger refreshment in the simple and understated lobby. Once you walk towards the stairs though, you realize how beautiful the grounds are. We were given the keys to a 2 bedroom villa that sleeps 6 people just a short walk up or buggy ride from the lobby (Rm 1403 I think). The room was amazing...almost too large for my wife and I (she was scared to go into the other half of the villa at nite). The private pool was clean, no bugs on the premises, and the room was in such sparkling working order that I was in awe for most of the stay. The tubs were filled with flowers and warm water. Greetings were left on all beds. Outdoor showers were clean and a great touch. Privacy was perfect as you could not view us walking around nude from anywhere on the property. I've stayed at some nice hotels around the world, but this was epicurean and above and beyond all others. We didn't have to lift a finger for anything and were driven by buggy anywhere we wanted.  The restaurants are good, but pricey. Our package included free breakfast (room service or buffet) and they were all good in quality and variety. The noodle house and especially PJ's are worth visits. I'd suggest walking the beach towards the pretty lights about 1000ft towards town and eat seafood on the sand. Don't order the imported lobster as it is overpriced, and stick to the fresh prawns, crab, and fish. The prices there are 5-6 times less than the hotel's and taste just as good. If I could afford it, I'd easily revisit the 4szns in Jimbaran. The people were nice, the service top notch, the locale safe, sound, cultured, and tranquil. The pools were clean and bug free and we were offered water, snacks, frozen fruit pops, and spritzers often. Very glad that they provide free sun tan lotion. The spa was pretty good, although pricey. Loved the decor and the couples room which had indoor and outdoor shower's and tubs for synchronized spa'ing. i'd suggest trying one of the spa's outside the hotel (we went to one near the airport, that was 50% if you flew in with Singapore airlines). We spent 6+ hrs at this spa getting so many treatments for less than $110 per couple. For those planning on visiting Bali in Oct\/Nov which is supposedly rain season, I just want to say that we never saw any rain. There were some clouds around when we went on one of those Bali Hai cruises (very enjoyable) though. We booked most of our excursions through Bali Discovery tours and Tour East prior to leaving as their prices were highly competitive and the drivers were very nice, honest, (spoke good enough english) and on-time. You can always book through the hotel, but they charge more and are limited on operators. Also, don't forget you can always rent out a taxi for couple hours or an entire day. I compared some, and although their prices are low, their actual touring services ~could be pretty bad (translation, knowledge). I'll be composing a similar review for the 4 Seasons Langkawi shortly. We loved Bali (although a little crowded with all those motos) and would definitely visit again.
