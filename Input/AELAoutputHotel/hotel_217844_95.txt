{"text":"Worth the money Recently stayed her for nearly a week on a business trip. While the view from my sixth floor window left much to be desired (it was the top of a neighboring building), the room itself was pleasantly large and comfortable.The bed was quite comfortable and there were a wealth of pillows provided. The bathroom was roomy and well lit.Even though Bush Street runs right out front and Powell St. runs just one building away, the rooms were pleasantly quiet and very little street noise seemed to reach the room. The cable car's bell and the back-up beeper used by a garbage truck were the among the few exceptions.The staff was quite friendly and my concerns were all met quickly and completely.There were safes and coffee makers in the rooms, along with DVD players and surround sound systems. You could check-out DVDs from a number that were available at the front desk. The wireless internet access was reasonably snappy, though the service provider's access control mechanism was clunky. In addition, the service provider (Wi-Fi Guys) would periodically inject ads into your web surfing, which was more than annoying.The room could be a bit dark at night, but lamps were generally placed where they were needed. For some mysterious reason, one of the lamps was hooked into a switch that also controlled the light directly over the entrance door. That meant leaving a light on where it wasn't needed if I wanted the light turned on elsewhere in the room.There were no recycling bins obviously available for any sort of recyclable material (newspaper, bottles, cans, etc). Given San Francisco's well publicized attempts to encourage more recycling, the lack of recycling bins was disappointing.
