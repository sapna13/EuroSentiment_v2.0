{"text":"A varied but good experience We choose Excellence due to their very good reviews. Some broad observations on what have said.Distance- yes it's a good hour from the airport. We enjoyed the ride through the countryside and small towns. You're going to be in a bubble at an all-inclusive anyway; why not see some of the real island on the way?Rooms- we lucked out. Requested and got a ground floor corner non-smoking room. We also got a partial ocean view and strong sounds of the surf. Semi private patio with a single hammock. After walking around we saw how lucky we were. The majority of the rooms overlook a small interior garden or the grounds- no pool or ocean locations. The bed was VERY hard. The room was large and comfortable, but had problems with the toilet- dripped. They came right away to fix it- twice. The shower was small-average size. Nice marble walls, plastic floor, drop ceiling with acoustic tile. The room had crown moulding. Usually a very nice touch. Theirs was thin and in bad need of a paint job. The jacuzzi tub was fun, but the jets were not very powerful or well placed. The TV got a good number of stations, but the VCR didn't work- not a big deal for us. Food. The restaurant service was very good and very fun. At each restaurant, the hostess escort the women, by the arm, to your table. Their house wine, Chard, Savanion Blanc, Cab, and Merlot were all quite good. The food itself was mixed. An example was the Mediterranean restaurant. My wife had to send back the Kibbe (she lived in the Middle East for 6 years and knows what the food really tastes like.) On the flip side, the pear\/goat cheese salad was spot on. All the portions are small, but the dinners- 3-4 courses served over a hour's time- filled us up by the end. The plating was all very well done. Beach- hard surf, sand colored sand that is very fine. Surf was very good for body surfing, but not good for bobbing. Spa- they push it; it's how they make their money. We did a free 1 hour hot tub tour they do to get guests to buy massages, etc. Frankly, I thought the building left a bit to be desired. Compared to other resorts- notably Ibrostar- theirs wasn't much to write home about. Very nice, yes. But certainly not world-class architecture. We didn't take any treatments, so can't comment about them.Overall- these resorts, like other vacations and like life in general- is what you make it. We went to relax, to be pampered, to have a good time and we did. We found the people- both in and out of the resort- to be extremely pleasant and proud of their island. All the staff were joy to interact with. Would we go back? No; because we would want to try other places and islands, not because we had a bad time. We would recommend it to others. Just realize that 5 star in the DR is not what 5 star in a Western country would be.
