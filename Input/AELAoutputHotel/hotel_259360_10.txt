{"text":"Great location, great hotel, great city. Again you look at the previous reviews  some are raving about the hotel while others do not.In our case WE LOVED IT. 8 great days spent here.We knew from previous visits to Barcelona that the hotel was in a great location. You can catch all the tour buses only 5 minutes walk away at the Columbus Column. The Rambles is 5 minute from the hotel. You overlook the everchanging Marina  if you walk behind the hotel you go directly into the Gothic area where ther is a multitude of things to see  small places to eat. Don't eat in the TOURISTY Les Ramblas. Get out in the back streets  eat there.Therefore the hotel was ideal for our needs. The room was immaculate  well kept  the staff were always polite  helpful. When asked they could not do enough for you. The view from the top of the hotel is superb  if you just want a lazy day then just sit up there  watch the cars  boats go by while taking the odd dip in the splash pool.We never ate in the hotel so I cannot comment on the food, but for a cheap  cheary late breakfast the Flore De La Notre just to the left of the hotel was 1st rate.The staff there were always friendly  the service superb. On our way home from sight seeing each day we stopped in for a wee PIT STOP. That involved 2 beers\/wines  an assortment of Tapas  some friendly banter with Rod the waiter. That set us up for going out at 9pm for something to eat in the Gothic area.TOP RATE HOTEL  Sorroundings. ","annotations":[]}
