{"text":"Great Location\/Rooms need some updating\/ Bring earplugs! Went to Barcelona for the weekend with my 20 year old daughter. We loved the location of Hotel Lleo --just a couple of easy walking blocks from Las Ramblas (lots of shopping) and Pla√ã√©?a de Catalunya (where you can pick up buses for tourist routes). If you really need some American food 'fix' then between the hotel and Cataluyna there is a Burger King, Mcdonalds, Starbucks, Subway and a Hard Rock Cafe. There is also an ATM right next door and a video arcade a few doors down (my 17 year old son would have loved it!) When you walk into the lobby of the hotel it is bright and looks new, so we were a little disappointed to find the rooms a bit tired and in need of updating. We had a room facing the street so it was definitely noisy until very late....I would suggest ear plugs if you want to get to sleep before 2 am (on a weekend night). We were also surprised that our room would not be cleaned until 3ish in the afternoon -- not a real problem, but a bit surprising. There is free internet access in the lounge area behind the elevators. We did not eat at the hotel.We took the Bus Turistic to get an overview of the city and found their ticketing \/ boarding process a bit disorganized. They had a bus parked in front of the Hard Rock Cafe where we waited in quite a long line only to find out this was simply to buy tickets (22 euro for 2 days). We then had to go down the street to pick up the bus (located in front of El Corte Ingles -- a HUGE department store and groceries too). Here we also waited in a very long line because most people want to sit on the top of the double decker bus so it takes quite some time for the line to move along. WE also found that you could buy tickets from this line as well (so our previous wait in front of Hard Rock cafe was a waste of time). ON our second day we got to El Corte Ingles about 9:15 and found many less people....so I would definitely suggest getting an early start to avoid the longer lines that pick up later in the morning.
