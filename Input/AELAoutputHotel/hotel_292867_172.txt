{"text":"Okay,probably will not return Punta Cana has an amazing beach! You can walk for miles! The grounds of the Caribe Princess are well maintained and beautiful as well. Peacocks, white swans, ponds, very nice.The hotel, well, it looks nice, clean spacious lobby. Our room was acceptable, important note: there is NO clock! Granted we were on vacation, but you do need to know the time occassionally. There are no books or even brochures listing hotel ammenities, activitites, restaurant hours, etc, absolutely nothing. Hotels we've stayed at in Mexico, Jamaicia and the Bahamas have asked for a deposit and provided a lock for your room safe, not so at the Caribe Princess! It cost $24.00. We had visited Puerto Plata in the past, however, this was our first visit to Punta Cana, so for the first time, we opted to do an apple vacation square deal. We found out where we were staying at the airport just prior to departure. Of course, we got the deal that isn't really an all inclusive. According to the apple vacation book, the Princess line appears to be the only one that has a VIP package of significance. Apparently for $21-24.00 per day per person, you would get premium brand liquor and one meal at one of the two restraunts not included in the regular deal. For $25 per person, you could eat at either or both places.The food in the buffet restaurant was okay, breakfast, unless you ordered an omelet, was always cold. The varitey was good, but cold. The five speciality restaurants were good! Food hot and very nice atmosphere.It wasn't just this resort, but yes, you have to get to the beach or pool to get a chair, especially if you want one with a back rest that actually works and if you want shade.The resort staff is nice, but much more reserved than in other countries. I did feel the Europeans were treated better than US people. In fact, interestingly, the Italians have their own section with a theater for evening shows.We did have a great time, weather was fantastic, the beach amazing, but we would not choose to return to this hotel. Most important, bring insect repellent! The bugs are terrible at night!
