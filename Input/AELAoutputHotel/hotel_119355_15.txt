{"text":"Dissapointed I travel a lot and stay at many different classes of hotels. When booking The Crowne Plaza I expected it to be pretty good. Upon walking in the lobby I was very impressed. The lobby is very nice with a business center including computers and printers that are easily accessible. There is a mini gift shop with snacks, drinks and even microwave dinners that is open 24 hours. The restaurant and bar looked nice and there is even a Starbucks stand that is open until 1pm daily. Once I got to my room though... I was very dissapointed. The room had a terrible odor. The toilet and shower was dirty. It looked like the room had not been cleaned properly after it was used last. Honestly - I was afraid to use the cups provided (I went to the gym and got plastic cups for my water). I kept the window open to try and air out the room to get out the smell but was cold because the beds aren't very warm. There is a very rough waffle blanket over the sheet that could be felt all night against my skin - not very comfortable. I could hear a train going by during the night, then before I needed to wake up the alarm in the room next to me was going off and never did get shut off. In the morning, I went to order room service breakfast, but could only find a lunch and dinner menu. I called and ordered french toast, bacon with a side of fresh strawberries and a pot of coffee. The coffee was horrible - tasted like dirty water. The french toast was cold (the butter wouldn't even melt - it too was right out of the fridge, or maybe freezer!). The bacon was probably crispy when it was hot, but now cold it was rubbery. The strawberries were good... they were cold too (the only thing I wanted cold!)I think this hotel does not live up to the price.
