{"text":"Satisfied This was my first trip to Amsterdam and my BF's second and he returned to this hotel b\/c of the location, service, and overall quality being good. I was a bit apprehensive after seeing the reviews on this site, but I was very happy with our stay here.First things first, the room was very decent sized, especially after two weeks in quainter locations throughout Germany and Austria. The bed was two twins pushed together, but they offered to set it up nicer, but we declined (it was the only room available when we checked in). The closet was large, nice desk space, small table, chairs, bed comfy enough (much more comfortable than those in the German hotels we stayed), TV with cable, decent shower pressure, hair dryer, wet bar, and clean enough tile\/grout\/counters\/carpeting. Our room looked straight out to the Centraal train station and the noise wasn't that bad. We had central heating and air system, which was great to have!I was never really annoyed with anything about our room, which is odd b\/c i usually find something to nitpick at a hotel.We found the hotel staff to be one of the BEST features of the hotel. From the front desk, to the concierge, to even employees in the hall -- they must make it a point to treat guests as -- well -- guests. The concierge and bellmen desk guys were so nice and helpful, super friendly, and always greeted us when we came in. I was honestly impressed with the service here, which adds to my overall impression of the hotel itself. We tried to eat at the restaurant one night, but i'm not fond of red meats and fishes (other than warm water hawaiian fish, yes i'm a snob). We did order room service one night, looking for some junk food, and it was fine. The prices seemed typical in Euros for a 3-4 star hotel chain (i.e. a bit overpriced b\/c of hotel overhead like in the States). There are two nice bars, one in the lobby, and one as part of the restaurant, to hang out. We ate one night at the nearby Sea Palace, a floating Chinese restaurant. We have tons of great (and BAD) Chinese restaurants here and found this place to be very good, but VERY overpriced, however, excellent ambience and service.The location couldn't be more perfect for exploring Amsterdam. You are right at the Damrak and across the street from the Centraal train station, Dam square is close, and many other sites in this easy to explore and walk around city. There are many places to eat, shop, and be a tourist very close by (Sex Museum, red light district, etc.). We never tried the public transport, b\/c walking was easy and fun, but it was very crowded with people from all walks of life...a very cosmopolitan city.I would stay here again if traveling to Amsterdam.
