{"text":"Currently not a 5 star We decided to have a few days in Barcelona with friends, and got a good deal at Le Meridien, attracted by its location on Las Ramblas and the official 5 star rating. I was wary about the previous reports on refurbishment, but it sounded substantially complete. On arrival, we found that the main reception and lounge area was being re-developed, and so had to use a temporary reception. This gave a poor impression of the hotel overall. The temporary reception was very busy and crowded with suitcases etc of those checking out, or waiting for transport. Our room was initially not ready, but after a walk around the area, we were allocated our room. This had been fully refurbished in a modern, minimalist style, and the bathroom, although very smart, had a large shower area but no bathtub. The view from the room was of the back of some appartments and offices opposite. We did not have dinner in the hotel, but had a couple of drinks in the lounge, which offered good service, but high prices. Breakfast was included in our package, and was very varied and tasty, with some egg dishes cooked to order. Unfortunately on the last morning, the overnight thunderstorm had caused the flat roof above the breakfast buffet to leak, resulting in water dripping through the still live light fittings - not a very safe situation!Overall the hotel was disappointing, and it was difficult to see how the 5 star rating was justified, even if the refurbishment was disregarded, and if staying in Barcelona again we would certainly look at other options.
