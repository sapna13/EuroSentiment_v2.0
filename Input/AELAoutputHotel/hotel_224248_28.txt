{"text":"Great hotel! My wife and I had never been to Miami, and when I checked on TripAdvisor, let's just say the hotels in the $150-300 range go from average down to absolutely dreadful. I spent a little more to stay at this hotel, because of the great reviews, and after seeing some of the other places I had considered, boy, am I glad I did!!! First of all, the rooms are impeccably clean, modern, and quiet. The views are not great -- we looked out at the airport, the other side of the hotel you get a worse view -- but hey, it's not South Beach, so you shouldn't expect it. Second, there is free, gated parking -- first level is covered, second level is not. A very nice pool on the second level, which we never used.Third, their breakfast spread was very good for this range of hotel. The review that I just saw of this hotel is obviously from someone not accustomed to anything other than a full-service hotel, but as someone who stays in many Hampton Inns, Fairfield Inns, etc., it was very good. I liked that they had a juice machine and apples and bananas available 24 hours a day (and occasionally there were cookies).The front desk staff was incredibly helpful and friendly -- among the best I have encountered. The area around the hotel is nothing special, but it's safe and close to the airport and Coral Gables, plus close to major highways. The choices for dining around the hotel are limited -- we ate at the Cuban restaurant in the shopping center across the street, and while the food was decent, the service was DREADFUL, and we noticed that we received MUCH, MUCH worse service than the Spanish-speaking family that entered after us. If I had it to do again, I would have eaten in the nicer-looking Italian restaurant right next door.All in all, a great experience.
