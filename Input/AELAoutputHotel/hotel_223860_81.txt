{"text":"Review from a Convention Attendee I stayed here recently for a Convention (size: 600 people). Pay the $25 to valet park your car...the free parking lot is quite a hike in the heat. The hotel appears to be less than 5 years old, up to date, and well-appointed. The lobby is beautiful with water fountians that add much-needed moisture to the dry desert air. I loved the complimentary ice water and iced tea in the lobby - it was great after arriving from the heat outside. Check in was easy and the front desk staff were pleasant. All requests made via phone to the Marriott at Your Service desk were met promptly and accurately. (I requested additional face cloths and hangers). The Marriott at Your Service staff made follow-up calls to my room to ensure my requests had been adequately satisfied - a nice touch! My room had 2 beds because a King room was not available at the time I made my reservation. I moved to a King room for the last night of my stay. The King room is the same size as the double, but with more room to move around in due to there being one less bed. Both of my rooms faced out towards the Lazy River and pool, but the windows\/walls were thick enough that I couldn't hear noise from those enjoying themselves outside. The bathroom was stocked with nice upgraded Artifact toilietries, not the usual Marriott items. The bathroom was pretty, but strange in that it had a small, glass-enclosed stand-up shower with separate bathtub. This was a meaningful detail to me because it is next to impossible to shave your legs in the shower...no place to put your foot up. The bathroom also had a strange absence of towel bars. My least favorite thing about the room was the fact that the carpet left my bare feet dirty, even though it looked clean. Yuck! The convention rooms were nice and it was fabulous to have a Starbucks on the property. I didn't get a chance to enjoy the Lazy River, but I heard lots of good things about it. My biggest complaint about this property was that it was very understaffed at a time when there were more than 3 conventions going on at the same time, especially in the evenings. For example, there was only one cocktail server working in the lobby lounge (at times there were more than 50 guests in the lounge) in the evenings and she nastily told everyone who arrived to get in line at the bar. The line at the bar was so long that it took a minimum of 25 minutes to get a drink. The hotel has a complimentary shuttle that runs every 30 minutes to the shopping center across the street. In the 110+ degree heat, we were glad we didn't have to walk over. I ate lunch at the Blue Sage (very good chicken quesadilla prepared the traditional way our server suggested, not the strange inside-out way described on the menu). We also had brunch at the Blue Sage on Sunday. The brunch buffet was a zoo, so we ordered off the menu. When our items took more than a 20 minutes to arrive, our server suggested that we get some fruit from the buffet to enjoy until our entrees arrived. This hotel has the potential to be a 4 star hotel, if they improve the consistency of their service.
