{"text":"Great Time in Dominican This hotel and experience were awesome. I cannot believe how arogant some people are, i'm not really sure what they were expecting for the price, this hotel is just fine, believe methe food - the food was fine, i didn't love the buffet and we didnt eat there when we could avoid it. My boyfriend, on the other hand, was completely fine with it. The food there was just kind of lower-grade. The pasta tasted like beeferoni and not pasta like we're used to - that kinda thing. We went to most of the a-la-carte restaurants and they were awesome. I was so surprised at te selection, in the chinese restaurant there's even sushi! So we really enjoyed those and stuck to those most of the time. If you read the reviews further back, they say they had to wait in a longgg line to reserve a spot in the a-la-cartes for dinner, we did not have the problem and even booked in the afternoon for that night a few timesthe service - the service was awesome, the employees are just great, so much fun. of course there's the odd person with a chip on their shoulder, they're people too...cut them some slack. the worst part was the language barrier, there should definately have been some more english - speaking people in key parts...like check in. that was a a little frusteratingthe room- the room was great. we had a queen bed and our balcony overlooked the pool which was awesome because we could hear what was going on down there. We did have to pay 24 dollars for the key to the safe but it was well worth it. the safe's arent huge, about 1 foot cube, average size. The one thing that was annoying about the room was that everytime the maids would come and clean the ceramic floors would never really fully dry, i guess the moist air is to be expected. we left the maid 1 or 2 bucks every day and never had a problem getting towels or having the room cleaned. the drinks - unbelieveably strong. very good though!the language barrier - we came not knowing a lick of spanish,and did fine, it would have been useful to know some spanish though, like please, thank you, etc my biggest complaint of this hotel is the language barrier and second the food. there were a lot of people who only spoke spanish which got aggrivating, but we dealt with it and were fine. there were a TON of french-speaking guests and a lot of the staff spoke french as well so if you speak french, you're in luckthe beach - just breathtaking! we spent so much time there, my boyfriend played volleyball on the beach and water polo in the pool. you could walk for FOREVER on the beach it was awesome. Also if you come out of the resort and turn left on the beach and walk for about half an hour, there are little shops where you can get souvineers and stuff like that, cigars, booze etc. make sure you bargain with them! dont pay more than half of what they ask -- at least. overall - great experience, we both got sick though so by the end of the trip we just wanted to leave, but now i just want to go back. i would reccomend checking out Sun Village resort in Peurto Plata if you havent already booked this one. apparently it's canadian owned, with tons of english staff and gourmet food but not as nice of a beach. if you've already booked this resort. it is just fine, enjoy your vacation.ps: DEFINATELY bring sunscreen, aloe, advil, and immodium, these things are very expensive on the resort, bringing them was the best thing i did ","annotations":[{"endOffset":423,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":418},{"endOffset":423,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":418},{"endOffset":3127,"mention":"canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":3119},{"endOffset":3127,"mention":"canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":3119},{"endOffset":3127,"mention":"canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":3119},{"endOffset":3194,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3190}]}
