{"text":"Wonderful time at the Majestic Colonial Went to the Majestic Colonial Oct 21 - 25 for our 32nd Anniversary trip. We arrived late afternoon due to a problem at JFK with our Airbus. We were warmly welcomed with a Majestic drink and check in was very quick. Sofia took us to our room #4406 which was beautiful until I looked out the balcony and terrace and saw all the construction of the new Majestic Elegance going up next door. Plus, we were way in the back of the resort. I was sad and the hubby went down to see if we could possibly move. Since the hotel wasn't full and not in season we were very lucky that the Manager Mr. Ramirez offered us an upgrade for no extra money. ( I love this man!!!) The next room was gorgeous #2350 and up at the ocean. We had our complimentary bottles of rum, whiskey and champagne waiting for us plus the fruit and cheese plates. :-) We had a large terrace with jacuzzi outside plus the beautiful suite with jacuzzi indoors too. The animation team was a lot of fun with the games at the pool which is where we spent most of our time. The pool is huge and beautiful and runs all the way from the beach to the lobby. It's quiet in the back section if you are there for just rest and relaxation. The pool bar was great and the bartenders very nice with no wait for your drinks. The waitresses came around to your lounge chairs often also. The beach was very nice and breezy so we would take a short late afternoon nap there before going in to get ready for dinner and the evening show. The Michael Jackson show was the best as stated by many others. We had somegreat audience participation in the other evening shows that made for many good laughs. The food was very good and yes there are some strange looking foods there especially at the buffet but you had many entrees to choose from. I enjoyed dining at Le Gourmet and had the filet mignon. I also loved the ChateauBriand at the Steak House on the beach. Don't miss trying the pasta bar too. Our favorite drinks were the Majestic, Coco Loco, Dirty Monkey and Miami Vice made at the lobby bar by Pablo or Vincent. We tipped all the time so our drinks were always very good and restaurant service very attentive. The mini bar is just a chilling box and not a real refrigerator so keep your ice bucket full. Their coffee is very strong so I had to drink it half coffee and half milk. The maid did a nice job in the room as did the guy who fills up the mini bar. Remember tips for them too. We did not go off the resort since we were there for a quick stay. According to the applause at the evening shows each night it sounded like there were mostly Americans there for our days visiting with Spain coming in #2. We had no problem with the employees speaking English to us. I have heard in season there will be mostly Europeans there. I would definitely recommend the Majestic to all my friends to stay at.
