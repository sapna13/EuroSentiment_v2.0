{"text":"very good value! booked a superior room. the room was a bit smaller than expected (but only because i had booked a superior room vs. standard room). we had views of local florence homes, but not of the duomo. in the end though, the room was more than sufficient for our needs. when we got to the room we were missing towels but a quick visit to the front desk fixed that. the front desk is mostly staffed by students, especially in the off-hours (evenings and early morning). but we found them to be very nice, accommodating, and very good with their english. breakfast was served from 7:30-10am. nothing hot was served - just your basic breakfast of breads  rolls, croissants, lots of spread (jams, butter, patte, nutella, etc), yogurt, cheese, and a couple of types of pastries. there's also two kinds of juice, a coffee \/cappuccino\/hot chocolate machine, and water. definitely not gourmet, but certainly more than enough to get you started in the morning. there's also wireless internet. the rate we paid for includes this option, but otherwise it's 15 euros for unlimited access during your entire stay (or 2 euros for 1 hour, and 3 euros for 2 hours - clearly the unlimited option is the better deal). unfortunately, there are times when the internet is not working properly. it seems like it's mostly during the late evening hours, but otherwise, for the occasional email checking, it was fine. if you need a dedicated and reliable internet access all the time, then this might be something to consider.one thing to note is that the front desk is on the third room with the rooms on either the second or third floor. the elevator is extremely small, just large enough for me and my rolling suitcase, and certainly not big enough for 2 people with lots of luggage. the location of the hotel is by far the best part - it's probably a 10-min walk to the train station, and it is close to a lot of nearby attractions. you can walk everywhere, and it felt safe walking around. given the price we paid (we used the prepay option), we would definitely stay here again.
