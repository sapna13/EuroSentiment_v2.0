{"text":"Almost perfect and a safe place for typhoon Nuri. We booked for five nights and six days. We are on our last day in the hotel and were hit by typhoon nuri yesterday so we got to experience most of their facilities since Hong kong shut down. We booked through their internet website and contacted them through email. We have ambassador privileges, used the airport limo pick up and drop off services, tried most of their restaurants, gym, spa, laundry\/dry cleaning and concierge services. We booked a superior harbourside room, got upgraded to deluxe and had club access.1. Concierge\/Lobby 2\/5: I should start with the bad which is not much if you are careful. We booked a day tour to Macau with their concierge at the lobby. We were told that there was only one tour company they recommend (who would not drop us off back at the hotel) but we found out that there was another one who would (it was too late by then). We were misinformed by the concierge that it was easy to get a ferry back from macau as long as we have a ticket back. If we wanted to leave earlier, it would not be a problem. Unfortunately, you have to be on standby at the terminal to get on the ferry earlier.The tour company that they recommended was disappointing. They dropped us off the ferry terminal steps and they were collecting their tips by going to each passenger with a plastic bag. I would say that the concierge at the club level was much better.2. Room 5\/5: The deluxe room was amazing with a wider range of viewing through wall to wall windows. (not floor to ceiling but I have no complaints, it was enough). There was complimentary water and fruits daily, two robes with slippers, (etemi amenities) sunken bath, weighing scale and butler service. There is no coffee maker so you would have to ask the butler to bring you some. He gives you ice daily and leaves it in the mini bar refrigerator. High tech controls especially for the drapes, turn down service daily. Housekeeping was excellent.3. Restaurants 5\/5 for the lobby lounge, 3\/5 for Nobu. Amazing views and service for the lobby lounge which I would highly recommend. We plan to try harbourside and yan tou heen today so no reviews are available.4. Club access: 5\/5 A must if you use the internet and have frequent small meals a day. Regular rooms will charge 150\/hkd daily. Club lounge has free wifi in the lounge and in your rooms. There were laptops for your use. Food is wonderful (local and international 3x\/day ), service is excellent and there is a view of the harbour. It helps to have a concierge onsite especially since we were there during the typhoon. The hotel continued to run at full strength and they housed their staff overnight. We were pretty impressed. 5. Airport pick up was excellent 5\/5. There were waiting for us with printed easy to read names outside the baggage counter and was whisked to the car (mercedes s ). The driver had water ready and sanitary wipes. He was very professional and answered all our questions. 6. Extras: 5\/5 Gym was great (especially that stretching machine), spa was wonderful (we had a massage during the typhoon). They had eyebrow \/ facial threading, waxing aside from tai na massage and facials. Warm towels were draped over you, private quiet room with professional staff waiting on you.Overall a wonderful experience. We would highly suggest the day city island tour (option of morning or afternoon) by Splendid tours only. They were the professional tour group company we later used. Tips: There is a grocery next door at the mall (selling wine\/saki, sodas, exotic and american groceries), an atm machine which takes usa debit cards(lower floor) and a small eatery in the supermarket with cheap great food (unagi, wonton soup). Avoid the other chinese restaurant near mc donalds unless you want exotic food ( i mistakenly ordered their eel which still had the vertebrae). Starbucks is next door as well as a hair salon.
