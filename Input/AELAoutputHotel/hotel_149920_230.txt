{"text":"Pricey for a ghetto resort We stayed at the San Juan Marriott Resort and Stellaris Casino for one night on our way to the Dominican Republic for spring break. We arrived at 2pm and left the next morning at noon.There is no shuttle service to the hotel, which is probably 20 minutes from the airport. Exiting in the SJ airport, there appears to be a single cab company - or single tourism company that manages the cabs. They are in a little kiosk as soon as you exit the airport and they write up your itinerary (for the cab driver) and tell you the fare. Then you line up and get in a cab when it is your turn. Cab fare to the hotel for 4 of us with 4 suitcases and a golf bag was $18.50USD.The hotel has a tall tower, maybe 20 floors, and then a 4-5 floor high wing (the cabana rooms). We requested a low floor in the tower because we had heard that the tower rooms had been renovated already but the cabana rooms had not. We were put in a tower room on the 18th floor, overlooking the pool and the ocean. The room was nicely decorated and clean, and had a new flat screen tv.The beach in this area has tan\/brown sand. The water is bright blue\/green. The pool at the resort is very nice and has a little water slide and swim up bar. They are obviously trying very hard to be a resort. The problem is that the area surrounding the hotel beachfront is all either graffitied and run-down, or under construction. Maybe eventually it will get cleaned up but we were really not enticed to walk along the beach, for example.This does not stop them from having resort prices. Our room was about $400 for the night (+\/- tax) for a single room with two double beds. Hamburgers at the pool grill were $12, a bottle of corona was $5. The Vista restaurant in the hotel offered a lunch buffet for $22 per person and a breakfast buffet for $17. We did not do either and didn't even check the dinner prices.Out on the street side of the hotel you are within easy walking distance of a starbucks, walgreens, dunkin donuts, wendy's, and subway - in addition to several little local joints. We would only stay here again if we were on our way to somewhere else and this was a stopover for one night. This is not somewhere I'd want to go for my entire vacation.
