{"text":"Simple, clean hotel in excellent location The Bellevue Hotel is a small and simple hotel located 2 minutes walk from Amsterdam Centraal train station and the Damrak, possibly the city's busiest street.We booked a double room and were given room 314 on the 3rd floor. It was a very compact wee room but very clean and the furnishings looked quite new. The bathroom\/shower room was small but functional and included one of those 'open' showers theyre so fond of on the continent - no actual shower fitting, just a curtain in the corner of the bathroom. But like I said it filled it's purpose very well and the water was always hotThe room also included a small working safe and a wall-mounted flatscreen tv which showed around 20 channels, of which around 6 or 7 were in English including major news channels. We didn'y have breakfast at the hotel as it was 10Euro and there are several places on Damrak offering breakfast and drinks for around 6 Euro, but the dining room was always busy so they must lay on a decent spread.The hotels location could not be better. Right at the heart of Amsterdam it is 2 minutes walk from the main train station (which itself is only 20 minutes from Schipol Airport) and 5 minutes from Dam Square where performers and artists were still hard at it even in cold November. The hotel was again only 5 minutes from the red light district and coffee shops, but this whole area is kind of hidden away and if you don't want to be bothered by it you can avoid it easily.All-in-all for the price and location the hotel cannot be beat, and I was pleasantly surprised at the standard of the rooms. OK they are small and the halls look like a hostel but I'd definitely reccomend the Bellevue to most.
