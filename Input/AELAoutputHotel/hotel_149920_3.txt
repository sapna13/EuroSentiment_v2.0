{"text":"A Fun Vacation My husband, 6 year old daughter and I stayed here for 6 nights at the end of December 2008. After some initial annoyances, we could not get into our room until 4:00 pm even though we had requested an early check-in for a 1:00 arrival and the hotel sought to charge us an exhorbitant daily rate for a roll away bed for our daughter (which they did agree to waive since we had no notification of these charges) we had a lovely stay.We booked a city view room at got a corner room with a king size bed (ending in 23) with 2 terraces, one overlooking the city and the other overlooking the ocean. The room was clean, bright and sunny and the housekeeping staff was excellent coming early in the morning and coming back promptly if you we were not ready for them. One night my daughter got sick in our bed around midnight and housekeeping was up in 3 minutes to completely replace our bedding (blankets and all) quickly and efficiently. The pool area is nice with a large wading pool for children about 4 years old and younger with a fountain in the middle and the deeper pool with a water slide. The water slide was open 11-4 most days which was ample time for my daughter to go down at least 25 times a day. The pool was not heated and I was very happy my daughter was occupied so I did not have to stand in the freezing water. The hot tub was nice seating about 8-10 people. Like many resorts with tall high-rises all of the chairs in the pool area are in the shade for at least half of the day. There was at least one activity every day for the kids by the towel stand (hula hoop contest or painting ceramics) which was a nice free activity around lunch. My daughter especially liked the cookie decorating around 2 pm.  The beach was very nice. The water was very warm with a nice blue green carribean color. Although the red flag was up at the hotel every day we were there, we were able to wade in a few feet and not be bothered by the waves. The sand on the beach was clean and because of the ample shade you did not have to rent umbrellas (chairs were provided by the hotel for free). The hotel had pails and shovels for the kids to borrow along with some board games.  We only had breakfast in the hotel once and it was your typical large Marriot buffet, it was nice to sit outside in a screened in dining area and look out at the ocean. We usually had breakfast at Danny's down the block who made excellent pancakes and eggs for breakfast and pizza for lunch and dinner. We also enjoyed the Chinese\/Japanese restaurant in the hotel which has upscale Chinese food, a sushi bar and hibatchi tables. There is plenty of fast food within walking distance, Starbucks, Haagen Daz and a gelato store (Pia Bella) directly across the street and Dunkin Donuts, Baskin Robbins, Subway and Wendys within 3 blocks. There is a significant homeless problem in the area and it was not unusal to see a half a dozen homeless people sitting on the streets with cups out in front of stores. None of them were intrusive or menacing.  We rented a car one day to drive to El Yunke (the rain forest) and found out that the guided tours there were not offered on Monday or Tuesday but at the information center we were given excellent maps and truly enjoyed driving up to the tower and water falls. It is truly magnificent. On the way back we stopped at a large indoor outlet mall that included stores like Polo, Guess, Nautica and Gap. Overall we had an excellent time and would certainly consider staying here again.
