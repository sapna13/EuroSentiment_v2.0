{"text":"Fabulous beach terrible food Stayed in June 2006. First of all anyone thinking of booking with Thomsons be aware that the flight is very cramped with old planes. I have had more legroom on short flights in Europe. Secondly all Thomsons reps at this resort are useless and all they are interested in doing is selling you trips. My advice is buy them through the hotel as cheaper and the hotel staff get commission.The resort is beautiful, the beach one of the finest I have ever seen and I have travelled quite a bit. It trully is paradise. Plenty of sunbeds and shade and the sea is divine. The grounds in the hotel are kep very well it looks lovely.The hotel itself I have mixed feelings about. The room was quite nice very clean and well air conditioned. Leave your maid a tip they work very hard. The food is bland samey and I was ill quite a few times. Never before has this happened to me on holiday before. I was very careful about not drinking the water (I did not even clean my teeth in it) so it must have been the food that gave me such violent sickness etc. The speciality restaurants are not that great to be honest.The staff are lovely so friendly and nice they made me smile all day long.The palace next door was great by all accounts. My advice would be go to that resort as it's lovely but don't stay at the bambu. ","annotations":[]}
