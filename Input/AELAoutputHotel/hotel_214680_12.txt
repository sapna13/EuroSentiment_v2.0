{"text":"Great Location, Great Staff! We booked 2 rooms for our parent's 50th wedding anniversary and my husband's 50th birthday. We really were excited about the location of Park Shore Waikiki, right across the street from the beach, with shopping all around, the zoo across the street, the aquarium next door, etc.The lobby of the hotel is very welcoming, with comfy couches to sit on and cool space to enjoy the beautiful palm trees and flowers all around the hotel. The staff are very friendly and were quick to help us find information and make recommendations for shopping, etc. There is an ABC convenience store on the beach side of the lobby, where you can buy great Kona coffee, souvenirs, and anything you might need. There is a great bar and grill, Lulu√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, on the 2nd floor of the hotel.We did stop by the pool and it looked clean and inviting. You can lounge on chaise lounges while watching the beach activities, that is how close this hotel is to the beach. The rooms we booked were clean, spacious, and right where we needed them. We have to tell you about the wonderful Guest Relations Director, Ms. Leonor Wong. Leonor is absolutely the greatest! She welcomed our family and made us feel right at home. She went over and above to help us find boxes to mail all of our goodies back to the mainland, and she helped us gain access to office space when we had a critical deadline. She is amazing! Spending time with her made our trip to Hawaii complete : )The rooms in the hotel are the same as many of the hotels on the main strip of Waikiki, quaint and clean. Almost all of the hotel rooms on the main drag were built very long ago and you will find peeling wallpaper here and there, etc, but that is about anywhere you find in this area. We were introduced to the manager of the hotel, and he was very genuine and welcoming too.We mostly used this room to sleep and shower, and for the price, you are getting a really great deal. I would heartily recommend this hotel and I hope to return as soon as we can!
