{"text":"Good place to stay Stayed here for 2 nights. We were offered a quiet room or a room on the Gran Via. Initially chose quiet room, but it had an internal window, and was dark and (I found) rather gloomy. So we opted for the Gran Via facing room, which was light, bright and a treat. Yes, there is much street noise (especially at odd rush hours), but the sound insulation when door to tiny balcony is closed is pretty good. First night I was aware of it, but second night it didn't bother me at all. Room was a decent size for a city hotel, spacious layout in entrance way which gave it a comfortable and roomy feel, small loveseat type sofa with ottoman to rest legs, nice flat screen tv. Bathroom large and well appointed. All spotlessly clean. I used the computers in the Library lounge area in basement - free access and useful to have. We used the spa for the hot-tub - atmospheric low lighting with candles around the place and soothing mood music playing (actually better than that sounds!). We used the bar for morning coffee and drinks - smokey (of course), but not overly expensive. On the recommendation of other posters here, I used the cafe opposite for breakfast - basic, but convenient and inexpensive. Great location - easy walk to Prado, Thyssen Bornemizsa, Botanic Garden etc. I found reception staff helpful - small reception area, but they did their best to move people through smoothly. I can imagine it would get tricky if more than 3\/4 people were trying to check in\/out at any one time. They helped me with stamps, mailing cards and even deciphering my (purchased for the trip) cell phone. Would definitely use this hotel again when visiting Madrid.
