{"text":"Exceeded our High Standards! I am not one to write reviews about anything but I feel obligated to in this case. My wife and I have stayed in Ritz Carlton's, the Venetian in Las Vegas, and other high-end resorts. This was the nicest resort we have ever been to. I won't repeat all of the same info that others have but here are a few tips for people that are okay spending a few extra bucks to make the vacation perfect...1) Excellence Club - The people that choose this option love it and the people that don't say it isn't worth it. We chose it and loved it. The biggest benefit is that there are always plenty of chairs on the beach and pool. If you aren't in excellence club, you may have to wake up early to get a good spot. Also, you get access to an actual club that gives you free food and drinks whenever you want and good, reliable, free internet. To us, it was nice to be able to check email or grab a quick snack without walking all the way to the restaurants. We also got large flat-screen plasma TV's and we heard that other rooms had regular 19 tv's. 2) Casino - We booked this resort because we like to gamble. They apparently sent out a note to all travel agents that the casino is closed for construction. Cheapcaribbean.com never told us about it. As it turns out, the inside secret is that when they aren't busy, they close the casino and shuttle you next door to the Sirenis resort to use their casino. We were disappointed at first but it wasn't a big deal to take their shuttle. It is about two minutes away. There is no telling when they will re-open. You get a different answer from everyone you ask. 3) Safety - Not an issue. Everything is guarded very well and your safety is not an issue. 4) Airport Transfers - It takes about an hour and 15 minutes if you go direct from the airport to the resort. Most shuttles seemed to stop at multiple hotels. It is kind of a drag. If you have some money, we found out that a lot of people use a service called Helidosa to take a hellicopter from the airport directly to the hotel. You get a scenic tour of the island and you get to your resort in 15 minutes. It was about $200 each way. 5) Food - Very few things blew us away as the best we had ever eaten but very few things weren't good either. We were really happy with the food in general. 6) Room types - You may want to request a certain floor to be on. There are three floors throughout the property. The first floor is right at the pool. You may like that. You have no privacy at all. I suggest a second floor room if you can get it. 7) Sports bar - This is more of a bar that you can play sports at than it is a sports bar. There are two TV's. The network stations are mostly out of Denver. This resort is a great value and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quiet, romantic place to get away. It is full of honeymooners.
