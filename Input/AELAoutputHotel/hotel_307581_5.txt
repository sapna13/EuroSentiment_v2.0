{"text":"Under rated Hotel Having never been to Bali before, our travel agent here in NZ booked my friend and I in for 13 nights to the Hotel.The hotel was big and catered for about 200 people.Location was only about 20 mins from all the action of Kuta Beach, but far enough away to be nice and peaceful.Very handy to heaps of local shops and wee bars and eating places.Breakfasts were absolutely fantastic, you couldn't have asked for any better way to start your day on holiday. Fully cooked choices to die for, and fresh bread and pastries and so much choice.Our accomodation was in one of the older parts of the Hotel, as we shared a twin room in the older accomodation block with a balcony too.The showers were good though, and the room adequate, but apart from this, this was our only recommendation we could make .Perhaps the bathrooms could be updated as they seemed to be more in the 80's style.The swimming pools were excellent, clean, pristine and the service at the Hotel was very good.The Bar area was beside the main swimming pool, and a proper Barrista could have assisted but the service all round the Hotel was great, friendly, and very helpful.We had different massage treatments and the women were really lovely and the price wasn't bad either.My friend and I did The Indonesian Cooking Class at the Hotel, it was fun and really worthwhile and I learnt a lot about Indonesian Cooking, do try it, after learning to cook a 4 course lunch, the Chef was fun, served it back to us tarted up and what a meal,fantastic.All in all well worth staying there and I felt that previous reviews didn't really do the Hotel justice ","annotations":[{"endOffset":520,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":515},{"endOffset":533,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":525}]}
