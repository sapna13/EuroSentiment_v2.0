{"text":"Run Down...Go Elsewhere I'd give this a 1 star rating, but there were some pluses. My room did overlook the ocean, which was great. The view was awesome. And the beach access couldn't be easier. That's about it for pluses. You could get both of those (ocean view and beach access) at MUCH better hotels closer to the action of South Beach. I echo what the last reviewer said as he was dead on. The rooms do look like a grandma decorated them. Everything in the room looks old. He's right, stained comforters, carpet and chairs made me not want to even sit down. Again, to echo what the last reviewer said, if you value cleanliness and comfort in a hotel room, don't stay here! It is misleading because the web site makes it look like a posh hotel, and it's anything but. The toilet barely worked...Had to press it a couple of times before it flushed, and my phone didn't work at all. The one near my bed wasn't even plugged in, and it could not be because there was no jack. Nice prop. The one in the bathroom could receive calls, but you couldn't dial out because the number were broken. The room and closets smelled of mildew, and the location was not the best. It's about a 10 min drive from where you want to be in South Beach. Pool is nice, but you loose sun at about 3pm because the hotels block it out. Front staff is very unfriendly unless you speak Spanish. I had problems with my bill all weekend, and I had to keep going down there so they'd fix it. They were rude even though they were in the wrong. Way too expensive for what you're getting. Trust me, it's and old and worn out hotel. There are heaps more hotels to stay at that are better in South Beach.
