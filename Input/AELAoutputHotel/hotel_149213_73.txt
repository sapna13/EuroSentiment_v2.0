{"text":"Good time had by all: Stayed there 3\/18 to 3\/23. After reading all the reviews for the past 3 months I felt like I already knew everything there was to know. I don't understand how 2 different people were there the same time and had totaly different reviews. The long and short of it is this: Yes everything is included, but when you see the same people serving you for breakfest, lunch  dinner, put your hand in your pocket and leave them $2 or $3. They work HARD. Slow but hard. Its their country and thats the way they work, very slow. Isn't that what vacations all about, taking it slow.Food: ok who are you kidding, Italian restaurant is a step above Olive Garden, not saying much, but hey I'm Italian.Mexican: I sent the first thing back and got chicken, it was good.Deserts were good too. Air conditioned real building, not a hut.Steak: Again, step above Boulder Creek, good, not great but good. Beware of the seafood restaurant on the beach, only serves lunch. Shrimp not only have to be peeled but also take off their heads. yuk..... never made it to the Spanish Restaurant.Our room was in Block 2. Only complaint was the beds are hard. Very quiet until my boys were around. Vinny and John make a lot of friends, sorry to the people that they woke up. They had a ball. No bed bugs, no bad smells, furniture was not old, paint was not peeling. The maid was scrubing down our tub with bleech and the tile floor was just washed when we came back from breakfast. I left her little goodies everyday in a gift bad on the bed. I left goodies for the person that stocked our refridgerator. Its the right thing to do. When you go on a cruise, they give you envelopes the night before you get off for the tips for eveyone. Same idea, you pre paid everything right? So tip! ","annotations":[]}
