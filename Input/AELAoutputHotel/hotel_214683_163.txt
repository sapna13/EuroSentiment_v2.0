{"text":"Nice place and it's Honolulu People want to complain about the noise on Honolulu\/Waikiki area. Sorry but you are in the city. If you want to get away from the touristy Hawaii go to the big island or Kaui. Or just stay at the Trutle Bay Resort on the north shore (where we just came from before checking in at the Marriott for my wife's meeting...see my review on the Turtle Bay Resort). We have stayed in Waikiki many times and this is the first time we stayed at the Marriott. The lobby is very nice. We self parked the car and if their is no space they will valet the car for you for the self park price. Bad thing about this is that they don't know when it fills up so you have to find out for yourself then circle around to the front to tell them. We switched to valet parking on our third day of our stay and we were charged self parking throughout our whole stay. The pools are ok but hey you have Waikiki right across the street. It is right across the beach, I don't know what another poster is talking about when he said it's a block away. Waikiki is a long beach, so maybe he was talking about the center of the beach where it is very crowded. Here is my secret, go in front of the Royal Hawaiian Hotel (pink hotel) near their reef, go out past the reef and just hang out....sooner or later a turtle or two will be swimming next to you. Don't handle them...it's illegal. I always go to this spot and turtles are there all the time. It does get rocky out there so get some water shoes and you can buy at the ABC stores. Waikiki is not that deep you can actually walk about two hundred yards out. That's why no sharks are out there...it's too shallow. But if you wanna see Sharks check out my shark encounter review I did in 2006. Back to the Marriott, we ate at the Kuhio grill for their dinner buffett. If you wanna catch up on your sports, you can head up to the bar up on the second floor near the pool. I still don't get why people order Budweiser when your in Hawaii....try a Mai Tai. The beds are to die for. My daughter didn't want to go in the portable crib they set up for us. She loved the bed. I used to think the Bed at the Palms in Vegas was the best until I slept on these. Yes there are other places to stay in Waikiki Honolulu area just try them all. I rate a 4 and I would stay here again but I would try other places just like trying another other hotes in Vegas. One more thing to add is, if you want to buy souvineirs there are some at Walmart behind Ala Moana mall or get them at the Aloha Bowl swap meet on Wed, Sat and Sun. The prices are must cheaper at these places. Aloha!
