{"text":"Guard Your Belongings!! We spent two weeks Feb 3--17 at this resort. We booked first week with our two daughters and their families at Golden, second week at Ambar. We paid for the entire family as a gift to them--over $20K in total.Things got nasty two hours after arrival when we were attempting to get our room in the same building as the rest of our family. (We had specifically asked for this well in advance of our trip there)While in the Golden Concierge office arranging the room switch, my purse was snatched from a table right beside me! Both passports, all my personal ID, credit cards, and a large sum of cash------GONE !! What a frightening situation for us.At first, neither the Hotel Concierges nor our tour representative(Apple Tours) believed us. We were quickly brushed off with comments like Your fault, not ours, the Hotel never has this problem, plus You should not expect any help from us, etc, etc.It was like they just wanted us to go away!!It took two days to get someone's attention---after considerable pleading, the next day we were assigned a Concierge to help us.The Hotel finally helped us get to a Policia Nationale station to make a report, and arranged to get us to the Canadian Embassy in Santo Domingo to get temporary passports, otherwise we would not have been able to leave the country!! Just the trip to Santo Domingo required one entire day because it's 4 hours away!!By the 5th day of our vacation, we managed to get the temporary passports, have money wired to us, etc, so almost half of or vacation was ruined making all these arrangements.The final week at Ambar wasn't without its problems either! (Seems like we were jinxed!)When we transferred to our Ambar suite, the patio door couldn't be opened or closed because it was broken; the air conditioner didn't work because it is linked electrically with the patio door, the safe was broken and had to be taken apart to be repaired; and last but not least, one evening some pipes burst in the bathroom ceiling and there was an incredible flood. (We had to wait until thaty midnight while the ceiling was being dismantled and pipes were fixed!!So our vacation turned out to be just one disaster after another!We did learn, however, that this Hotel and most others have a serious theft problem, but they don't make it known and won't admit it when it happens---and we learned from a good many others who had things stolen---cameras, Ipods, clothing, money, etc. The airport is apparently particularly bad because baggage handling is quite hapahazard, and it's not uncommon to learn that baggage has been opened either on arrival or on departure.Other than a systemic problem with theft, and the issues we had with ours, the resort has its good and bad points just like other similar resorts.Grounds, beach, and pools are well kept, restaurants are quite nice, rooms are accommodatiing, and many staff really do make an effort to provide good service. There is an abundent food choice, and the food is reasonably good in most restaurants.On the downside, this resort is huge, and with about 6000 guests on site at any given time, lineups and crowding are typical situations.Getting a shady spot at pools or at the beach can be challenging because people reserve them early. We actually witnessed a few heated confrontations over shady spots!All in all, the sheer size of this resort is, in our opinion, its weakest point. We liken it to what we call Mass produced vacationism.If you don't mind the crowds, lineups, and lack of quiet\/privacy, and just nice weather and sun is your thing, go for it.That said, if you are looking for a safe and relaxing vacation, with a more personal and intimate environment, this kind of resort isn't for you!
