{"text":"cool and chic but missing a little something We stayed at the Clift hotel at the end of our road trip around California. On arrival we were greeted by friendly door staff and a competent reception. When you walk into the lobby of the hotel it is very impressive and gives the impression of a chic trendy hotel.We stayed in a delux room on the 6th floor of the hotel. This gave us a slightly larger room and more storage space than a standard room. The room its self is nicely designed with a very comfortable bed. However it did let its self down on the final touches with a tv cabinet that didnt fit the style and tiny t.v, the bedside tables also were a little worn. The hotel its self is a few minutes walk from union square and is in an excellent location. I note from previous posts that people felt unsafe the area, I have to say we never had any problems what so ever.The hotel bar appears to be very popular and is very busy on a weekend and also quite pricey! However its a cool place to get a drink before you go out.Be warned that you may have to show your room card to gain entry to the hotel of a night and they appeared quite strict about this. They could do with a seperate guest entry.Overall this hotel would suit people who enjoy staying at modern contemporary hotels, however at times it does feel that style is placed over substance here.
