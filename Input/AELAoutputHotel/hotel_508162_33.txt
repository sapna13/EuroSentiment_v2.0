{"text":"Two weeks of heaven! My husband and I stayed at Dreams from the 31st Oct to 14th Nov and I can honestly say it was the best holiday we ever had. Despite a long delay in charles de gaulle airport from the moment we arrived we were struck by the welcome we received and the friendliness and efficency of the check in staff. The road from the airportbis bad but our driver really avoided the worst parts.Our room was in block 3 and was spotlessly clean and well equipped. we were on the 2nd floor with a pool view,. It was my husbands birthday and we had chilled champagne and fruit waiting for us. The room had a kingsize bed and there was plenty of pillows etc. Our maid was lovely and we had turndown service each night with chocolates and soft music to welcome us.We ate at all the restaurents except the Oceania as neither of us are seafood lovers. We found the buffet great for lunch and found the soups lovely and with a freshly made sandwich it was enough for midday. The breakfasts were great with eggs every way you could think of and plenty of bacon, juices, smoothies etc. We enjoyed freshly carved turkey, chicken, roast lamb, beef and pork. our only complaint was that they cooked the potatoes al dente like other veg. There was a huge variety and you would have to be really picky not to find something you liked. I think it is a shame that people dont watch their children at buffets as a did observe them handling food and putting it back down. I work at catering so I am very concious of food hygiene regulations and i couldn't find anything to complain about in relation to the food and believe me I would kick up a fuss if the standards were not good. Neither of us had any tummy probs. In relation to service in the bars etc it was not as fast as at home but then you are on holiday so whats the rush. Most of the time our drinks were replenished without us asking and that was tipping and not tipping. The entertainment team were great fun and work their socks of. The spa is a bit expensive I thought, but wow the massages fantastic. The beach was lovely and we spent every afternoon on it when we were not on trips and we followed advise and kept left, no rocks at all. We did see the litter outside the hotels bounderies and that is a pity.Our rep for cocoa tours was great and organised anything we wanted. Our laundery was returned to our rooms within 24 hours however they were a bit to liberal with the starch I thought!We found the other guests to be friendly and only witnessed a few episodes of float stashers. We saw one huge spider for the whole two weeks and this was quickly disposed of by the gardener. We did get a good few bites so dont forget to be generous with the sprays. also the sun is soo strong and you will burn even when its overcast.The resort we could not find fault with, the staff were brillant and we would go back tomorrow. If I was to do anything differently I would avoid Charles de Gaulle airport and Air France. The airport is dirty everthing closed up at 4.00pm and I never experienced such rude and unhelpfull staff. This was our experience on both the outward and return journey.Do look forward to your holiday if you have booked Dreams and relax and have a great time. I know we did and any of the guests we spoke with said the same.
