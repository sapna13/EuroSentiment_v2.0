{"text":"Amazing We stayed here for 2 nights as a stop over on the way back from Australia and it was possibly the best hotel experience I have ever had in my life. We arrived at about 10pm, looking tired and scruffy after a delayed flight from Brisbane but were treated like royalty from the minute we entered the hotel. We were amazed and delighted to find that we had been upgraded from a harbour view room to an executive harbout view suite! We were taken to our room to check in and were stunned by the amazing views of the harbour from the floor to ceiling windows that ran the entire length of our room. Having completed check in, and on deciding to upgrade to be able to use the hotel's club facilities (very reasonable but more of that later) - our welcome tea, fresh fruit and water was delivered. It was only once the staff had left that we were able to explore, yes it was that big, our suite. There was an enourmous bathroom with walkin shower, spa bath, separate toilet and 2 sinks and a dressing area, The bed was enourmous and incredibly comfortable in within the same room there was a lounge area and desk. It was simply the biggest hotel room that I have ever seen. The view was fantastic and we watched the Symphony of Lights from our room one night. As I said previously, we paid to use the Club facilities which entitled us to breakfast, afternoon tea and evening canapes and drinks in the Club lounge. The food in the Club was excellent, a good range of both Western and Eastern options and pretty much everything we tried tasted delicious. The staff in the Club were attentive without being intrustive and seemed genuinely friendly and happy to serve you. We had champagne in the Club one night and our glasses were topped up almost the instant that we had finished! As we'd eaten in the Club we didn't need to eat in any of the restaurants in the hotel but we did have drinks in the lobby bar - the views were stunning and the service good as well. The location of the hotel can't be faulted - close to the Star Ferry, Nathan Road, MRT etc.Overall we had a fantastic stay, we just couldn't fault the place at all. If you're coming to Hong Kong and can afford it, stay here, it is worth the extra and you won't be disappointed.
