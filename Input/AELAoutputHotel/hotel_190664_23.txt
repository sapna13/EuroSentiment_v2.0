{"text":"luxurious and overlooked The Regent, Berlin, used to be the Four Seasons. Four Seasons obviously has a much more recognized name. We stayed in this hotel when it was the Four Seasons and loved it then. On this trip back to Berlin, we were a little concerned because of the name change, even though Four Seasons owns Regent, I believe. The name change seemed like a downgrade. In addition, with all the other deluxe hotels in Berlin, like the Adlon, where Michael Jackson stayed (and dangled his baby off the balcony), the Regent seemed almost second rate. We got a terrific rate-- unexpectedly reasonable, especially considering what other deluxe properties were asking.What a delight. The Regent is beautiful, elegant and has SUPERB service-- attentive and polite, no whiff of condescension, even when I asked one afternoon re dinner at their Michelin one star restaurantdressed in a Tshirt and jeans. Rather, the maitre'd, a day later when we were seated, told me, very endearingly, that she hadn't expectedto see me return.This is a truly wonderful hotel, in a wonderful location only a blockfrom Unter den Linden, a few blocks from the Brandenburg Gate and Museum Island, with some of Berlin's best restaurants within a few blocks. Try Vau, with 2 Michelin stars, only across the beautiful Gendamenmarkt Square. They have outdoor seating in the courtyard and are very reasonable for lunch. The outdoor restaurants in the square are also reasonably good and less touristy than you might expect.I have stayed in numerous other hotels in Berlin -- the Ritz-Carlton,the Grand Hyatt, the Bristol Kempinski. This is the best of the ones I've stayed in.
