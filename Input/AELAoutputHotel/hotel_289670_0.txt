{"text":"Excellent -- beyond expectations I was very impressed with this hotel. Not only was everything fabulous (it was also a real bargain), it was obvious that they really, really care about keeping their clients happy. As an example, when I arrived and asked about the indoor pool for my two young children, I was very disappointed to find out that it is only for the use of those over 16. Without my prompting, the receptionist took it upon herself to find a public pool nearby, called to get the opening times and prices, and printed out a map for me. (It was only about five minutes away, and is a very nice, clean facility.)The room itself was very comfortable, and everything was clean and in good shape. The breakfast was very good, with an excellent view of the city. I also ate their for dinner, and the cuisine was absolute top quality. There is also another very good restaurant right next door (Club Paella Peixenet (sp?)), which I highly recommend.The only potential drawbacks I see are the following. 1.Location: it is somewhat far from the center, and those visiting Barcelona for the first time might prefer to be closer to the Barri Gotic\/La Rambla, etc. I did not mind the location, however, which is not far from the Placa Espanya, and right between two metro stops. 2. Noise: one reviewer recommended taking a less expensive room on a lower floor, since the view from the restaurant is what is most impressive. However, I actually got upgraded to an executive room, which was on a lower (sixth) floor, which can be pretty noisy at night time. This didn't bother me too much, but might be a problem for light sleepers.Highly recommended.
