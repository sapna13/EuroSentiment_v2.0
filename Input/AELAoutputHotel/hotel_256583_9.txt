{"text":"Not terrible but not great I booked this last minute based on location and price and was expecting it to be not as good as the brilliant place I had been in. I was right. The check in was great and they were incredibly helpful at getting me into a room early.The room smelt of smoke although they assured me it was non-smoking etc. I ended up with a little machine blasting on all day to clear the smell which it did,alongside opening the balcony door.It felt a bit jaded, furnishings, the bathroom with two plugs that fitted neither bath nor sink although it had a big bath which was nice...well would have been if I could have had one!Kitchen was teeny tiny and barely lit although had pretty much everything I needed for a couple of nights.No laundry facility in room.It was lovely to have a balcony and a good view over the cityNo ethernet cable and a $50 deposit for a very short one - wonder where they buy theirs form as I bought a 3m one from Dick Smith for under $20!, The internet kept dropping out due to some recurring technical issue. Not very impressive if you're trying to conduct meetings online. Still it was fixed relatively quickly, couple of hours, Lifts were very slow and seemed to stop at every floor and the lift access card didnt work once which was a little nerve wracking.It was very clean and house keeping were friendly and helpful. Shouldn't have been disappointed I suppose, but I was.
