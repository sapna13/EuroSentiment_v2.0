{"text":"Superb location I stayed at the Affinia Dumont with my 2 grown up kids for 3 nights in December. We were doing a whistle stop Christmas shopping  sight seeing trip  booked this hotel on the back of reviews on Trip Advisor. And we were certainly not disappointed.Firstly it is in a magnificent location, Macys is 8 mins walk away (I timed it!!) Empire State Building about 6 mins  about 15 mins walk to Time Square. There are several nice bars  restaurants close to the hotel. The Barking Dog which is attached to the hotel is a great place for a late afternoon, post shopping beer! We ate in here also  the food was great  not expensive. We also used Blockheads - a mexican restautrant close to the hotel - the food was great here too  really cheap.The staff in the hotel could not do more for you if they tried. Sadly my son was taken ill when we were there (we thought he was having a heart attack), whilst we were waiting for 911, they sent a CPR trained member of staff up to help  2 other staff to calm me down! No hotel could have done more  I will always be truly grateful to them for that. It turned out on our return to the UK that my son had a collapsed lung - so I cannot be so complimentary about 911 service that said he had pulled a muscle!The rooms in this hotel are massive  spotlessly clean  the beds just waht you need after a hard day around NYC.If or should I say when I go back to NY I will definitely stay in this hotel. No question.
