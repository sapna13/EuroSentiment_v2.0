{"text":"Unhappy at RIU Bambu!!! This was our first trip to the Dominican Republic and prior to had heard nothing but good things about Punta Cana. We stayed at Riu Bamboo for 6 days. This resort is rated with 5-stars however; our experience was more around 1-2 stars. We experienced problems with communication, bugs, professionalism and service. We found that the majority of staff - front desk personnel, room service, and entertainment staff was either not bilingual or fluent in English. We had so much difficulty communicating at this resort that we felt isolated. This was a huge problem for us since we are social and always get involved in resort activities with the entertainment staff on vacations. It was ironic that we were approached by three entertainers on Monday, the day before we left, asking if we had just arrived when we had been there since Thursday and had been very visible going to shows and walking by them many times a day. They had never noticed us even for a brief time when we were one of two couples of color walking the grounds. We also could not communicate our needs to the room service staff at all because they understood nor spoke any English. We did not have face towels to bathe with. They had to be requested. Our room was to come equipped with an iron\/board and it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. The iron arrived within hours of my request but it took me 3 requests, 2 face-to-face, within a 28 hour span before an ironing board arrived. By the way I didn't wait for them; I took one from an unoccupied room because I was tired of asking for one having already been told that I had received an iron and adapter. With regard to outlets, they are limited. We had 2 outlets of which only 1 receptable on each was available. In our room, one of those receptables was broken and the ungrounded adapter provided by the hotel did not work with all appliances.The next problem was with bugs. We had small bugs running across out night stands and bugs traveling through holes in the wall area of the bathtub. The last straw on our last night was the cockroach crawling on the bathroom counter. With regard to our experience with the lack of professionalism from some affiliated personnel, we scheduled a photo session directly with a photographer only to be stood up by him. We eventually went to the photography store where they work and hang-out and were told that our photographer was on the beach and there was no one to help us. We continued to ask if there was someone available who could take over as we were going to make a big purchase. We got frustrated because the lady working the counter was not fluent in English so she would have to defer to other photographers who seemed to ignore our urgency as we were leaving the country the following day. Finally after much persistence, someone agreed to photograph us. By the way, the other photographer showed up at the store and did acknowledge us or apologize.Please note that this resort only has 4-5 channels in English. A couple of channels have programming that varies between Spanish and English programs. We wanted to watch ESPN and found that this resort does not have this channel not even at the new Riu Palace√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sport√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ bar which means that you will need to find out about their √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºatellite√à√\u2020\u2022?TV.In general, we found it difficult to converse with the locals to learn more about them, their country, their products\/goods etc. As a result of this experience, my husband does not want visit the Dominican Republic again even though we met other U.S. couples whose experiences were 180 degrees opposite such as being accommodated and upgraded, receiving excellent service from everyone and being offered Spanish lessons, horseback riding and cooking lessons for FREE to name a few.
