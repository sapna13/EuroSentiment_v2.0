{"text":"Christmas at George V This is clearly a world-class hotel with prices to match. I spent Christmas here with my mother (we chose Paris as she lives in France and I live in the UK) and overall it was a lovely experience. We booked the Six Senses Package for 3 nights which turned out to be very good value (Superior room, daily breakfast, 3 course dinner at La Galerie each evening and a one-hour daily spa treatment each). It was no more expensive to stay there over Christmas than at any other time of year it seemed which was refreshing given the cost of top UK hotels during the festive period.The room was beautiful and spacious. Only one vanity unit in the bathroom but a separate bath and shower so plenty of space there too. Bulgari toiletries and pretty much every amenity that you can think of (except a coffee maker which you rarely seem to get in top hotels these days). Good entertainment system but very limited choice of DVDs and our dealings with the Business Center on this front were a bit hit and miss. Housekeeping was a different story - it operated like clockwork and the room was turned around very quickly each day and was always fully serviced when we returned from breakfast.Breakfast in Le Cinq was wonderful, the spa was lovely (good therapists, complimentary herbal teas, coffee and fruit, although arrive in your robe as the locker room is small), and the staff at the hotel work very hard to remember your name and make you feel special. Dinner at La Galerie was ok, but I wouldn't have eaten there more than once if dinner hadn't been included in our package (the food was very pricey for what it was - approx. 275Euros for a 3 course meal for 2 people without wine - and it's less of a restaurant, more of a corridor lounge, with very low uncomfortable chairs). It was also cold in La Galerie every evening due to the draughts coming through the courtyard doors. Having said that, they had live music every night (different types so we never got bored) and it had a nice atmosphere. We also had afternoon tea in La Galerie one afternoon and that was suprisingly reasonable. The hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas and overall it was a lovely stay. The staff and the decor make it feel special rather than the facilities or the dining in my opinion. However, I stayed at the Peninsula in Hong Kong earlier in the year and enjoyed that more.We had one issue on checkout. To begin with I was presented with a bill for the package plus all of the included items as additional charges. I asked for these to be removed and the mistake was quickly rectified, although I was informed that dinner in La Galerie was only included up to the value of 80 Euros per person. I told the cashier that this was not reflected on the website, the booking confirmation, or on pre-arrival correspondence and that we had even checked in person with reception on our arrival and had not been informed of the limit then either. The cashier insisted on charging me for dinner each evening over and above the 80 Euros per person and I decided not to argue. However, my mother had a different view and took this up with reception before our departure. They discovered that the French version of the website and package clearly states the 80 Euro limit, but the English version does not. This is something to be aware of if you are booked on the Six Senses package. Reception agreed to request a refund to my card but could not do it there and then for some reason. However, the additional amount was refunded to my card and a credit receipt sent to my home address within a few days of departure.
