{"text":"yokoso, nippon! limo buses from narita usually drop you off in front of the hotel you're staying, but not to the star hotel. the closest drop off spot is at a mall so prepare to walk through a mass of human traffic, 5 intersections, downhill sidewalk, and 50 pachinko parlors that wreak of cigarette smoke. if you have a ton of luggage -- good luck! it was harder for me going back to the pick-up spot to go back to the airport on my return home. went crazy shopping for japanese goods.the hotel -- expect to smell cigarette smoke even if you're in a non-smoking room. even at the lobby, guests are allowed to smoke! what a turn off! the elevators are narrow and the entry way to the room is shoulder-width! you face right and there's the bath and shower. the bed touches the corner and 2 walls, so dont expect to be doing any cartwheels.window opens a bit, but all you can hear is traffic. for the little bit of space, i thought it was a bit pricey. but, i think it was the location of the hotel. you're basically in the middle of it all -- a stone's throw away from kabukicho, the red light district. even the metro\/tram stations are nearby. shops as far as your eyes can see. a mcdonalds for breakfast, but i usually visit the tiny bistro downstairs that serve breakfast\/snacks\/cold drinks. staff was super friendly and bilingual -- though i had to give directions to a couple visiting from the states as i headed out. basically -- a place to sleep and shower with a small tv box, where your knees touch the chair for the dresser if you sit on the edge of the bed. i stayed in a standard room for one, so i'm not sure how big the other rooms are and how pricey.i'd stay elsewhere next time just because i want my limo shuttle to drop me off in front of the hotel rather than walking!
