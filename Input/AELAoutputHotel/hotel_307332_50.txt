{"text":"Nice rooms with all a great bathroom and location. The previous posters reviews are very accurate. My wife and I found the rooms to be larger than we thought they would be especially for Tokyo. The bathrooms have seperate tubs and showers. The tubs are very large, nice to soak in after a day around Tokyo. The concierge was incredible, they set up dinner reservations for us and was very helpful with all the questions that we had. We returned from dinner one night and found an envelope placed under our door with the dinner reservation confirmations along with detailed street maps, directions and even detailed subway directions, connections and even subway fare prices to our restaurants. The hotel offers a number of restaurants but the prices seemed to be on the high side. If you exit the east side of the hotel (the side facing the SunKus convenience store) take a left and then a right at the first access under the train tracks you will be headed toward Ginza. After passing under the tracks take your first left and it will put you on a small street that is filled with restaurants. As you walk up this street it is restaurant after restaurant. We went to this street just about every night. Most have menus with pictures posted outside and many have English menus if requested. The price ranges can be anywhere from about $10 per person (noodle bowls) to $50+ per person if you want to spend that. One night we ate at a place that offered small plates of things (like Tapas) and had a couple of cold sakes and our bill was less than $45 for 2 people. We were stuffed and even had dessert. You can eat in Ginza for a reasonable price, just look for where the locals are going. The attention to detail is what made our stay there so nice. We returned to Dai Ichi Tokyo for our last 2 nights in Japan from Kyoto and there was even a nice note in our rooms welcoming us back along with a small orchid. We couldn't believe that they would remember us. Each morning daily newspapers are hanging on the door outside the rooms, in room TV's have a few stations in English including CNN. A nice way to stay connected.There are internet computers available in the lobby but for a fee of 540 yen per 30 minutes (about $4.69). Expensive but a way to check e-mails if needed. The yukatas in the rooms along with bathrobes are nice for lounging after a bath or shower. We got a great rate on an internet site, cheaper than booking on the Dai Ichi site directly. Don't know if I can mention the site or not but just do a search on the major sites because the discounted rate seemed to be about the same.JonAtlanta, Georgia ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":1486,"mention":"Tapas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tapas"],"startOffset":1481},{"endOffset":1486,"mention":"Tapas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tapas"],"startOffset":1481},{"endOffset":1847,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1843},{"endOffset":2098,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2094},{"endOffset":2098,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2094},{"endOffset":2098,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2094},{"endOffset":2098,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2094}]}
