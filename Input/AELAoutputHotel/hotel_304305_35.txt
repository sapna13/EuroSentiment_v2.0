{"text":"where's the pool??? We stayed at the Keio Plaza the first week of August. We had chosen this hotel because of the location and the pool looked great too. Upon arrival our room wasn't ready but we were upgraded from a deluxe room to a Premier room-great customer service. When we asked about the pool we were informed that it was closed which was a great disappointment-the website doesn't state this so that's 'a bit naughty'.The check in staff are friendly and the concierge is keen to help. Housekeeping are very efficient. The only let down was the Polestar bar-AVOID!!!! On the last night we went there for a drink. We were completely ignored by the staff. It took 15 minutes for someone to bring a menu, another 15 minutes for someone to take an order. We then waited for another 15 minutes or so before our drinks arrived; I was ready to walk out at this stage...We weren't offered seats at the bar-seats with great views-yet there were seats available. We were completely ignored yet a guy sleeping at the bar was getting quite a bit of attention. We both really felt that we weren't wanted in the Polestar bar; the staff looked after the Japanese guests but we, 2 western women were not treated very nicely...Oh and then we had to wait for another 10 or 15 minutes or so to get the bill. I did complain to the duty manager and he assured me he would speak to the restaurant manager; not sure if he ever did. It truly is a shame this happened because we did enjoy our stay at the hotel-in spite of there not being a pool-but this really spoilt our last night. The location is very good and the rooms are nice-almost all of the staff are friendly and helpful BUT the website needs updating regarding the pool and a change of attitude at the Polestar Bar is required!
