{"text":"It really depends on the room Having now been back to Amsterdam about 6 times in as many years, and tried others (the Krasnapolsky customer service was just dreadful, although the rooms and location were great), I find myself drawn back to the Pulitzer every time now. And I think I've now discovered the reason for the variety of reviews... There is a *huge* variety in the rooms in this hotel - even those of supposedly the same class.There have always been the two of us visiting and we've always asked for a double room. So it's been quite surprising to find that we were once offered a split-level room with two twin-beds upstairs; we've had a suite which was a good size but rather strangely had a sink and electric hob in the hallyway of the room (can't see many people who can afford to stay there cooking up an economy breakfast - but there you go - especially when little amuses bouches are brought round mid afternoon); the garret room had literally no space (one shelf in the wardrobe) and was very dark; the room on the ground floor had wonderful exposed brick work and a newly decorated bathroom with a heated floor. That worked very well. So a lot of it is, unfortunately, down to luck of the draw.I would recommend this hotel strongly though. The staff are almost all helpful and polite (not used the concierge but did notice the golden keys on his jacket), and the breakfasts are very good. Not eaten there in the evening, but the bar does very good cocktails in convivial surroundings and has a fine cognac selection too. The hotel's location is roughly central - and if it seems that 10 minute extra walk from Dam square is a bit far in the evening - you'll welcome the peace and quiet when you arrive back. There's definitely a good feel about the hotel.The hotel seemed to go through an economy drive during 2005 (removing things like the complimentary slippers and the welcome cookies, and not refilling the breakfast containers... Cold dregs of scrambled egg anyone?), but someone seems to have come back and got things back in order. No longer will the traveller have to experience this.The hotel's not cheap - but that's fairly typical for Amsterdam - and I agree its grip on a 5* rating is up for questions (it's a fine 4* hotel though) - but (like Amsterdam itself), I think everyone should experience it for themselves and not necessarily rely on what others have told them. I suspect you'll enjoy it.
