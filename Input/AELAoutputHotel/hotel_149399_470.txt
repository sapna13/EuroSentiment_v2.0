{"text":"Beautifull, peacefull and relaxing. I stayed at the resort from march 22nd to the 29th. What a trip! We were there for a convention, 42 people of us. Everything was wondefrull. Check in was fast and easy, they deliver your bgs to your rooms and food is available even if you arrive very late.The breafast you can have at the buffet by the beach, no need to go back to the lobby. Alot of variety and good food. Its not everywhere you have breakfast looking at the ocean!Lunch is at this same buffet by the beach, variety is so so, pasta is good, always alot of fruits, deserts are great. The A la carte restaurants are incredible, for an all inclusive, WOW! I personnaly loved the mexican, there is also one called Los Dos where you eat outside and sit 2 people, it was very good as well. The restaurants are all very impressive, nice selection of wine ( be carefull they rarely have the ones you want in stock).The beach is very nice, well maintained by the dominicans picking up the seeweed early. Alot of chairs available. Its crowded but still is nice. The ocean is very nice as well, once the wind picks up it brings alot of seeweed though. Beach towels are available but they often run out...The bars are great, bring a coffe cup for the car to keep your drink cold and full. From the beach, the bar is a few minutes. Alot of variety of drinks, good service.The rooms are big and nice. alot of storage. Clean bathrooms. The only thing is if you dont tip them alot ( more than 1$) forget about having nice towels folded in different animals etc.Overall, its a nice 4 star hotel. The grounds are beautifull. They are so well maintained, its really gorgious. The food was great, some of us got a little sick but didnt last long, bring imodium.As for the train, it passes often but the walk is pretty also. Just dont forget anything at the lobby because its a 10 minute walk! I recommend this resort to everyone, families, couples, groups etc. We did the tour where we swam with sharks and rays! What a tour! Definatly worth it. Enjoy your stay!
