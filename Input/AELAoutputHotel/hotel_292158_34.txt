{"text":"loved the grand palladium My husband and my 2 year old boy stayed at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana between 10th and 24th October 2008. We had a fantastic time √à√\u2020\u2022?the hotel was stunning √à√\u2020\u2022?very large grounds with all 3 hotel complexes combined, but the little train that takes you around all the complex is very frequent and quite a treat for the youngstersThere were a few restaurants closed and a pool closed due to the hotel not being full, but there will still plenty of places to eat, and the food was plentiful and very tasty. The staff always refilled the trays as soon as they start to get half empty and you can eat as much as you like.There is a great sports bar in the Bavaro complex which serves hot dogs, nachos, sandwiches etc throughout the day.There are a number of a la carte restaurants on site, which don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ need to be pre-booked, and are well worth a visit √à√\u2020\u2022?we went to the oriental and the Italian and the food was fantastic, and the service great. You don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to pay any extra, but would easily pay √ä√£¬¢50-60 if you were visiting a similar restaurant in the UKWe stayed in a basic room which had its Jacuzzi bath in the main room, with a shower and a toilet in a bathroom. The room was a larger than average size for a hotel, and was cleaned everyday to a high standard. We weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ able to keep the room on at the end of the holiday as we had to check out at 12, and weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ leaving the hotel until 5pm, but we had to pay US$35 and they gave us another room which we could use from 12 until 5pm.The beach is a golden sand beach with lots of loungers and beach bars for you to get your drinks from √à√\u2020\u2022?try the Coco Loco and Banana Mama drinks √à√\u2020\u2022?frozen fruit mixes, absolutely addictive, and they will add rum if you want.The pools are plentiful, and there are lots of loungers available, although we found a few selfish families would put towels out the night before to keep the same loungers all week.The only downsides of the holiday were the cleanliness of one of the childrens pools in the compex, which was dirty on the floor, and had a few sharp bits on the sides of the pool.Definitely recommend this hotel for families and couples ","annotations":[{"endOffset":722,"mention":"hot dogs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_dog"],"startOffset":714},{"endOffset":730,"mention":"nachos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nachos"],"startOffset":724},{"endOffset":742,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":732}]}
