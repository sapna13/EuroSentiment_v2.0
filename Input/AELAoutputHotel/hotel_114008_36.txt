{"text":"Very Nice Resort If you want to get away from the crowds in Wikiki and have a relaxing resort experience in Honolulu, this is your only option.Room:The room was outstanding. It had just been remodeled, and everything was up to the highest standards. They really do a good job of getting the little details right. Relaxing Hawaiian music played on our in-room stereo when we entered, and we were greeted also with a generous portion of delicious candies and large complementary Fiji waters. The bed is incredibly comfortable. Even though we had booked one of the less expensive courtyard rooms, these rooms still come with large balconies and have ocean views.Beach, Area, Views:The hotel is right on the beach, and it's basically a private beach. There is an upscale residential neighborhood surrounding the hotel so it's pretty well cut-off from public traffic. The beach is soft white sand and it's good for swimming. Water is very shallow for a good distance, and there's a floating dock you can swim to. It was a bit windy on the beach, but not too bad. They have beach service (they will bring you food and drinks). The views are outstanding.Restaurants:We ate at both the signature restaurant and the poolside restaurant. Honestly, neither was very good. If this resort has a weakness, it is the food. It was surprising bad given the way they seem to do everything else right. They really, really need to hire some new chefs and raise their quality level in the kitchen. The service from the wait staff is excellent, the food is just poorly prepared.Pool, Gym:We're not really pool people, but the pool seemed nice enough, if perhaps on the small side. They have the dolphin pool which seemed like it would be fun for kids, but we didn't try it. Felt a little sorry for the dolphins if I'm being totally honest. The gym is excellent-- all brand new equipment and each machine has a TV. They are supposed to give you headphones for the TVs, but when we went, nobody was staffing the gym desk for over an hour and we missed out on the headphones. Definitely minus one point for that. My wife and I tried the yoga class... I would say if you are expecting a yoga class that would compare with what you take at home (we live on the west side of Los Angeles) don't get your hopes up. The class is short, but still moves really slowly and is geared to the lowest common denominator. We didn't so a single warrior pose or vinyasa-- for those of you who know what those terms mean.Overall:If you need to stay in Honolulu, and are not a fan of crowds and skyscrapers, this is the place. If you're looking for a great, relaxing beach resort experience and don't have any special reason to go to Hawaii, skip it and go to Playa Del Carmen in Mexico.
