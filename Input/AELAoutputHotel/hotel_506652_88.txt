{"text":"Fantastic Value My Girlfriend and I stayed at the B-Hotel for 4 nights and i have to say the hotel did not disappoint at all. For a 3 star hotel in a central location of a major and trendy European city we got our money's worth and then some. The location is not too touristy but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ fine because of the proximity of the metro which is only few stops from the touristy center. And the connection to the airport via the Aerobus is easy, quick and cheap.The hotel's design is very modern and definitely not cheap looking. Sure it lacks the final finish but this is not a 5 star hotel. It has some cool gimmicks that you would never find in a hotel within the price range in Paris, London, and Amsterdam etc. Such as the automatic lights in the hall or the LEDs in the elevator. Not to mention the very cool pool on the top floor, room  bathroom design, LCD TV etc. The only drawbacks are views of the rooms, which are non-existent, the very late check-in (15:00) and the breakfast is definitely not worth the money. While the staff is not top-notch we did not have any problems with them. And the free Internet on the bottom and 1st floor is a major plus. As long as the B-Hotel keep their prices (I paid √à√\u2020√ü?30 for a double through easyhotels.com) then I would definitely come back again. It was a real pleasure for a romantic holiday.
