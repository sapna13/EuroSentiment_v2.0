{"text":"It's all about the beach, cause the hotel is average Just the wife and myself on the anniversary for 8 days. A few years ago, we stayed at the Sharaton Waikiki 300 yards away. There hotel was great, but it lacked direct beach frontage. At that time, I noticed the pleasant access of Outrigger Hotel's beach front location and view from Dukes restaurant, and opted for it this go around. Its really hard to screw up the day activities at Waikiki beach, so I will only mention the bad aspects of the time we were actually in the hotel. They charged $25\/night to park your car with no discount to hotel guests. This was not divulged on web site. While the hotel web site indicates that it matters, actually selecting (or in my case verbally requesting) the ocean view\/king bed and then getting it upon arrival are two diff things. Upon arrival, they suggested that next time I should call up a day or two before arrival to remind them. For a minute there, I could almost swear that some palm scratching was in order\/required, if you get my drift. Fortunately, significant begging did the trick, after I declined to pay for their offer of an ocean front upgrade room. What I got was the room across from the elevator. While the elevator is not noisy, the people traffic is. Without a doubt, (and as everyone else writes) the walls are paper thin. A door closing nearby is a loud bang. The Air conditioning unit is loud on high, and fidgety to maintain on low. The toilet flushes so loud, Al Bundy would be proud of its power. Above you, below you, next to you. If your the party animal who can manage to stay up and continue the cocktail'ing in your room, then this is no big deal to you. If you are like us and enjoy somewhat of a peaceful night starting at 9 - 10pm, then you wont dig this. Very simply, normal talking can be heard from adjacent rooms and from across the hall. As indicated, our first room was next to\/across from the elevator. Two days later, we requested and received a relocation. Now we were next to the lady with the hearing aid (literally) and loud TV at night. Called building security and they eventually got her to turn it down. The Hula grill and Chuck's Steak House are the alternate restaurants but they are not open for lunch. This limits you to Dukes, which is OK at best. Honestly, the $2.50 pre-fab tuna sandwich in the lobby market comes with light mayo and is a very tasty night snack. The $6 tuna sandwich for lunch from the lobby custom deli (closes at 5pm) sucked due to them soaking it with mayo. My fault. I still recommended the deli over Dukes for an economy lunch. For the budget minded drunk, I recommend going to the ABC market across the street and buying 10 of the $1.50 bacardi mini-bar bottles. Get the free (or low cost) passion\/guava mix from the bar and bingo, instant Mai Tai. Excellent. I know, I'm a cheap sh**. But it saved me $300 bucks! I also recommend that upon arrival, ask the beach services desk to give you one of the free rafts that everyone leaves there. Otherwise, go to ABC store and but one for $2. If you want chairs and umbrella, same thing. Buy it at ABC. Otherwise, rentals for each item is $5 - $50 day. Then throw it away when you done. Overall rating - Average.
