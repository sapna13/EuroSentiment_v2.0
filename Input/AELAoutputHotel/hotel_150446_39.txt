{"text":"Excellent Resort Just got back from a 7day 6 night vacation with my husband and teenage daughter. The hotel met and exceeded my expectations. All the employees we encountered were polite and very helpful. We arrived Sunday night and received lots of tips from Jesus who works 3 to 11pm. We found the room to be nice and clean. The bed was wonderful. We stayed on the 15th floor after receiving an upgrade and had a spectacular ocean\/pool view. The room was cleaned everyday. We took the advice of previous travelers and didn't eat at the hotel restaurants. We ate breakfast across the street at MiCasitas, good food and even better prices. We found the area surrounding the hotel to be nice and safe to walk all hours day or night. We walked to several restaurants for dinner, Metropol being our favorite. There are taxi's located outside the hotel for your convenience. We took a cab to Old San Juan, it was wonderful and culturally rich. We went to Old Morro (The Fort) then we had Mollorcas and Puerto Rican coffee at La Bombanero (recommended by Rachel Ray). It was delicious. The cab ride roundtrip was $42.00. We went to the rainforest and the views were breathtaking, it is a nice hike, so wear comfortable shoes. The waterfall inside is beautiful. We ate at a road side Kisok, the rice and beans were delicious. On the tour, we were provided with lots of information about the Island and its history. Great tour, provided through the hotel. We also took a trip to Plaza Las Americas, the big mall there, very nice, there are upscale and regular stores throughtout. It is very large.We found getting around by taxi very efficient and they are readily available. All in all, we had a wonderful time and would go back in a heart beat.
