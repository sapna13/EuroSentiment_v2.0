{"text":"Extremely Disappointing We stayed at the Farjardo Inn for 5 nights beginning 4\/15. First the O.K. stuff: The hotel had some plusses: landscaping, 2 nice pools, and if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e lucky a good enough room with a good enough view. (I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l explain more later--but in the meantime don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay in Rm. #208.) Most of the staff were friendly, polite and responsive about requests. The food was O.K. in the Starfish Restaurant. As a whole we found the Puerto Rican people to be very nice.Now the unfortunate minuses. For the life of us we cannot understand why there has been no mention that this hotel, while very nice from the look of it despite it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hilly terrain, hammering and sawing noises from a construction project on the property, inconsistencies with pool and restaurant hours, internet use and access problems, hotel amenities not available, a lack of knowledge about reputable and decent resources available to visit the sights, stray dogs and cats in the most pathetic condition about the premises--it has not been mentioned that the location of this hotel is among impoverished and dilapidated neighborhoods and from the looks of what serves as √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢omes√à√\u2020\u2022?with jail bars or cages around them, some serious crime issues. Although we did not encounter any conflicts in the day during our travels, we guessed that it might have been a different issue at night. The towns are dirty with many boarded-up store fronts and many indigent people idling about the streets or in bars. The Kiosks are disgusting. We can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe why anyone would take a chance at these places. When we asked for a restaurant recommendation, we were told to try Rosa√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Seafood. As with most everywhere else we drove to, you had to drive through some of the worst poverty stricken neighborhoods we have ever seen. With this place, though, the restaurant was right in the slum with a stripped down car across the street as an added visual treat. How can you enjoy yourself and supposedly enjoy eating a good meal, when you see all the poverty surrounding you? People and animals living in the same squalid conditions just outside as you are stuffing yourself.Are the people at the hotel oblivious or does everyone just accept the terrible conditions of their neighbors? There seems to be no humane services for man or beast. Before entering a Carvel on Rt. 3, we had to be buzzed in. The same for a Radio Shak store. No doubt others. In the parking lots of strip malls, there often is a guard in an elevated tower. If you go to Seven Seas Beach, one side of the road is a beach and the other side a slum again. This is typical of the whole area. If you have to stay in this section of Puerto Rico for some reason, the Fajardo Inn will do, but we found it difficult to enjoy what beauty there is when you have seen the poverty that is between you and some of the beautiful views.
