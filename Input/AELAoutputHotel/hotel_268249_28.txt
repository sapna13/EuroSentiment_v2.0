{"text":"Fabulous Resort First of all, I would like to say that we are not first time travellers. This is our 3rd time in Dominican and we have also been in Cuba. I cannot honestly say anything negative about this resort!! It had it all. There were 3 pools, 3 a la carte restaurants, 2 buffets, pizzeria, beach grill and 7 bars including a swim up bar. The service was fantastic. In certain bars you didn't even have to get up to get your own drink....they would come to you!!! (really liked this feature). There were 2 big markets on each side of the resort and there was deep sea fishing, parasailing, speed boats, catamaran, etc. all right there on the beach.....everything was right at your fingertips.....About half way through our trip, my husband dislocated his shoulder playing beach volleyball!!! and I just had to write about our experience with the health care in this country. It is better than ours!!!!! From the time my husband had the accident, to the time we arrived back our room, we were only gone about 5 hours and we were at the resort for about an hour after the accident. They were very professional, both at the resort and the hospital. We arrived at the hospital in the ambulance about an hour after it happened and he was seen by the doctor right away. The doctor took an x-ray, put him to sleep, put the shoulder back into place, then gave him some good painkilers!!!! The longest part of the stay was waiting for the drugs to wear off and then the doctor put an amazing sling on to support his shoulder. The doctor and most of the staff we dealt with spoke really good english.....we had no problems with communication. We had to pay for the bills, of course, but we do have travel insurance and will be reimbursed 100% for all costs incurred both at the resort and the hospital. A word of advice though.....don't travel without insurance....our bill was $1300.00!!! And you never know when you might need it.Overall, we had an excellent trip. The food was great, as were the drinks. The people were very friendly and spoke very good english. The rooms were superb and kept very clean. I would definately recommend this resort to anyone.
