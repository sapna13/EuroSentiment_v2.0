{"text":"Nice hotel, but don't use the concierge service We stayed in the Le Meridien for 5 nights in October as the final segment of our vacation. We took bus A1 from the airport directly to Plaza Catalunya and the hotel is a short walk down La Rambla. The hotel location can't be any better. The hotel is few minutes walk from La Boqueria, La Rambla is right outside your window, (if you are lucky enough to get one of those rooms) and 5-minute walk to the Gothic quarter. Also, if you follow La Rambla all the way to the end, you find yourself in an amazing marina. Since the hotel is under construction, there isn't any organization to storing luggage. There were luggage everywhere in the lobby and that seemed to be a permanent feature of the lobby. At our 2pm arrival, the only room with king size bed ready for check in faced the back alley. We took that room regardless. When we got to the room, she wasn't kidding that it faced the back alley. We were looking directly into other people's living rooms on the other side of the alley. The room is a decent size and the bathroom was great. Even though we didn't have a tub, the shower had one of those rainforest shower heads. The room came with all the niceties of robes, slippers, comfortable bed, clean linen, mood lighting and a 42-inch plasma TV. During our stay, housekeeping was very nice with daily turn-down service. If you have a don't disturb sign on, they always leave you a nice note to call when you are ready for turn-down service. The two computers with free internet access in the lobby is a great bonus. My main issue with the front desk\/concierge service is that they insisted that we will get lost on our own and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ better to take one of their tours when we had transportation questions. For example, we wanted to take a day trip to Montserrat and asked the concierge for train station location. They insisted that we will get lost on our own and not enjoy the trip, and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ best to book a bus tour with them for 48 euro per person. On top of that, they would not provide any detail about the metro\/train services we had asked. We ended up looking up the train service in our tour book and took a chance with getting lost. It turned out that the train station had BIG signs directing you to multiple daily services to Montserrat. It was a beautiful train ride up the mountain and the monastery was fabulous. It cost us a whoppy 12 euro per person. (BTW, we saw the route the bus would've taken, and it could not have been a comfortable ride). Just on a side note, hotel staff constantly stood in front of the hotel entrance taking smoke breaks or just hanging out there. For a 5-star hotel, they could do better than that to their first-impression. Overall, the hotel is in a great location, comfortable room, and free internet. But I think they could do much better for a 5-star hotel and for the price they are charging.
