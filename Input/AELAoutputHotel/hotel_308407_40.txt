{"text":"Great Hotel, friendly staff Our agent was instructed not to sell any more rooms at the Santka Beach Resort because of renovation woerk to the sea wall. We were offered alternatives but chose to stick with the Santika.So pleased that we did. The staff are friendly, the location excellent for walking into Kuta and the rooms very good for the price - not opulent luxury but comfortable, large and with a great balcony. The hotel has two pools, one is a recently refurbished infinity pool, both have a kiddies pool.Hotel fronts onto the beach where they are renewing the wall - right the way along and not just at the Santika. Once within the grounds of the hotel you are not aware of the work. Many of us chose loungers near the sea and kept an eye on the sea wall work which was quite interesting.The sunset restaurant is a perfect location rather than a culinary experience. The Kunyot restaurant was memorable on our first visit but gave terrible service on the second - we walked out in trh end and complained to the management.A ten - twenty minute walk from the hotel gives access all he shops and restaurants in Kuta - we ate at Made's Warung twice, Ket u pat in Legian twice, TJ's in Poppies One, Kunyit twice, sunset once and at the nearby Batan Waru which is really good.Hotel breakfast is good but too expensive (110,000 HP) if not included with your room\/ Nearby places offer breakfast from 25,000RP (less than √ä√£¬¢2).Rented a car for four days with insurance cover for √ä√£¬¢40 total. Driving is manic but fun. It gets you out into the country and back 150 years.Would not hesitate to book again at the Santika Beach. ","annotations":[]}
