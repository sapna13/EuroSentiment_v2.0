{"text":"If you'd prefer personal to corporate this is the place for you! My wife and I are fairly seasoned travelers and generally prefer a small property to one of the big corporate properties. The Petite Auberge was an extraordinary find. They seem to have two sizes of room - big and little - and price accordingly. We stayed in a small room which was comfortable but a bit cramped. The posted photos show both styles of room and I would guess that some other reviewers thought they were getting the large room when they had paid for the small one. There is no A\/C in the room and in SF you almost never need it but we were there during a hot spell and had to ask the front desk for a fan which was delivered in about three minutes and worked wonders. The open windows let in street noise but living in the city as we do we're used to that.The service and attention was terrific. Freshly baked cookies are available 24\/7 and one evening we came back from dinner to face a home made pound cake with chocolate frosting: We were too full to say yes but I still regret it.The breakfasts are wonderful. For the life of me I can't understand why other reviewers would complain about them. Fresh quiches, fresh rolls, fresh fruit, fresh breads, boiled eggs, homemade oatmeal, juices and really good coffee. We could hardly believe it it was so good. Sort of spoiled us for the rest of the day.The location is just a block away from the Powell-Hyde Trolley and within walking distance of both Union Square and Chinatown. SF is hilly, really really hilly so if you're not in shape you're better off taking a cab. The neighborhood is mostly large apartment buildings with a mix of small businesses and small hotels. No problem there.No one should confuse this property with the Hyatt. It really is a matter of taste and preference but if you like small, personal properties when you travel you'll love this one.
