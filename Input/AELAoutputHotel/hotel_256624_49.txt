{"text":"Very disappointing We stayed at this hotel over Easter and had high expectations because of its cost and advertised features. When we had booked we were not told that this '5 star' establishment would effectively be non-functional due to the Easter weekend - the restaurant was closed ( and a 15% surcharge added to room service because of the holiday!), the bar was closed, the spa and sauna were out of order and unable to be fixed because it was a holiday weekend, much of the gym equipment was broken and only one lift appeared to be working. The rooms were average but smelt of cigarette smoke.Yes the view is good, but with no balcony there is a sense of distance and detachment to it and, having stayed previously in a hotel with a balcony, would strongly recommend - if you can afford the sort of price you're paying at Quay West anyway - go to a hotel with the view AND the balcony !The majority of staff there were polite. But when we tried talking to the management they were surly and argumentative, particularly when we suggested at check-out that a rate reduction would be appropriate. We took the step of writing to the CEO of Mirvac Hotels after our stay and received a reply from the hotel manager, offering us - wait for it - a complimentary night's stay at Quay West, Sydney. Apart from the unlikelihood of us getting to Sydney again in the remotely near future, it is only in our nightmares that we would stay at this hotel again. ","annotations":[]}
