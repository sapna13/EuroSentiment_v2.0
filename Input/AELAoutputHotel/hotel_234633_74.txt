{"text":"Lovely little gem From 29 December 2007 until 1 January 2008 we stayed with our three teen-age daughters in this very homelike hotel.We got a very warm welcome by the receptionist and received the keys within 5 minutes. We were given room 52 and 53 on the fifth floor on the streetside. The no-smoking rooms were very recent completely renovated and very tasteful decorated, very clean, warm, comfortable and well equipted with flatscreen (the signal was not so good unfortunately), minibar, tea\/coffeemaking facilities,airco, a safe working on your creditcard and a very well equipted and new bathroom.The breakfast is being served on the groundfloor in a little cosy room with 12 chairs. The atmosphere there is very relaxing and informal and the staff will do everything to satisfy you and to feel comfortable. There are several sorts of fresh! bread, croissants, muesli, cheese, ham, marmelade, Nutella, honey, juices, fresh fruit, eggs, milk, yoghurt and much more. We used breakfast every day and it was really lovely and for us very complete.The hotel is standing in a Residentiel (a lot of Ambassies), quiet and safe neighbourhood. There are 2 Metrostations and several Velib(bikes))-points nearby. The Eiffeltower and the Arc-de-Triomph are within walking-distance. There are indeed enough good restaurants in the neighbourhood.When you really want to sleep quiet and not be waked up at 7.00a.m. every morning by the garbagetruck ask for a room on the backside of the hotel. The airco was not working so we slept with open windows. So every sound was live.There is free internet access in the lobby which is very great.Our compliments to the always smiling staff. They were all just great, very helpful, friendly, nice, very good English speaking, and really interested in their guests. Isabelle is a very nice lady and she will do everything to make you feel at home. When you read it Isabelle: Thanks for everything (p.s. our daughters liked your clothes very much!).We highly recommend this cosy place and will certainly come back in future. It's a lovely place for a very reasonable price (certainly in a town like Paris) and the staff is wonderful.
