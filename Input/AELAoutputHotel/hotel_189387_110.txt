{"text":"Great location in Amsterdam I stayed at Pulitzer during a weekend get-away to Amsterdam from the States. Since I was in Amsterdam for the first time and only for 48 hours I spent no time in the hotel other than in my room.I booked the lowest level room. It was small, and with all the furnishings was crowded (to reach one side of the bed I had to climb over a sitting chair). The bed was queen-sized and adequately comfortable, but a little firm and lumpy - not what I would expect given the focus high-end hotels are placing on their beds these days. The pillows, however, were great. There was also a small desk, a large closet, a regular TV (not flat-screem), and a Bose Wave radio\/CD player. Lighting was adequate, but not great - with all the lights on the room was still a little dark.The bathroom was also small but very nice. The tub was large and accomodated me easily for a bath (I'm 5'11), but it was narrow, as seems the norm in Europe. Each day I was left a complimentary water bottle and cookies, and turn-down service was accompanied by some chocolates.My room looked out over an inner courtyard of sorts, but all I could really see was other parts of the hotel. Since I was on the 2nd floor of a 4-5 story building this meant very little natural light. The front desk staff were very understanding when I asked to be moved, but they could only put me in a different room for the 2nd night (I declined).One of the best things about the hotel is its location: in the heart of Amsterdam, but just far enough away that it's quiet and feels more residential. There are many nearby restaurants and shops, the Anne Frank house is a 5-10 minute walk, and the tram is only 3-5 minutes away.Overall, I was happy with my stay in Pulitzer, but not thrilled. The location is great and might convince me to return, but not at their current high prices.
