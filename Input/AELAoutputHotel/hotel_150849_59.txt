{"text":"Amazing Trip to Riu Bambu When I first booked this trip I was very nervous after reading all the negative reviews. I honestly don't know what the people who wrote the negative reviews are talking about..This was my first all inclusive trip to an island and was beyond happy with the vacationThe flight..The flight was good and we were greeted by friendly people when we arrived in Punta Cana..The hotel..Riu Bambu exceeded our expectations..The staff was greatly helpful and were always there when we needed anything..We were greeted at the lobby when we first got there with a drink in our hand..The rooms were very nice and very clean..The bungalow set up made it feel like we were really on a vacation..We asked for a room closest to the beach and a second story room and they were more than willing to give it to us..There were 3 of us and they even gave us a cot so we would be more comfortable. We always got extra towels and everything without even asking..The pools were very nice and clean..There were always chairs around and we didnt have to get up early to save one..The beach was absolutely amazing and the water was beautiful..There was an abundent amount of chairs and once again we didnt have to get up early to get one..The food was good and we were very satisfied with the buffet that we never even went to the restaurants..They have an entertainment team that works hard during the day and at night to keep us happy and smiling..They put on great shows at night..I was very happy with everything with the hotel and the amazing service we gotExcursions..We did the dolphin swim at manati park, horseback riding and parasailing..They all were amazing and decently priced.I am a very picky person and enjoyed every second of my trip and would definitely go back in a heartbeat..I already miss it!
