{"text":"Not overly pleased.... The room was very clean but we had a handicapped equipped room which we really were not pleased with. We are not handicapped but have stayed in rooms designated this before and have had no problem. Usually the doors are wider and there are hand rails in shower\/tub\/toilet area. This room was completely different. The entire bathroom area was set up like a gym shower with the shower faucet coming directly out of a side wall and the drain in the middle of the bathroom floor. The toilet was in the same area so everything got wet . After a shower the entire bathroom floor was wet with puddles of water the rest of the day. We totally hated it. If this is the only room left at this hotel you may want to think twice before taking it.Also, there was construction going on in front of the hotel - right outside the windows. There was a two-story hole in the ground with huge cranes - ugh. The sidewalks were blocked and also part of the streets so it was difficult to walk to places. I can say the construction noise didn't start until around 8:30 am. Even though the hotel was within walking distance (eight or nine blocks from the Space Needle and also the waterfront) the area was not real desirable. We made sure we were back in the hotel before dark each night. I would not have felt comfortable walking there by myself at all.There is free parking with the hotel so that part was good and the room was very clean. The breakfast was pretty good. There was only one restaurant within a couple blocks - Korean I believe. There was a Whole Food Market about two blocks away which we went to a couple times although we had to walk in the street to get there due to the walks being blocked. ","annotations":[]}
