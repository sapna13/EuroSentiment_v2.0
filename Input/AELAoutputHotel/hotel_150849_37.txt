{"text":"It was okay for a first trip together. Hey everyone my fiance and I stayed at the Bambu for 8 days. It was our first real vacation together. ( AND we have been together 7 yrs!) Anyway, I have to say, the hotel is definatley NOT a 4 or 5 star. HOWEVER, the complex itself was very beautiful. Unfortunately your sleeping conditions are very uncomfortable. The beds are hard as a rock!! No exaggerating...you would be better off on the floor.I had no problems with the food for almost the hole trip. Towards the end i started feeling ill, however it could have been due to the fact that i was ready to go home. There is plenty of food to choose from so there is no worries about that.Also beware of falling when things get wet!! I fell a time or 2. The beach of course is AMAZING!! If you love the beach you will love this beach! There is always room and chairs around. You are not crowded in or feel like there are too many people.Parents BEWARE you are in a new country and if you or your child are not used to topless woman then i suggest you stay home. I'm an American, so it is not socially acceptable in our country....HOWEVER ......it was no bother to me at all...i barley even noticed.I don't have children THANK GOD...so i can not speak for the children's activities.The workers work very hard but as said before you can only watch the animacion show 2-3 times before you get really bored. There is NO language barrier. These people have gone as far as to learn all kinda of languages to ensure that their customers are taken care. I'm sure they are hard to find. As far as English goes they speak it fine.Overall, after a couple days it gets repetitive and tiring. There is not alot to do at the hotel if you don't do excursions. I would say that for a first time trip out of my country, it was a great experience. I would go back one day but not to RIU bambu.
