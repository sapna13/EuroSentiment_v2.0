{"text":"Fantastic Time!!! Our family of 4 including 2 children ages 2 and 4 just returned from a fabulous week from Jan 10 - 17 at Melia Caribe Tropical. We had an absolutely wonderful time.We spent our first 4 days on the Tropical side in a family suite right next to both the pool and the beach. Upon arrival we were originally booked for a building near the lobby in a standard room but my husband tipped $50 and requested a room near the beach and we were upgraded to a family suite that would have cost much more had we booked thru our travel agency. The room is comfortable and adequate but nothing to brag about. It was cleaned promptly everyday and new towels and mini fridge stocked everyday without any problems. Only saw one large beetle on one day in the room. The beds are way too hard!On our 4th day we decided to look into upgrading to royal service and after seeing the room we were sold. The one bedroom suites were absolutely fantastic and were like a good size apartment. If you have kids, I definitely recommend this room as it gives you so much more freedom when the kids are napping\/sleeping. We had an amazing time on the royal service side and would highly recommend it if you have the money. We will definitly return!The beach is absolutely beautiful on both the royal service and regular side. There are plenty of lounge chairs available everywhere. Lots of activities are available for everyone. All the restaurants were good especially the Gabi in Royal Service, the Japanese, and the Mexican. We also ate at the American Grill which was just okay. The MarketPlace buffet was good and you'd have to be pretty picky if you can't find something you don't like. We very much enjoyed eating breakfast and some lunches at the beach restaurants as well. It is so beautiful enjoying a meal while watching the ocean. It's also nice having lunch at the pool on the Royal Service side. We enjoyed a lot of different food at the resort and never felt sick at all. We found the service at the resort to be very good on both sides. Tipping and treating people nicely will get you a long way. These people work so very hard but will go out of their way to make you happy if you treat them right. While on the Tropical side, we met a great guy who gave us a lift on his golf cart. We mentioned we were having difficulty getting reservations at the Japanese and he promptly got us a reservation at the time of our choice the following evening for a private seating and then came and got us every night for dinner - too cool. On the royal service side, the staff just couldn't seem to do enough for you. We felt as if we were royalty and very much enjoyed our stay. We did not use the kids club but did go in to check it out. A couple of the ladies seemed very nice and as the week went by we felt very comfortable with a few of them. I didn't get as good of a feeling from some of them so check it out for yourself. The older kids did seem like they were enjoying themselves. A couple on the Royal Service side appeared to have a nanny provided by the resort and she seemed awesome. If you have the money, it might be a nice way to catch a break here or there. I enjoyed 2 massages while at the resort - one on the Tropical side by the pool and one in the spa. Both were very good but I actually enjoyed the one by the pool more as it seemed more relaxed. The timeshare people can be annoying at times but it really didn't bother me too much. All in all, I really don't have any complaints and we had a great time. As with anything, it is what you make of it. We will definitely return to this resort again and would have not have any problem recommending it. It was a great value for the money. Go and enjoy!!!
