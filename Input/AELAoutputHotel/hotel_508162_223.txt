{"text":"Great time we stayed at Dreams from July 5, July 12, 2008. We had a party of ten people. I had emailed Jerry Three times requesting we all be in the same building. This did not happen. We were in three different building. When we tried to communicate this with the reqistration staff, they obviously could not understand English nor could we understand Spanish. It was a hopeless case so we just made the best of it. Our rooms were all fine. The facilities were great. The pool was awesome and the beach was OK. Having done my homework here on trip advisor we were all prepared with water shoes, but did spent the majority of our time at the pool. The food was very good. The staff was excellent. On several occasions we were given incorrect information from the front desk, but after speaking to the bell men this was corrected. If you have a handicappe they will transfer you by golf cart but just a simple phone call to 3000. The grounds are exceptional and well maintained. I have only one real complaint and that is the drive from the airport to the hotel...It is a real problem for people who get car sick. The hotel gift shop is very expensive and shopping with the vendors they bring to the resort is limited to mahogany, cigars, canvas painting and some Jewelry (no silver). like in Mexico. The shows are better than any other resort I have been to. I was very sceptial of this resort from reading some messages here on trip advisor, but not really sure those bad reviews were from the same resort I was. Yes I would return. ","annotations":[]}
