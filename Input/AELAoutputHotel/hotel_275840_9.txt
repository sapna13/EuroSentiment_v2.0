{"text":"Our Trip Reviver The Hotel Alamanni was our haven for a week. We got to a point in our month long holiday when we just wanted to stay put and not pack up every couple of days. The travel information office at the Santa Maria Novella Train Station found this gem for us. We wanted to be close to the station so we had easy access to public transport and do a few day trips by train and bus. We had no problems finding it, although a bigger sign would be an advantage. We had a lovely warm greeting, and although we had only booked for one night (in case it was a dive), once we saw our room, we promptly booked for the rest of the week. We had a view of the Doma, which meant we also overlooked the street, but with the double glazing, noise was not an issue. The train station was 5 minutes away, with nice eateries and restaurants in between, also a small supermarket and laundromat close by.We asked advice on a couple of nice restaurants, and were told about Le Rotonda, about 3 blocks away (7 minute walk), and spent a couple of great evenings there, enjoying their excellent food, wine and great atmosphere, with extremely pleasant and helpful staff. Our last two nights were spent in their annex less than 2 blocks north, which again was very nice. They took the luggage up there for us, while we were out for the day. We had a ground floor room with a small terrace into the garden area. Unfortunately no Wifi, but that was not the end of the world. A phone in the entry alcove was handy. Both the main hotel and the annex were spotlessly clean. Rooms were reasonably sized with great bathroom facilities. The fridge was a bonus. Not many rooms in Italy (or France) have fridges. Breakfast was plentiful, although as others pointed out, some fruit would be nice. I would thoroughly recommend the Alamanni to anyone. Thanks for a great relaxing stay.
