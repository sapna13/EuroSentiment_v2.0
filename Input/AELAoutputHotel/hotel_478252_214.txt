{"text":"fantastic vacation even during the worst time of year Me and My boyfriend went to the bahia principe in Oct 2007. It was my first time going to the dominican and it won't be my last.This place blew me away! It was absolutly spotless. The hotel was beautiful. The check in went smooth. We were planning to upgrade to club dimond when we got there, but to our surprise they had already done that for us at no charge. We were thrilled, we had a room close to the beach. It was a little overwhelming at how big the resort was, but they have these buses that take you up and down the resort. Honestly we never had to wait more then a minute for one they're constantly going back and forth. The food was fantastic. The buffet was different every night, which was good cause you never got tired of the same stuff. We never got sick or even felt sick the whole time we were there. The staff was sooo nice. Given the language barrier they did their best to try and understand and help you. It rained a few days we were there but that didn't stop the entertainment at the beach or by the pools. The kept on dncing and singing and totally made us forget the rain. The beach is the best part. AMAZING!!!! that's all I can say. If your thinking about going to this resort go.... you won't be dissappointed no matter what anybody says. I'm definately going back there.
