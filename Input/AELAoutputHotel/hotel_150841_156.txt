{"text":"Lived Up to Our Expectations.....Manage yours.... Just returned from a 5 night stay at the Iberostar Bavaro. April 5-10. This is our second trip to Punta Cana. We absolutly loved it. Weather was perfect during the day some sprinkles at night. I'll approch this review a liitle different. I managed my expectations before the trip....and the Iberostar crew over delivered. Beach- One of the finest I have ever seen. Absolutely fantastic. The Iberostar team keep it groomed and clean. Europeans out number USA folks 3 to 1 so remember tons of women are topless and men in thongs. Overall beach rating A+. This is why you come to Punta Cana...#1 reasonFacility- This is a beautiful, clean, well maintained property. Service is as good as you can expect in a 3rd world country. What they lack in knowledge or skill they more than make up for in effort and positive attitude. A+ for a clean room, fast prompt responses.Food- This is an all inclusive resort, food is going to be average at best....and it was. That being said I found good things to eat at every meal. Acceptable Pizza, burgers at the beach\/pool restaurant. Steaks at dinner are the qualty of a Ponderosa or Ryans.....acceptable. Great fresh fruit. Overall food C+. Just keep in mind....you don't come for the food and you will not be dissappointed.Medical Facilities- The have a 24 hour Dr on premise. They have a pharmacy. Wife needed some Phx stuff......cash only.Casino- Don't do it. There are no laws governing the gambling like in Las Vegas. They will deal off the bottom of the deck, clear winning bets etc. Go to the beach.Things I have read in reviews that I disagree with - The food is only average. If you like cruise buffets....this is a step down.If you have an issue with things being not like the good ol USA(food  language).... don't go.....this is a spanish speaking 3rd world country. We (USA) are not the primary customers. Euro's out number USA 3 to 1. Iberostar is a company based in Spain. They cater well to their customers.Regarding tips..... I tipped because of the effort they put in, outstanding.... did it improve service.... no. They worked hard regardless. They were appreciative of all tips. The only people who solicited tips were the airport transfer folks.Things to make sure you bring\/plan for....Take an umbrella....if it rains you can get trapped in your room. You will want it to get to the restaurants.Take more sun screen than you think you will need. You can buy it there but it will be 50% more than a well planned trip to Wal-Mart. We left the hotel 3 hours before our flight....we barely made it through checkin and security. Plan plenty of time for all of this. This was a great trip and a great facility. Wife and I are already planning our return ","annotations":[{"endOffset":232,"mention":"sprinkles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sprinkles"],"startOffset":223},{"endOffset":1078,"mention":"Pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1073},{"endOffset":1087,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1080}]}
