{"text":"Superb Service at the Conrad! My family stayed at the Conrad for a short holiday last week and we enjoyed the great service this hotel had to offer. It started from the email we sent their reservations office regarding our requests for rooms on the higher floor, specifically connecting or adjacent to each other. When we arrived, all our requests were granted. It was very important for our group to have easy access to each others rooms so it was great to know that they prepared for it too. The concierge staff were very helpful in attending to our daily needs. And the staff at the Oscar's were very attentive when we had our breakfast every morning.Location is very good. I like staying in this part of town than in the bustling Orchard Road. The Conrad is located right beside the Convention Center and the Suntec City Mall so everything was just a walk away. We were given 2 rooms with the view of the Fountain of Wealth and another two rooms facing the Harbour on the same floor. In the evenings when we get back to the hotel, I feel very relaxed opening the door with a great view and having soft classical music on. One great thing that I appreciate about this hotel is using Muguet D'ogive collection as their toiletries. I truly enjoyed using them!I've stayed in different five star hotels around Singapore and I can say the Conrad is a pretty quiet hotel, has its own character, definitely a 5-star for me, but maybe over shadowed by the other big hotel chains around the city. I definitely recommend this hotel and will stay here again when visiting Singapore. ","annotations":[]}
