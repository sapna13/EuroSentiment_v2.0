{"text":"Fawlty Towers does not compare! Terrible experience, arrived at 1:30, smelly and musty reception area, the man at the desk started to process our details and then said the room would be ready between 3 and 4 o clock, went for a walk and then arrived back at 3:45. Other people starting to arrive back for get key cards to rooms but they still were not ready. The reception man was slow, and went through a map of the area with everyone even when there was a q which further dealayed the check in process. Said he would check and see if our rooms were ready then and went off up the stairs with us waiting 5 minutes for him to come back. Our room was still not ready but he started on about payement then. Because we had booked on hotels.com and had no triple A card we were not eligible to any discount!! Due to a convention on in town that week we had to stay at the hotel for the 3 nights as there was no other place available. Finally got into our room at 6 o clock after a lesson in how to use the lift!! The Superior Room with a City View and continental breakfast turned out to be average sized room, with homeless people shouting outside the window at night and breakfast was tea and a banana passed out over the reception desk. The only positive was the bathroom was clean but the smell of cleaning products and bleach every day was very strong. Would not recommend this hotel.
