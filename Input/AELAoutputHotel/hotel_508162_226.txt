{"text":"Brilliant holiday - ignore the bad reviews!!!! We went to Dreams on June 14th for 12 nights and it was bliss! Yes shock horror on occasion I had to wait 5 mins for a drink......but guess what I hadn't exactly other pressing engagements at the time. Yes shock horror - one of the tiles in the bathroom was not exactly in line, but interestingly this did not cause me the trauma that it caused other review writers.The hotel, pool, rooms, service, food and weather are amazing. When I have travelled in the past I have always had stomach trouble (i.e Dubai, New York, Italy etc.) but I did not have any trouble here (despite for the first time ever, being really organised and bringing half a pharmacy with me!).Re the weather - don't freak when you look up the forecasts and it says 60% chance of rain and overcast. They only say that to cover themselves because it is the wet season - but if wet season means 32C sunshine everyday and the odd shower at night, I'll take wet season over our Irish summer anyday.Tips: Bring mosquito repellent and use it (esp when going to the seafood and french restaurant down by the beach). Also, if you have any small cosmetic samples etc. bring them for the maids - it might be just a lipstick to you but they cannot afford\/access anything like that, so to see their face light up is a joy! If you really want to be a good Samaritan bring some toys e.g. dolls, colouring books and give to the priest who says mass in the hotel on Sundays - he'll bring them out to the children. This is a really poor country so try to give something extra if you can afford to!There is lots of entertainment and the tv has a wide variety of channels including some movie ones if you just fancy a night in.I will definitely go back and please don't let the other reviews put you off!! And have a dirty monkey on me when you go! ","annotations":[]}
