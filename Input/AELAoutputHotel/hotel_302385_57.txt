{"text":"Great value for great service. Hi all,Although it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ been a long, long and sad time since I was in Bali (last April), it seems that after that me and my wife have been living just to fill the time between our trips√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>We had a wonderful time in Bali, and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ in a great deal due to the Nusa Dua. It was our 5th anniversary and actually our 2nd true vacation since our marriage, so we called it our 2nd honeymoon. I booked a superior room, but they upgraded us to a Palace Club Room. Great reception, rose petals in the tub, a heart made of orchids at the bed. My wife spent the whole week taking care about the orchids.The staff was really friendly and helpful, but the again, I think this is a Balinese treat, so I guess any good hotel will serve you that. The hotel room and facilities are well kept, everything looking new, great toiletry, changed everyday (even a good quality wooden hairbrush, that my wife took to the beach was replaced). In general, good attention to detail. The social area is very pleasant, and the Balinese style entrance garden is certainly a plus. The breakfast is vast, ranging from a complete warm Japanese meal and European cheese, to beef sausages, for the Islamic guests. Overall good food, although the fruits seemed to us a little flavorless (but then again, we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e from Brazil, and we do have very good fruits).The beach itself is not great, the sand stripe is quite narrow, and the seabed full of rocks and seaweed. Anyway, for us, it was great, quiet and peaceful enough. The swimming pools are great, large, and the artificial beach is very pleasant.The hotel restaurants serve good food at prices comparable to what we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° find in Brazil (which by the way is not cheap, as some may think), but we found that the restaurants around the Nusa Dua gate justifies Bali√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ fame of inexpensive food. A complete seafood meal for two, including lobsters, big shrimps, crab, fish, etc. and beverage cost us an average of $30~40. I mean the kind of meal that occupies the whole table√à√\u2020\u2022?Our tactics were lunching light meals at the hotel, and walking down the road for dinner.Ok√à√\u2020\u2022?That said, some pros and cons:PROS:Great hotel, service, attentiveness from the staff, cleanliness, good variety of activities. Overall great value.GREAT, I mean GREAT spa service. We went for a couple service, which provides includes massages with Balinese creams, and the masseurs leave the two of you to enjoy in private the facilities, including a pool, a Jacuzzi and sauna. We did it on our last day, and I can say it was an excellent farewell activity√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>CONS (for some):The hotel receives a lot of company workshops. That means that while you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e with your topless wife sunbathing at the pool, some people in suits walk by to get to the restaurant. While for us it was not a problem (my wife do not go topless), we observed that some guest were somewhat bothered with this;Our room was at ground level, which means that our balcony was also an exit to the side yard. Although it rendered us a great view and nature ambience, it stole some of out privacy. We had to close the balcony doors completely, otherwise somebody could see we showering from the garden.Hope this helps!Best regards,Rogerio.
