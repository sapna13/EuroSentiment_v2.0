{"text":"Disappointing service I booked this hotel based on the previous reviews on Tripadvisor, which generally seemed favourable. Also the location appeared to be suitable for my needs. I was attending a conference but also wanted to be close to shops and restaurants. The location is fine for that, but it is also situated close to a major traffic intersection which means it's really noisy most of the time. That is tolerable, depending on how sensitive you are to traffic noise. What is not tolerable was the blunt, almost rude attitude of some of the reception staff. After checking in, I asked to have my room changed for one with a full bath and the receptionist promptly started calling other hotels in the neighborhood, rather than either just apologize for lack of such rooms or try harder to find one. Having travelled for 24hours, I was not going to go out in the streets of Sydney, changing hotels at my own cost. This particular receptionist was unhelpful in everything! I was happy to acquiesce but politeness and consideration would have been nice. The room was also directly opposite the lift which made it noisy and I wanted that changed....again, it was a challenge for them, one to be met with blunt comments. I explained that I needed to work during the conference days and in fact had explained this quite clearly when I booked the hotel. Overall, the place is sort of clean, there was a faint smell of cigarette smoke in my room even though I'd asked for a non-smoking room. Given the noisy location and the unhelpful reception staff, I would not stay at this hotel again. It is also a long walk from the hub of activity,namely the Rocks and Darling Harbour area.
