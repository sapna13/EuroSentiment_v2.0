{"text":"Good location, very average hotel Three good points:1. Very central location just off the Dam Square - ideal for all the sights.2. The staff are friendly and helpful.3. The standard of cleanliness is goodHowever!1. The rooms are quite small and ours on the fourth floor had a sloping ceiling which made it impossible to get into or out of bed without having to stoop (and I'm only average height).2. The walls are very thin - conversation from adjoining rooms could be easily heard.3. The overall quality is basic - not even a 'do not disturb' hanger for the door - and the room attendants do start quite early.4. Our room only had a shower and the shower 'well' is so shallow the water easily goes all over the floor.5. Although we had booked a double in a no-smoking room some weeks in advance when we arrived we were allocated a twin. The only alternative was a double in a smoking room. Their allocation procedure seemed to be a mix of computer and written sheet - not very efficient.6. Breakfast was also basic - yes there is bread, preserves, fruit etc. but the bread was virtually all toasting bread, the preserves were of a poor quality and the fruit consisted of tinned fruit cocktail, tinned pear halves and very little else. There was also thinly sliced ham but some nice Dutch cheese. If you are bothered more about quantity than quality then you can stoke up for the day but not with anything special.7. There were some cooked items - however, the only eggs were scrambled. If they were fresh into the hot containers then that was fine but they appeared to be kept over a dry heat so quickly dried out and became very unappetising.To be fair whilst the hotel appeared busy and whilst we ate breakfast at different times during our stay we did not encounter any queues nor had a problem getting a table.We only noticed 1 lift but had no problems during our stay. There is a baggage room and the reception staff were very helpful with us leaving our bags on the day of departure.Overall the firm with whom we booked the break to Amsterdam described the RHO as 3* superior. Our view is it more 3* basic.
