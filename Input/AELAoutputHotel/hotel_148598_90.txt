{"text":"VERY nice resort The best part about the Rio Mar was the staff. They were very accomodating when we asked to switch rooms, and they helped us promptly with a smile. All of the restarant staff were likewise very polite and were happy to make suggestions and engage in conversation.The rooms are very adequate, although a bit on the small side. At night, the coqui frogs will either sing you to sleep or keep you awake. If you are a light sleeper, it would be wise to be on a higher floor.The pool area is somewhat crowded if you don't secure a spot early. They also have a quiet pool, which seemed to have just as many fun-loving kids as the larger pool...so it really wasn't any more peaceful.The beach is nice, but the water wasn't the turqoise we were hoping for. It was not crowded and was a very short walk from the pool area.The hotel has an iguana pool and has several feedings scheduled each day. My youngest daughter enjoyed hand feeding them with lettuce supplied by the hostess.The best part of the vacation was our short drive over to the El Yunque rainforest. We spent the morning hiking on paved, well marked trails and saw some incredible vistas.Our trip into Old San Juan was forgettable. It may have been better if we had arranged a guided tour, but we went on Wednesday ,which was apparently trash day, and had to step over piles of garbage bags as we walked through the streets.Both of my children thoroughly enjoyed this vacation, and my wife and I did too. We would probably return, but there are more places in the caribbean that I would like to see first. ","annotations":[]}
