{"text":"A wedding to remember, a resort like no other. I cant believe what this wedding coordinator can do in so little time. She really bent over backwards to meet our needs. She is amazing and it is hard to believe in the first week of our trip she had thrown 12 weddings together. She never once made us feel like we had to worry and she took care of all the details. Guest services were also very helpful. Caesar spoke very good english and was a great help with tracking down the wedding coordinator. Our ceremony was on the beach, the photographer was great. He was very vocal to the hotel guests that kept stopping in the background of our pics. Or he would change the angle he was standing at in order to cut them out. he is also able to photoshop them out of the pics. If you are planning a desination wedding dont hesitate to book with this resort they provide all the fundimentals to exicute an amazing day. If you pick a menu over the seafood restraunt, i recommend the italian and treat your wedding guests to the lasagna. WOW. Applauso. It was very good. I would avoid prawns at the seafood restraunt. A couple from our family were extremely ill after eating them. Overall this resort is really something to see for yourself. It far exceeds all resorts i had been to in mexico. And the food is so much better than there too but, dont expect the food to taste the same as home. It doesn't. Its not at all bad its just a little off and i cant say for sure but i think it may be in the different types of cooking oils which changes the flavours ever so slightly. The grounds are well kept, and landscaped beautifully. You have to see this place to really enjoy its splendor. Its an escape to a quiet, relaxing retreat away from the grind back home. I miss the sound of the palm trees blowing in the breeze. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":408,"mention":"Caesar","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Caesar_salad"],"startOffset":402}]}
