{"text":"Great value for money It's hard to find a better value in the Bavaro area.Keep in mind this is a 4 star hotel, so don't expects the services and amenities of 5 star hotels. Having said so, the place is great:beach is huge , you can walk for hours on both the left and right sides from the resort. On the left side, after a short walk and a couple of more resorts, the beach becomes unspoiled (apart from the palms). The hotel lagoon pools are very large and pleasant too, and well-kept. Though we were there at peak season, we never had problems finding sun beds on the beach or near the pool. There's a number of bars and restaurants, and large quantities of food of good quality. Food and drinks are available at any time of the day and night. Very importanlty, none of us had any stomach problem during the stay at the hotel (which we heard happens quite often at hotels in the Bavaro Area). I really do not understand why people give bad reviews to the food of this hotel. I don't think any 4 star hotel that caters for some thousands of people can provide a better service. Critical aspects: most of the restaurants of the hotel are overbooked, and we could not get a reservation at the Italian and Fish restaurant. Rooms are placed on both sides of long corridors, that amplify noises, especially door shuts.Most relevant criticality: the hotel has an Appendix, called The Club which is 1\/2 mile from the sea, and connected to the main complex by a bus. Not a long ride, still it might be very uncomfortable and unpleasant to take a bus to go to your room , especially at night, when waiting time is longer.Ask for a written confirmation that you are staying at the Grand Paradise and not at The Club.If you make it to the Grand Paradise (and not to The Club) this is gonna be a great vacation.
