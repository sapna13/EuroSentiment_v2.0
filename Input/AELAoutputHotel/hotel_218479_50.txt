{"text":"Sucks, Sucks, Sucks First of all let me tell you that this is not a family oriented resort. On the brochures it states that it is but please believe me when I tell you it is NOT. I traveled with a group of 18 people including 6 children and EVERYONE WAS BORED!!. The entertainment staff was Whack as my older son would say. They do absouletly no activites for the kids. My husband and I had to travel to the sister hotels just to find things for our son to do but like in our hotel all the activities were cancelled due to staff going on vacation. How convient!!The food was horrible!! And please believe me when I tell you my husband is still going to the bathroom. And keep in mind that he is used to eating spanish food being that I am Puerto Rican, so I do not want people to think that its that he is not use to spanish food. I only eat spanish food and found myself picking at everythiing. All I ate was chicken!! My son had french fries90% of the staff had attidudes and spoke no English. Half on them did not even know what was going on in the hotel. When you check in they just give you your key card and off you go. Oh I forgot to mention that we were dropped off at the wrong hotel and the receptionist was extremely rude, enough that I was going to show her how me get down in NY.Bottom line is do not book this hotel. My husband and I travel alot and we always try to book 4 star or better resort. We were very disappointed with our stay and felt the money was not worth it. I would recommend you stay at the Riu Resort were they know how to treat a guest.Pleae be advised that upon entering the country you must pay to go in at the airport. This is new to me, i have been to other Islands in the Carribean and this is a first!! ","annotations":[]}
