{"text":"Hotel Inglaterra: Perfect Access Point The best feature of this hotel is its location. The aerobus from the airport stops at the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√òniversitat√à√\u2020\u2022?which is just 2 minutes walk from the hotel. You have to walk to the Pla√ã√©?a de Catalunya to catch the return bus, but this is just about 5 minutes away. A single bus ticket is from the airport is less than √à√\u2020√ü? and would recommend this as a convenient way of getting into Barcelona.Furthermore, the hotel is perfectly situated to access the tourist attractions North, South East and West of it. We walked to most of these districts and it is minutes from the hive of activity - Las Ramblas. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be fooled however, although on the map Parc Guell and Montju√ã√\u2022√ác appear to be close proximity they are up a very steep incline. As one of our restaurant waitresses warned us -with her one English word- we would be √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ârazy√à√\u2020\u2022?to walk there. However these sites were easily accessible on the Metro.As we were staying for six nights we booked a deluxe room with a private patio. The room itself turned out to be disappointingly small, and it would have been perfect to have some form of focal lighting so that we could sit outside after dark.We booked our room through the hotel website. Be warned that it does not include the 7% tax, nor does it include the √à√\u2020√ü?\/person that they charge for breakfast. The website also says that you can get free access to the pool and roof top terrace at its sister Hotel Majestic. Unfortunately it was undergoing renovation and would not be open until May 2008.The hotel receptionists were very helpful, fluent in English and gave good recommendations for restaurants etc.The hotel is clean, modern and provides you with an ample breakfast to start the day to see beautiful Barcelona.
