{"text":"Just what we wanted Just returned from Amsterdam and had a great weekend.it took us a long time to choose this hotel and it was ok. The location was great, although we did arrive at night and the road was initially a bit scary, but soon got use to it. We walked from Central station and this took no more than 5 minutes(after dicing with the trams and bikes LOL).The hotel is very secure, has a 24 hour reception and bar, after about 9pm you have to be buzzed into the reception.The rooms were perfectly adequate and we had our room cleaned and fresh towels every day. Which we were not expecting. No hair dryer in the rooms though despite being advertised.Location of Hotel was great, walking distance to everything. We were to a curry house off Warmstratt down one of the side roads that leads to the RLD, called karma Sutra would highly reomend it, was lovely. Would also recomend Dirty Nelly a bit futher up for a great Irish bar and lovely food.As mentioned, hotel was great, We paid √ä√£¬¢420 Euros for 4 nights, with the Euro being so weak against the √ä√£¬¢ this worked out a bit more expensive than we wanted, I really belive you pay for the location. I would not hesitate in recomending this to my friends.Finally, the secirity and safety in the area I found great, as 2 girls in their late 20's we felt very safe, RLD is patrolled by police and also undercover guards.
