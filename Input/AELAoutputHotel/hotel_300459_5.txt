{"text":"A fantastic service : Director of guest experience The very first time I met Concierge Jerome Palacoeur was in Bora Bora at the InterContinental Le Moana resort, I had been pushed in the pool of the resort by some √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°riends √Å¬∂√ë and when I walked out of the water he was standing there with a towel, a new dry key for my villa and a dry telephone chip for my mobile, that was in December 2002 and I was impressed.A few years later I found out he was head concierge of the acclaimed InterContinental Thalasso Spa in Bora Bora and returned to Bora Bora without knowing my stay would be that memorable Thanks to Monsieur Palacoeur. It was my wifes√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ birthday and I asked Jerome to have some ballon brought to my overwater villas by outrigger canoe; any concierge can organise this, even in Bora Bora but a GOOD concierge is going a step further by asking the color of the balloons and this is what Monsieur Palacoeur did, again I was impressed.Lately I staid at the ANA Intercontinental Tokyo and discovered that Jerome was there as Director of guest experience, a challenge for him, a definite plus for the guests of this hotel. In a few months he has been in Tokyo, J. Palacoeur managed with his team to offer the real concierge √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√™l√ã√\u2022√ñs d√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√Ør√à√\u2020\u2022?service. He is everywhere and knows everything, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know how he does it but he and his team certainly deliver the experience a guest is looking for in a hotel such as the ANA InterContinental. This is not the best hotel in town in terms of service and quality, but thanks to Jerome, Japan and Tokyo have become for me a much easier destination to deal with than in the past : just to name a few of these Concierge experiences : my business cards in Japanese were ready within 2 hours (they could have been in my room if I ordered them in advance), my suits pressed upon check in in 60 minutes and best of all he has an incredible network and address book that gives him access to a 3 *** Michelin restaurant or a concert ticket for the Who√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ who will be performing in town in October. Monsieur Palacoeur you may soon be a legend in the small world of Palace concierge around the world and will definitively make sure to stay again at the ANA InterContinental Tokyo or wherever you may end up in the world . Merci beaucoup Monsieur as you would say in French !
