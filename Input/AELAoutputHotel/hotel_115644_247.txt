{"text":"Pleasant Stay Old fashioned hospitality in a perfectly maintained hotel, at a great price, in a top notch area! The employees at this hotel are friendly, helpful and welcoming. Plus the hotel is attractive and clean. The manager should give himself a pat on the back as he obviously knows his job and does it well. Our room looked just like the web site. Starched white bedding against a nice green wall. Looking out our window we could see beautiful Union Square all decked out for Christmas. The elevator worked and was never overly busy. The free coffee in the lobby was better than the diner's next door...and always available (along with cookies and daily newspapers). The free internet in the lobby was helpful as were the people at the front desk who seemed glad to help you find restaurants etc. We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel's restaurant because so many tripadvisors raved about Sears which is next door...so wanted to try that...but saw a very intersting specials board when we got back, and wished we had eaten there instead. The hotel gave us free cable car tickets which we used to go to Fishermans Wharf where we took a boat to Alcatraz. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping. Saks 5th Ave is across the street and there's a huge Macy's, and too many other stores to name them all...lots of designer shops too. Union Square is sort of in the middle of the city, so every area is within walking distance. We walked to China town, the Embacardo, and Nob Hill.
