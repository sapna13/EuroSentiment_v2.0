{"text":"More like a 3 star Signature is the tour operator that we went with. Our rep told us this hotel was new to them and wasn't even sure what star rating it was. I told her it was a 3 plus in the book but was told that was a mistake as other websites are all selling it as a 4 star. It is NOT a 4 star.  Punta Cana itself is a very beautiful area with clear waters and white sand beaches, this hotel had a nice beach with some coral areas that you could scuba and check out. Beach was kind of dirty at times but that wasn't one of my concerns. I will always give the beaches in Punta Cana high ratings.FOOD-1 starI've never been a picky eater but this restaurant had terrible food. Same thing every morning , lunch and evening at the buffet. People were lined up to get in and waiting as the hotel over booked and at times it seemed like there was never any glasses, cutlery or enough food to go around. No wonder people were lining up. The 3 a la cartes were also very bad, I didn't finish my food once, steak was scary, seafood wasn't even peeled in the soup, and the italian was a joke. I was only offered a drink once in the whole week I was there even though they were offering wine. There is a container of water on each table but you have to run after the servers to get another drink. Grounds- 3 plus starGrounds were very nice, very cool birds all around including flamingos. There is a spa and a gym but only one pool. You have to get your chairs early or they will be gone very early. Service-2 starService is the worst I have observed at any place I have stayed. While sitting in my room the cleaners and other help would briefly knock and enter the room without waiting for my response. Our air conditioning took 2 days to be looked at and fixed plus during dinners the wait staff never asked if you wanted a drink or offered tea or coffee during breakfast. It almost seemed the staff were just not trained to ask these questions AND i had to literally run after the staff each time to get a drink. I always thought asking someone if they wanted a drink was the first question to ask others when they come into a restaurant. I think the problem here is the management is not training or supervising the staff enough to ensure good service to customers and they overbooked too many guests. The hotel had to send away over 30 guests to other resorts. Room- 3 starRoom was the basic kind, bring your blow dryer. The one thing that was nice about the room was all came with a patio or balcony. Beware of the mini bar, very expensive and people had troubles with this. Staff said they took items when they didn't and items are very expensive. Overall I would choose another hotel if I went back to Punta Cana and I would only say it would be worth it to stay here if you got a REALLY CHEAP DEAL.
