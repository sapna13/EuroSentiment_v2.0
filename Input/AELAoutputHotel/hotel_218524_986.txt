{"text":"Excellence Club is the BEST ! We LOVED the Excellence CLUB Package when stayed at Excellence Punta Cana for 14 days during the first two weeks of May, '07 ! ... Very tired when we arrived, Roberto, Excellence Club Manager, showed us 2 other rooms besides the one\/type we had requested. He had compassion and empathy on how tired we were, when we arrived late at night. All our room needs were met ...Thank you, Roberto !We had immediate attention to anything that we did not have in our room, including extra towels etc. The wood of the dressers, closets etc. had a musty smell, and as the Excellence Resort continues to update their resort, we trust they incorporate wood furnishings that do not hold the musty odor, as well the fabrics of the drapes, bedspread etc. ... although the room was very clean, fabric, woods etc., can be replaced with a oror retardent ingredient that will eliminate the musty odor.Excellent service was given by, not only Roberto in the Excellence Club, but Jocasta in the Grill, little Juan on the Excellence Club Beach, Kelvin in the French Rest. and especially Santos in the Excellence Club Room where he waited on us ... hand and foot and started our day off with Cappies each morning ! The fact that we were able to communicate with our business, our friends and family ... via e-mail was a great feature for us !Also, we thought the food was outstanding and the service excellence .... Only Restaurant we did not enjoy was the Lobster House ... The French was fantastic as well as the Grill ! We missed not having a  Beach Bar \/ Grill  on the Beach for Lunch ... That should be added to the property.Although we have been to Punta Cana 4 times,our expectations were exceeded @ Excellence Punta Cana. We used ALL the amenities in the Excellence CLUB and would always purchase that Package when returning to the Resort. We travel to the Islands at least once a year and it's always a MUST to carry insect repellent with you and use a little each evening .... particularly on your legs and arms.Thank you Excellence Club Punta Cana for a GREAT Holiday !Penelope Hustins Crane  Paul Crane, Nova Scotia ","annotations":[{"endOffset":15,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":11},{"endOffset":58,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":54},{"endOffset":58,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":54},{"endOffset":58,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":54},{"endOffset":213,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":209},{"endOffset":213,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":209},{"endOffset":981,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":981,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":977},{"endOffset":1043,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1039},{"endOffset":1122,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1118},{"endOffset":1783,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1779},{"endOffset":1783,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1779},{"endOffset":1783,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1779},{"endOffset":1783,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1779},{"endOffset":1783,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1779},{"endOffset":2052,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2048}]}
