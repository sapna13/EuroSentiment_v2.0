{"text":"Really clean, good service Stayed in London July 4-10 to sight-see. The Park City was our hotel the entire time. We were very happy, and would gladly stay here again if it was just the two of us. Great location, close to the museums, and sub stops (Earl's Court and Gloucester). The #74 bus route has a stop at the end of the street the hotel is on, and is very convenient to ride to Hyde Park\/museums\/Baker St, etc. It's great sometimes to catch the bus when you don't feel like walking the extra blocks to the Underground station. Sainsbury's grocery (like Kroger's in US) was just a five-minute walk away, and since there was a small fridge in the room, we bought soft drinks\/water at the grocery to have during the day. The neighborhood the hotel is in is quiet, and seemed safe. The hotel itself has a very helpful concierge staff, nice lounge\/waiting area, and delivers the London paper every morning to your room. They also have copies of USA Today in the hotel lobby, which is nice. They have a business center, but we didn't use it, as there was an inexpensive Internet Cafe about a block away which cost a little less to use. Our room was standard and small compared to US standards, but apparently that's to be expected in London hotels, and since there's so much to see\/do, who wants to stay in the room anyway? Our room had about a foot of space on either side of the bed, one small round table with two chairs, a desk with a chair, a closet with a safe inside, and a nice sized bathroom with an extra-large shower head and large tub. There was not much room to walk around, most of the floor space was taken with the bed, desk, table, closet, etc. All the furniture was sleek and looked new, with clean simple lines. The water in the bathroom was always hot, and the bed in the room was queen-sized, super soft and comfortable with lots of pillows. They kept the room spotless, and had free turn-down service every afternoon. It was a little stuffy\/warm in the hall outside the room, but the temperature in the room was always comfortable. There is a lift (elevator) to get to the higher floors. We payed about $150 US per night, and felt it was a good deal. There is a movie cinema close by that shows the latest US movies, and a post office right across the street from the Earl's Court tube station if you want to mail postcards home. One note of caution. We asked for a wake-up call the day we were leaving, and received one, but it was thirty minutes later than we asked for...not a big deal, but you might want to bring your own alarm clock.
