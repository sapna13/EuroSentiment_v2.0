{"text":"Great Spring Getaway My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights the first week of April. We had a fantastic time. We arrived at night and the hotel was beautifully lit. Upon entry the staff was very friendly and helpful. Walking to our room we were a little nervous as we had to walk to the back of the hotel and down the stairs. When we got into our room we were pleasantly surprised. The room was definitely one of the nicer rooms we have been in. Everything was very clean and updated. Our room had a small patio area that overlooked a water with a fountain. My husband is in sales and stays in hotel rooms across the country every week. He was impressed with the both the room and bathroom. The grounds of the hotel are spectacular. We found something new to explore every day we were there. We didn't find the pools to be too crowded. There are a variety of locations to sit at and enjoy the pools and waterfalls. We found the lazy river a nice place to sit near since it kept people moving by and not constantly splashing or yelling right in your face. There were also other locations through out the pool area that were quiet and relaxing just to sit and listen to the water falls. My husband is a Gold member and we had access to the spa fitness facility. Which was also very nice with ellipticals and tread mills with tv's attached as well as a variety of free weights and machines. The Desert Ridge mall is with in walking distance and offers a variety of great places to eat and shop.We at at Roy's one night which was fantastic. We had a lunch a few times at the pool and the staff was very accommodating. We had a great time seeing the wild life too. We made friends with a duck, got to see a nest of great horned owls at the spa and saw a variety of birds and bunnies. I was a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews. I do have to say some of them are a bit critical. My husband stays at various hotels across the U.S. every week. And he was very impressed with the grounds, room and service here. He pointed out that rarely does he find a hotel that has free internet access, few that have rooms that are as nice as these, and very few that have bathrooms as nice as this. Yes there are kids here and people enjoying their vacations, if that bothers you there are plenty of spaces around the 4 pools, hot tubs, lawns or spa that provide privacy.
