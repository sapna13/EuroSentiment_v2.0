{"text":"Friendliest experience in Italy! Our family of five (2 adults and 3 children 15, 13,11) stayed for 2 nights in October and loved it! While my husband parked our rental car, I ran ahead up the stairs to book in and was greeted by the lovely, smiling face of Gassim who quickly went to the fridge and handed me an icy bottle of water. My husband brought our daughter in a wheelchair plus our luggage up and was very warmly greeted by Gassim who offered us help in getting us into our gorgeous suite. It was two huuuuge rooms plus a bathroom, so cool and relaxing and not to mention spotlessly clean.While we were marvelling at the space and settling in, there was a knock at our door and there was Gassim with a tray of iced juice for all of us! I can honestly say, in our week in Italy, he was the kindest, friendliest person we came into contact with.Our children loved it so much they wanted to cancel our 2 nights planned in Sorrento and stay on in Florence!The hotel is, indeed in a very ordinary, nondescript building on the 1st and 2nd floor so if you aren't prewarned you could really miss it. Luckily I had read all my Tripadvisor info so was armed with good, useful information!.The breakfast was enough to start the day with and Gassim was always on hand to get you anything you requested, nothing was ever a problem.I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone... I haven't seen the rooms but the suite was just beautiful and, as mentioned, the service was so warm and spot on. As I wrote in their guest book.... I just wanted to put Gassim in my pocket and take him home.I hope you read this Gassim!
