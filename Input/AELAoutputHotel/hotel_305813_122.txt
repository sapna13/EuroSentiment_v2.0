{"text":"Loved the Langham We read many reviews, and tried to find a hotel in Hong Kong that offered luxury, but at a relatively affordable price. We wound up booking the Langham in Mong Kok. We booked a 2 room suite on the club floor through the hotel's web site (which I would highly recommend surfing, it's a little complex but the best deals for this hotel are there), at a little over $400 per night. While, as most people state, we found it a little out of the way, the hotel was wonderful. First, I would highly recommend the club floor rooms. the rooms are higher up, offering relief from the claustrophobia of Hong Kong. Second, the club lounge was excellent - and, like the rest of the hotel, it just grows and grows on you. It's open 24 hours, unheard of in this day and age, and offers breakfast, many courses of light appetizers, sweets at night, and drinks of all kinds, both soft and alcoholic, and champagne at certain hours. It also has 2 massage chairs, a business center with MAC's and PC's and printers, a DVD lending library, nice seating, and a nice staff, and expresso maker (which I loved, expresso every day, and excellent expresso at that). Next, the rooms. while they were a bit smallish for a suite, they had wonderful fit-and-finish, comfortable beds, 2 bathrooms and 2 flat panel TV's. Add a nice pillow menu (try it, they're not kidding, order your own pillow and it will be cheerfully delivered), internet phones with color displays, free internet access. All in, you're quite comfortable. Oh, I might add, and this was not clear at all (either from reading TripAdvisor or from the staff), if you're staying on the club floor, you can go down to the lobby restaurant for the sumptuous full breakfast (it's downright decadent), for FREE! It's probably the largest breakfast buffet I've ever seen (and I travel extensively). The only way we figured this out was to take a table and try it, as we got conflicting answers from the staff as to whether it was included in the club floor rate or not.The hotel also has an excellent Gym, nice locker rooms, slippers, fluffy robes, turndown service, an assortment of magazines in your room when you get there, daily newspapers, and more. The spa area was particularly nice and you don't need to go to a spa treatment to use it. The rooftop pool was also great, and if you want to venture further in the hotel, there is a complete business center on the 5th or 6th floor with about a dozen computers. Use of the computers is free. The one thing I would point out is that this hotel IS out of the way. On Sunday morning (no pedestrian traffic), it took us about 30 minutes at a steady, brisk walk to get to the Kowloon waterfront. I highly recommend taking cabs (and I usually walk everywhere), they are excellent, incredibly cheap, and very helpful. I think our average cab ride was about $4 anywhere in Kowloon. I can't wait to go again.
