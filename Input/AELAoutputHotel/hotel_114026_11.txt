{"text":"Fun in the Sun We stayed at the Parc for five nights in April. The hotel is very clean and modern. Rooms are a nice size. Our room was on the top floor and had a view of the ocean and the city scape. The hotel is a two minute walk to the beach and you are around the corner from the main drag where there are tons of shops and restaurants. We had a late flight and had to check out at noon, but the hotel has a complementary shower\/bathroom\/changing room which was very clean and well stocked and was great after a day at the beach before our flight home.  THe front desk staff is nice and they provide mats, towels and water every day for you. There is a tour desk in the lobby, but when I was there the man did not speak very much English and just gave me a bunch of pamflets and we ended up booking a tour on our own.  The area of Waikiki is reminesent of Miami in that it is a beach in the middle of the city, but I highly recommend checking out the surround areas. We took a bus tour to the North Shore which is beautiful and mountain biked in the mountains on the West side of the Island where Lost and Jurassic Park were shot. Great eats and an overall wonderful experience! We also did not rent a car, its not really necessary if you do not want to. There is public transportation which we did not try but there are tons of cabs and tours and walking is a great way to see things!
