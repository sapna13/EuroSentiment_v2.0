{"text":"modern chic within 50 feet of Ponte Vecchio Absolutely fantastic experience.I booked this hotel as part of a special long weekend to propose to my girlfriend. I emailed the hotel to ask about my room and if it had a balcony - i received an email back stating i was being upgraded to the Junior Suite (very large sofa TV room, large modern bedroom and double basin bathroom). This certainly made an impact and highlighted the personal touch of the hotel. On arrival the reception staff and porter were very helpful and accommodated our request for wine and champagne glasses - they assisted with the ideas and options of food and drink. We ate at the Hotel Savoy which was fantastic, limited menu but impeccable service as expected. I would recommend the Golden View Open Bar Restaurant (just over and to the left of the Ponte Vecchio - you may need to book) but it was very busy with a good mix of locals and tourists, live jazz band playing in the background but was not intrusive - excellent wine menu and food was glorious.All in all the whole experience was fantastic, an Italian city full of excitement and things to do - its very centred on the art and craft world (obviously) but if you are like me, who enjoys the sun, relaxing and eating nice food and e people watching then Florence is the place for you - its not cheap, but remember to haggle at the markets and with the fake-good guys where there are plenty on the road to the Ponte Vecchio. Also, remember if you book a taxi you pay from when you actually book (our taxi was 18 euros to the train station...!Enjoy.
