{"text":"Wow this is a Radisson? In my personal opinion, I usually find Radisson hotels to be the bottom of the three star class. They look ok from a distance but when you get up close they are brimming with problems. This was a pleasant exception. This is a very nice three star hotel. All of the staff I encountered was friendly and helpful. The room was almost perfectly clean (and I think there is no better complement for a hotel than that) The forward Hilton-like space maximizing design of the room was nice as well. The sleep number bed was great. The shuttle to the airport takes eight minutes (I timed it) One other great thing about this place is the proximity to this Asian cultural center food area\/office complex two blocks north of the hotel. It is hard to see from the road. When you get past the Chinese garden and walk in the arches you discover a whole asian mall full of Chinese restaraunts and a vietnamese superstore. The only problems I could see would have to be the lack of a business center. That is pretty inexcusable for an airport hotel. Especially since they can make it pay for itself if they want to. Another issue might be the staffing at the counters. They were nice, but they really needed a couple of extra people when I was there. The line was too long, but I was only there one night, might have been a fluke. All in all a great place. I would gladly stay there again.
