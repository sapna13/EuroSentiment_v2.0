{"text":"Slightly Above Average For about $99 a night, Hotel Milano is above average since most hotels charge much more. No coffee maker and no air conditioning. However, it's directly next door to a shopping center, Nordstrom's and some pricey shopping areas. It's about 3 blocks away from Union Square so you've got to be out of shape if you think it's too far. The BART train system and the trolly system is very close at about 100 yrds away. Some reviews talked about a seedy area; the truth is that everything from here thru Chinatown have beggars at every street corner; you just say no and they'll leave you alone. Friday and Saturday night in the local area is packed full of people. Only go north along Powell or Mason street for things to do; south on 5th or west on market don't offer anything. Anything west or east from powell by 3 blocks gets you more beggars and prostitutes √à√\u2020\u2022?yep, San Francisco, aside from the nice areas, has a lot of destitute folks. Go to Cityscape at the Hilton hotel for a fantastic view and go to Union square for a ticket store that sell half price tickets. We went to the american conversatory theatre on Geary street; definitely worth it but buy the tickets at that half price ticket store called Bay area tickets. At the bottom of Hotel Milano is a fairly good thai restaurant with a wide variety menu; it's open late and drinks\/food are fairly cheap at $10 below. The wireless internet they offer is not dependable all the time but it's affordable at 10 buck a day. I walked around during the past few days; the other hotels are about the same league as Milano unless you want to stay (and pay extra) at the big hotel chains: Hilton, Hyatt, etc. We also went to Santorini restauarant on Geary for some Greek food; really good and highly recommended. Later, we ate at Neptune√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ seafood at Pier 39 Fisherman√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ wharf for the best view; most restaurant at the pier have some view but this is by far the best. Bottom line -- Find a hotel as close to Powell as everything you need is right there!!
