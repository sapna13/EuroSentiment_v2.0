{"text":"Excellence in Punta Cana The Excellence Resort in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic was... well... Excellent! The staff are great! Always busy and always trying to help. Not everyone speaks english, but they all try very hard. If they came to Canada the staff at our hotels would be hard pressed to find anyone who speaks spanish so I certainly don't hold that against them!The activities staff were really great! We had so much fun with Julio, Isabel, Franklin and Ines! Julio kept it interesting by sneaking up on my husband regularly and running a finger over his toes so that he thought a bug was on him or tapping him on the opposite shoulder and walking away. We've made it our new goal to try to sneak up on him at least once before we leave in about 24 hours! :) My husband spent time outside the disco chatting with some of the staff and especially enjoyed Franklin's company (I was feeling a bit under the weather so he was forced to go stag a few nights). Beach volleyball was my husband's fave activity and I enjoyed a few aerobics classes. We played a few games and won a couple of bottles of Dominican rum and some pretty necklaces.The beach was stunning! Body surfing and boogie boarding special!!! The waves are not for people who cannot swim though so be forewarned. If you're not a strong swimmer you may be better off in one of the resort's 2 pools! Snorkelling off the eastern point of the beach was amazing! Clear waters, beautiful coral, tons of colourful fish, at least 2 diff types of urchins (there are a lot of these so watch out cause they hide in the coral) and starfish as well. If the water is a bit rough I'd suggest flippers - just some added control against the tides. I certainly didn't need the life jacket for the boogie boarding or snorkeling so just left it on the beach with my stuff because they make you take one when you sign out flippers or boards etc.The resort itself is beautiful! So much greenery and flowers! Ponds and fountains everywhere! And the wildlife is great! There are a bunch of flamingoes, ducks of all sorts, peacocks, and two beautiful mostly red parrots - they will be happy to sit on your shoulder, but watch out cause they really like shiny things! They were trying to steal the metal thingies on my safari hat, they did manage to steal another lady's sunglasses, and I've heard that they go after earings as well. That could hurt! :) But they make for a great photo op. We met so many great people while visiting the Excellence Resort and were impressed with how frendly everyone was. You never had to eat dinner alone if you prefered to have company! If you want to take a tour we strongly suggest the Bavarro Runners. This tour around some of the Dominican countryside was an amazing experience! Such a fun day! We visited a sugarcane farm (mmm - yummy), a little village where they process chocolate and coffee amoungst other things, a beach ranch where we got to ride some horses, and a neat cave! Pedro was a fun tourguide and Wilson was a great driver! Don't miss this one!We had a few too many days of rain during our 2 week stay, but that's just our lucky nature coming into play. :) We strongly suggest this resort! It was nice and secluded being the last resort in the strip and we didn't have to wear any plastic bracelets during our stay! The beds on beach and poolside are really cool, the all inclusive waiter service on beach was AWESOME, the fact that room service was also included was INCREDIBLE!!! We loved it!- Wendy and Chris ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2271,"mention":"hat","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Hat"],"startOffset":2268},{"endOffset":2864,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":2855},{"endOffset":2875,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2869},{"endOffset":2912,"mention":"ranch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ranch_dressing"],"startOffset":2907}]}
