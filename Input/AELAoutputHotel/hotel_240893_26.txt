{"text":"Awful! don't stay here A friend and I stayed here for 4 nights recently - April 2007. The whole hotel was smelly and dirty. It needs renovating for a start... The worst part was that our room smelt of urine and some other unknown bad stench...After booking a double room we were put in a single room, or had to face paying an extra 15USD per night. Also, on arrival i had to sign a form to say we weren't allowed to burn candles in the room or smoke (which is fine! although we were tempted to buy scented candles! even though the only thing to get rid of the smell would be to burn the whole place down!) but the piece of paper stated that these things could damage their LOVELY rooms - lovely ha!The complimentary breakfast was a pot of coffee on a tiny table opposite the reception desk.The location is ok - it's the only positive point i can think of. fairly easy to get to other areas.On our last night, the toilet leaked and flooded the bathroom and some of the carpet by morning. I'm sure this must have been a problem before and contributed to the bad odour in our room and throughout the hotel. I would not consider staying in this hotel again. even if you're on a tight budget, don't bother. go to the York next door, or search for another cheap hotel. I've stayed in many cheap hotels and this is one of the worst. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":745,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":739}]}
