{"text":"Loved view  My husband and I booked this charming hotel following all the positive tripadvisor reviews. We made a right decision.We stayed in two different rooms: Room #25 for the first 4 nights, and in Room #56 for another 2 nights after coming back from our overnight trip to MSM\/ San Malo. Both chambles were worth the rate -- cleaned everyday, hot nice shower always.Room #25 (on the second floor): Only the top 1\/3 of the Tower Eiffel was seen, but the room was quite spacious for Paris standard -- two opened suites cases, no problem. Shower w\/ bathtub, separate bathroom. Room #56 (on the top floor): Marvelous view of the Tower Eiffel through the window\/ from the balcony, especially when lighted up at night. It even twinkled every hour, at 9, 10 11 and 12 midnight, which perfectly highlighted our stay in Paris. Though the room and bed were rather small, we fitted OK, but may not be such a recommendation for larger people. Shower w\/ bathtub, bathroom in the same room. Service: All the staffs were always so pleasant. People at the reception spoke very good English and helped us finding our way getting around Paris, they were always quite busy helping out people. We also liked breakfast in our room, nice caf√ã√\u2022√ñ and kind ladies who brought the plate with nice smile. Food (dinner): Our No.1 recommendation is 7 me Sud, 10 minutes from the hotel, on the Mont Piquet Ave, always packed with locals and tourists. Try their 20 euros course menu. I had Foie Gras as entr√ã√\u2022√ñe, Dug Fillet as main plate, and candied pear w\/ vanilla ice cream as dessert. The best a la carte was Escargot (in Takoyaki plate). Had two red wine (full-size bottle), and it was 85 euros.Mariko, Japan ","annotations":[{"endOffset":356,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":352},{"endOffset":1278,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1274},{"endOffset":1476,"mention":"Foie Gras","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Foie_gras"],"startOffset":1467},{"endOffset":1546,"mention":"vanilla","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mille-feuille","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Vanilla"],"startOffset":1539},{"endOffset":1556,"mention":"ice cream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream"],"startOffset":1547},{"endOffset":1614,"mention":"Takoyaki","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Takoyaki"],"startOffset":1606}]}
