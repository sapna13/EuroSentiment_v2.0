{"text":"Stay at the Casablanca but it's not like other places aren't as good I stayed at the Casablanca for six days, so I definitely feel I have enough experience to write a solid review. First, I agree with another reviewer here that the room you stay in is important. Ours was facing a wall, and while that sounds dismal, it was amazingly quiet. The air conditioning is not central air, just a unit in the window, but the nice thing was you could control the temperature easily and by yourself. The not nice thing was that the room would get cold extremely quickly, and then get hot if you turned off the A\/C. Oh, well.I was looking forward to the famous cookies the Casablanca website boasts but they were just Oreo cookies and that confused me. There is free Internet access which was a nice touch for some last minute information-gathering or to check in with family back home. (I'd like to add it was my boyfriend and I on this trip, and we are both in our mid-20s. Most of the other people at the hotel at the time we were there were 40+)There are pros and cons to staying that close to Times Square. Pros include an amazing subway station half a block away that connects to everything, which is great if you are thinking of taking the subway. Another pro was that it was fairly midtown, so you could walk to places downtown and uptown. The cons were that it was a hugely busy area at all times, so if you just wanted to go for a nice evening walk, there were always hundreds of people, and most of the restaurants right around the hotel were always very busy because of the pre-and-post Broadway show crowds. I thought that the guys who work there were nice, but nothing amazingly special like some people say. I've definitely had nicer and more helpful service at other places. It annoyed me that for a local call I was chared 90 cents (I just wanted to see if a store was open on Memorial Day), but that's just hotel politics. I did not believe the bed we received was a queen - they said it was, but then the queen is quite small, so be prepared. The bathroom was much larger than I thought. They had a DVD player and DVDs you could watch, but ours was so scratched up it didn't play at all, so don't count on that feature. The buffet breakfast really was very nice, and had something for every kind of eater.There is a 24-hour Duane Read (like a Walgreen's or Shopper's Drug Mart) right around the corner if you need anything you don't want to pack (like liquids, hehe). Overall, I would say my experience was positive, but I don't think it was so unique that another hotel could not have produced the same result.
