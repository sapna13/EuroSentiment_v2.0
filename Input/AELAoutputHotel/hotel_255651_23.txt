{"text":"Quite Comfortable I had my doubts about this hotel prior to leaving home. I had read the reviews in this site and was even having thoughts about cancelling the whole 3 nights accommodation I had with them√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?I am glad that I did not. I am going to make my review in point form:Good\/Avarage Points:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√üllowed us to check in 40 min earlier then the 2pm check-in and did not charge us for it.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?lenty of parking available.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬©omfortable rooms.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬∫ery friendly housekeeping staff on our floor. Nothing was too much trouble for them. Extra towels, extra tea\/coffee\/milk\/sugar. At one point he said to me that I could just help myself at the cart and get whatever we needed. Great! They were on our floor for most of the day.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√ò had to call housekeeping once because a light bulb went out. I though I would be waiting for ages. I was very surprised to hear a knock on the door within 5 min and it was fixed.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬\u2022O MINIBAR IN THE ROOM. I thought this was great! There are fully stocked minibars located near the lifts on each floor. You simply go to reception and ask for a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u201AÑ¢martbar√à√\u2020\u2022?card and you swipe the card and grab what you like and pay upon check out. This eliminates temptation and the accidents of children opening chocolate bars  chips and disputes upon checking out.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬©onvenient location to the airport with complimentary pick-up and drop-off was only $4 AUD per person.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?rain to the city is only a 10min walk across a park to Wolli Creek station. Ticket on the train for an adult to the city return a bargain at under $5 AUD for a 10-15min train trip.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?axi fare from the centre of the city to the hotel was I thought fair at $24AUD.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬Æuffet breakfast I thought was ok, a bit pricey for it though. Your typical scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, grilled tomatoes, pancakes (No maple syrup though!), toast, cereal choices, tea, coffee, juice, yoghurts, fresh fruits and a few Asian dishes (miso soup, rice etc.)Bad points:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√ò found the food at the hotel a little pricey for what it was. Room service was I thought very pricey for what it was eg: $14AUD for a bowl of wedges, $12AUD for a piece of mud cake.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?e ended up having to buy food whilst shopping in the city and also bringing back extra food to the hotel to eat. Other options we did was to take the hotel shuttle to the Int. Airport and eat in the food court area. There is also a bakery and caf√ã√\u2022√ñ located near the Wolli Creek train station  there is a Rowing club where I was told later, that you could get food there also.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ¬\u2022ot much to do during the evening.I hope this helps  happy travels.T4 ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1293,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1284},{"endOffset":1305,"mention":"chips","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":1300},{"endOffset":1876,"mention":"pancakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pancake"],"startOffset":1868},{"endOffset":1908,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1903},{"endOffset":1929,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1926},{"endOffset":1937,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1931},{"endOffset":2002,"mention":"miso soup","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Miso_soup"],"startOffset":1993},{"endOffset":2216,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":2212},{"endOffset":2216,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":2212},{"endOffset":2216,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":2212},{"endOffset":2216,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":2212},{"endOffset":2216,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":2212},{"endOffset":2546,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2542}]}
