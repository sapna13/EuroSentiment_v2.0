{"text":"Loved Barcelo Bavaro Palce I just got back on the 1st and I had the Best experience in the Barcelo Bavaro Palace the workers were really nice and friendly , they had really good food if you like latin food really good shows and my kids loved it the have day care for you to leave you todlers while you experience the massages the pool and beach you can pay 15 american dollars to have your self a nanny for the day to take care of your children who are under 2 years old and from 4yrs old - 12 yrs they entertain your children with games actiities, train rides all types of activities I am sorry but everyone who has a bad review on this hotel are crazy. First of all you have to remember you are going to the caribbean to a Spanish Country were all the speak is spanish and were they speak very little english or no english if you go to another country or spain or where ever you know you are not going to under stand them if you want an english speaking vacation stay in AMERICA dont experience in other countries. Dominican people are known as very nice and with a funny caracter. and I am American but you see the worker are tierd that is because they work from 5 am till 12 pm straight wont you be tierd if that was you? BUT I DO RECOMMEND that if you are not a latin food lover or are a very grumpy person who only expect an english language and dont under stanf the fact that you are in a counrty where all they speak is spanish DONT GO STAY IN AMERICA.
