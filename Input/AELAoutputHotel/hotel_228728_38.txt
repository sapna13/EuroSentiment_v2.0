{"text":"Very average, possibly overpriced. Did a lot of reading on TA to find perfect hotel, but think I might have got better value for money elsewhere I'm afraid. The hotel is very modern and trendy and the service very friendly, but sadly the room size and a few other drawbacks, meant that I couldn't give a better review.We were given an upgrade on arrival, but I'll be honest, unless the upgrade meant we got a mini bar... I really can't believe it was a proper upgrade. The room was very small and compact, and if we were rightly upgraded to a suite then I'd hate to have spent even more money (which I nearly did prebooking) on such a small suite.I have been to Paris before and I am aware that rooms are small most places, but fo rthe money I spent I'd have expected better. We were unfortunately right across a small street from an Irish bar.... which at the weekend allows it patrons to drink outside while smoking.... EXTREMELY LOUD... to the point you can't possibly ignore it. Adults with suits acting like kids... both fri and sat nights.We also ordered room service. My partner tried to order just a plain baguette with cheese, which they said they couldn't do as it's not on the menu!!! The food was very poor too for the money. A club sandwhich, drenched in dressing that it turned to mush. Chips were cold and merely batter. We just popped it back outside hardly touched... but were still charged full price obviously.I'm really sorry I can't give it a better review. The location was excellent, but to be honest you could stay anywhere in Paris cos the metro is that good. I feel bad as the staff were lovely. Sadly, I'm not the type to exaggerate in a review. I wouldn't tell people not to book, but look around first.Sorry Marriot.
