{"text":"Lives up to the name! We stayed at Excellence Punta Cana August 23-27, 2008. This was my first visit to the Dominican Republic. I have stayed at several all-inclusive resorts in Mexico, and Excellence Punta Cana beat them all hands-down. The food, staff and facilities were all top-notch. This resort deserves 10 stars.We had no problems with our standard garden-view room. The room always stayed cool, and it was very spacious. We decided on saving money by booking the least expensive room because we planned on spending the majority of our vacation on the beach and in the pool- not in the room!Food was great. We ate all of our breakfasts at Toscana (buffet style). Some days we had lunch at Toscana and others at The Grill. Both restaurants were great for lunch. We had dinner at Chez Isabelle (great food!), Spice (small portions but good), The Grill (fantastic!), and The Lobster House (okay). Our least favorite was The Lobster House. The Grill was our favorite! GREAT steaks!The beach was pretty rough. Tropical Storm Fay had recently passed through, so 5-6' waves were commonplace on the beach. I found it almost impossible to snorkel on Excellence's beach and I am a very experienced swimmer. The pool at the resort is fantastic. Best drinks in the entire resort are at the swim-up pool bar (Blue). Dionel, Rafaelina and Hector all were fantastic. The staff at the resort really works hard at making every aspect EXCELLENT. We will definitely return to Excellence Punta Cana and highly recommend it to others! ","annotations":[]}
