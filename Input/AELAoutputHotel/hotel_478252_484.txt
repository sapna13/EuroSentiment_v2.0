{"text":"Loved It We have just returned from the bahia principe on the 2nd November 2007. I thought i would write a review about this hotel.We travelled with First Choice and we upgraded to premium on the flight which was well worth it. The cabin crew going out were fantastic and could not do enough for you.We arrived at Punta Cana airport which i must say is very nice.Little thatched huts which look lovely. One word of warning keep hold of your suitcases when you get them as there a alot of bell-boys waiting to take your cases off you and take them to your coach for you.I know this is a very nice touch but if i wanted them to take my cases i would of asked them.We were checked in on our coach on the way to the resort.We were given alot of information and also our wrist bands. When we drove throught the gates of the hotel i could not believe how magnificent the place was. Lucy the first choice rep come onto the coach to say a quick and very loud hello. We were then given a wonderful fruit punch and a welcome dance. We were then put onto a tram system and taken directly to our room with our luggage. We were in Villa 15 room 15304 which was fantastic. I have never been to such a clean resort. The staff there have always got a smile on there faces and nothing is to much trouble.The service is incredible.The whole resort is clean and tidy and the staff are working all day on the gardens to cleaning and polishing the floors in the lobby which i must say takes your breath away.It was my Daughters and my Mothers Birthdays while we were on holiday. I went and spoke to Guest Services and they decorated both room on the day of their birthdays. In the eve they were both given birthday cakes a wished happy birthday the domincan way which was fab.This hotel is fantastic the only down side really was there was not enough going on for my daughter who is 10. The mini disco never ran unless you can call a clown giving out sweets every-nite.I would not hesitate in returning to this hotel but maybe when my daughter is off doing her own thing in a few years.The weather is extremley hot.Factor 50 and still got burnt.
