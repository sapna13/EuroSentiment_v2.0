{"text":"Great location, great staff I stayed at the Hotel Regina for two weeks in February while on a business trip and was extremely pleased with the overall experience. As an American who speaks very little Spanish (and certainly no Catalan), I was put at ease by the staff who spoke very good English and were extremely accomodating. Both the front desk and bar staff called taxis on a moment's notice, filled all requests for needs in a timely manner and were very helpful with directions and providing local information about transportation, restaurants, etc.The room was modern, comfortable and included most of the usual ammenities (no coffee maker). Hairdryer was not very powerful and there was no iron (but desk provided one upon request). Unfortunately, my room was next to the maid's closet, close to the elevator, and view was of a small airshaft (from which I could hear the people in the same room on other floors when my windows were open). I believe it was room # 12 (212, 312, etc). If you get this room I would suggest moving as it is very noisy. I am returning in April and the front desk suggested I book a room at the front of the building. I did not eat breakfast at the hotel, as the cost was 17 Euros ($25 US), which seemed quite overpriced, but there are several places nearby to get breakfast or coffee - Starbucks, Cafe Catalunya, etc. The bar at the hotel is quiet and relaxing. My coworkers and I found it a great place to relax and have a cocktail after returning from dinner most nights.The location is very convenient, as the subway has several stops within a few blocks, the tourbus stops at the end of the block on Placa de Catalunya and, of course, the infamous Las Ramblas. Las Ramblas is about as touristy as it gets (do NOT eat there), but I would highly recommend visiting the market. As I'm sure you have heard already, be very aware of pickpockets. One of my coworkers was targeted on the subway and almost had her camera stolen out of her purse which was inside her backpack!Restaurant recommendations: Me' (my absolute favorite), Siete Portes, Cuidad Condal, O' Beach (for the view and atmosphere - NOT the food), Terrabachus.In summary, Barcelona is a wonderful city and the Regina Hotel is in the heart of it all. For a hotel at this price you can't ask for more.
