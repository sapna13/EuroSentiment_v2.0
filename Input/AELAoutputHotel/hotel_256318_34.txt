{"text":"Great location - Close to Kings Cross The hotel itself is located in a great spot, close to most anything you could need. I pretty much walked everywhere from here. Trains, taxi's and buses are all close. Many places to eat and markets nearby. When I arrived the kind woman at the desk helped me lug my suitcase up 2 long flights of stairs. (no lift) I don't know how I would have done it without her (and I work out). My room was nice, small but comfortable. There was no walk in closet as I read in one of the other reviews. But when I arrived there was classical music playing on the stereo in the room which was quite nice.The bathroom as grey tiled and with the dim lighting it was hard to see - especially in the shower. I also wish there had been a few hooks to hang things like towels and cosmetic case from. Internet access was available from your room if you had a laptop but it cost additional fees. I think it was $10 a day but can't remember. I took advantage of the use of a gym down the road. You pick up the pass at the front desk, show them at the gym, then drop the pass back at the front desk when you return. The gym was quite adequate and only about 5 blocks away.  Mini bar in the room was crammed with things (for purchase) so if you want to put anything in of your own, you need to remove items and what you put in must be small as it is designed for extra small bottles. The bar\/rest. was not open when I was there. When I needed a cab, the staff help hail one for me. Phone messages (all but one) were delivered to me. Everyone was very helpful. All the other places I stayed in Sydney  elsewhere in Australia were more economical but didn't offer the ammenities that the Kirketon had.
