{"text":"good for business I stayed a week on corporate rate at the fairmont south tower in a standard room in early february.what to say...let's start with possible improvements:- while about 10000 wireless access points in Singapore provide FREE internet access, it is high time that hotels do the same. Maybe they could limit the speed of the free access to 512kbps or something, but asking for more than 20SGD a day for that kind of commodity is not acceptable.- cleanliness: the room itself was quite nice, but it was not very clean. usually i am not very sensible to a little dust here and there, but the cleanliness of that room was sub-standard. for example, there was a lot of dust under the TV commode and it seemed that a guest had a bottle of coke or another sticky beverage explode on the table. the table itself had been cleaned, but the lamp and other parts of furniture were still dirty, as well as the floor where that happened (sticky dried-up drops).also in the bathroom, i would find a long dark hair everyday in the middle of the floor after room cleaning.mold between tiles in the bathroom is not much of a hygiene problem, but it would just look nicer if it was regularly bleached out (a few chlorine every 3-4 months could take care of that problem)the room cleaning staff is not thorough. additionally to finding dust and sticky stains in some places, I found two DVDs hidden by another guest under the bose radio. These were bad-quality porn DVDs, so I left them there.- room service\/equipment: the staff should focus on better attention to detail: the remote command of the bose radio was missing the battery and therefore didn't work.- irritating: when you call a lift and briefly press the button, it will light up, but can deactivate if you are too quick. that happened a few times, and was quite irritating, especially because the button lit up, so i thought the life was coming...- while the bad's mattress was ok, I wasn't too satisfied with the pillows, which are apparently filled with a synthetic foam, which caused me to sweat.now the positive:- my request for a non-smoker king size room was granted without trouble.- the staff was quite friendly.- the hotel is situated right next to the historic raffles, and on top a shopping mall and above the MRT (underground) station city hall.- there are direct entrances from levels 2 and 3 of the mall into the elevators, so it is very convenient for getting quickly to the room from the mall without having to pass the lobby.- if you have to check out late, they can give you access to a complementary guest suite (no bed) to wait on your plane.- 2 bottles of water are replaced every day- i will not post a list of everything that worked as expected, you can assume the rest of standard services was provided and working well.Overall, the Fairmont was not bad to stay in for business, but I feel the rate was too high (even the corporate one) for the delivered quality. Therefore, the Fairmont gets a rating of 3 from me.
