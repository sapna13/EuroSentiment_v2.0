{"text":"Lovely hotel, great position, rooms, garden, staff My wife and I spent 6 days at Hotel l'Abbaye, which we chose for two reasons; a friend of ours stayed there and recommended it highly and we lived next door (in an apartment) for 6 months and love the area. The hotel was excellent and we will stay there every time we are in Paris in future (finances permitting, it isn't cheap). The area is wonderful, a very quiet street but in the heart of St Germain des Pres a hop skip and a jump from the bustle of rue des Cannettes, the boutiques of Bd St Germain and the fabulous Luxembourg Gardens - and one minute to the metro and the buses (tip, use the buses in Paris if you can, they are cheap, regular and give you a great view of the city, and very easy to use).We paid for a slightly larger room and it was worth is - elegant, comfortable and a home away from home. The staff were excellent, the breakfast room, with its ivy covered courtyard and fountain are to die for, the breakfast is wonderful and the drinks and meals are surprisingly affordable and very nice.If you do stay I strongly recommend Cafe Cassette (particularly the salmon), just on the corner of rue Cassette and rue des Rennes, and the boulangerie one block up rue des Rennes is packed with locals getting their baguatte traditions and is a delight.OK, I'm biased, I love Paris, I love St Germain and I love rue Cassette but if you want a great hotel in the heart of the Left Bank action, yet a peaceful haven, you won't do better.One last tip - Positano in rue des Cannettes (just of Place St Sulpice) is a great Italian\/pizza place, but get there at 7pm when it opens to avoid the queues.
