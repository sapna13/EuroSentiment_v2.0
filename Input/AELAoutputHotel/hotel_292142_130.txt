{"text":"Very nice. Booked through travelocity - flight and hotel $2500 for 5 nights. my wife and i stayed in the junior suite (room #1001) which was clean and pretty large. kitchen included a dishwasher (which the maid ran with all our dirty dishes every day), a large fridge, dishes, pots and pans, microwave and coffee maker (unfortunately they give you puck's coffee wich is just terrible). living room has a very large desk, pull-out sofabed, a couple comfy chairs, huge mirrors, stereo, tv, internet connection and cable, decent view that isn't really anything to write home about. the bedroom is a decent size - you can move around the room very easily despite a king size bed. lots and lots of closet space including a walk-in but also several drawers and two more closets for hanging. failry typical-but-clean bathroom accessible from bedroom only. thermostats adjust to 70 degrees automatically fairly early in the AM which was pretty annoying given the summer heat. the attached restaurant was very nice and not terribly expensive for NYC. all service was very nice - however, the maids are borderline OCD about the do not disturb signs and might yell at you if you don't use them. the spa and workout facilities are really what make this hotel so fancy... you should plan on using them. the hotel is located 8 blocks south of grand central. a quiet area that you'll feel safe in but probably wont really want to hang out in. several 20-something bars and a couple decent restaurants just 2 blocks away.
