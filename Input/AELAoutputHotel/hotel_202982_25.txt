{"text":"Clean quiet hotel, helpful staff, very close to train station Enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Albani. The hotel is very close to the train station on a sidestreet, you can easily walk your luggage to the hotel from there and back when you leave by train. The hotel is close walking distance (5-6 blocks) to the Academia to see Michaelangelo's David. The hotel itself is a very nice 4 story property, the rooms are very clean, the bedding very nice, good sheets, blankets, matreses, pillows, etc (not an automatic in Italy). The staff are very freindly, some more helpful and outgoing than others. Other reviews noted Elizabeta and Laura as being nice. Did not see Laura, but did meet Elizabeta twice and she was as indicated very friindly. Most of our transactions, though, took place with Emanuela, we saw her several times during our stay for questions, suggestions and booking tours and she was outstanding, I give her very high marks and thank her for her help. Our room was what we wanted, comfortable, clean and quiet. Our room and bathroom were smaller than the usual room as we asked to switch to a higher floor and accepted his compromise. The morning breakfast was outstanding with very professional staff serving coffee and tea. The only knock on the hotel is the location, you can pretty much walk to everything in Florence, but most of what you want to see is between Duomo and the Arno river, and the Albani is not very close to that, so we found ourselves making several roundtrips back and forth, which was tiring, and as is the case with most train stations, the walk through the train station area to get back to our hotel, especially at night, was not much fun. We enjoyed the hotel very much, would recommend and would stay again, but would also look for something closer to the center of the city to see what else is availale. We stayed in late July and the hotel was not very busy, so if you are going around this time you may be able to find very good rates on Hotels.com, veere or through the hotel's own site.
