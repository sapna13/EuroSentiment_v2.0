{"text":"Can't go wrong Excellent hotel stayed there for two nights occupying a triple room. I can't say anything bad about this hotel at all. Service was excellent we did not have enough towels the day we arrived and we received them in about 5 mins. Breakfast buffet was included in the deal, again excellent value for money and lots of choice. I was a bit worried about some of the reviews saying that the breakfast was not all that and the so called shady area. I'm not sure what people definition of shady is but i did not find this area shady at all and i was a part of group of three girls and we had absolutly no problems during the day and early hours of the morning. In regards to the breakfast if you want convenience then it is def worth it and like i mentioned good quality (well i happily stuffed my face). Location was also very good relativly easy to find altho you may need to ask for directions but people are more then friendly in helping and there is a station nearby to the hotel like 5 mins away. Only thing i have to say to be wary of which is nothing to do with the hotel. Is pickpockets who are rife in Barcelona and i had two not so good experiences with them. There are however safe's available in the rooms which i did not use and looking back probably should of. All in all tho very good experience with this hotel and if i was to go back i would book with this hotel again. ","annotations":[]}
