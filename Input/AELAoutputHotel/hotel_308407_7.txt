{"text":"Buyer Beware We were welcomed at the airport by the Santika hotel staff which we thought was great as we had not booked transport. I should have known better as we were then told that the hotel had been overbooked and we had to stay elsewhere for 1 night. Of course we were angry and disappointed as they then told us the accommodation was in Sanur no where near the Santika. We were given a free dinner voucher each as compensation and believe me this never compensated losing a day of our precious holiday. 5 of us were travelling together 1 being my disabled 12yr old daughter who has cerbral palsy and this just totally confused her. The villa we stayed in was nice but it was horrible outside the hotel and a complete waste of time as there was no shopping or decent restaurants.After this I thought we would be treated like royalty but ths wasn't the case. We had previously asked for ground floor interconnecting rooms ( I had even emailed the hotel the night before we left to ensure ground floor rooms and was told they would do their utmost )so I could be near my daughter but when we finally arrived at Santika the next day this was not the case. 2nd floor with separate rooms. no interconnecting rooms avaiable until 5 days later. What could we do? To make it worse I knew we were not the only ones this happened to. I spoke to other people who had experienced the same. I know it was school holidays but that is not our fault. We paid more money because it was school holidays.3 nights into the holiday the airconditioner in 1 room refused to work and could not be fixed so at 11pm that night 3 of us had to move to another room until the next day.I wanted to let other travellers know of our trouble. The hotel was nice as was the pool and breakfast but we would never stay there again because of the trouble. Given the chance again I would definitely choose elsewhere. Beware of the Christmas school holidays.Tracey ","annotations":[]}
