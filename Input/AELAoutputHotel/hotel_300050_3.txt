{"text":"What A Pleasant Surprise!! Spent two nights (11\/15  11\/16\/2008) here using Hotwire.com for $56 per night and what a STEAL! There are two towers to this hotel, connected with a glassed-in walk-way. The lobbies and common areas of the hotel have been newly renovated and are very classy and upscale. The check-in personnel made us feel welcomed and as if we were paying the highest rate for the night ($159 according the Holiday Inn's website). We were given a non-smoking, King Leisure room with microwave  dorm size refrigerator. The vanity area was separate from the TINY tub\/toilet area, but it was fine. The room was SPOTLESS and we were told the rooms will begin renovations in January 2009. This hotel is located 5 to 8 minutes from the Rental Car location (depending on stop lights). There is a nice Houlihans Restaurant in the hotel; we elected to eat there one night so my husband could have a couple of beers and not have to worry about driving. The service there was excellent as was the food.When leaving the parking lot, there is a stop light and you simply go straight and you are on Hwy. 101 North! We usually go I-280 to 19th Av. when going into San Francisco and it takes 20 minutes from the Holiday Inn.There is a Costco within a couple of blocks and also a McDonald's. I also noticed an IHOP nearby, but not much else.We would definitely like to return there because we were treated like visiting royalty!
