{"text":"Delightful 5 night stay Having found this hotel by reading other reviews on tripadvisor.com, we wanted to second the comments left by other travellers and add our own opinion.We stayed 5 nights at the Castle Inn. We are a family of three, two parents and one 12-year old child, staying in the area primarily for a trip in California that will take us to all the major league baseball stadiums. While in San Francisco we also wanted to see the major tourist attractions. The Castle Inn was the perfect locale for us.The Inn's location is superior, 1\/2 block to a major bus line, 3 blocks to the busline that goes to AT  T park. We were able to walk to Fisherman's Wharf, Lombard Street and Chinatown. These walks are definitely for those in good physical condition. We were also able to go by bus to Golden Gate Park and Haight Ashbury. We chose to drive our rental car (parked FREE at the Castle Inn) to Muir Woods, Berkeley and Oakland (McAfee Stadium, for the A's game).Re: parking at the Castle Inn. Other reviewers have said that parking is tricky because the lot is small. Yes, but if you have a compact car or are a seasoned driver, you will have no difficulty. Do not let these comments deter you from staying here.Our room was very large (#229). Unable to secure a room with two beds, we booked a king room with a rollaway bed for our son. We had optimal room all around, plenty of room for our suitcases and belongings. We never felt cramped.Our room rate for our stay was $189\/night + taxes. We felt this was a steal compared to the price of other hotels who would also charge for parking and wi-fi access (luxury hotels, when will they get a clue??). The room was very clean, sheets, towels and soap \/ cups refreshed daily.The breakfast included was nothing to speak of. Our son loved the cello-wrapped cinnamon rolls, but we prefered to pocket some cereal \/ granola bars for our day trips and get our breakfast from Peet's coffee and the Bagelry (just around the corner).Checkout is 11 a.m. You need to vacate your room prior to checkout -- apparently the owners had some difficulty with travellers using the telephone and incurring charges after checksing out.
