{"text":"Good Location And Staff I booked this hotel for a two day stay in Tokyo. I based my choice mainly on proximity to the Tsukiji market, which we planned to visit early on our first morning, and also to the main Tokyo train station, as we were proceeding onto Kyoto on our third day.The hotel is close to a number of train stations, the closest being the Higashi-Ginza station, about three blocks away on Showa-dori, but we went to the Ginza station on our arrival as it was a single train from the main Tokyo terminal. This station is an additional 3-4 blocks, but still within easy walking distance from the hotel. We later discovered that the Shibuya Station was about the same distance away, which was convenient as Shibuya is on the JR Yamanote line, the main JR line serving most of Tokyo's neighborhoods.The hotel, as described in other postings, is under renovation, and while we were there, two floors were being renovated and off-limits to guests. We could tell because those two floors (I don't recall what floors but they were two consecutive) had their buttons blocked off on the elevators so that you could not even press the buttons, plus we had a written notice in our room regarding the renovation. We got a room on the top floor (11), several floor above the floors being renovated, so we were not affected at all by the renovations.I don't think we received a renovated room, as most of the furnishings did look a bit dated and some of the labels bore the logos of previous identities for this hotel. In fact, our hotel book still bore the Renaissance logo and most of the looseleaf pages within the book also referred to the Renaissance name.The room was small but adequate for what we paid. The room had only a small window, which was sort of a bay outcropping with windows on three sides, but not much of a view. The bathroom was a western-style, with a single shower\/bath. The room came with a flat-panel TV but it was rather old and small.The Internet access was wired, but worked without a hitch.The staff we interfaced with all spoke English, or at least understood enough of it to understand what we were asking for. They had a very good English-speaking concierge, a non-Japanese woman with a European accent.One of the things that we did not see right away was a tower of xeroxed cheatsheets for many of the local attractions, as well as a current calendar of events and schedules, all written in English. We used several of these to help us figure out what to do and how to get there, though I wished that we'd discovered these before we took the long way to Tsukiji market the first morning.Again, you're in the Ginza, though on a large but not commercially active street. You're within a couple of blocks though from the main streets in the Ginza, plus you have a number of useful shops and other businesses nearby, including an AM\/PM and a Lawsons convenience stores within a block, as well as a Starbucks and a CitiBank ATM within several blocks, a 5 minute walk from the hotel.We received drinks coupons for the bar in the lobby, as well as coupons for complimentary breakfasts in the buffet restaurant, Fiore, located at the rear of the lobby near the side entrance to the hotel. We had breakfast there one morning and found the food satisfactory for a quick breakfast before a full day of sightseeing. They had a full buffet of western style breakfast items, as well as some Japanese items including fresh rice and some grilled fish. We also had tea and coffee in the coffee shop in the lobby, which was also fine for what we needed.Ultimately, I think this hotel is a very good combination of value and convenience, and will probably be even better once all of the floors and rooms have been renovated. if you're going to be making an early morning trek to the Tsukiji market, this hotel deserves serious consideration.
