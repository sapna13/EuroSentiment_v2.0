{"text":"Good value We stayed at the Royal Pacific Hotel and Towers because it seemed to be one of the cheapest quality hotels (I think it's a ***, not a **** as stated in another review) in HK and we wanted to stay in the Peninsula for our final few days. The RPHT enabled us to do this without spending far too much on our stopover from Sydney to London. Furthermore, the hotel is situated directly over the China Ferry Terminal, and we wanted to take a ferry to Macau from this terminal on one of our days there.The RPHT lived up to our expectations. Our room, in the hotel wing, was really quite small (though we could have upgraded for HK√ä√£¬¢300 or so a night, which isn't much), but it was clean and pleasant and the staff were very helpful. The laundry service was amazingly good compared to hotels in Australia. The layout of the hotel takes a bit of working out, but this is true of many hotels in HK, because of the shopping malls they stand on. There is a Pacific Coffee Company (a rather superior Asian version of Starbucks) on Canton Road under the hotel, if one wants a cheap Western breakfast (we can't comment on breakfast in the hotel, as it cost extra and we didn't have it).The hotel is very near (10-15 minutes walk) both the Star Ferry Terminal and Tsim Sha Tsui MTR (Metro\/Underground\/Subway) station, both of which take you to Central Hong Kong very quickly. There are several very atmospheric shopping streets around Tsim Sha Tsui, as well as modern malls, and it's only one MTR stop from Temple Street Night Market. The city art gallery (next to the Star Ferry Terminal) and space museum are not far either. Well worth staying in if you want a cheap central hotel in Kowloon.
