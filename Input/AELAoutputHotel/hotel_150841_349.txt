{"text":"Sorry we had to leave ! The Iberostar Bavaro is exactly what we were looking for a beautiful and relaxing vacation. This resort offered both relaxation and peace as well as the opportunity to party into the morning if you wanted. We normally handle all of our own vacation plans but decided to go through Apple Vacations this time. I can not thank our Apple representatives enough, especially Carlos and Petra! Everywhere we went we had an Apple rep ready to assist us. We went with another couple and none of us had any problems at the Airport upon arrival or departure. Our check in and check out was fast and quick, our tours and dining reservations were all made easily and for the times we wanted. The rooms were very clean, large and very beautiful. Although, with so much to do we were not in them very long. There was so much food offered on the buffets that even the pickiest eater would have had a hard time not finding something they liked. Although, they do not offer what we Mid Westerners call top shelf alcohol (crown royal, southern comfort, kesslers etc.) we did not have a problem finding plenty of other great drinks. We spent most nights trying different drinks and had a blast doing it. I highly recommend the Coco Loco (be warned though coconut is a natural laxative!). If you are not an alcohol drinker the only soft drinks offered are Coke products(no Pepsi products). For those that enjoy a beer the only kind available is El Presidente or Becks N\/A. If you are looking for an American beer there is none to be found.The people were all very friendly and ready to assist us with any questions or needs we had. The only thing we were a little disappointed with was that the pool was closed at night. It would have been great to be able to use the pool at night as well as during the day. The shows every night in the main lobby bar are quite entertaining especially when they include the audience in the shows. In previous reviews we read the resort is very well maintained and beautiful, these reviews were correct. The grounds and buildings were all clean and beautiful. Make sure you bring plenty of one dollar bills for tips even though you don't have to tip as it is all inclusive. A little tip here and there went a long way. We never had to wait for a waitress or bartender and by the second day most of them new what drink we wanted without us telling them.We had an Awesome time and the four of us are already planning our return trip there only this time we are staying much longer. The hardest part of this vacation was returning to Green Bay to 30 degrees and rain\/sleet.
