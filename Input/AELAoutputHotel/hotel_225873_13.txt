{"text":"Not much charm, but go for the value and location This is, all in all, a very good choice for the budget-conscious tourist. It is definitely value for money - what you get for the price is an excellent location to base your sightseeing from and comfortable, clean rooms. It seems some rooms are noisy, so my advice is to arrive on or slightly before the check-in time to make sure you're happy with the room they give you. I arrived about 30 mins early, and discovered that the room allocated was on the 1st floor and facing into a tiny yard which was blocked in on all sides by the walls of the surrounding buildings. This yard contained the air conditioning units, so being on the first floor meant very high constant noise levels from the aircon units. I asked to be re-located, and was given a room on the 4th floor which was much much better. To their credit, they swapped our room with no fuss at all. On the other hand, we did specifically ask for a quiet room when we made our booking, so.......The rooms are comfortable, clean, and small but not too cramped. The ones at the back are rather dark so not particularly inviting in the daytime. I think it's a bit of a misdescription to say the hotel is boutique because it certainly doesn't have the style or design of a boutique hotel. I am surprised by the previous comment that the breakfast is awesome. Maybe I am used to the breakfasts in European hotels, which usually include hot buffets with sausage, egg, bacon, tomatoes etc. The breakfast here consists of: doughnuts from Dunkin Donuts, bagels from Finagle A Bagel, muffins (didn't see where they were from), and a basket of apples, bananas  oranges. It's okay, but certainly not awesome. The hotel and the staff are efficient but without charm but, given the price, don't expect anything more. For my three-night stay, I'm pretty sure I made the right choice.
