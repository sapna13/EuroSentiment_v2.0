{"text":"Great Deal, Decent Hotel My husband and I stayed at Aqua Palms  Spa for seven nights in early April. I did a ton of research and read a lot of reviews before booking this hotel. It was an amazing deal for $110\/ night (including tax) through bookit.com. My overall thought is that it was a good bargain. I don't know if it should be rated #7 out of 85 hotels in Honolulu, though.I had requested a room with a king bed and when we arrived in our room, it had two queens (looked like fulls). i called the front desk and they told us that they couldn't move us until the next morning, which we were okay with. we moved into our room the next morning and to my husband's disappointment, we no longer had a lanai. instead, we opened up the sliding door to a tiny strip of concrete. we didn't want to switch rooms again so we stayed put. our room faced ala moan blvd. and all the construction but it didn't bother us too bad. The room was clean, and it's nice to have a fridge and microwave. The tv is small but adequate. What bothered me the most was the bed. The sheets were too small for the king bed and bare mattress was often exposed. The sheets are a bit threadbare and the bed had a coverelet, which always gives me the heebies because I doubt they're regularly washed.The bathroom was clean and had nice papaya\/pineapple scented products. The tub is standard-sized but not really the kind you'd want to soak in. It had a slip-resistant mat on the bottom.The front desk was very nice, and we often checked out beach towels, boogie boards, etc.. It's about a leisurely 10 minute walk to the beach through Hilton Hawaiian Village. It's about a 30 minute walk to the center of Waikiki Beach.My husband and I had a car the entire week which was super convenient, though it cost $18\/day to park it. Since the hotel is located on the west end of Waikiki, it's nice to have a car.Overall, I would probably come here again because of the price. It's a pretty good deal and it's clean.The hotel staff was nice, but in my experience, Hawaiian people as a whole are nice and helpful.If you're used to fancier hotels, I'd recommend you go somewhere else. Otherwise, this may be the hotel for you.
