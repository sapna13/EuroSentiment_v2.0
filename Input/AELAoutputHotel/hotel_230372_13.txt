{"text":"Excellent value for money! My husband and I had just come back from the Hotel Savoy Frankfurt (October 2007) and have to say we were pleasantly impressed. The hotel is located just opposite the Frankfurt Mainz central station the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥auptbahnhof√à√\u2020\u2022?which is very convenient. The hotel reception is friendly and speaks good english except for their porter - a bit stern looking. We were given a room located on the first floor, clean but built next to the lift shaft and was very noisy when the lift was in operation. The room itself was not accommodating for a twin bedded room as the two beds were in an L shaped room, so one of the beds was unable to see the other person or the TV etc. (which is fine with us). Shower and toilet facilities were fine. The only down side is there is no tea making facilities in the rooms (ie kettle, etc)The breakfast buffet is really good with lots of choice to choose from √à√\u2020\u2022?cooked breakfast like scrambled and fried eggs, bacon, sausage, meats, a big selection of cereals, breads, rolls, cheese, yogurts, chocolate croissants, toast, fresh fruits, and more. The waitress was attentive and always quick to offer a refill of our coffee or tea. There is a basket full with fruits and free pastries in the reception lobby throughout the day. They also served us free drink at the bar as we were waiting for our room to be ready before they could check us in.Overall we found this hotel excellent value for money. Would stay again but would demand a different room location definitely. Would score it a 7\/10. Highly recommended!
