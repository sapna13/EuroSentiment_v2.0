{"text":"LOVED This Place! First let me say that I've been reading reviews on Trip Advisor about Excellence for a year now. I began planning this trip in 2006 as a surprise 25th anniversary trip for me and my husband. The main reason I selected Excellence is because of the no children factor. Now on to the review.After reading many reviews over the course of the year, the general concensus was that the food was just okay (some said inedible) but service and grounds were beautifully kept and that upgrading to the Excellence Club was not worth it. Let me tell you how it really is . . .I did upgrade to the Excellence Club and it was WELL worth it! Upon arrival you are wisked away to a private airconditioned club (2 floors - bottom are private bathrooms and Concierge; top there is unending fruit, food, bread, coffee, tea, drinks, TV, balcony, etc.). You are treated like royalty! We were then taken to our rooms with our luggage - thanks to Tony!Rooms - The rooms are average. While the decor is beautiful - cathedral ceilings, ceiling fan, balcony overlooking pool and ocean, jacuzzi, shower, etc. - they could use a little sprucing up and the resort was doing so on the lower levels. A fresh coat of paint and some upgrades were taking place while we were there.It is amazing how well stocked the mini bar is and they come around 2 times a day to replenish! Top shelf liquor, water, juices, etc. Staff - nothing to say except EXCELLENTE!!! They are beautiful people inside and out and truly love what they do!Food - Never had a bad meal. Chez Isabella the best - at there twice. Agave second favorite - margaritas and chips delicious! Toscano - wonderful! The Grill - very good. The Lobster House - very good (of course you get spiny lobsters not Maine - after all you're in Punta Cana). Spice - fair our least favorite but still good.Beach grill during the day was also very good.Entertainment - the shows in the evening were fun! Chris Blizzard our favorite! Can't wait to download his Christmas album. Michael Jackson review - it could have been him for all we know! Audience games\/participation very funny! We did not go to the disco and were told to stay away from the Casino as it has nothing to do with the resort! So beware! It's an independent Casino that rents the space and they say they take you for everything you have!Beach - Amazing! There are beds on the beach - go figure!! It was wonderful! The water is EXTREMELY rough! Had a horrifying experience with someone almost drowning. My husband and a few other men on the beach went out and dragged him back in - GOOD JOB GUYS! You are waited on hand and foot and the beach with drinks galore!Pool - Amazing! Never had to fight for a chair, towel, etc. Always a spot open with plenty of pool floats.We did take a trip off the resort to Saona Island. WELL WORTH IT! Although the bus ride there was 90 min. it was still EXCELLENTE! From the bus they put you on a speed boat to a Katamaran for about 1.5 hours. That was truly fun - drinking, dancing, singing! GREAT! They drop you onto the island where you have lunch and swim in the Caribbean - just beautiful and lunch was good! From island on speedboats to an area in the middle of the Carribean to look for starfish - we found several. Back to the bus on speedboat - VERY FUN!Check Out - made easy thanks to the Excellence Club and Carlos.This trip was truly Paradise! I highly recommend!
