{"text":"excellent hotel My boyfriend and I just returned from a 3 day stay at the park hotel in Barcelona. We booked the hotel the morning we went to barcelona on a hotel website as it was a last minute holiday so we really didnt know what to expect from the hotel. When we got to the hotel we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel room was great with air conditioning and a very modern decor. My boyfriend was extra impressed by the 30 inch flat screen tv and minibar in the room!The location is really great too. Its just around the corner from the metro. The bus turistic for the city goes from just down the road and its directly across the road from estacio de Franca which is the major station for trains going to and coming from France. About a 5 minute walk away is the aquarium and the pier where its nice to walk along and see all the boats and some good restaurants are located there too.It's only a 5-10 minute walk to the bottom of las ramblas but if you get the hang of walking up and down to the centre of the city you will find your way down all the shortcuts through the Gothic quarter where the streets are really narrow and quirky with some great cafes and shops. I really though that this hotel was good value, The hotel was only √à√\u2020√ü?0 a night which for the quality of the rooms, we thought was great value. I would definatley recommend this hotel.
