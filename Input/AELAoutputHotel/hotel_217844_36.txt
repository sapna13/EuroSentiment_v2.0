{"text":"A Perfect Weekend We arrived from the east coast at 9:30 a.m. on a busy marathon weekend expecting to be turned away until the afternoon. Not only did the staff invite us to check into our room immediately, they upgraded us to a suite free of charge. The rooms were spacious and clean, the bathroom was huge, the bed was comfortable and the hotel was quiet with just the muffled sound of the cable car bells every once in a while. The Orchard is in the heart of the city, close to the best shopping and dining, yet it feels private and calm. The staff was wonderful at anticipating our every need (box breakfasts were available for race participants, choice of several newspapers, turn-down service with chocolates, free fruit) and could not have been nicer every time we passed through the lobby. After the race, we were allowed a late check-out (2:00) and since our flight didn't leave until 10 p.m., the hotel desk people locked up our bags, printed our boarding passes, and then had a town car waiting for us to go to the airport (for the same price as a taxi). We will definitely stay here again. The suite was plenty big enough for a couple of kids too if you're traveling with family. This was one of those rare weekends when everything just seemed to be going our way and the Orchard played a big part in making it special. The employees really seem to like their jobs and know how to make guests feel welcome.
