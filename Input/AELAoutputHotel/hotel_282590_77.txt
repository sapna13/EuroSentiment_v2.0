{"text":"Top Service, Great Hotel I found this hotel on hotels.com and based my decision on other reviews on tripadvisor.com. All I can say is that this is the best hotel I have stayed at in a very long time.The service you receive from the minute you walk into the lobby is brilliant. Most of the personnel in the lobby speak english, so communication is reasonably easy. I had a few technical difficulties getting the internet going, within minutes of a phone call the hotel handyman was at the door.The room we received ended up being a disabled room. This hotel caters for everyone. The room was very large and the bathroom was equally as big. One downside to the room we had was the shower was integrated into the whole bathroom, hence if you have a shower, the toilet gets wet as well. This is due to the disabled setup. It just requires prior planning before your shower :) Not all rooms are like this. From looking at the emergency exit plan in the hallway, the rooms come in all shapes and sizes. The bed was strange to say the least. It was two king single beds joined together at the base, but the mattresses werent, so there was a gap inbetween the mattresses. I dont know whether this is normal, but it didnt worry us too much. The room had floor to cieling windows which was good. The room also came with a DVD player and a LCD TV, albeit a small one (approx 20)The location is fantastic. A tram stop is right outside the door, there would be at least 15 restraurants \/ food outlets in the street where the hotel is located. The selection caters for all budgets. The streets are quiet, and safe. Nightlife is very busy with all the restaurants about. The hotel is about 5 minutes in a cab from Haptbahnhof station and about 10 minutes from Ostbahnhof station.There is a coffee shop next to the hotel that has free Wireless internet. The internet in the hotel rooms (via LAN) costs 9 Euro for 12 hours, or 3.50 Euro for 30 mins. They also supply two computers in the lobby for free internet. There is hotel WIFI available in the lobby area.The hotel is very secure. You need your room key in the elevator to access your level only. I like this feature as it keeps unwanted people out of each individual floor.Cot facilities are available for infants, and high chairs also are available in the restaurant.The breakfast is worth the 11 EURO they charge. It is a massive banquet ranging from fruit, yoghurts, bread rolls, bread for toast, cereal, pastries, cakes, many juices, cold meats, its all available.I highly recommend this hotel, the room colours are all white, but thats retro I guess these days. Enjoy your stay!!!!
