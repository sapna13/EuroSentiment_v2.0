{"text":"OMG this place needs to be updated in their rooms i booked the night before Friday October 11th 2008 after 6:20pm pacific time on Hotels.caI've used Hotels.ca lots for Florida and always got lucky with last minute lowest rates.we got it for $239 canadian taxes included. We were coming from Vancouver Canada by car.The Valet service is the best, its true what they say about these guys. The whole experience per say with service was unbeleiveable. This staff is teh best i've come across. If it wasn't for the suites and rooms needing a total new uplift, i would have gien this hotel a 6 Star rating.We were upgraded from a executive suite to a Deluxe Executive suite. Holy S***!, huge room with a living room and big bathroom. This place is extremely clean. Probably the cleanest hotel and its rooms that i have ever saw.The problem is the furniture is so old, something you would see maybe at a second hand antique store or Sally ann store, but in good shape. Saddly the carpets had slight ripple and was not in style.. I found everything to be in the 80's style with the furniture being early 70's. The bath tub is the lowest i have saw.. Really , its so low don't expect a deep soaker tub which i would have expected from this hotel. The toilet was so low to the ground, i needed a handle which wasn;t provided. I'am in my late 30's , great shape and found an inconvenience. I feel really bad the decor is mostly suited for those over 70 years old but lack handicap accessories found in European and Canadian Hotels.Yes you do get CBC from Canada on the old 26 inch panasonic tv, but the picture quality is less than digital with fuzz snow in every channel.The hide-a-bed in the sofa had a sink in the middle. Our teenagers complain of this. Our king size Mattress was so stiff, i kept twisting and turning all night. Everything felt and smelled clean. But the bed, the curtains(GOD UGLY), old tv sets, toilet, bathtub, carpets, french doors, thermostat all need to be modernized and improved to a high standard.The door knobs where worn off from the brass, the french doors had no glass, just see thru curtains from the seating room to the bedroom.as to the noise, I was on the 10th floor. I could hear all the traffic outside and someone yelling on the street. Its true , there is no view anywhere in this building. You are surrounded by newly built highrises way taller than 12 stories..lolas to distance to the shopping district and Pike Market where they throw the salmon. You are really close but far away from teh crowds. about a 15 minute walk. I was thinking before booking Fairmount Olympic Hotel to book the Sheraton. But the Sheraton and Westin in Florida really suck and over price for the dumps they own! BUt seeing the Sheraton, I would definitely book the Sheraton. It looks newer, beautifully decorated, really what a new hotel should look like and lots of stagette parties. Convenently located to everything and priced moderately. next time, it will be the Sheraton or the Pan Pacific.by the way valet parking in Seattle is $30 , at the Fairmount its $35. beleive it or not , its much cheaper to the the valet than using the public pay parking where they charge you $11 for a 90 minutes parking.Also everything is Seattle is overpriced to any other big city. It has no real good restaurants and all are over-rated and overpriced. But We did enjoy the TapHouse. Seattle is the most unfriendly City and a dunGY ugly city. I take cruises every year or Royal carribean and Princess and travel to many huge metropolitan cities. Seattle is the bottom of the list for restaurants and thinsg to do.IF your on a budget but still want a nice place, but don't want to pay a fortune but still stay close to Seattle. I would recommend anything in Everett washington that is close to Seattle. a few minutes on the I-5 interstate. Honestly!if you like my post.. please score me.
