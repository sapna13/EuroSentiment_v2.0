{"text":"Pedestrian, at best... I'd been to Singapore before in 1994, but stayed in the Oriental. That hotel was very good, but geographically, a bit out of it. The agent recommended this place, and on arrival despite the lack of welcoming staff and doors being opened for you, the lobby looked the part. It is attached to the hotel shopping arcade, which like so many in over-subscribed Singapore is a run-down ghost town.The room:Refurbished in contemporary theme, but with chunks knocked out of the woodwork and a dirty carpet. Kind of an Ikea vibe going on and unfortunately quality of fittings to match...We were told it was recently refurbished, but it looked rather hammered. Only supplied 2 bath towels  no hand towels. Our room loooked over 2 building sites and the refurb of the pool area.Pool: Shabby. Ancient loungers, ice cold water and looking onto the side of a building, hence little sun. They did however, site the 'putting green' overlooking Orchard Road, which was bathed in sunshine. Go figure...The biggest choker was breakfast. √ä√£¬¢12 each for a poor quality, limited choice buffet, in an ambience of cheesy plastic marine life. How they can charge 10% service charge on a serve yourself breakfast is beyond me.Location:If you like shopping  prostitutes, no problem! As soon as dusk arrived, it was Hooker central outside. Both my Wife and Daughter felt anxious coming towards the hotel after shopping, being looked up and down by some very dubious characters.In conclusion, we would definately not recommend, or stay in this hotel again.
