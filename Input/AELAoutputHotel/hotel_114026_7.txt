{"text":"Great service, simple decor As sister property to the Halekulani hotel, the Waikiki Parc is very different in its approach. LOCATION: Although it has no direct access to the beach, it's just a short walk away down a side alley to the beach front. It's also within easy walking distance to all of the Waikiki restaurants and stores on Kalakaua (the main street). If you need a cab, you can arrange one at the bell desk in advance but there's also a cab rank across the road in front of the Halekulani. And for some 24\/7 dining, there's a Denny's on the corner (only if you're really desperate). ROOM: We stayed in a room on the 12th floor that was the most economical. It was quite a small room and really very simple. The decor was surprisingly unpleasant - the entire room is tiled and there was a green rug under the bed. At all times, though, the room was very clean and the make-up service efficient but be prepared for a very simple room. We had a view of the parking lot next door so if you'd like something better, make sure that you request it upon booking. SERVICE: Absolutely everyone in the hotel was extremely courteous, helpful and efficient. Check-in and check-out were quick. They were extremely reliable too - from wake-up calls, to pre-ordering a cab for the airport, etc. Every Tuesday (?) and Friday night there's a one-hour mixer in the lobby - everyone's invited and the hotel provides free alcoholic drinks. It's a nice touch and something that would be particularly good for younger travelers or those who are going out on the town but don't want to spend too much on alcohol. FACILITIES: There's a small pool on Level 8 and an even smaller fitness centre. The business centre off the lobby consists of two computers for which you need to purchase time - $3 for 15 minutes or $5 for half an hour. Other than that, the hotel doesn't offer too much. DINING: We never ordered room service and I'm not even sure that it's available. For health-conscious travelers, the breakfast is fantastic. It's located in the Nobu restaurant off the lobby. There's no buffet but they have several different options which you order a la carte. It means that you can control your portions in a much better way and all of the food is very healthy. One option, for example, is a three-cheese omelette with shiitake mushrooms (delicious). All options are accompanied by a breakfast muffin, a serving of fruit, a small tub of yoghurt and juice and\/or tea\/coffee. On the day that we had to check out earlier than when breakfast started, the hotel was able to arrange breakfast boxes for us at no extra cost - fruit, yoghurt and breakfast muffin and a bottle of water. I thought that this was a nice touch. MISC: Although we never did it, you can arrange to hire a Lotus Elise which and the hotel has several parked out the front. If you arrive too early to check-in, you can opt to use one of their hospitality suites to freshen up. It's best to use a phone card when making calls (international or to Hawaiian cell phones) rather than the room phone. I usually do buy a phone card to do this but didn't have time to on this occasion and the charges were absolutely exorbitant. There are several ABC stores nearby which sell calling cards so it's best to go out of your way to purchase one. As it's a sister hotel to the Halekulani, you can also dine there and charge it to your Waikiki Parc room. I highly recommend trying the dining at the Halekulani - the breakfast buffet is wonderful and La Mer (their restaurant) is exquisite - we've been there twice now and it's worth every cent.All in all, we had a great stay here. It's good for people traveling on a budget who don't plan on spending a lot of time in their room and who don't require too many facilities. The service here was unbeatable.
