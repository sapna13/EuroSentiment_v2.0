{"text":"stylish but noisy I agree completely with other reviewers who have complained about the noise levels. It seems inconceivable that when the hotel was built no-one appreciated how noisy the fire engines that go past at least every half an hour are and soundproofed accordingly. All cities are loud, but this was the one thing that could really have improved our stay.Actually, I lie. Two things, the other being that in our room there was a huge shower stall but no bath. The bathroom was easily big enough to take a spacious tub (the toilet alone had enough space to do backflips in) yet they had decided to forego one. I find this mystifying in such a beautifully appointed hotel. I am aware that other rooms in the hotel have baths, but we were not told this at the time of arrival and I laboured under this misapprehension until I got home and checked their website. Had I known, I would have asked to be moved to a room with a tub. Also, putting the TV in the bathroom above the sink is a nice touch, but pretty useless, given that most of the time when you're using the sink you're doing something else. I can only hope that they had the foresight to put it above the bathtub ( in the rooms lucky enough to have one).But minor gripes aside, it is a lovely hotel. That it is fairly new shows in the furnishings, which are still sleek and polished looking. The beds were hugely comfortable with sumptous linens and piles of cushions, and the chaise is a nice touch for relaxing and reading on. So many hotel rooms offer only a desk chair for somewhere to sit and read, so this was very much appreciated. We found no problem with the location of the TV, though I was slightly peeved to find you still had to pay for movies. Some other St Regis properties, notably the Lanesborough in London, don't charge for this service, and given the price you pay for a noisy room, little luxuries like this are notable by their absence.The touch-screen panel by the bed is a nifty little device but awkward as hell to reach and use in the middle of the night without your glasses when all you want is a bedside light to read by. I really wouldn't have complained about a switch by the bed! It also gives off a powerful glow, and as one accustomed to sleeping in complete darkness, I ended up turning it face down, thus rendering its usefullness pretty redundant.The honor bar is nicely stocked and reasonably priced, and the room service was quick and efficient when we used it. The pool is beautiful, but more of a gesture than anything else, as it's impossible to imagine people toiling up and down it -more suitable for a relaxing dip than anything else.We didn't eat in the restaurant, but heard nothing but good things about it, and the cosy bar in the lobby seemed to be a big hit with the guests and regulars. The hotel itself is in a great location for seeing the city without being in the downtown crush.The staff were thoroughly polite and charming, and the maid service extremely efficient.So to recap, it's a wonderful hotel, but I wouldn't stay there again simply due to the invasive amounts of street noise.
