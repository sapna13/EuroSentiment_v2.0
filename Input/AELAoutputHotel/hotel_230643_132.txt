{"text":"Great Location, Fab Views and Friendly Service! As a lastminute holiday we decided to go to Barcelona\/Sitges for a six day holiday. We stayed at the Universal for the whole time. The rooms are quite large and incredibly clean. We particularly liked the fact that the bathroom had shavers, toothbrushes, shower cap, make-up remover, shoe polish etc provided. The pool on the rooftop is small but relaxing and the views breathtaking. The gym has the basic cardio equipment, but had no air conditioning nor was it equipped with a fan. Hence, it proved to be a very hot work out. The breakfast was okay. The service overall was fine, but we did find the service somewhat inconsistent or shall I say forgetful. The wake up call we requested was not followed through, the room service we tried to cancel, was not cancelled and arrived to our room. They informed us that they would return our call to confrim cancellation and never did. Other reccommendations: La Confitteria- A nearby bar which is great for a drink. Traditional looking and the bar staff speak English and always willing to give advice on where to go etc. Noti Restaurant. The food and service absolutely divine. Over 100 Euros for two persons. The best meal we had in Barcelona. A definite hot spot ----go on a Thursday\/Friday. Buddha Bar- Fab on a Tuesday. Great music. Ensure to trendify though! We noticed a few people being rejected at the door. CDLC night club by Port Olimpic. A great place for a boogie in very stylish surroundings.Visit Sitges Beach, which is thirty minutes away by train. The restaurants are wonderful and the beach clean and just beautiful. Tone up on that belly before going though, I have never seen so many buff bodies eeeek!
