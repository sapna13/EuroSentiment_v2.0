{"text":"Nice place for the budget price Just returned from Iberostar (IB) Dominicana in Punta Cana. First of all, the Iberostar territory in Punta Cana includes three hotels adjacent to each other: 1. IB Punta Cana, IB PC (probably the cheapest if you book through the travel agent, includes the older building, rooms starting with number 6, e.g. 6012, 6122, and one more modern building with elevator, rooms starting with 5, e.g. 5012, 5112, 5212, etc)2. Probably slightly more expensive IB Dominicana, IB D, (includes one building, rooms starting with 4, e.g 4012)3. IB Bavaro. Slightly more expensive, separate territory and restaurants, consistent of many villas, each with 4 rooms\/suites upstairs and 4 rooms downstairs (rooms starting with 1,2,3, e.g. 3024, 3756 etc).IB PC and IB Dom share the same territory, restaurants, and facilities. You can use the territory, spa, and pool of the Bavaro, but can not use their restaurants and bar (they have their own color of the wrist plastic label). Rooms. The villas seem much more quiet as c\/o to IB PC and IB D. If you look for something quiet and want to go to bed before 12:30 am, you probably better book IB Bavaro for quiet room. The main buildings of IB D and IB PC are built like budget hotels, i mean, no frills, all rooms in the row, all doors are facing the beautiful court yard, so when somebody shatter the door on the 3rd fllor in the middle of the night, you will definitely hear the echo on the ground floor. And there are 96 rooms on each floor (floors 0-ground, 1,2,3rd).The rooms facing the theater and lobby are the nosiest in the evening and nigt, with loud music sometimes until 11:30 PM and 12 am. The rooms are very nice, spacious, all with balcony, sitting area, refrigerator with free water, beer, and drinks, A\/C, TV, TF, and you name it. The made service: very average. The bed linens have not been changed for the whole week, and the towels will be changed only if you put them in the bath. The pillows are very flat (that was mentioned by two other reviewers before).Food. Average in the buffet, very good in the resaturants. My favorite restaurants are the Gourmet (i suggest to order the grilled lobster) and Oriental, where the appetizers and soup were delicious. If you love the meat, then there is the steakhouse.Territory and landscape: WONDERFUL, that really makes the atmosphere of the paradize. And the only thing that can be called luxury in this place, without hesitation. The flamingoes, peacocs, tropical birds are not afraid of people at all. The same about the landscape of the buidings backyards.Towels: please, bring one beach towel with you, if you want to have one fresh after 4 PM. During my stay for the whole week there were no fresh towels after 3:30-4PM (the towel booth is open until 6:50 PM). You can return the used one, but would not get the new one. I've heard many people to wow about it.I would also suggest to have your insulated mug that you can fill with any drink.There is jaccuzzi, but you have to book it in advance, as well as the restaurants, better on your first day of stay.My overall impression: nice place to stay, definitely not 5 stars as they claim, budget with touch of luxury i would say. Anyway, the brand Iberostar does not let them to lower the quality, even in Dominican. I have been in Iberostar in Mexico, and did like Mexico more.
