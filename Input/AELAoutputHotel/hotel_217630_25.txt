{"text":"Hidden Treasure I stayed in this hotel the week before Christmas and it was so lovely that I nearly did not write a review, in case this hidden treasure gets too popular and booked up!!I have previously stayed in some large mid-price hotels in New York aimed at tourists, which appear to be over-priced, with cramped rooms and in need of updating. So 414 was a very lucky find. It is small (22 bedrooms) and well maintained. It has been refurbished in the last couple of years. Don't be put off by the dark brown paint on the walls of the stairs and hallway, the rooms are bright, light and larger than the average New York hotel room.Unusually for New York a continental breakfast is provided with an excellent choice of croissants, bagels and muffins, fruit or cereals. There is also coffee, tea and juice. It is self-service, mugs are provided for the coffee and teas, and disposable plates \/ bowls etc for the food. The tea and coffee is available all day as it is not provided in the bedrooms. Breakfast is eaten in the small foyer area in front of a cheery, warming fire.The bedrooms as stated are large, bright and airy, with double glazed windows, and air conditioning units. I stayed in room 402 which was well decorated and had a small fridge, plenty of storage space, an iron, a safe and a very large wall-mounted TV. The bathroom was also quite large and modern with a shower and small bath. Everything was kept spotlessly clean during my stay and the staff were pleasant and very helpful.There is wireless internet access throughout the hotel and a computer guests can use to check e-mails in the lobby. There are also daily newspapers and magazines in the lobby. As it was winter I did not make use of the courtyard garden however I expect this is a wonderful place to breakfast in the summer.All in all I had a wonderful stay. I recommend phoning the hotel direct for a booking as I tried to book through websites but got a better deal for a week long stay by phoning directly. One negative point is possibly the lack of a lift. My room was on the 4th floor which was also the top floor, but remember in the USA the 1st floor = the UK ground floor. I think this lack of a lift might explain why the hotel has not got better 'star' ratings, but if you are OK with stairs then I highly recommend this little hotel which is very handy for Times Square and all the restaurants along 46th Street between 8th and 9th.
