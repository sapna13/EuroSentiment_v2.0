{"text":"Beautiful and secluded I booked a package through an agent which included airfare, hotel, and breakfast. I woke up in the morning to thousands of birds singing (loudly) below my window and the ocean off in the distance. The rooms were immaculate and the hotel property itself beautifully kept. I found that a number of people at the front desk whom I spoke to didn't understand English, and it takes a little while to get the message across. I also found that people were generally more polite to me when I dressed up versus dressed down - I wanted to go running (make a right out the front door and down the mountain about a mile and a half is a little town with scattered shops) and asked the front desk as to where I can go. She impatiently told me to just go run on the street. I came back from running and asked her where the beach was and once again got a rushed answer. After I showered and changed into a dress, I went and asked her where the business center was... and surprisingly she was plesant when speaking - I wondered then if she didn't recognize me.Location-wise, you're close to a lot of watersports and the hotel will plan your travel to and from local beaches (as long as you pay for an activity - one guy said he'd put me on the back of his scooter\/vespa and take me scuba diving). There is a beach at the hotel, but no watersports available. Overall, the hotel is a bit secluded but if you're looking to stay on the resort, it's a nice place to go.
