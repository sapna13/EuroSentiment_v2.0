{"text":"Would NEVER stay again The moment I walked into the reception area of this little hotel, I was put off by the rude and unfriendly lady behind the counter. Not one salutation, not even a hello. After we were issued card keys for the room, she then proceeded to take my Visa, charge $25.00, and after asking her for an explanation, she rudely said the charge was for incidentals. Asking her what incidentals were, she briskly said don't worry about it, you will not be charged. After inserting the card key into the room, and having spent 5 minutes trying to figure out why the key didn't work, I returned to Miss Congeniality who was far too busy with her phone call to even say one word. She did find the time to toss me two new keys on the desk, and went back to her more important phone call. A simple sorry about that would have gone a long way to acknowledge her mistake. Should I go on with the list of $25 dollar incidentals? Parking in SF is always a challenge, but waiting each time for the person blocking my car before I could leave the hotel was a big fricking pain. Worse, when we did find a spot in the lot, there was never any room to get out of the car, I had to slide out the passenger seat EACH time I did manage to find a spot, only to have to wait to leave again when someone else double parked behind me. Did I mention the syringes scattered around my car in the morning? There's more I could list, but you get the picture. A lady more eloquent than I used to say, Just say No. That about sums it up.
