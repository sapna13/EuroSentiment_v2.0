{"text":"Brilliant Location My husband and I went to Barcelona for the weekend and stayed at this hotel on recommdations from our in-laws. The hotel is in a prime position just at the top of Las Ramblas which is the mean street in Barcelona. This stretches from the middle right down to the Port. We loved this city, it was clean, friendly and quite easily accesable. Top tips. From Barcelona Airport jump on the bus marked Playa Catalunya for 3.90 euors each and this takes you straight to Las Ramblas. I think a cab would be around 25-30 euros so this is much better. Hotel Jazz is very comtemporty, clean with a lovely roof swimming pool. We were is room 506 which which I think a bit bigger than the rest however the hotel is great with very helpful staff. Las Ramblas is quite expensive in itself ( 2 large beers between 12-20 euros ) however there is entertainment all day and a great bustling street. Highly recomend Hard Rock Cafe ( at the top opposite the square ) and a small place called D'or which was opposite Hotel Jazz. Serves great wine and huge amounts of very reasonably priced Tapas. Also recomend the Open Top bus tour. Although it is 20 euros per head, it lasts around 3 hours but it the best way to see the city and its beatiful buildings. I guess it was quite quiet going in Jan compared to the middle of the year however we would defiantley go back here and also stay at this hotel !!!
