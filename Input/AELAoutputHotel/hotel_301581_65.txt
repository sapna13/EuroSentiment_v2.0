{"text":"Wonderful stay We stayed at the newly named Fairmont hotel for 9 nights over Christmas and New Year. Overall we were impressed and enjoyed every aspect of our stay. Our room in the South Tower was modern and well kept with a lovely view towards the Marina Bay allowing us to watch the New Year fireworks from our balcony. The bathroom was large and light and the shower fantastic. The amenities were generously replenished thoughout our stay.It was a luxury having our room serviced twice a day with fresh towels and robes and new sheets on the bed every morning.The in room safe was large enough for our laptop and other valuables.It is a shame that the previous reviewer JamesVki did not ask about breakfast. We had breakfast in the hotel every morning (included in our room rate), either at their Market Plaza restaurant on the 2nd floor or by the pool on the 8th floor. Both breakfast buffets were extensive with western and asian choices. We preferred the Market Plaza because the staff were more attentive and the selection wider.We found the reception staff and the concierge to be very polite and helpful. I used them for a number of queries about Singapore. It was also possible to reserve a table in one of the numerous hotel restaurants by using the in room reservation service on the phone.The food and drinks in the hotel are not cheap but not outrageous by Singapore standards. Raffles Hotel next door was even more expensive (unsurprisingly). If you want to eat cheaper then there are plenty of options in the food court in the mall under the hotel. Also Chinatown had excellent food at excellent prices.The location of the hotel is perfect. We were in walking distance to Marina Bay, Clarke Quay, Suntec City and of course Raffles Hotel. The MRT under the hotel was very convenient for trips to other sites around the island. We can recommend going to the races at Singapore Turf Club, a 40 minute ride on the MRT. Book a package at their restaurant @hibiscus and enjoy a fantastic view of the races.All in all I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Singapore. Excellent rooms, good service, perfect location and a reasonable price.
