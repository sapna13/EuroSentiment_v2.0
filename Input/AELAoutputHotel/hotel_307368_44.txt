{"text":"Nice hotel - poor location We arrived at the park hyatt by taxi from the Tokyo station. It was a long drive and took over half an hour. The check in is on the 41st floor and a bit of a walk. It is not like a normal check in and efforts are made to make the experience seem more personal and less hotel like. The decor of the hotel is stylish with nice art pieces on many walls.Our room was larger than expected with good city views. The bathroom was big and had an interesting layout. It was possible to watch the TV from the bath which was a nice touch. The bed was comfortable and room quiet.We ate in the new york grill of lost in translation fame which was excellent. We decided to splash out as it was my boyfriends birthday, so we had the Kobe beef. It was very expensive but absolutely incredible - highly recommended if you want to treat yourself.The major downside of this hotel is that it does not have good public transport links. It is at least 10 mins walk to the nearest metro station (although the hotel does have a free shuttle service to shinjuku station, 15 mins away - but this only runs from 9am). We found this to be a little inconvenient as other hotels that we have stayed in in Tokyo have metro stations very close (i.e. Mandarin oriental). Whilst we liked this hotel I did feel it was a little over hyped and a a bit too trendy (possibly intimidating) for its own good. On reflection I probably wouldn't stay here again as I think there are nicer hotels for a similar price with a better location and public transport access.
