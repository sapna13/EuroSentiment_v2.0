{"text":"We enjoyed the Pulitzer! My friend and I just spent five nights at the Pulitzer using Starwood points. All those we encountered at the hotel treated us with efficiency and smiles, the front desk folks, the concierge, and the doorman. My friend uses a walker and they were concerned about her. They put us in room on the lobby level so she would not need stairs. We had a large, lovely, quiet, clean room off a garden.After reading some negative comments from other reviewers I was a bit concerned about what we would encounter, but as I mentioned the room was large with comfortable twin beds. Not heavenly beds as someone mentioned, but they were fine. The garden turned out to be a blessing as we were there on Queen's Day and the room\/garden offered a quiet place in which to escape the crowds and noise.The bathroom had a combination shower\/tub. It was difficult for us to climb in and out and the tub was a bit slippery. It was also difficult to adjust the water temperature. But, those are the only complaints of this charming hotel.We liked the location, too. The hotel is not in the center of tourist activities, but very close to the Anne Frank House and less than a block to a tram stop. We enjoyed this neighborhood and had dinner there all five nights. Many, many options of restaurants and shopping.The buffet breakfast at the hotel was very good even though at 27 euros per person it was a bit expensive for me. There were plenty of options of what to eat and there was no way I could sample it all. I especially enjoyed the hash brown potatoes that were more like potato pancakes and the hot chocolate. The service was adequate and the staff seemed busy, not rude. We liked the restaurant a lot and tried to dine there for dinner on Queen's Day, but to our disappoint they were fully booked.When I needed help using the pay phone to call my bank in the U.S., the concierge left his post to help me. As I mentioned, the staff at the hotel was great.I stay in a lot of hotels while traveling for my job. In my book, this hotel is a winner.
