{"text":"Save your money! My husband and I stayed at the hotel from March 17-21 for our honeymoon. The hotel shuttle kept us along with other passengers waiting 45 mins and then after after leaving the airport went back for other passengers who were taking thier time. The hotel is a good 45 mins away from the airport. When we arrived at the hotel, the gave us a room with two double beds overlooking the parking lot and drop off to the hotel. This is what the hotel considers a mountain view. After another 30 minute wait, we spoke with the manager who initially told us that was all they had and it was a family hotel so king beds were scarce. Uhm ok. Miraculously a room with a king bed was found only overlooking the corner of the parking lot. Every morning starting at 6am we awoke to people walking above us, doors slamming constantly, toilets flushing incessantly, and people from the parking lot shouting. This is EVERY morning. We are from Manhattan so we are used to noise. The hotel looks nice but that is deceptive because it was obviously built on the cheap. Concierge sent a bottle of chardonnay over at dinner but that couldn't and didn't make up for the aggravation. The hotel staff always greeted you with a smile but at $450 a night and the restaurants and drinks pretty expensive, with all the aggravation we will never return to any Westin hotel. And yes, we did ask for another room but they hotel was booked solid. ","annotations":[]}
