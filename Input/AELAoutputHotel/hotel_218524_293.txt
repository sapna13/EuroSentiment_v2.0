{"text":"Excellence was Excellente Excellence Punta Cana is by far Excellente. Everything about the resort is beautiful. Outside of th resort however leaves something to be desired. The Dominican people live in small huts with garbage everywhere. It is for sure a third world country The roads have potholes the size of the vehicles and it takes about an hour and twenty minutes to go from the airport to the hotel. Once you arrive at the hotel it is just the opposite. You arrive to a beautiful open air building with a glass of champagne and damp cloth to greet you. Check in is very quick and you are off to your room. A bellman brings your bags directly there. From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave you are pampered. Our room was a Jr Suite swim out. Swim out is the way to go...just feet to the pool. The room is pretty nicely decorated and had a 2 person juccuzi. The mini bar and coffee was restocked daily and maid service was top notch, there was not a detail overlooked by the maids. Between each building was beautiful gardens with elegant walk ways. as far as the rest of the resort goes you can definately tell that they have put time and thought into every aspect of it. The restuarants where excellent. We went to the Chez Isabelle, The Grill, The Toscana, The Barcelona, and the Lobster house. Chez Isablle has the best Rib steak by far. As for the Lobster house...we were not impressed. limited choice of dishes and the lobster was not what we expected. Aside from that breakfast, lunch, and dinner at any resaurant was perfect. The premises of the resort are well maintained and EVERY single worker was extremely friendly. The beach was beautiful with carribean color but atlantic waves give you the best of both worlds...to the right of the resort there were pools formed from coral and the water was so calm, so clear and just a perfect place to relax. Everything about our honeymoon was great at the Excellence. The only bad thing about it was a hard bed and pillows. We feel ike they could do better with them. Also vendors come everyother day and try and sell you the same thing at all of them. you are better buying from the giftshop at the hotel. Vendors harass you until you give in. overall 5 star resort but i will not return due to the conditions outside the resort. makes for a scarey ride to and from the airport ","annotations":[{"endOffset":897,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":891},{"endOffset":897,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":891},{"endOffset":897,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":891},{"endOffset":897,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":891}]}
