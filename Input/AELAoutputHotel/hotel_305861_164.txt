{"text":"Fantastic Stayed at the Mertopark Causeway Bay for 3 nights at the end of September 2006. We took the hotel shuttle bus from the airport as we were arriving very late into HK - last shuttle left around 11.45pm. Costs HK$140 each but it was a very very luxurious bus and at that time of night it was nice to snooze in comfort. Arrived at hotel at 1.30am. We had booked a Harbour View Room and were upgraded to an Executive suite. Result!!! First time we've ever been upgraded in a hotel so didn't know what to expect but were very pleasantly surprised. We had two separate rooms, both with spectacular views of the Harbour across Victoria Park. The lounge had a settee, chair, coffee table, large TV, CD player and desk area. There was also a bar area and a second toilet. The bedroom was an OK size but not a lot of room around the bed but when you've got a whole other room to spread out into who's complaining. There was a second TV which also had a DVD player incorporated. The bathroom was lovely with a large bath and a huge shower cubicle. Bed was big and nicely presented. Breakfast was served in the second floor restaurant but finishes at 10.30am. There is nothing in the hotel directory to tell you this so we nearly missed out after having a lie in after our late arrival. There was a great selection on offer. Fresh fruit juice and fresh fruit, youghurts, breads and pastries, cereals, all the usual suspects for a cooked breakfast, along with dim sum and noodle soup. All good. Breakfast for 2 was HK$280 (√ä√£¬¢20) - not too bad. Location is superb - views over the harbour and the park are great. The Tin Hau metro station is 2 min walk (honest) at the bottom of the road which is on the main line. Times Square shopping mall is about a 15 min walk into to the Causeway Bay area. Our first full day we arranged a half day city tour at the hotel tour desk for that afternoon. Pool on the roof is fairly small and the water is quite cold but the views make up for that. Area is quiet at night so no problems sleeping. Couldn't have asked for much more from the Metropark. If we were back in HK we would definately be staying at the Metropark, Causeway Bay.
