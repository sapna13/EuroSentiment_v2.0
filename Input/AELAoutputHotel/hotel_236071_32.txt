{"text":"the keyword is 'sleaze'... It's worth bearing in mind that the Winston is both a hostel and a hotel. We stayed two nights in one of the hotel art rooms - from her photos, the same on that ladolcevita13 (below) stayed in - and enjoyed our break very much. The bar in which the reception is situated is welcoming and we found the staff to be slightly distracted at times but always friendly. Security is good in a somewhat dodgy neighbourhood and the location is very central and an easy walk from the station. The continental breakfast was plentiful and filling. As some other reviewers have brought it up, I'll mention that although there's doubtless a lot of drinking, smoking and, uh, other less wholesome pleasures going on in the place, we didn't feel that it was assumed (by the staff or the other visitors) that this was all we were interested in. The room was pleasant enough, on the seventh floor (there's a lift) and set in the older part of the hotel, with a high ceiling and big windows overlooking the street. As you'd expect from the area, it's noisy day and night and when we were there it was very hot. The bathroom was a very small but functional wet room and the bed linen and towels were clean. The room itself was pretty grubby and needed a good hoover; there was an old puke stain on the carpet next to the bed and we found some discarded pills in the corners. All in all, it was a bit tired but not uncomfortable. I'd stay again. ","annotations":[]}
