{"text":"Great location, small bathrooms, excellent bang for the buck I stayed with my wife and small baby in the Chancellor for three nights and I had a good overall stay.The location is excellent, near Union Square, with many shopping places and restaurants and theaters nearby. It is also on the cable cars route if you want to use them. However, it is not a good location if you are mainly going to visit Fisherman's Wharf.We had a rental car and it was a little complicated to load\/unload our luggages, but the garage a half block away was easily accesible and open 24 hour\/day, though a little pricey ($22.00\/day, because of the location). You can also get valet, but it will cost you $34.00\/day and you may have to wait longer.We had a room on the 15th floor (1500) and it was on the small side, but not too bad, considering it fit a crib without too many problems. The bathrooms are very small, although the tub is large and the shower good and they change\/add toiletries daily. There was a little mold on the paint near the shower, but I think it can be fixed easily with some paint job. The closet was astoundingly enormous, a walking closet! with a safe and ironing board\/iron. There is no A\/C, we had a fan in our room but it was never hot. We liked being on the last floor (15th) because the ceiling was really high (20 feet at least) and the window was as well really tall, plus I think we got less of the street noises. We did not try the restaurant for breakfast but appreciated the free cookies and coffee available at the bar.Staffing was helpful and corteous, there is a small tour organizing area with a very nice lady that was helpful to us in a few occasions.Overall a pleasant stay, would recommend to others.
