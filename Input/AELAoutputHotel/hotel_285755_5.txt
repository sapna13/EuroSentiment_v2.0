{"text":"OK but not great The Good BitsThis is not a bad hotel at all and so I don't want to appear negative but it just doesn't cut it as a 4 star either in my opinion. Although the location is definitely not city centre, there is a metro station and a tram stop less than 200 metres away. Travelling time to the city centre is about 10-15 minutes and so this is not a problem. The beach is about 500 metres away which is also a big plus. The rooms are clean, the fit out is modern and the receptionists are quite friendly and so first impressions were quite good on the whole. The RestBut the little things matter and this is where the hotel falls down. Arriving for a conference the following morning, the hotel does not provide an iron. There is a laundry service apparently but only at certain times of the day and the receptionist was not clear at all on the details and was very sceptical that anything could be laundered within 24 hours if at all. Everything shuts after 11pm, including room service. Even the front door is locked around midnight and you might have to knock to gain entry if the receptionist isn't paying attention. There was no kettle in the room, so even a simple cup of tea is impossible after 11pm and given that this is primarily a residential area there are no real options available in the vicinity either. There is no gym or pool and the terrace is definitely a pleasure reserved solely for the underprivileged. ConclusionI have an impression that this is primarily a tourist hotel aimed at the low to mid-budget market - long weekending accountants from the UK and that sort of thing and the attire and palour of the guests reflected it. In fact, in some ways the hotel is like a Premier Inn or Travelodge which isn't a bad thing at all but it is hardly worthy of 4 stars. I wouldn't stay here again although I didn't totally dislike the experience - I just think there are better alternatives available.
