{"text":"Hotel Casci - Great Choice Hotel Casci is a small family operated hotel. The property is a 15 minute from walk from the Florence Central Station, Santa Maria Novella.This hotel is a typical 3 star hotel The rooms are small but very comfortable, the bathroom was newly remodeled, spotless and well appointed. Breakfast is adequate, a selection of breads \/ rolls, hard boiled eggs, fruit, yogurt, etc. There is free internet available in the lounge as well as free wireless in the rooms.The building is 450 years old, and was undergoing some restoration on the building's front. This in no way affected our stay. But you might walk right by the hotel because of the scaffolding. There's a small bar \/ lounge off the lobby, good pricing for beer, wine, drinks, etc. 3 minute walk to the Academia and in the other direction to the Duomo.The family who operates this hotel is there for your satisfaction. They go beyond what you might expect to insure your satisfaction with their hotel. Laundry service is available (wash and fold) for a very low cost, iron and ironing board is available for your use.The lift is very tiny, adequate to get the luggage from the ground floor entrance to the hotel level. I used the stairs even with luggage.We were very happy with the hotel and especially happy with the friendliness of the staff. You begin to feel like part of the family. As we were heading out one day for touring the desk clerk insisted we take hotel provided umbrellas because it was going to rain. They will provide you with street maps and provide directions, as required. Will also make reservations for the Uffizi and Academia, ask them to do this before you arrive in Florence. Would use this hotel again and have no problem recommending it to others.
