{"text":"Let's Not Get Carried Away The positive reviews from Tripadvisor lead us to book this hotel and in general we had a similar positive experience as most people who have placed a review. But I feel a number of the reviews have lacked some balance. Having stayed at a few hotels around the world I can offer the opinion that this is definitely a four star hotel pretending to be five (as sold to us via the British Airways website). On the positive side the health spa, food and staff were all excellent and the hotel is well located for the MTR and shopping in Mongkok. The health spa and facilities are some of the best I have used.Where the hotel is let down (and this is based on an Executive Room) is the room size. The hotel has tried to fit a very large bed (super king or possibly larger) into a room which then barely leaves you space to walk around it. The entrance to the room is simialrly narrow and the bathroom whilst very well appointed (the rain fall shower is excellent) is also on the small side. I know space is at a premium in HK, but if you are going to be ranked at 5 stars then this hotel does not make the grade. Also a number of people have comment about the 42 plasma TV hung off the wall - unfortuantley this is completely out of propotion to the room size.I know it all sound like nit picking - but 5 star should leave no room for criticism.The other thing, and it is somethng which is a bit intangible is that the hotel did not leave us with that 5 star wow impression. Perhaps it was the understated entrance and reception or that things gets lost in translation when speaking to the staff.Overall a very good 4 star hotel and worth a stay - but defintely not a 5.
