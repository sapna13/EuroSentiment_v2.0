{"text":"First impressions didn't last... Firstly, when we (group of 4) first arrived, we were all more than impressed with the Bounty. There was some atmosphere, but nothing over the top and the hotel looked clean and impressive - But soon found this was not really the case. Negatives; Rooms; Average, but soon found them to be well in need of an update, interior is ok, but cupboards etc are starting to fall apart. TV remote didn't work in 1 room, both room TV's were small and had varied channels (which we didn't understand??) Shower was at best a strong trickle, washing hair wasn't worth the 20mins it took to wash out the shampoo! The rooms are in desperate need of a makeover.Staff - all are very friendly, but the constant you going to the friday\/wednesday night party, i sell you a ticket?  the Where are you going for tea tonite? I take you to Jimbaran Bay? wears thin pretty quickly. I expect people on the street to hassle you, but not the staff at your hotel!! So called Party Atmosphere - We were there for a good time like most others - it soon became obvious that meant drinking for 30hours+  passing out on Sun lounges at 9am whilst everyone ate breakfast... And this also meant waking up most of the hotel if you got home later than anyone else! The friday night Party was expensive and although we didn't attend, did walk through it a few times going back and fourth and no-one seemed to be having too much fun..... Seemed pretty dull to us! The positives;The hotel exterior and grounds are good, the pools are clean and the pool bars are def the feature of the hotel - great way to spend a day or night if you are happy to stay in the water (which we were)! 24 Hour room service was a great touch, some 3am munchies were perfect and general standard of the meals was good.The LOCATION - middle of Poppies Lane in between the 2 major roads in Kuta makes it probably the most ideal spot in Kuta to be staying! All in all, it's an OK place to stay with +'s and -'s. I would recommend you be selective with your room and make it clear to staff you will contact them if you want a ticket for the party.... The location and Pool bars seem to outweight the Negatives, but this hotel has the potential to be great but just doesn't deliver in our groups opinion.
