{"text":"Would stay here for business trip..... As a previous review mentioned ....most of the guests were westerners and on a business trip or at a conference. Mind you saying that whilst I was there the hotel held a very traditional Japanese wedding on the saturday and from what I could gather no expense was spared ! So perhaps the hotel is held in high regard by the locals ? ANA is a very clean and modern hotel. I stayed in a basic room on the 24th floor as I was only staying in Tokyo for 4 nights. Last time I stayed in Tokyo I was in the Palace Hotel and I felt that the hotel was in need of an 'upgrade' ...for want of an expression. ANA is perfect for the business traveller....and suits if travelling with your partner. Everything you need is in your room...if not ask and it will be . .. In fact if you need anything at all, the staff are all very eager to help and do more than is required of them. They really did try to make my stay as comfortable as possible and ALL staff were curtious, always willing to please and bent over backwards to help should you need any. For the more 'adventurous traveller' the hotel is located near the Roppongi ..literally a 10 minute stroll. ... Tokyo isnt necessarily the cheapest town in the world and the hotel certainly reflects that. I personally found the eating and drinking ''in house'' was particularly expensive. I had one incident which was most unexpected....got up one morning and there was NO water supply at all to the hotel...it was only off for 30 mins...but if one had appointments it was no consolation. When I returned later that day 2 bottles of red wine awaited me with a letter prefuse apology....which was very nice. I will stay again when I return to Tokyo . I would also recommend other business travellers and tourists ( if it's within your budgets) to stay there too.
