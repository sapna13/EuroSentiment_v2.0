{"text":"Ever-so-slightly faded glory -- for a great price We had the pleasure of staying at the Park Plaza this week, when we decided to add a night to a kid-friendly museum trip. I jumped on Hotwire and found a room at the Park Plaza for a very good rate; knowing the location and having seen the public spaces, I thought it was a good bet. We were not disappointed!At eighty years old, the Park Plaza recalls a grander era of travel. The hotel has been well maintained over the years, and, while there are signs of wear-and-tear, they in no way diminished our enjoyment of the comfortable room we had on the 11th floor. The room was nicely decorated, the beds cozy, the bathroom small but well appointed -- and had the power to transport you back to the Deco era, with its lovely mosaic tile. As my kids said, Wow! Fancy!.Wow! Fancy! works equally well for the lobby and other public spaces. Maybe I have spent too much time in anonymous business hotels in the last year, but the warmth of the Park Plaza, even if it's just a bit tatty around the edges, really made me feel good. The Park Plaza is in an excellent location, close to the Theater District, the Boston Common, etc. We were thrilled to fall out the door and walk a minute to the nearby Legal Seafoods for a wonderful family meal that really warmed us on a cold, rainy Boston night. There are several good restaurants right on the property (speculating here -- but I would imagine the Todd English steakhouse, Bonfire is worth a try)... and my kids were once again wowwed by the hotel restaurant's breakfast buffet (really just average for a high-end hotel, but a nice change for two kids I dragged to the hinterlands of New Hampshire).Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at the Park Plaza. The combination of a great value and a flashback to a more elegant time had us immediately planning a return trip...
