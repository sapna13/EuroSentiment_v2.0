{"text":"Better than average artsy hotel I stayed at the Pulitzer for a big conference and chose the hotel solely for the fact that it was the only mid-price hotel available in town. Later I learned it had great reviews on tripadvisor.com, and I was not disappointed.There was some problems with the room: specifically, the lighting controls were weird and hard to manage and master, and oddly the shower head flew off repeatedly when the water was turned on. There was no fix for the lighting, but the hotel quickly fixed the shower head problem. (Nice touch: the shower head was placed high on the wall -- nice for us tall folk.) Another weird issue -- the bar soap was tiny and smelly. I expect more from a high-end hotel.Otherwise, the room was fairly design-y. Dark wood floors, dark wood furniture, and a firm (comfortable) bed. One down-side of the dark wood everywhere was the lack of lighting in or near the closet. I was constantly afraid of leaving something behind in the drawers or on the shelves. The electric outlets in the room for charging cell phones and plugging-in laptops were not easy to reach, but the in-room safe was big enough for my 15 Macbook.Good things about the room: minibar was fairly inexpensive (2,20 euros for water) and free WiFi in the rooms. All rooms in the front of the hotel had small balconies overlooking the street with a view to Placa Catalunya down the street.My Wallpaper* guide to Barcelona mentioned that rooms 306 and 506 had extra space and a leather couch. I can vouch that 406 had the same extra space and couch. Nice and big, but a weird lay out in the long thin rectangular room. However, the fire escape map on the room door showed that most rooms were tiny. Be warned. Ask for one of the bigger rooms. As for the common areas, the bar area looked comfy although I did not take advantage. The breakfast buffet was great and included in my 300 euro room rate, so I can't comment on the value. I did not get room service, but I believe it was 24 hour service.Location-wise, it was quite convenient to Las Ramblas and the #1 underground metro line. And if you have to get to the hotel from the airport and there's a huge line for taxi's, the #17 bus from the airport stops just a block from the hotel (1,40 euros I think). (I usually do take the taxi, but in this case had to find an alternative method of transport!)All in all, I'd go back.
