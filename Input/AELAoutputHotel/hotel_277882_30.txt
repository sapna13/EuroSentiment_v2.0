{"text":"Better than expected Booked at the Hampton Inn because I needed to travel to NY for business and there was NOTHING else available. I've been told the first week of December is not a good time to come to the city on business because hotels are sky high (this property was $521, which was about a $100 per hour of sleep and about $350 more than I would expect to pay). I've stayed in the area but never at this hotel. At that rate you'd normally expect luxury, but this week all of the hotels were equally expensive and many had no availability at all. The Hampton Inn offered warm cookies on check in, a clean room with a comfortable bed, and a clean bathroom. The sheets were a bit scratchy but clean, and the bed was comfortable. The flat screen tv saves space in the small room. In the morning, there was a free warm (not quite hot) and continental breakfast available, with grab  go bags if you're on the run. The fitness center consists of one treadmill and one bike, so if you're expecting a workout, stay elsewhere. I did not find the area noisy...in fact it's a bit deserted, but there are a few restaurants around and the Metro is very close. One downside was a colleague was shut out of the hotel due to maintenance on his room (read: oversold) but the hotel, to its credit, gave him a voucher to stay at the Express, not far away. Also, a couple of the rooms are actually on the basement level, so beware. Nonetheless, I would stay at this hotel again. It was a short walk to the financial district.
