{"text":"Nothing exceptional or spectacular My partner and I decided to stay at the Bilderberg Hotel Jan Luyken after reading all the positive reviews. Well, I do agree with most the reviewers that this hotel is well managed but I don√à?√¨t think it deserves such a high rating.We arrived at the hotel at about 730am. Although we had requested for an early early check-in, we were told that the standard rooms were booked. We were then offered an option to upgrade to either a business or superior room at extra cost. At the end of a 12-hour flight, my partner and I decided that it was better to get some rest rather than to roam around Amsterdam for the next 7 hours. I began to wonder if this is the tactic that they use on those guests who arrive from an early morning flight. Apparently, the receptionist used this tactic on another guest when I was checking out of the hotel at 930am two days later. Hmmm...Other than that, the hotel is located in a very centralised location. It√à?√¨s located in a premium residential estate and is within walking distance to the Van Gogh Museum and the luxury brand boutiques such as Louis Vuitton and Cartier. The Superior Room has a reasonable size floor area. It√à?√¨s well designed and has the neceesary amenities that you require. The only complaint is that the bathroom is a bit tricky to move around if you√à?√¨re more senior. The floor gets too wet after a shower. The glass door that covers the bathtub does not help much. And it√à?√¨s not huge. We were told that it√à?√¨s bigger than those in the standard room.We did not try the breakfast. We thought that it was too pricey (it√à?√¨s about 17 Euro). We had our breakfast at a cafe behind the hotel. The cafe, CaffePC, is located just behind the hotel. The establishment is featured in many local magazines and guide books. They serve decent breakfast. I would recommend guests to give CaffePC a try. On the whole, the hotel staff are okay. And the hotel is ordinary. Nothing great to shout about.
