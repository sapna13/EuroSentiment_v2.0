{"text":"Gem in NYC! We just returned from an overnight at The Chelsea Pines in in NYC. We were attending a concert at the Hiro Ballroom in The Maritime Hotel, and couldn't afford a room there. So we started doing some research to find something more reasonable. We came across CPI from a map-quest search for hotels close to the concert venue. The Hotel was spotless, very tasteful, exceptionally welcoming (a plus for us, since we don't know NYC very well, and felt a little overwhelmed). Each room has a movie star theme. But it's nothing gaudy or tacky. In our room (we stayed in Room 135, the Tony Curtis room) there was a Tony Curtis gold star on the door, and it was decorated with very cool, framed movie posters from his films. The bed was very comfy, the AC worked perfectly, the towels were heavenly, the toiletries were exceptional, the room was clean and comfortable, there was a safe and a fridge, very nice TV with cable, and free wi-fi access. Some rooms (the Economy rooms) share a toilet but have privates showers. Our room was a Deluxe Superior, and had a complete private bathroom. Your stay includes a great continental breakfast in a cute kitchen area, and you have access to coffee, tea, cookies, etc at all hours. Also, there is a cute veranda for outdoor seating. I should mention that while NYC is obviously noisy, the CPI was totally quiet from the moment we walked in the front door. I don't know if it's a noise-proof door, or what, but we were very impressed. Our room was equally quiet, although we were aware of people using the hallway toilets during the night. The CPI is also easy walking distance to lots of great restaurants, bars, and shops. We were disappointed we only had one night there!The Chelsea Pines Inn is a gay hotel, although they welcome all orientations. My husband and I (obviously not gay) felt completely comfortable and welcomed by everyone we encountered. We will absolutely stay at The Chelsea Pines Inn again when we make it back to NYC!
