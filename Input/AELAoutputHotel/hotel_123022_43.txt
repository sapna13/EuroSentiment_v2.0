{"text":"Very good inexpensive hotel I have had roughly 10 stays at the Silver Cloud Lake Union between January and September 2007 due to work travel. I can write that it is a good hotel to stay at in Seattle if you are looking for something within a few miles of downtown in the sub $150 per night range. Parking, a hotel shuttle to downtown (a cheaper alternative to taxis) and breakfast are also included in the rates which I would think makes it a great pick for those in Seattle for a few days that want to keep their costs down.That said, I feel it is my responsiblity to write that the free breakfast scene always appears to the equilvalent of the first 20 seconds when a pinata explodes at a birthday party for 8 year olds. There are many random families eager to get their money's worth and willing to climb over each other to get the last bagel. I avoid the breakfast room and go hungry if necessary.Breakfast room aside, the hotel rooms are adequate relative to the price and always clean and the staff has always been helpful and efficient. For those that value fitness facilities, they consist of a small room with a treadmill and an elliptical machine. But, you can always run around Lake Union which is across the street and is a great alternative.For comparison, I have also have several stays at the similar Homewood Suites. The location is probably not as good, it has larger rooms, and is often priced at $189 per night. The Silver Cloud is probably a better option if you don't need to stay downtown, want something clean and want to pay around $150 a night or less.
