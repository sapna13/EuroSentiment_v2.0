{"text":"It's everything that's good and bad about Marriotts This is an absolute monster of a hotel - it's huge and has only a single front desk. So you may encounter lines at check-in or check-out. It's fairly nice as far as Marriotts go - but kind of sterile, dull, predictable (which isn't all bad, but if you close the curtains, you may as well be in Ohio or Kansas). i.e., they haven't done a great job of giving a local feel to the place (aside from the palm trees and orchids in the atrium). There's a fair amount of street noise if you're on the lower floors.It's not a super value - we paid $1000 for 3 nights in an ocean view room. We really enjoyed watching the spectacular sunsets from the balcony. The configuration of the hotel is L-shaped so that for the most expensive rooms, the balconies have no privacy. One way, you have a great beach view, the other way, you're looking into dozens of hotel rooms. The bed and bathroom were clean and comfortable - not super-luxe by any means.The extras add up quickly. $22\/day for parking (more if you valet). $26 for the breakfast buffet (it was included in the package we booked thru Travelocity). The buffet was quite good, but there was often a 10-15 minute lineup to get in.The pool is fine - again, nothing special. Many Waikiki hotels have more interesting pools. There's a big pile of towels that you can use for the beach.We liked the location - at the Diamond Head end of the strip. There are several great restaurants on Kapahulu Ave, if you want to avoid eating in the hotel or on the strip (generally, very mediocre fare unless you're a fan of the Cheesecake Factory). Don't miss Ono Hawaiian Food (about 1\/4 mile up Kapahulu) for some authentic Hawaiian food.
