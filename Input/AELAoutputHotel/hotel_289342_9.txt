{"text":"Had everything we needed! Fab little hotel. Got back this morning from a short stay in this fab little hotel. Highly recommended. Can't understand why it's classed as a 2star - I've not long come back from a 4star in Rome, which wasn't any different! Room was slightly on the small side, but that's not really a negative, as it had everything we needed. Room was exceptionally clean. Clean bed sheets and crisp white towels, which is what you would expect anyway but after reading reviews of other hotels around La Ramblas - you never know!! Slept through the night - no problems with noise. Mini bar \/ fridge in room - apparently the refreshments are free - they didn't charge us for the water we took. There is a coffee machine in the room, but even my clever techno sister couldn't work it out! Continental breakfast. A little basic, but very filling. The usual, bread, toast, cakes, (try the pain au chocolate - yummy) fruit, cereals, tea coffee fruitjuice etc.etc. ALL Staff were very friendly and helpful. Excellent locatation. Very close to La Ramblas - less than a five minute walk - in a straight line, so no way of getting lost!! Lots of very nice clothes shops all around the hotel, so get ready to spend some money. Just behind the hotel is Bus Stop No.1 of the open top hop on\/off bus. This will take you to all the sights around Barcelona. it cost 20euros for one day, or 24 euros for a two day ticket. Well worth the money if you want to try and fit everything in in a short space of time. We just managed most of the sights in two days. If you're looking for somewhere nice to eat, try The Attic Restaurant near the centre of La Ramblas. V.nice restaurant. Bill for 4 of us came to 100euros (√ä√£¬¢70) for 4 three course meals, which included a bottle of one of their dearer wines. Couldn't understand why it was so cheap there as the food was fab. (Tho, Make sure you ask for your starter to come separately to your main, or they'll bring it all out together)!!!!I travel a lot, and always research my hotels before I go - this hotel is definitely value for money. No complaints from me.
