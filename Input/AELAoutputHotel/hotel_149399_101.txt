{"text":"Bumps along the way but enjoyed- Royal Service was key! There were some bumps along the way, but overall we enjoyed our stay 5\/21-5\/25. We are in our mid 30√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and went for our anniversary. We opted for Royal Service which I think was well worth it and made the difference in our experience. The place is exceptionally large and beautiful. I can't say enough about the grounds and first class atmosphere. However, the food and service was good to great depending and could use improvement. RS check in went smooth and they were very helpful since we missed our entire first day due to the airline. They upgraded us complimentary to a suite which was very nice. Be sure to tell the driver Royal Service so you get off on the second stop. The room was a bit musty at first, but nothing a travel candle couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fix. Bottled water, Rum, and soft drinks were provided in the room. After a few attempts we stopped trying to call our butler and just called the RS number for things. Only once did we have a problem with dinner reservations; but we called after 2 and got in with no problem (thanks RS). The water and sand were spectacular. The RS beach had seaweed, but the bali beds and bar service were great. There weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ any floats to use in the water. The water was clearer in the regular beach area. I did notice people reserving spots on the beach and by the pool, but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ everywhere. We ate at the seafood, American, Dominican, and Gabi restaurants. I think the seafood restaurant was the best and the grill near the beach was awful. The best meals and service by far were at dinner. Lunch at Gabi was great, but the poolside snacks need some improvement. Breakfast at the Marketplace was great too, but service was sometimes lacking. Everyone was friendly, but sometimes the staff would totally ignore you without saying a word. Other times, you couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even get your request out before they were trying to help. Also, the vacation salespeople were really a pain. A firm NO is the only way to deal with them. We enjoyed the nighttime entertainment; but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not exactly a night on the town if that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for. Drinks\/bars were great; although I did notice during the day they seemed to use the same slushy mix in several drinks as another poster complained. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind the train; but with RS we rode mainly in the golf carts. We did the Stingray bay\/Carnival festival excursion and highly recommend it. Having been back a month, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think this place was as bad as others made it out to be. In fact, I think it has awesome potential. I would recommend only going Royal Service to make sure you get the better experience. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° return until the service and food improved from good to great to match its beauty. BTW- My husband got sick our last full day and had to see a doctor when we returned. He√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ gotten sick from most of our trips to the Caribbean but this was the worst. Be sure to take the necessary precautions. ","annotations":[]}
