{"text":"over rated There are both good and bad things about this hotel. I have stayed her three times toward the end of 2006. During the first stay we had a two bedroom waterfront room with living room and kitchen. The views and balcony were unbelievable. The living space was huge. However, the decor was just fair. It feels like it needs a renovation. The doorknob to our bathroom door fell off, as well as the handle on the toilet. In the second bedroom it literally rained water from above. They came to fix it several times. Each time they'd say, it's all fixed only to have it leak again a short time later. When we complained to the front desk they didn't seem that concerned about the leak and didn't have any other rooms to move us to. During our other stays we just had the run of the mill hotel room without a view. These are very small rooms, but the bathrooms are a nice size. I certainly would be disappointed if we'd paid for them, but were there on business. The location is very convenient to Cocowalk if that is of interest. The food at the restaurant is really good and the view is wonderful. We had both breakfast, dinner, and some drinks in the course of our stays. My biggest gripe is with the front desk staff. We got the WORST service there of any hotel I have ever stayed at and I travel a lot. On three occasions I waited my turn for over 20 minutes!! There was a problem with my bill during every stay. And, the front desk staff never acted interested or concerned in my problems with anything. I sent my comments in, but never heard back. Customer service is important to me.
