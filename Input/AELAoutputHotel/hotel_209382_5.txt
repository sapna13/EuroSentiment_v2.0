{"text":"Great hotel for the price! We recently stayed at the Millennium UN Plaza over the Christmas holiday and had a great experience. We took a redeye flight and arrived at the hotel at about 6:30 am. We didn't book a room for the night before and decided to chance and see if we could check into our room early. Turns out they didn't have a room ready for us to check in, but we decided to pay the extra $100 and upgrade to a suite for that night since they had one available. So by 7 am we were napping in the suite. The next day we were ready to downgrade to the room that we booked, but they decided to let us stay in the suite for the rest of our trip at no additional charge-- NICE!!! The suite had an AMAZING view of the skyline and river! There were two full bathrooms and a living room\/ sitting area and separate bedroom. We didn't need all of that space as we didn't spend much time in the room. The rooms very clean and well maintained, and I really don't have any complaints. We were with another couple who staying in a regular room and they said it was very nice as well. The decor of the hotel is slightly dated, but not shabby or in disrepair. The staff was very friendly and accomodating.The location was pretty good, we were able to walk to many of the places we were going.Overall, I think this was a good value. We paid $175\/night at Christmas time and I think it was a good price for this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
