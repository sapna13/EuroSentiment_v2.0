{"text":"great vacation at catalonia bavaro My husband and I (in our thirties) stayed her from October 1st til October 7th. The weather was fantastic! 1st trip to DR, 3rd all-inclusive. Upon arrival at airport- did not realize we had to pay $10 each to enter the country, but luckily it was worth the cover charge. Made arrangements ahead of time for transportation thru Dominican airport transfers.com It was $40 each way total, which was probably more than a taxi, but they were waiting right out front to take us to the hotel, and pick-up from hotel back to airport was already set up so we didn't have to worry about it at the end of the trip.  We checked in in 10 minutes, which was nice cuz it was 9pm and we wanted to eat. Buffet was still open so we had time to check-in, go to room, and then go eat.  Buffet was ok but not great. The steakhouse was really good, italian and Mexican good, we missed our japanese reservation. The beach party on Monday was excellent. Make sure to go. Good food good entertainment. We were able to walk right up our first morning and make all our dinner reservations for the week in 5 minutes, no problem. We spent the days on the beach or at the pool . Volleyball on beach,other activities and a bar. Plenty of chairs and shade for everybody. The beach is stunning. Palm trees that almost go down to the water!Pool was gigantic, and had a swim up bar, which was where we could be found. Met so many people from different places. Staff was nice and helpful. We ate Pizza and chicken at the pool every single day, sometimes twice! Even the fries were tasty.  My husband and I snorkeled ($20 refundable deposit for equipment), and scuba($85 per person) at the resort. Scuba was excellent! coral and lots of fish 45 minutes. I am EXTREMELY claustrophobic and took 4 lessons in the pool before venturing out in the ocean. The scuba guides were so helpful, and it is only because of them I was able to stay down the whole time, They even held my hand the entire time!! We left the resort for 1 excursion that was dune buggy, horseback ride, visit a cave with fresh water swimming, and visit to Macao beach. $69 per person. (can't remember tour company but booked at front desk) It was really fun!! The only thing is that Catalonia is far so you are the first ones picked up (10am?) and the last ones dropped off (5pm). The club was ok, we had more fun after meeting the animation team and other travelers. Definately more packed on the weekends. (Even some apparent local visitors who approached my husband twice for services that were not part of the all-inclusive. !! Ay dios mio!! ) Tips---bring bug spray, lots of sunscreen,and many singles. Tip everybody a dollar or two, why not?? left money and chocolate for the maids everyday, with a note for anything extra we needed, and we were fully stocked with towels beer and water, more than we needed.  We will be returning to Punta cana and to The catalonia bavaro ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1500,"mention":"Pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1495},{"endOffset":1574,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":1569},{"endOffset":1574,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":1569},{"endOffset":1574,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":1569},{"endOffset":2352,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2348},{"endOffset":2736,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":2727}]}
