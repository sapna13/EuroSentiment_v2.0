{"text":"The personal touch in Sydney We recently spent 3 nights at Simpsons on our first visit to Sydney. Upon arrival we were greeted by Keith Wherry who, with pre-prepared map in hand, advised us on how to best take advantage of our limited time. In light of the beautiful weather he steered us to a nearby waterside restaurant as opposed to our original plan to book a less scenic venue. The Woolloomooloo Wharf is a 5 minute walk from the hotel with waterside dining and an unanticipated view of the bats arising from the Sydney Botanical Gardens. Simpsons is a good 20 minute walk from Circular Quay although one is tempted to spend hours strolling though the gardens enroute. Taxis are an inexpensive alternative, especially on the way back so as to avoid a somewhat uphill climb. The hotel is a converted Victorian with period furnishings and interesting art. Our room (number 10, the Victoria) was very comfortable and spacious with a large walk-in shower. The air-conditioned hotel was a welcome refuge after a hard day of sightseeing. The internet connection in the study was very efficient although one is tempted to lounge in the leather sofas, reading the owner's Rolls Royce literature and drinking sherry, instead. The staff was very pleasant and Mr. Wherry was a congenial host who was very flexible in meeting our travel needs upon departure. Simpsons is an ideal alternative for those who do not wish to stay in a downtown highrise and appreciate a more neighborly atmosphere.
