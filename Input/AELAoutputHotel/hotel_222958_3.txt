{"text":"good value, but with caveats There is nothing written in the other reviews taht i would disagree with. Yes it is close to teh T and a busy street, and planes fly right overhead. The shuttle to the T station\/airport is crowded. The restaruant and pool are not on site but at the adjoing Ramada, owned by the same people.But consider that Boston is usually pretty expensive for hotels, espcially any closer to teh city center. I paid $134 a night, which was far cheaper than other properties closer in, and i was still easily able to get to where i wanted to go. Plus the free parking saves you the $20+ you'd pay downtown.If the weather is nice, and you dont mind walking, it is just over a mile to the nearest T station (not the one the shuttle takes you to), so i avoided the crowded shuttle. Coming back to the hotel was not crowded at all.Breakfast was wonderful, a little more than usually expected. waffles each day, plus other hot foods (including eggs) the other day. not sure why eggs were not both days, but i was very late to eat that first day.If you have kids, there is a very nice city beach\/playground just behind the hotel. If you are a runner\/biker\/walker it is on the developing harborwalk trail system, which i ran on each day i was there, felt safe and was very nice.If you are a person who sleeps lightly or who would be bothered by any of the issues listed in the reviews - STAY AWAY, you wont be happy here. But if none of these things are things that you are really concerned about, this is a great value hotel for Boston.
