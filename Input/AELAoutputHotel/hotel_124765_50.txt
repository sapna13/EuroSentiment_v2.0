{"text":"Hotel 480 is still a great place I've stayed at the Hotel 480 for at least 4 nights each of the past 7 years. It was the Crowne Plaza for the first 6 and recently became the Hotel 480 before my most recent stay. The service remains top notch and the rooms are comfortable. Not much has changed since the name switch. The only difference I noted was the absence of the Crowne Plaza sleep kit, which isn't that much of a loss. The mattresses and bedding are pleasant and there is plenty of work space if you are on business. If you are travelling with family, I suggest you request one of their Family Rooms. These rooms are at the end of each floor. I've stayed on both ends-if you like the sound of cable cars, the rooms located on the Powell and Sutter corner will do just fine. If you want more quiet, try to get the opposite end of the hall.The location is fantastic with many shops and restaurants within easy walking distance. As noted earlier, two cable car routes run right past the hotel and their are numerous taxis on the street. The BART station is down Powell Street, about a easy 10 minute walk.The hotel is going to go through a year-long remodeling project. Five floors at a time will be refurbished, so be sure to ask about the work in progress before you book.I spend quite a few nights of the year in hotels on business and I always enjoy my stay at this property. One addition I hope they do make is to put a spark in their on site bar and restaurant. ","annotations":[]}
