{"text":"Please Avoid if you want to be close to town -- extremely inconvenient location We spent one night at this Hotel in early January, 2007. Hotels.com website misleads you in believing this hotel is close to Orchard Rochard but in actuality they are miles away in a very inconvenient location.They apparently have another property (associated with the Le Meridien?) which is close to Orchard Road but that is not this hotel.You may feel this hotel is a good deal but the inconvenience of getting to and fro is NOT at all worth it. You can pay S$ 20-40 more and get a lovely hotel on Orchard Road itself.If your plan is to just spend some time in a hotel I would recommend this hotel. If your plans are to visit town and get around Singapore I would not stay at this hotel at all. You can get around easier by taxi but the cost will offset any savings on hotel price. It takes 40-60 minutes each way (no joke) to get to Orchard Road or anywhere around town by MRT and or bus.The hotel otherwise is very nice and the staff are extremely helpful. The rooftop pool is lovely with a gorgeous panaromic view. The overall hotel, the rooms and bathrooms are very new and would appeal to anybody. But their way-off location negates these other positives.If you are used to eating at small but yummy hawker-style restaurants in South East Asia, there is a strip of restaurants right next door. We love most Asian food and loved the food here. It is truly open 24 hours.The hotel is located in a residential area and as with most places in S'pore it appeared safe.The hotel's free shuttle to the airport was helpful. It takes about 15 minutes each way.I would be happy to answer any questions\/concerns you may have. ","annotations":[]}
