{"text":"Horrible!!!! My experience at this hotel was dreadful from the moment I arrived! The hotel room and the lobby are beautiful but that is all. I have been traveling to Puerto Rico since I was a child. I have been a guest at various top notch hotels, paradores and modest hotels too. I vacation at least twice a year. This has been by far the worst experience of my traveling life. I paid alot of money to stay at The Gran Melia. I paid alot because I wanted to see my eighty year old grandmother who lives there and have her visit me. The first night I arrived, we both got food poisioning from one of their restaurants. The next morning I needed something light since I had a bad night. I walked to a food station, the hotel has on the premises and was told, we ran out of breakfast. I couldn't believe it. The employee gave me attitude while sarcastically informing me after I asked,  where do I get breakfast. She answers without even looking at me  you can go to the restaurant and then walks away. It cost $25pp to have a very limited buffet breakfast. at their restaurant. You also have to wait a long time if you want eggs. The guy preparing the eggs skips out for a break when he sees a line forming. At the pool bar, I witnessed one of the employees handling food with his bare hands. It was repulsing. The employees have major attitude. They seem more interested in socializing with each other then in assisting guests. I have never experienced such low quality service. I have gotten better treatment from modest unknown hotels. This place is also boring!! BORING!! Besides the pool and casino, there is nothing to do! I felt like a hostage in this prison. You pay Japanese prices for everything. It's not worth it. Trust me. As a result of my experience, I checked out of this prison in the middle of my paid stay. I felt it was more costly to stay then to lose the payment for the rest of the hotel stay, which was another four days. My advise to anyone visiting Puerto Rico and wanting to stay at a nice place, try the Paradores if you want culture, nature, woods, authentic experience and real Puerto Rican cuisine. If you want a tourist experience, try the Old San Juan Hotel and Casino. I have stayed there and love it too. You can eat at the hotel or just outside of the hotel. There are so many wonderful eateries and restaurants just outside of this hotel. It is close to everything. Stay away from the Gran Melia Resort unless you want to be bored, crave substandard service, and want to be charged and arm and a leg for fast food which is trying to pass as gourmet cuisine.
