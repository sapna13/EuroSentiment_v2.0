{"text":"Great Hotel, good location, excellent staff, champagne breakfasts Got moved here on arrival from the Majestic because their water was dirty in some rooms and they were having it fixed. At first I feared the worst but walking into the marble reception I knew the hotel was better. The hotel is about 250m from the train station on the main road round to the duomo and just up a little side street about 30m. The train station is where the buses and tourist buses run to so it is most people first port of call on arrival. No carrying your heavy bags across town.The area is safe, and there is a good selection of restaurants in the area to the north and east. It is about 5 minutes walk without baggage to the duomo via several different routes you can choose including the main road, the market, or side streets.The rooms were large and relatively modern, there were huge bathrooms, a safe with key code combination of your choosing (self-set on first use) and a mini fridge (although 5 Euros for a bottle of water). Only one English channel on TV but you're not here to watch TV anyway. full complimentary supplies in bathroom, shoe shine, sewing kit, soaps, shampoos, body ltions etc. The breakfast was sparse choice, but good food and thebest bit - champagne for breakfast (unless you prefer coffeee). Breakfast was buffet. The staff are multi-lingual and there is a free secure room for baggage after you check out which is guarded by a doorman.I have travelled all across Europe and the US and stayed in some good, bad and ugly hotels. I would definitely stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
