{"text":"Excelent for business and leisure Stayed there from 30th Oct till 2nd Nov during a business trip. My second time in Singapore. Upon check in I asked for a harbour view room in a high floor and got one on the 41st. Spacious and very quite room (stayed in the 4172 twin, even with single occupancy) and bath (water pressure is understandably low, since you are sky high). Slippers, bathrobe, iron+board, customizable AirCond, choice of pillows, easy-to-set alarm, electronic do-not-disturb button, quick dry-cleaner, quick check in and check out, helpful valet and taxi-hailing service are just a few of the very pleasant surprises.Checkout is until 1PM, but if you have a late flight out of Singapore, you can ask for a late checkout (not available this time due to fully-booked status) or access to the hospitality lounge (a shared room in the 8th floor, where you (and others) can refresh and relax).Breakfast in the 2nd floor is either in the SwissCafe (bigger, louder, more food-choices) or the asian-inspired Copi Tiam (where they try to get you to go, because the SwissCafe is most of the times full), which is good for a change.This is a self-contained complex, with 2 hotels (Stamford+Plaza), 15 restaurants+bars, a conference centre (4th floor), an 8th floor SPA (extra charge) and a 4 level shopping-mall (except the NewYork Metropolitan Museum of Art shop, nothing to crave about). Eat out at one of the street Hawkers, which are clean, safe and full of local cuisineWalking distance to everything of interest for leisure (Boat Quay, Clarke Quay, Esplanade, Asian Civ Museum), Shopping (next door Chijmes is excellent for ethnic artwork; 10 min walk to Orchard Road or Sim Slim Square+Funan for IT stuff); ethnic diversity sightseeing\/shopping (Chinatown, Little India, Arab Quarter) or business (Central Business District, Big Corporate Offices on Bridge Road or Suntec).If you manage to get a room in a high floor, then don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother going to the 70-72 floor restaurants and bars, since the view is not so much different then from your room and the price-service relation is below what you can get elsewhere.Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss the next door Raffles Hotel. Pure luxury. Indulge in the buffet lunch and feel like a maharaja for a couple of hours.15 min to the airport (even in rush our) cost you either 21 SingDollar (standard taxi) or 35 (limo-service).Would definitely stay here again and recommend this to all my colleagues and friends without hesitation.The only neg was a bar-charge I never did, but they tried to pin on my invoice upon check-out. Since they couldn't produce a signed receipt, the took it out at once.
