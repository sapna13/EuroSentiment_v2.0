{"text":"lovely hotel We had a great time at Pan Pacific. Really beautiful hotel and the staff were exceptional. Our room was very nice, well appointed and clean. The only drawback was we were very tired after our flight and went to bed early but couldn't sleep because of the singer in foyer! Never had that problem before! We were given a late check out because our flight was delayed by 8 hours and we were very grateful. A very nice touch and I felt the hotel staff couldn't do enough for us and seem to really care that we were held up.The location is very central and there are numerous shops and restaraunts in the area. Raffles is a short 10 minute walk away but beware if you dine there! We had a glass of house wine each, a peice of fish between us and a serving of fried rice and the bill came to over $125! I kid you not! A once in a lifetime experience!Little India and Arab Street are within walking distance if you like to walk which we do. If you don't you can use the Hop On, Hop Off service outside the hotel. If you fly Singapore Airlines it's free or $12 if not and you can use the ticket all day. It takes you all around the city and is great value. Don't be afraid to travel by public transport as everyone we met were extremely friendly and helpful.So my only real problem with the hotel and I left it until last because I hate to be negative is that before we checked into the hotel and after I paid for the accomodation in advance I sent an email requesting information about doing something special there for our anniversary. No reply and I couldn't help wondering if any one had actually read it! It might not have been important to management but it was to us as it was our 30th wedding anniversary. So one tiny suggestion is that they read emails from their guests.
