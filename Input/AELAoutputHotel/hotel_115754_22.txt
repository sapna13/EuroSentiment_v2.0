{"text":"Great stay We stayed here for 1 week and enjoyed it. My wife had a conference at the convention center Sun-Wed and I worked from the hotel room. The chair, desk, and free wired internet were fine and I had no problems. The mini-fridge was nice to have too. We didn't use the 24 hour fitness directly across the street but it was free with room card. We did use the hotel pool\/hot tub and it was nice. It was only 10-15 minute walk to the convention center if you weren't able to take the hotel shuttle that only left on the hour. We did have a room on the 5th floor that faced the highway (I-5 is very close). The traffic was somewhat loud, but I didn't find it very disturbing. I always bring earplugs when staying in hotels and slept fine with them in. If you are sensitive to noise, you should request a room that does not face I-5. The only real complaint I had was it was all one big room. I guess I am used to Embassy Suites where the bedroom is separated by a wall and door. You could not have one person sleep and another watch TV since the TV was between the bed and couch (with 1\/2 wall between them). The breakfast was surprisingly good. You could make your own waffles and they even had fruit and whipped cream toppings along with maple and boysenberry syrup. They had 5+ types of cereal, several types of breads and toasters, bacon, sausage, oatmeal, fruit, and milk\/juices\/coffee daily. Some days they even had pancakes, but not every day. Overall, a nice hotel with free internet and free breakfast downtown. I would definitely stay there again.
