{"text":"A Quality Hotel Jury's provides a very comfortable stay with everything you need to make you feel at home.  I generally like to stay in boutique hotels so I straight away noticed that there was nothing distinctive about the hotel's design or furnishings. However, the bed is comfortable, the TV is large and the shower was great.  In fact, this hotel had a very nice, and large, bathroom for the price. The room itself was a little small.  We ordered room service once and it was a very tasty angus burger delivered after midnight and in generous portions. Bonuses: Free internet and printer. 2 terminals downstairs that you can use at your leisure. Free water bottles, 2 per day. The mini-bar fridge is empty. What a fantastic innovation! We loved this and could fill it with our own soft drinks and extra water and even put some snacks in there the night of our departure to eat the next day. Very convenient! The only complaint I can make is that the room is a little drab in terms of decorating and the TV didn't have much of a selection of channels. The only cable channels were sports  news, no entertainment channels. Also from what I read I expected the neighborhood to be more energetic. It was really a business district and completely died after dark. All in all I would definitely recommend the Jurys Boston and also recommend the tiny Italian takeaway place on the corner down the road called Viga (304 Stuart St). Yum! It's only open 11-3 on weekdays for lunch - lines out the door!
