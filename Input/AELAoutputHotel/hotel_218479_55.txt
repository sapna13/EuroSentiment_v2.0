{"text":"Go Elsewhere! Baaaaaaaaaad service! Rude front desk staff, Patrick is a rudeTransat Rep... $27.00 US for suntan lotion, $8.00 US for bag of chips... Bar fridge stocked with Coke Light and Tonic Water...My son saw a worker let themselves in someones room and took a coke out of their fridge. I went up to the bar and asked for 3 bottled water, they gave me 2 and said they didn't have any more, then when I left, proceeded to give their workers bottled water...Not enough service staff, had to line up at bar for a drink everytime, then when you give them a tip, they don't even thank you. Gave maid $5.00 US a day for room service and one day got four towels, next few days got 2 towels, put her tip down to $3.00 US, got no toilet paper!! Bathroom plug didn't work, TV didn't work, air conditioner didn't work first night, staff came up at 1:45 am to fix it and covered the bathroom and hallway with buckets of water... Public washrooms, only 5 stalls for 600 rooms, one on the beach and one in the lobby, 90% of the time one of the stalls in each washroom didn't work... Know some spanish because most staff don't know ANY english... Good points: the beach and no beach vendors and the fresh pasta and meat at the supper buffet (warning: tip jar is left out) Very long flight from Vancouver, 8.5 hours and your squished in like sardines. I prefer Huatulco, Mexico, the people are friendly regardless of a tip or not... The Gala Resort was a nice place with good food and wonderful grounds. PS. don't forget your travel alarm because no rooms anywhere have clocks in them....
