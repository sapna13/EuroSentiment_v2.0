{"text":"This is how hotel service should be like! Amankila has one of the most beautiful hotel grounds in the whole of Asia. While the hotel was built quite a few years ago, the property and fittings are very, very well maintained, and a big plus point is that the flora\/greenery is mature and adds to the ambience of the place. The cliffside location adds to the drama. The staff to guest ratio here is outstanding: I believe it is around 5 to 1. The staff are very well trained, quick to anticipate your needs and does everything with a smile. Yet they remain unobtrusive. Indeed, one of the big selling points is that there are only 33 villas in the property, hence you feel that you have the whole place almost to yourself. Even with a fairly high occupancy rate, we seldom saw many guests milling around. The food is surprisingly good by hotel standards. And do try the massages in your room - they are blissful. The one gripe we had, and this might seem very trivial, was that there were three tankers moored right in front of the hotel beach. I think there is an oil terminal nearby (likely built after the hotel was constructed, I suppose). It is a shame, really, because it is the only blip in what is almost a picture-perfect hotel. Interestingly, we noticed that hardly anyone used the beach during the days we were there; this could very well be due to the presence of the tankers...
