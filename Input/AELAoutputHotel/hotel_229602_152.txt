{"text":"Charming hotel near Rue Cler I was travelling with 6 other people and we were all staying near Rue Cler. Most hotels are small and book quickly. The hotels where others were staying were booked. That's how I came across this gem of a hotel.The front desk staff is very professional and treated us very well. They were accomodating when we asked them to make dinner reservations for our party of 7. The room was very clean and comfortable and had air conditioning. The windows have privacy shades which keeps light out and reduces street noise (I heard no street noise at all). The shades are on the exterior and are operated by a click of a button (by the bed). There is a coffee maker with free coffee, and a mini-bar (at fairly reasonable rates). There is a dresser, desk, armoire, and TV in the room. There is internet access in the breakfast room, which is free for guests. It is not attached to a printer, so if you need to print something, you will need to go elsewhere.The hotel is about a minutes walk from the Rue Cler pedestrian street. This street has a couple of cafes, a delicious crepe\/Greek restaurant, and many other shops. There are two grocery stores within the block and a couple of bakeries. We never ate breakfast at the hotel because there we opted to eat outside at a cafe or ate on the run (being late to meet our family\/friends).The hotel is a few minutes walk from the subway (only one subway line stops at Ecole Militaire).It is an easy walk to the Eiffel Tower and it was fun to walk over there in the evening and watch the light show and people.I would definitely stay at this hotel again. It was an excellent stay!
