{"text":"An excellent local hotel chain I didn't know what to expect from a local chain, and I was very pleasantly surprised to have all my expectations met. The king bed and armchair-ottoman combo were comfortable and in good repair, lighting was plentiful, the floors were well padded (good for my morning stretches), the wireless internet access was trouble-free, the room ventilation worked well, and the showerhead was unclogged (little things count!). The in-room microwave and refrigerator were godsends, allowing my wife and I to economize on our meal expenses. The continental breakfasts included some protein as well as grains (I eat low-carb), so the hotel gets bonus points for that. The hotel even has a nicely equipped gym, with cardio, machines, dumbbells, and stability balls, so I could do complete workouts.The complementary computer room (with printer) was a novelty for me, and I appreciated it when it came time to print our boarding passes.The one time we requested housekeeping service -- paper towels at 7:30 PM -- they were at our door within 10 minutes. The room was always immaculate, even though we left later in the mornings, after the housekeeping staff made its first rounds. The desk staff was courteous and attentive.Being close to I-5, the major north-south highway here, is a plus, although the one-way streets around it require some learning.The price was very reasonable, too, considering all the amenities. The Silver Cloud chain pays attention to the big and small things, making our stay here very pleasant. We would definitely consider staying here again on our next trip to Seattle. ","annotations":[]}
