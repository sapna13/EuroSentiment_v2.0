{"text":"Best breakfast PROS:-Amazing breakfast in variety and quality. Best bacon, yogurt, fresh fruits, cereals, fresh juices, rolls  croissants, mini hotdog, deli meat, coffee, espresso, hot chocolate, etc... Everything was delicious except for the mass scrambled congealed eggs. Should switch to medium boiled eggs.-Staff was helpful. Made reservations to the Uffizi and Academia. Gave good advice on how to get to Siena and advised us to buy our train ticket from the nearby Tour center to save us time. Told us about a Beauty Pharmaceutica ran by nuns hundreds of years ago, that sells creams, perfume, hair products that people from around the world come to buy. It's on the same block as the hotel. Awesome hand cream 'Almond paste' and 'Calendula face cream'. Spoke English.-Wireless internet access in room-Spacious roomCONS:-Bed made my lower back hurt. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have this problem with 2 other hotels.-there is only one button in the bathroom for light  vent, and the vent was noisy, so you can't use the bathroom quietly in the middle of the night. -Noisy in the morning, because we were on the 1st floor and heard all of the breakfast dishes  chairs downstairs. Not a problem if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e a heavy sleeper. Very quiet at night if you face the garden. -Doors need to be slammed to be shut  locked simultaneously. At least, that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what most people were doing.Side notes:-Staff was helpful  professional, but not warm.-My spouse and I had major (pollen) allergy attacks in April. Luckily we brought Flonase and Antihistamine.
