{"text":"From Holland: Fantastic! (Ignore the bad reviews) Dear Punta Cana visitors,Here you find a very positive review from a couple from Holland. From 5 till 20 July 2006 we have stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach hotel in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic. We had a really great time, it was fantastic!!I haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ placed a review on the internet before, but in this case I do, at least to put some balance between the negative experiences of some people and the fantastic experiences like ours.I myself have also used this website and reviews prior to our holiday to help us choose a hotel and although I had become very enthusiastic about the Bavaro Beach hotel (from the pictures in the travel guides), I would have almost gotten doubts after reading some negative experiences.I cannot judge other people√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ negative the experiences, but I c√ã?¬©n emphasize the fact that we simply have had a fantastic experience and that I, looking back, could have saved myself those doubts by not taking the negative reviews too seriously, or even better, ingoring them at all.We are close to thirty and have already made several beautiful holidays to all kind of destinations, but always with the notion that we were in a another country, with other uses, habits, other people and another culture and that this is the charm of traveling. When you realize that, you can enjoy your holiday very easily with the tropical surroundings and the notion that you are on the other side of the world, where everything goes a little different and a bit more relax....that is holiday!My point is that Punta Cana and the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Hotel, is a fantastic place for a two week stay and to treat yourself on great food, splendid tropical surroundings, nice hotel-chambers next to the palm beach, rest for the rest seeker and recreation for the active holiday seeker, beautiful shows in the evenings (even 1x week a cinema!) and all other things that make your holiday complete and that make you feel like al very lucky person just to be able to be in that place.A big staff that all work for your pleasure and comfort. (and just like in the US and in Holland: if you are kind to people, then they are also kind to you.)A big plus of the Barcelo-hotels is that it is very large resort, with 5 hotels, where you can go wherever you please (eating and drinking in the Palace-hotel is only for Palace-guests). The complex never gets boring by its size and many guests, you can eat in many buffet- and a la carte-restaurants in the several hotels and therefore you imagine yourself frequently in a beach village, instead of in a single hotel.The hotel is mainly visited by people from South-America and that is nice for Europeans like us. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ nice for the tropical atmosphere.Although you are on the East point of the Dominican Republic (there are the tropical white beaches), there are enough excursion possibilities, both on land and on water. (we visited the capital, made a beautiful inland\/city-trip and a snorkeling-trip, including nurse sharks!)I hope that this travel experience helps some people (that still have to pick a hotel), to choose for the Barcelo Bavaro Beach Hotel, because this truly is a fantastic place and definitely worth the money.We hade a great time there!We wish you also a great time in Punta Cana.Roy  IrisHolland, august 2006 ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1750,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1746},{"endOffset":1750,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1746},{"endOffset":2111,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":2104},{"endOffset":2747,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2743},{"endOffset":2866,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":2861}]}
