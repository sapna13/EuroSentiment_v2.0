{"text":"The Good, Bad And Ugly This hotel is very attractive and on a nice wide street. It was doors away from my daughter's apartment where she is living for a semester abroad. The room was very small and our first room was on the street side, even though we had requested a room in the back when we booked. It was extremely noisy as we had to leave the windows open for air, since the air conditioning cannot be turned on until June. The next day we changed rooms because the door lock broke which turned out to be a good thing since we were moved to the back where it was much quieter. The problem here was again having to leave the window open for air which allowed for mosquitoes to invade us. We figured out that if we left the window open a bit and the shutters partically closed it kept the mosquitoes at bay. Luckily the weather was still pretty cool, especially at night. The room was attractively decorated and clean, and the shower had plenty of hot water. The mattress in both rooms we stayed in was horrible - the worst I ever slept on in any hotel ever!!The staff were all very helpful and all spoke very good English. The continental breakfast was also very good and you could purchase eggs and bacon for a reasonable price. The location was good and close enough to everything but yet away from the very crowded streets. I passed by some of the other hotels I considered and the Carolus appeared to be the better choice. The Hotel in general was good for the price and I did enjoy by stay, but they should invest in new mattresses.
