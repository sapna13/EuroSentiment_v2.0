{"text":"Terrific Service!! If, while visiting Paris, you want to make your home base near the Arc de Triomphe and the Avenue des Champs Elysees, then you seriously want to consider staying at the Hotel Royal Magda. This 3 star hotel is well appointed with a small bar, a comfortable breakfast and lobby sitting area, clean standard rooms, affordable suites, and roomy bathrooms having bathtubs with standing showers and heated towel bars. The Hotel Royal Magda√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ location puts you within 3 to 4 blocks of either the Arc de Triomphe or the Avenue des Champs Elysees and within a 4 to 5 block walk to the Air France bus stop for Charles de Gaulle international airport. But what really sets the Hotel Royal Magda Hotel apart from other 3 star hotels that we have stayed in Paris is the service! While most of our dealings were with Yohan, the daytime manager, our interactions with other staff members were also very pleasant. We were in Paris for the marriage of our youngest daughter. Yohan found us a florist for the wedding bouquets (in August many floral shops in Paris are closed for summer holiday), made reservations at a fantastic restaurant close to the hotel for the groom√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ dinner, and arranged transportation for the bridal party and guests from the hotel to the church and the church to the reception. Yohan accomplished all of this extremely efficiently and with good humor. Yohan and the Hotel Royal Magda are both a class act that our family recommends highly! ","annotations":[]}
