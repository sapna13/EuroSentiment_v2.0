{"text":"The only kind thing you can say is that it's clean This was a pretty horrible hotel. We were booked into the Fantasia Lucky Travellers hotels for four days, but they had double booked our room so we were transferred to here for two nights.First they ripped us off - charged us √à√\u2020√ü?00 a night when the advertised rate is √à√\u2020√ü?8. The room was pretty as basic as you can get - two single beds, two bunk beds (in a room for two - it's an odd place). There was an en-suite shower and toilet, but nothing else at all - no chair, no table, no phone, no lamp - nothing. They really are stretching two-star beyond breaking point. The room d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was just nasty - orange walls with a rough texture and incredibly dim light.The room was not touched in any way between day one and day two - no clean towels, no making of beds - the only thing done was to remove one towel to take us back to the one towel that we were given between two people on the day we arrived.The included breakfast was a very minimalist affair - orange juice or water, toast or you can make yourself a toasted sandwich from slices of processed cheese and very cheap ham. If I've made it sound appetising it isn't.The staff were generally acceptable, except for one receptionist who seemed defensive and unconcerned.Finally the walls are paper thin so you can hear everything that every other room does. Basically avoid at all costs.
