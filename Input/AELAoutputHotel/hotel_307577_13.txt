{"text":"Great Hotel Stayed for 2 weeks in a Club Room at the Puri Santrian at the beginning of September and we thought the hotel was lovely. I had read all the previous reviews and to be honest was a little nervous as some really weren't positive. I needn't have worried! The gardens were lovely and the staff were great. Every last one of them from the waiters to the garden staff were friendly and said hello as you strolled through the lovely grounds.Our room was fine, with one of the biggest and comfiest beds we have ever slept in! We thought the little touches like daily bottled water and little pots of fresh flowers in the room were great.We generally sunbathed at the beach and round the main pool as the area around the club room pool was very hot with no breeze (Not a complaint, just an observation!) Contrary to previous comments, we never had a problem getting a sunbed either on the beach or round the main pool.We enjoyed the breakfasts at the hotel and thought the choice was great...previous reviews commented on lack of choice but I personally fail to see what else the hotel could have provided.We got a free jet lag massage and a free meal at Mezzanine (the hotel restaurant by the entrance) and they were both lovely. We also ate regularly at the pool restaurant. It was more expensive than the beach bars but of a much higher quality and the setting was great. We returned to the spa on our last day and had an aromatherapy massage (2 for 1) for about $50. This is obviously more expensive than a massage on the beach but we thought the increased price was well worth it.We did check out the Hyatt along the beach whilst we were there and to be honest the 70s looking concrete building was less than impressive.In conclusion, if we returned to Bali, we would definitely return to the Puri Santrian, in fact I wish I was there now!!!PS For a laugh we tried the Seawalker experience and it was great fun!!!!
