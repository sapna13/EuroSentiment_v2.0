{"text":"Frist time to the Domincian Republic We just returned from the Excellence Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic after a week long stay.The resort property was one of the most beautiful places I have seen. The resort is VERY clean, and the groundskeepers are constantly at work making sure every plant, flower, and tree is just right. A unique touch that this resort has is the wildlife. In the main lobby they have a few turtles in the lake in the main lobby, they have flamingos down near the shops on the resort, a wild turkey and baby roam the resort throughout the day, and 2 talking parrots near the stores, that will great you with an hola. Once you land, it is just about an hour bus ride from the airport to the resort. Once you arrive, you will be greeted with a glass of champagne, and a cold towel to help you relax and refresh after your travels. Rooms: The rooms are very nice and clean. If you get a room on the 3rd floor, you get the added benefit of nice vaulted ceilings which make the room feel massive. We stayed in building 8, and our air conditioning in the room did not really work all that well. We brought it to the attention of the Excellence Club at least 3 times, but nothing was ever resolved which upset me. You room was cleaned every day, and your mini bar was always restocked, and they also provide a turn down service every night.Pools and Beach: The pool is unbelievable. It is just massive and very very clean. There is always something going on at the pool. Water volleyball, Water Polo, just tossing around a football.. you can do as much or as little as you want. The pools has a nice selection of chairs that are in the sun, or chairs that rest on the ledge of the pool with water right below you, or in the shade covered by a leafy umbrella. If you are looking for a nice place in the shade you will unfortunately have to get up early (7:30am) to throw your stuff on to reserve it. That is one of my biggest criticisms of the resort, and some people would reserve seats in the shade, and you would not see them all day until they grabbed their stuff at 5:00pm. The beach is one of the nicest I have ever seen. The beach is not as popular as the pool (further away from the bars), but is a nice place to relax and their always seemed to be a nice constant breeze to cool you off. The water was the perfect temperature, and you could go way out into the water and it would not be above your chest. I highly recommend walking along the beach, but prepare yourself if you walk to left Left (facing the water), you will be pounced upon by vendors that want you to see what they are selling. If that is not your thing, I would walk to the right I only know of 1 vendor to the right. Food: The food was good. My personal favorite restaurant was Spice (Japanese), and the other couple we went with really enjoyed The French Restaurant as well. The service was fantastic at the French restaurant, and the food was very good as well. The Italian restaurant the food was average at best, and the service was very slow. All of the restaurants are not open every night, so you will need to check the schedule you get when the turn down service comes around to see if the restaurant you want to go to is open. Service: For the most part the service was OK, nothing fantastic. I personally felt that almost everyone there was looking for a tip. There were a few people, that were very friendly and social, but over all most of the staff just responded with a forced Excellente or It is our pleasure. I have also been to Sandals where they will not accept tips, and received better service. I took about $100 to tip people with (bartenders, baggage men, servers) and even when we tipped them, I did not feel as though they appreciated it. They just took the money, and wondered off and we did not get any better treatment.Overall, it was a very nice trip. The resort was easily one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen, very clean, and overall it was a very nice trip. I would recommend going to Excellence Punta Cana.
