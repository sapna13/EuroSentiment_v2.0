{"text":"Another Day in Paradise That is what my wife said everyday. Another Day in Paradise.The resort is huge and very well kept. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food was very good at most places including the a la carte restaurants. We ate at the Italian, Mexican and Steak restaurants. The only thing we didn't care for was the ribs at the steak house but everything else was great.The beach was beautiful and well kept. They have great lounge chairs with cushions. There was plenty of palm tree umbrellas to provide shading and also just enough actual palm trees along the beach to do the same.If we had to complain about anything about the resort itself is the lineups to reserve dinner and the fact that there are no Non Smoking sections .... anywhere!We had doubts at first because our travel agent called us seven days before our departure to inform us that alcohol was no longer all inclusive in the disco and the casino. The tour operator, Nolitours, just informed them of the change and the only thing Nolitours was prepared to do was offer a full refund on the trip. This was very little to console us as it was now impossible to get a vacation for five people in such a short time frame. To say the least we were not impressed with the tour operator. I voiced my displeasure to the travel agency and also directly to Nolitours via their website before leaving for vacation. We have been back a day now from the trip and have yet to get a reponse from them. ","annotations":[]}
