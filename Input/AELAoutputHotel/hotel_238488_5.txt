{"text":"family run hotel near the main train station I stayed in the hotel for 2 nights. This is the only 1 star hotel i stayed in through out my 2 weeks in italy (which i stayed in 3 stars hotel). I did not notice that it is a one star hotel when i made the booking. At first i was scared when i was climbing up the stairs to this hotel (hotel on 3rd floor) and did not know what to expect. As I arrived I found out the hotel was run by a family. The host was nice and accomodating and made me feel like staying at a home! I know nothing about how stars were given to italian hotels- but I am satisfied with the facilities the hotel offers. My room has a private bathroom- the bath room was clean and seems to be recently renovated, the shower was nice, there was a hair-dryer and towels were provided. There was no shampoo\/shower gel etc. The beds were big and comfortable and there was an extra pillow and blanket. The room was quiet, clean and spacious. the cupboards can be locked. Breakfast was not included in my booking so I had breakfast in nearby cafes.This hotel is very close to the train station if you know the right way, and the duomo is within a walking distance of 10-15 minutes.The hotel also has a collection of travel guide books about florence and italy which i found useful.I am satisfied with the price of the hotel (compared to other hotels in florence) and I would recommend this hotel for those who are travelling to florence!
