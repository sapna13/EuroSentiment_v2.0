{"text":"Relaxing stay Arrived late on our first day and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly welcome from reception. Even though we arrived just after the wine and cheese had finished, we were offered a plate of cheese and wine in our room. The library on second floor was another haven, somewhere pleasant to hang out. Good selection of books around the hotel, tea, coffee, pastries and biscuits available 24\/7. The location of the hotel made it convenient to drop in during the day in between various activities and have a short break and quick snack. Saved a fortune not frequenting Starbucks. Breakfast is described as continental which it is, bagels, Danish pastries, yoghurt, cereal, fruit salad, fruit, hot and cold beverages. Went at different times during stay and didn't have a problem with food availability as it was regularly refreshed. A knock on the kitchen door would get something that had just run out replenished. If you are expecting an American style breakfast and\/or table service then plan to eat elsewhere. Stayed in two rooms types one the Petite Queen and the other the Deluxe Queen. Yes the rooms are small, but for short stay perfectly acceptable,clean and well laid out. I found the beds to be comfortable. If there are two of you and you like hanging your things up then the Petite Queen is not for you, as it only has a single closet. The Deluxe Queen has adequate closet space, on par with most hotels I've stayed in. The bathrooms have all that you need and the amenities provided are a nice touch. There is some noise from outside, but this is New York and I didn't find it intrusive. The heating was effective and relatively quiet. If you are used to radiator style heating systems you may be bothered by the noise of fan based heating system. There was a DVD player in the room and free DVD library, as we managed to pick a week when there were no movies out that we wanted to see, it was nice to catch up on some that we hadn't seen. Two computers with free internet and print facilities on the 2nd floor was also very handy.If you are arriving from JFK then the direct bus to Grand Central station one way $15 return $27 is worth considering as its only a 5 minute walk from the hotel to the stop. Much cheaper than the super shuttle and a bus every 20 mins or so.To summarise, I had a really good time, would stay again if I'm in New York.
