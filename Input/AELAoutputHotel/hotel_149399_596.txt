{"text":"Really Dissapointed I stayed in the Melia Caribe Tropica with my family for a ten day vacation and was thoroughly disappointed with the service we received. Although the resort was really nice and we were impressed with the complementary train service that was provided in the heat, we were faced with a number of different problems. Firstly, we found that the staff at the hotel could not speak in English, although we tried our level best to speak to them in Spanish there was a definite communication problem; we also found them to be laid back and unwilling to help. Secondly, the housekeeping service was very poor. We were not provided with clean towels when requested, our rooms were not cleaned properly and we would find large cockroaches wandering around. We also had problems with the restaurant reservations, in order to secure reservations we had to wake up as early as 6am and sometime when we arrived at the restaurants we would be told that the reservations could not be found. Additionally, the food was very salty, being vegetarians we were also limited with our food choices and there was also only a limited choice of wines and beer. I found that the bar staff would serve alcoholic drinks to anyone regardless of their age without checking for Identification.The vacation was supposed to be a treat for my family and I before my daughters left for college, we booked via Orbitz and were expecting a good time in a four star hotel, but unfortunately we came back very disappointed.
