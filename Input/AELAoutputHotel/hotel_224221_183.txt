{"text":"A Grand New Experience We have been in NYC many, many times in previous years. Had never even heard of the Library Hotel. What a shame! It was great. The rooms were small, it certainly was not the Four Seasons, but the people were kind, helpful and despite some problems with the facility, they worked diligently to solve all our problems and compensate us for our inconvenience. These things happen when you are on a vacation sometimes and viewing them as an adventure to share with your friends and family upon your return and not a ruination of a trip is all in the attitude of both yourself and the hotel staff. The rooftop bar was a gift that allows you to stand and admire the greatest city in the world while sharing a romantic cocktail. Bryant Park is a hop, skip and a jump (sorry for the cliche) and if you hit it right, you can see evening films in the outdoors.The rooms, as mentioned were small, but we've stayed at the Columbus and we know what small is -- these were gigantic in comparison. They had roses, a bottle of champagne and chocolates in our room (by mistake, I'm sure), but when pressed to make sure there hadn't been a mistake, they assured us, it was no mistake and told us to keep them (I think it was a mistake, but they certainly held to their position on that one). You have to try this hotel at least once. You'll love it for sure. Just relax and enjoy.
