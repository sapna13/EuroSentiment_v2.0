{"text":"Great location, clean and good breakfast but noisy and crowded The hotel has a great location (2 blocks from the main shopping street and a few blocks from the central Plaza Catalunya) and a pleasant, elegant check-in area. The room was fairly small but clean and there was a minibar. Breakfast was a buffet (included in our price but generally was 15 euros, I think), with a good selection of breads, meats, cheeses, even some sausages. The staff at the check-in desk was helpful, too.A big PROBLEM, however, was the noise. Nothing is carpeted. We did request a room facing the depressing elevator-shaft-looking inner courtyard, which decreased the noise a bit. However, we could hear every single noise made outside in the corridor and even in the other rooms. It was very difficult to sleep and we were woken up by the maid dragging appliances across the corridor from room to room. Couldn't wait to get out of there for that very reason - after all, if you can't sleep, what's the point of everything else being good? Breakfast staff were loudly banging pots and pans during breakfast, completely ignoring you until you dared pour your own coffee. Then they'd scowl and insist that they do it. That was unpleasant. I tried to toast some bread, which burned because the toaster hadn't been cleaned for ages. A member of the staff rushed over, took away my bread and disappeared without a word. THAT was strange...Overall, I wouldn't recommend the hotel because of the noise but if you've got earplugs, by all means, go there.
