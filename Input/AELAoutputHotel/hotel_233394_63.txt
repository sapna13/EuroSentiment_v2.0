{"text":"Absolutely the highlight of our summer vacation!! We were fortunate to stay at this property both prior to and after a summer 2007 7-day cruise, and even now, several months later, our entire family counts our stay with Matteo and his staff as a highlight of our entire vacation. It is a small 9-room hotel located directly on the Grand Canal just a few meters from the Rialto Bridge. Although it was still in the process of renovation at the time of our stay (Matteo had just taken over the property a few months earlier...) we loved it. Getting around Venice is incredibly easy from this location.Our stay included not only a junior suite (directly on the Grand Canal), but also a triple room, as we were traveling with 3 adult children. The hotel easily accommodated us, and similar to the experience of many other writers on this forum, Matteo personally greeted us by name upon our arrival by private water taxi at the hotel's dock. He and his staff made numerous valuable dining, touring and shopping reccomendations during our stay. We were treated like favorite family members the entire time. Even when one of our children was taken ill, Matteo graciously moved him to a quiet third room. Perhaps my favorite memory was the look of total awe of each of my family members as they first entered the junior suite. We could easily have passed a glass of wine to a passing gondoleer; the room was that perfect!Ahhh, the wonderful terrace and those famous omelets need no further accolades! .Thanks, Matteo! We hope to see you soon. ","annotations":[]}
