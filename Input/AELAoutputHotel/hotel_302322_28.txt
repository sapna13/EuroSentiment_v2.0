{"text":"Great hotel but weird staff Overall this hotel was great but we had some strange moments. I had splurged for the harbor view so when we arrived we got a room assigned to the 9th floor. I asked if we could be moved to a higher floor and the front desk had a weird reaction, almost like How dare you ask. Could be my imagination of course. My husband thought it was because we look quite young. So the concierge took us up to our room and when we walked in, it jus stank of smoke. We of course requested a non-smoking room and the room smelled like it was being used for that purpose solely. We didn't overreact just calmly said that there is not way we can stay here, and the concierge I think was embarrassed. He called down to the front desk and they immediately upgraded us to a club floor. A questions begs itself - why didn't they just upgrade us right away when I asked and instead tried to shove us in a smoking room? Weird. From there on things improved. The club floor must have had amenities but noone told us about them so we didn't use them. The buffet lunch was out of this world. Best ever. But the service was questionable. We kept asking the server to bring more coffee and he just seemed like it was a chore for him. Like he was surprised we wanted so much coffee. I don't see where he got the idea that he is supposed to judge how much coffee we drink.The room was nice and the view was quite nice but not as spectacular because it was blocked a bit by the hotel's left wing. We saw the harbour full view but not the cool skyscrapers. The last day there was a typhoon and we all got stuck at the hotel. It was surprisingly fun. We went for a harbor promenade during the eye of the storm passing over Hong Kong and it was super. Also the hotel is located three minute walk from the ferry that goes to Central station on Hong Kong island - very convenient. Our last night we went to the hotel's grill restaurant and had kobe beef. That was particularly outstanding. On top of a very nice meal, the restaurant gave us each a second glass of wine on the house. Overall great hotel and we would stay there again, I just don't really understand some of the staff attitude. Seems they were happier catering to an older crowd.
