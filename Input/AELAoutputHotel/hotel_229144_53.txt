{"text":"Very Happy at the Jan Luyken We stayed here 5 nights, in room # 510, and were very comfortable, indeed. The feature I noticed first was the gorgeous tile panels just inside the front door. Further in, we could see the bar\/cafe with a beautiful white fireplace, that looked very tempting. Each day, new flowers graced the bar, lobby and sitting room, too.We had a bit of a problem checking in because we missed our first night due to a missed connection in Chicago. However, the lovely young lady at the front desk (who took over from her colleague) told us that the reason our reservation wasn't showing, was because we had already been checked in, so that no one could have our room. Needless to say, I was much relieved. The elevator to the 5th floor was wide and roomy ( This is almost a novelty for European hotel elevators.!) I was a bit disappointed with the area off of which the rooms were placed, as it looked a bit institutional. Inside our room, however, I was very pleased. We had a very large bathroom, with huge black marble counter. All was spotless. The shower was great, and I enjoyed the hand held shower. Good toiletries were also supplied and replenished each day.One reason I did not give the hotel a 5 star rating was because there wasn't much room to put our clothes, etc. I had to move the extra blanket and pillow from the few shelves provided. However, the pillow and soft ,comfortable blanket were much appreciated.The room was set up for a business traveler, and even included a stapler and paper tray, which I converted to my own use for storage other than paper. The other reason I didn't give the hotel a 5 was because of the low lighting in the room, which made it difficult to read.The linens and towels were lovely, and the twin beds comfortable. The best feature of the room, for me, was the window with a view over the rooftops of Amsterdam, including a great view of the Rijksmuseum to the left. There was also a minibar in the room, which had enough space in it for the milk, etc. I bought at the local grocery store. A word of warning is that the bottles of water placed on the desk are not free. I did not see anything warning of the 5 Euro charge per bottle. However, I may have been negligent, as I am programmed to think that only items in or on top of the minibar cost money, and that water placed in other locations are free. To their credit, the front desk only charged me for 1 bottle rather than 2, when I explained that I was unaware of the charge.I also liked the electric kettle, and jar of tea, coffee, creamer and sugar. We were supplied with 2 glass mugs and teaspoons, so tea making was easy. Throughout our stay, I only heard the sound of the next door room opening twice. That's it. No noise from the other rooms. We were subjected to the sounds of revelers on the streets, which appeared very quiet during the day, but that only happened on Sunday and Monday night. For those bringing cars, it should be noted that parking in this area is quite expensive. I overheard the front desk clerk telling other guests that it costs over 3 Euros per hour to park on the street. The hotel will sell a voucher for parking, but it costs about 30 Euros per day. Parking on Sunday is free, however. We took the Connexxion Bus from the airport, which worked very well for us.The location of the hotel was brilliant. The main entrance to the Rijksmuseum was about 2 blocks away. A shopping street, which I likened to Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, is one street over. It made for great window shopping. One of the best Italian delicatessans I've ever been to-Pasta di Mamma- is on that street (who's name presently escapes me) The deli has wonderful sandwiches, which are priced just about 4.5 Euros, and can be eaten on the premises or taken away. They also have gorgeous salads, pastas, meats, etc. It was an easy walk into central Amsterdam. If you keep walking straight after crossing the street and canal in front of the Rijksmuseum, you come to a wonderful street full of lovely antiques dealers. The Vondelpark was about 7 minutes away. The residential area near the hotel and Vondelpark is very beautiful, and reminded me of buildings in London's Knightsbridge.I would definitely stay here again, as the room, location, hotel facilities and staff were great.
