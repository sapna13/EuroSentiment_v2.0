{"text":"Amazing hotel, very luxurious We decided to splurge for our first three nights in Hong Kong, so we stayed at The Peninsula. While it was a bit pricey, it was well worth it.We especially recommend the limousine pick up from the airport. They actually meet you at the gate, and take you on a motorized cart through what would normally be about a 20 minute walk - and then they pick up your bags from baggage claim while you're waiting in the passport control line! It was the most hassle free airport arrival we've experienced.The rooms are beautiful and well equipped. You can even control the opening and closing of your curtains from the control panel next to the bed. A nice sized flat screen TV rotates for visibility from the bed, the couch, or the desk.The hotel is quite the tourist attraction, with high tea being served in the lobby. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are dress codes if you want to dine in the restaurant. Basically, just don't wear flip flops or sport sandals. No big deal.We didn't get a chance to enjoy the pool area, but stopped up to take a look at it on our last day. It has beautiful views of the city, and looked like a really nice place to relax.The concierge was very helpful in directions for the city, and for sending our passports off to obtain visas for mainland China for the next part of our trip. All staff members spoke excellent English.As we've experienced in other Asian hotels, the hospitality was super. We highly recommend The Peninsula, if you're willing to disregard the price tag.
