{"text":"Great Stay in Dallas I stayed at this property for 13 nights on a business trip. Upon arrival, I was greeted by LaShawn at the front desk. She was extremely helpful and knowledgeable of the property and the surrounding area. During my stay, she would always go out of her way to find out how I was doing and even remembered my name throughout the stay.I was in an oversized room which overlooked the Market Center. The room was clean, bathroom was adequate, and there was a desk with complementary internet connection. (There is also a small business center next to the lobby) There was always plenty of room to move around even when I had everything spread out.There is a pool and spa towards the rear of the property. It was never very crowded. The hotel supplied beach towels.This property also had a restaurant on the main floor off of the lobby in the large atrium. The food was good and reasonably priced, but the service at night was very slow. It seems that they were always short handed during the evening dinner hours and could not handle the restaurant being only 1\/2 full. I had the buffet breakfast in the morning which included omelets and never experienced a problem with the service.Finally this hotel also had a free shuttle service within a 5 mile radius and to Dallas Love Field. I used the service a number of occasions and the drivers were always very courteous and willing to accommodate.All in all, this is a very nice property. I would stay here next time I was in the Dallas area, but would probably skip dinner at the hotel.
