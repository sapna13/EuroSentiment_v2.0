{"text":"Pleasent Stay Positives:The rooms are very large and clean. They come with kitchenettes which include a stove, microwave and a fridge. In the fridge there are complimentary juices, package fruits and bread for breakfast. There are also forks, spoons, plates, frying pans and a water steamer for tea. The view is very nice. The bathroom is also clean and comes with all the proper things. You are also alloted a parking space if you have a car (I do not recommend driving in Sydney). The beds are very comfortable. The hotel is very homey. It is a comfortable place to stay in. The desk clerks do not really bother you but say hello and smile when you walk in. Also included is a flat screen T.V.. There are a lot of channels, but what I liked the most is the Box Office channel that offered new movies that are on DVD for free. I was sick for a day and a half during this trip, so the movies really made me feel at home. The hotel is very centrally located to the subway (on same block or across the street) that connects you to all the main attractions. On the same block there is also a a bus stop that connects you with all the main buses that can take you all over the city. There is a also a Seven-Eleven store two doors towards Liverpool street where you can buy inexpensive dinners (noodles, beef pies) and bus\/subway tickets (I suggest buying the Red Ticket, you can use this ticket for a week on all the subways and buses that are in the Sydney Area but won't work on the Ferries). It is also two blocks from the Monorail, two blocks from the Spanish Corrider, a block from China Town and across from Hyde Park. Also included is air condition.Negatives:The hotel is on a major street (Elizabeth Street) which can get quite noisy during the day. If you close your door to the balcony, your room becomes very quiet. The hotel offers Internet Via Ethernet wire (no wireless) for 22 Aus dollars a day. I bought it for two days because I was sick but around the corner on Liverpool Street there is a internet shop that offers internet for 1 hour for 3 Aus. Dollars. Other then that, I had a great stay. Very Central Location. Very comfortable and Homey. Sidney is a very Metro City and quite busy. I suggest heading North for day trips to Manly or going taking bus rides and getting lost in the outer Sydney. I hope you have a great time!Oh, if you are heading to this hotel from the Airport, just take the green line towards the city and get off on Museum Station and your at the hotel.
