{"text":"Excellent 1 night stayover I was at the end of my 2.5 week trip through Asia, during which I had gone to Singapore to meet with my vendor, gone to Guangzhou to meet with my client, back to Singapore to get engaged (yes you read that correctly), and then to Hong Kong to meet with client. Needless to say, I was incredibly tired and just wanted a nice place to stay that was convenient.Langham Place hotel turned out to be the exact remedy I needed. For one the location in Mongkok is central, it's connected to a mall and the busy shopping area (including the infamous Ladies Night Market where it's like Thailand's Chattuchuk market but in Cantonese). The hotel was well-appointed, the bed comfortable, bathroom clean, and even though I didn't have much a view I didn't really care. It was just nice to stay in a nice place that was reasonable from a price perspective.The only regret that I had was that I couldn't use the much-talked about spa as they were fully booked. I did manage to go see the rooftop pool that's a part of the spa, and it was very impressive.Next time I'm in Hong Kong I think I might stay here as opposed to Hong Kong Island as the transportation is incredibly convenient, it's closer to the airport, and there is obviosuly a lot to do in Kowloon. However most of all, I really liked this hotel a lot and wouldn't mind coming back for a longer stay, including a few hours in the spa.
