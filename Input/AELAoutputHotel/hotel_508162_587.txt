{"text":"Beautiful Weather, Average Resort We just returned from out honeymoon at Dreams in Punta Cana. First, I should say I am not a seasoned traveler so I don't have a lot to compare the resort to. The resort is going under a facelift as sidewalks, paths and other things are being upgraded since Dreams purchased the resort. The weather was great and the beach was wonderful. Other reviews said it was rocky but I did not see this problem. Plenty of chairs and people coming to ask you for drinks while you stayed on the beach. A few topless females but not many.It blew pretty hard while we were there so we didn't spend more than 3 days on the beach out of our six. The other time was spend poolside, when it wasn't raining, which it did everyday at least a little. Lots of chairs, cushions should be replaced, but not enough floats in the pool area. Although the pool was great and was one of the highlights. The room was nice and I would say to get one that faces the pool area so you know what's going on. Always had hot water and clean towels. The maid service and room service were fine. But expect to wait at least 40 minutes on room service if you order food. All the reviews said the food was average and I couldn't agree more. The buffet was okay with the breakfast being the best meal. I thought the rolls and bread were outstanding. Get the made-to-order omlet's. We ate at the Mexican one night and it was decent. The seafood grill was poor with the fish being cold and nothing special. Although the view and atmosphere was great. We ate at the Seaside grill the last night and had a well cooked steak, grisley from being grass fed beef, but good taste and the salad bar was very good. This was by far the best food we had on the stay. But overall don't expect anything great and they have a long way to go to upgrade. Service was outstanding and everybody I met and dealt with were very friendly and worked very hard for any tips I left. I was shocked at the amount of young children and infants at the resort. This is definately a FAMILY atmosphere resort. Lots of strollers and children running around. The grounds are being upgraded and the resort has a look of being out of date and in need of a major sprucing up. Several people stated that the Iburostar is the place to stay. We had a wonderful time resting and relaxing. It is a 45 minute drive from the airport and you are kinda in the middle of nowhere so have a plan of what you want to do. Not like you just run into town and shop.  After being there I'd say we won't go back to this resort, but we will go back to Punta Cana.
