{"text":"don't pay more than $100\/night for this hotel...not a 3 star at all nice hotel in its day, but badly needs to be updated. I got scared before leaving for Miami, looking at the reviews of this hotel, but glad I did as it prepared us for what to expect. I called the hotel directly the day before we arrived, to make sure they had us in their system, and sure enough, we were there, and our check in was smooth with no disappointments. Our room was on the 17th floor, and the elevators weren't as bad as some people say. Sometimes there was a bit of a wait, but not very often, and we stayed there for a week, so that many times up and down, we would know. The front desk staff was very courteous, and during our week stay, we had two different ladies from housekeeping doing our room. We tipped each day, 4 or 5 $, and one lady was very nice and filled our ice bucket, but didn't change the sheets, or clean the mirrors, and the other lady was very rude, in fact I had to let the concierge know, but at least she changed the sheets. We had to leave a note asking the hskpg staff to clean our window!! The inside of it was smeared with grease from countless heads pressing up against it...yuck! It was like that for a couple days, stupid me, I should have let them know earlier, but part of me was curious how long it would remain that way. Apparently indefinitely, had I not specifically asked. I didn't notice film in the pool water or whatever some people are saying, to me it looked very clean every day we were there. I did miss the part, though, about free fruit or whatever. I didn't encounter that one single day we were there. Beach access is close and nice and clean. Giant dead cockroach on the lower level floor inside the hotel leading out to the pool\/beach area...gross. Plumbing in the room...what can I say except bring flip flops to wear on your feet when you shower. It didn't look very clean, and the drain didn't work very well. The water started backing up into the tub within 10 seconds of the water running. It must be beach sand or something, because it was like that every time. We didn't pay a lot for our trip, and we read reviews before going, so we knew kind of what to expect. There was a wedding reception in the front ball room, and we didn't experience any irritation or undue noise because of it. The valet service is pretty good, not to long a wait, and we didn't mind tipping because the guys really hustle; they turn up the a\/c, unlock all the doors, help you in, etc. One thing I will say that I was really impressed with, was the way the hotel dealt with Tropical Storm Fay. Monday and Tuesday, you couldn't go in the water at the beach because it was closed, and beach patrol was going up and down making sure people stayed out of the water. Where the hotel went above and beyond, is that they used the third floor conference room as a movie theatre, having movies running back to back all through the day, complete with free pop and popcorn and tortilla chips. They put up notices all through the hotel Sunday night, to say that they would be showing movies, and had a game room also set up on another floor, to provide guests with things to do because of the weather. They printed out a list of movies and the times they would be playing. I thought that was really good service that they really wasn't required, and my family appreciated it. With a 13 and 14 year old kids, it was very handy. I highly recommend renting a car if you're staying more than one or two nights; there's nothing in walking distance, and if you can afford the restaurant food at the hotel, or continual taxi trips, then why would you stay here? If you have money like that, stay someplace nicer in a better location. Why the resort fee? An extra money grab if you ask me. I don't know what in the world it's for.
