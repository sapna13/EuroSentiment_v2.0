{"text":"good overall, but some not so good points We stayed from 26th Sep to 10th October.Flew from Manchester with First Choice, arrived late, but the reception was quick and easy with no language barriers.We were allocated a room in block 7 a short walk from reception, but on arrival we found that it smelt badly of damp, so we returned to reception and requested a change, which was done with no real trouble. The new room was ok, again it smelt a bit musty but we soon got used to it. The fixtures and fittings in the bathroom were a bit tired, and there were things hanging off the wall, but it is possible to ignore these things and just get on with the holiday.The room was cleaned every day, although sometimes not till late, so if you needed to get out of the afternoon heat you had to find somewhere else to go. That said the rooms were cleaned to a very good standard, and the hotel itself was kept very clean and tidy, with constant maintenance visible everywhere. The yellow pool was drained when we arrived, with staff replacing tiles, so there was only 1 available, however as the hotel was no-where near full there was little inconvinience, they re-filled it on 2nd of Oct, so the blue pool went back to being quiet during the week. At the weekends quite a few locals come to the hotel, they can be quite loud so be prepared.The food in the buffet was of a very good standard, well prepared and presented with lots of variety. We were dissapointed with the themed resteraunts, as the quality of the food was not very good, with a common theme being everything served with smash  carrots, be it the american, the italian or the dominican.....it seems that they all use the same kitchens. We opted to use the buffet every night. Breakfast and lunch both very good as well.Beach nice, well maintained, the sea was quite choppy, with a net a few yards out to stop swimmers getting in the way of the various speed boats etc. This does restrict swimmers  snorkling though, so we spent most of our time round the pool. There are dogs on the beach, however they are very friendly and when given food are very gentle and are very skinny so we gave food and water to them when ever we could.The staff were very pleasant, we found no language problems at all, although they never appeared to be in a rush to do anything...The only thing that really spoilt the stay were some of the fellow tourists, so this has no bearing on the quality of the hotel at all. There were several groups of loud people (of many nationalities) that seemed to want to take over their own spot and compete in volume, be it by the pool or the bar, or at 2 in the morning outside the rooms. But this will happen where ever you go, so therefore does not affect the rating of the place.This resort is very family based, if you are looking for a quiet couples get away, perhaps look elsewhere.
