{"text":"Wonderful beach paradise Our family , 2 adults  2 teenagers returned last week from Sienis Cocotal Beach Resort. We had a great time.Beach-great beach, good for swimming. Some rocking areas in deeper parts of the water. Could walk for miles along beach, up from beaches mostly coconut groves. Resort had kayaks-lot of fun in the waves, couple of catamarans. The water was too rough for snorkelling but could book snorkelling or diving tours. Along the beach were a lot of chairs but resort did not have enough shade structures.Room-was average size, clean and decent. With bar fridge stocked with pop  water daily ,safe and TV. Facilities-were gorgeous. Beautiful gardens, fountains and stuctures. Everything clean and well take care off. Pools were great with 2 swim up bars. Some shallow pools for very young children.Food-Main restaurants for breakfast  dinner were great. Each night a small part of the restaurant had different theme. Nights we were there there was Dominician evening, Sushi  seafood  Italian. Had a section of vegetarian food  children menu each evening. All the foods did have a Domincian feel. If your looking for stictly American food there is some but you would be missing out on the the many different types of entrees. Breakfast were great. Lunch was in 2 different restaurants  beach barbeque hut(excellent burgers\/hotdogs  chicken. All very good. They also had 4 or 5 theme restaurants, we went to the Italian  Steakhouse. Both were pretty good, not excellent but they do try.Drinks-were good. Did have a mix for pina coladas that was okay. Had a menu of their specialty drinks, most you could get non-achocolic as well. I tried most and like the best Banana Mama, Tropical Breeze and Chocolate Monkey.Entertainment-Shows were excellent. Very good quality. Beach night was not worth it-audience doing stupid things. They had a coupled of these types of nights and we skipped them.Need to improve-More shade structures. All good chairs by pool or beach are reserved by 7 am. This should not be allowed. Many saved seats and then don't come to use them untill after lunch. Animation staff music was annoying. Could hear their music blasting all the time during the day with dance lessons, excercising. They should tone down the music so only the participants could hear. Would be nice if they had a teenager hangout. Teens are shy about mixing with each other would have been good to have some hangout close to beach or pool. What was great-Mostly everything. Staff-all very attentive. Bars and inside patios were great for before and after dinner drinks. Beach, food.Highly recommend!
