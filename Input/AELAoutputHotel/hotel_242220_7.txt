{"text":"Save half your money, ignore a little mold! I went to Puerto Rico to help my son find an apartment for himself and his bride-to-be. This hotel fell into our price range a LOT better than the nearly next door Marriott Hotel did, and the location was great. I chose to ignore the reviews. I hope you will read mine, as Diamond Palace deserves a chance.When you walk in the front door, it is almost like stepping into a movie set of the era of the Rat Pack. I expected Dean Martin to come swaggering over from the lounge at any moment. The lobby is clean, and the Casino, while small, was usually busy and always protected by at least one extra from the set of The Sopranos. To the left of the lobby was the Lounge, with an appropriately dark and swanky bar, where Bingo was often in action. In the evening there was often live music, or karaoke. A walk out the door at the end of the lounge area brought us right out on the main street, and a right hand turn brought us to a Haagen-Daas AND a Starbucks, both with a high-speed internet access. So it was easy to get online.As far as the rooms go, the beds were a little hard for my liking, and the pillows were not great. But the sheets were clean. The rooms were in bad shape. There was bubbling of the ceiling both over the bed, and a lot of it over the shower--both were moldy. It is always humid in Puerto Rico, and I suspect when there is no one in a room, the air conditioning is off, thus the mold. But the countertop in the small bathroom was clean. We just stopped looking up. There was a free refrigerator in the closet in the room, and with a 24 hour Walgreen's directly across the street, we saved a ton by keeping drinks and some food in there. There was also a free safe in there, though we had no valuables. It was only ONE BLOCK to the beach!!When we had trouble with our air conditioning, they responded immediately. I mean NOW. Everyone was friendly and helpful. If we asked, they responded. We did not eat in the restaurant, but it seemed like lots of people came to the hotel just to eat there. We also did not swim in the hotel, though many families were and they were all smiles. I asked for extra towels in the room on the first day and Housekeeping remembered every day after that.So fear not the Diamond Palace. I enjoyed my 8 days there and would stay there again. And I am usually a 5 star only gal.
