{"text":"Charming Boutique Hotel in Great Location My wife and I traveled to Italy and a stop over in Paris for 3 days with our 20 month old daughter. We were willing to pay a little extra to make sure we did Paris right, as the hotel can make or break your trip when you are traveling with a little one. We looked at about 100 hotels and narrowed the search to a couple and finally decided on this for a bunch of reasons - room size appeared good (compared to most European hotels), great location - easy to walk to sights\/Tuileries Garden, seemed fairly updated and clean, good bar (although only open until 10pm) and outside sitting areas that we could go to while our daughter napped during the day or slept at night (with our monitor of course). It totally exceeded our expectations in all these areas. We had room for our pack and play for our daughter and all our bags (although we had to move some chairs out of the way) and the walls were thick - we couldn't hear anyone around on our floor and the hotel was booked solid. The bathroom was beautifully updated and had a tub\/shower. Everyone was extremely polite and helpful...especially the concierge\/bellman\/bartender - Allen - who spoke perfect english and very friendly! The breakfast was not included in our room rate and we didn't take part - it looked very good, but 15 Euro a person for breakfast is not how we wanted to spend our money (Starbuck's right around the corner). Whether travelling with a baby or not, this is a great place. ","annotations":[]}
