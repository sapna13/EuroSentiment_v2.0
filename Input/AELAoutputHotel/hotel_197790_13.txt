{"text":"A Wonderful Place To Stay! During a 10 day stay in Amsterdam, I had the pleasure of staying at the Amistad Hotel on Kerkstraat. I have to say that they scored 100% on the 3 Cs: Clean, Comfortable and Convenient. After getting to know the city a little, I came to realize that the Amistad was truly in the middle of everything a visitor would want. Walking distance to EVERTYING. The building, a beautifully restored Canal Style house adds a cozy element not found in major hotel chains, and really adds to the whole Amsterdam Experience. The included breakfast service was fantastic and it stayed open until 1pm for the days I felt like sleeping in. Additionally, the high-speed internet (available privately in your room or in the internet lounge) was an impressive amenity also included in the price of the room. The team the runs the Amistad is extremely friendly, welcoming, and knowledgeable about where to go, when to go and how to get there. As well as being in the historic center of town, the Amistad is also in the middle of Gay nightlife. I would definitely stay there again and recommend the Amistad highly to anyone considering a trip to Amsterdam. (Important lesson learned: Most if not all of the hotels I researched online SAY that they are in the City Center of Amsterdam, but that is definitely not true. The Amistad is in the center of the old part of the city, which is exactly where a traveler would want to stay). ","annotations":[]}
