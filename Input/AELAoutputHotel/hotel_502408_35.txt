{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic - That sums it up ! I always rely on reviews on Tripadvisor, so it is only fitting really that I leave one for others. Just got back from New York, and Affinia 50, and could not wait to tell everybody how wonderful this hotel is. I cannot fit into words how great this hotel and location is, what I have written only scratches the surface !This is my 4th time to NYC and this is by far the best hotel, and location\/area I have stayed in. The hotel is located right on the corner of 50th Street \/ 3rd Avenue.Room: Stayed in a standard room with queen bed, booked thro expedia at a deal of stay 3 nights get 4th free. The check in staff were polite, concierge\/bell boys were helpful. Hotel room by NYC standards was a wonderful size, bathroom was a little small, but hey it's just a bathroom. Room had a queen bed, TV, desk, arm chair, mini bar, air con, safe, hair dryer, iron  board, pillow menu, tea  coffee making, free toiletries, plenty of storage. The bed was VERY comfy. Hotel: There is no bar in this hotel, but it is such a fantastic location - you don't need one. The free cheese and wine evenings are a great idea too, make sure you go to them. There is a gym (didn't use), and a business room where you can get internet access with printing facilities.Location: Just fab. There are two metros close by - one at the end of the street, and another one street up (giving 2 different lines for easy access around Manhattan). Because you are a couple of Avenues away from busy 5th Avenue, walking around the streets \/ Avenues is easy, and a lot lot quieter. We were at the back of the hotel and could not hear a thing.There are some lovely bars and restaurants nearby - I recommend The Emery Bar (part of Benjamin hotel) for a nice drink and people watching. Restaurants: Plenty within a street or two. Out of the Hotel, turn left, cross 3rd Ave and walk down to 2nd Ave, there are lots of nice little places to eat here away from the mad hussle  bussle. Recommend Lasagna Restaurant. I also recommend going to Luncheonette Cafe, which is about four doors away, for a hearty breakfast. Usual fry up stuff, or bagels, fruit etc etc. Good prices too.I will most certain return to this hotel and area without a doubt, it is just the best. It is quite an affluent businessy area of NYC, so is very safe on an evening too, not at all seedy.Please stay here, and enjoy !!
