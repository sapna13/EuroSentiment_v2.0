{"text":"Great Honeymoon resort......but This was our first time to the Excellence. Great Honeymoon destination, landscaping on the resort was breathtaking. Overall the grounds including the pools were very well maintained. Great restaurants! Our favorites were Agave  Spice for dinner and we thoroughly enjoyed the daily breakfast buffet at Tuscana. The service at the resort bars and restaurants was great as well. There was even a daily beach BBQ which we really enjoyed! They cooked something different for lunch each day right on the beach. Pizzas were also handed out on the beach and at the pools during certain times of the day. One day they even brought out fruit kabobs while we were laying on the beach. The shows were also good. We did not think we'd be into going to the shows, but the few we went to were great. They bring you a schedule of the shows and activities to your room each day so you can decide ahead of time if there is a show you would be interested in seeing. Plan ahead though because if you get there too late the seating is all taken. The included horseback riding was really nice although we do not recommend the ATV tour the resort offers for $80. Basically they take you to the outskirts of Punta Cana, which is very underdeveloped and the dirt roads are extremely bumpy! There is no reason to leave the resort on your own. From what we could tell, there is not much outside the resort and if you don't know your way around it has the potential to be shady. We also must say that the rooms need attention. At least ours did. Upon entering we were greeted with a very musty smell and many of the room amenities needed updating. The jacuzzi tub took 45 minutes to fill up and the refrigerator kept things cool at best. The service to the room could have been improved on as well. Our door would not lock at one point and they left us waiting an hour before someone came to fix it. Also, one night we had ants and it took an hour for someone to bring us bug spray. The room service takes at least an hour each time you order and you get the feeling you are bothering them when you do place an order. Our mini bar was filled once in the week we were there, and should have been filled daily. Luckily, you don't spend much time at all in your room, and once you leave your room you are welcomed by paradise so it doesn't matter as much. Overall, great experience. We would consider staying at an Excellence resort again.
