{"text":"Different, friendly, but bring your climbing boots! A lot of what I'll say has probably been said, but perhaps there's no harm in an update. The most recent trip was my second time at the Nadia, and I enjoyed it as much as the first time!A few observations, plusses and minusesIt's about 10 mins walk from the Dam and all the sights and sounds around there. It's less than 10 minutes to the Anne Frank House and other sights in that area.It's on the tram route for the Rembrantplein and the Zoo.The staff couldn't be friendlier and more helpful - from carrying bags upstairs, offering (non-alcoholic) drinks on arrival, providing maps  event guides, and making reservations for the hotel\/airport shuttle, they couldn't do enough.The rooms are small, but comfortable and had all amenities - I was in a single room on the top (4th ) floor, and had a good size bed, ensuite with shower, TV, tea\/coffee making facilities, safe and chair  desk. The room was spotless, and housekeeping called every day to make\/change bed, clean bathroom, etc.The building is old and quirky - so you won't get a sterile square box to stay in. You may hear next door watching TV or....(well, it is Amsterdam!). You may hear your neighbours who've stayed out later than you coming home, saying goodnight and heading to bed.Yes, there are a lot of steep steps and no lift, so don't wear high heels and don't get too drunk while out for the evening! The staff will carry cases up and down, just ask!I asked for a non-smoking room, and was told they're in short supply - but I got one, so didn't have any difficulties mentioned by another reviewer.General noise - I was at the back of the hotel, so heard very little outside noise. Remember that you're in the middle of a city, which doesn't sleep, so noise is to be expected.I spent 4 nights here this time, and was very happy with the experience.Two tips- get the Conexxion hotel shuttle from Schipol to the door of the Nadia. Return fare is √à√\u2020√ü?1 and well worth the trip. You'll be dropped at the door, and the hotel will book the return trip for you. - Cafe Panorama, at the other end of the block is a nice place to eat (Italian pasta\/pizza and steak).
