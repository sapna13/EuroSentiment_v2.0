{"text":"Great Value for your money! August 22,2007We are staying at this hotel before we start our cruise on Sunday. We have two rooms and both are a good size and the bathroom is also a nice size. Perhaps when checking in make sure you ask for what you are looking for. I guess we lucked out on our rooms but I did ask for a high floor because of prior feedback! Ask for a higher floor as the closer you are to the street the noiser the street noise is. The airconditioners in the room are also very noisy. I suggest not to rent a car as there really is NO parking around the hotel. Good luck on that one. Staff very courteous, helpful and kind. Breakfast is great....What more can you ask for...except for the coffee(ugh!!!) My suggestion to the hotel is to change the coffee they use for breakfast.They have cake, croisants, cinnamon-like buns kind of....They have bagels, toast (whole wheat and white) cereal, hot cereal,different juices, boiled eggs...I know it's not the Ritz, however....its breakfast and how much can you eat, really!! I am sure I missed some stuff but plenty of selection for a continental breakfast and it's free!!! The sitting area for breakfast was not enough for the breakfast crowd, however alot of guests I noticed went out to the poolside were there are additional tables and chairs. It was quite nice actually. You are around the corner from everything, There is a wonderful beach across the road, the restaurants, old San Juan area..There is a bus stop at the top of the street. Take the B21 bus to the plaza Americana ( the biggest mall in the caribean) and take the B21 bus back for 75 cents each way or take a cab for $14.00,each way, your choice. We have really enjoyed the pool at the hotel as it is at times too hot to go out so we just laze around the pool. Free towel service for the pool and the beach. They also have a hot tub but we could not get near it as it was way too hot during the day. They have two computers available for guests (highspeed internet) Great money saver as hotels charge per minute for internet access. No time limit however I would not stay on it for hours if someone is waiting to use it. Our whole family has really enjoyed our stay here.
