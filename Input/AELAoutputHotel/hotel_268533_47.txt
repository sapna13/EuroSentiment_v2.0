{"text":"Failed to meet expectations We booked this hotel based on its rating in several places as being a good hotel for famlies with children. The hotel is certainly servicable and without question has a good location but overall was underwhelming and disappointing. The front desk has a toy chest that children are allowed to choose a toy from once a day. However the toys are along the lines of a small rubber bouncy ball. Nothing wrong with this per se but not particularly impressive. The hotel rooms are stylized in a nautical theme but are otherwise standard fare. It is difficult at times to obtain tickets to see Alcatraz Island. So one might expect the concierge of a hotel to be able to help with this....Not at the Argonaut. Okay then,. perhaps the concierge can tell us about the usefulness of the Go San Francisco Card, is it worth buying? No such luck, the concierge had never even heard of this card. Want help from the bell staff? You'd better call well in advance, we waited for an hour.We ate breakfast at the hotel's restaurant and were amused at how they semed to run out of staple breakfast foods on a daily basis. One day they were out of croissants,. the next day out of muffins, the next day Orange Juice was out of stock, and yogurt the next day. Over all I feel that there are other hotels that are a better value for families and other choices down at the Fisherman's wharf area. I certainly wouldn't stay here based on any perception that the hotel offers anything special for families.
