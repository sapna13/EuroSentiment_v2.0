{"text":"Great Location Stayed 24th √à√\u2020\u2022?27th August 2007The location of the hotel is excellent, it is 2 minutes walk from the Louis Vuitton shop on the Champs Elysees and just a bit further to the Arch de Triumph. It is also an easy walk to the Seine and the Eiffel Tower, and there is also a tube station close by. So a good base to explore from.The hotel is very nicely decorated; everything is immaculate, though they do seem to have a bit of a book fetish, with the lift walls lined with fake books, fake book doors. There is a nice lounge and a bar area, with yes more books.Breakfast is served in a pretty breakfast room, and there is a good selection from fresh fruit, cereal, bread, pastries, cold meat, smoked salmon and some mornings a hot option as well. The other good thing is that breakfast is served until 11:00 so you can be a bit relaxed if you want. The service was good, and the staff were friendly and helpful.The downside; I expected a small room, rooms in London are small but it was the smallest room I have ever stayed in without asking to be moved. That said it was very nicely decorated, it had everything you need, with double doors that opened on to a roof garden. The air con worked perfectly and with good black out curtains and a comfortable bed, we had probably the best nights sleep we had in ages. The bathroom was also nice, with a double end bath, powerful shower, and plentiful towels. Maid service was good and we had a turn down service including chocolates and a weather forecast. Whilst in Paris we did a dinner cruise with Bateaux Parisiens, it was a great way to see the main sights, the food was good, there was music and the wine flowed, we both enjoyed it. The only problem was I had scallops as a main course and it was perhaps not a good choice in view of the mass catering. They also had someone walking round answering questions about the sights, as well as a map with descriptions as part of the dinner menu. We paid extra for premier, which meant you had priority boarding, a table for 2 at the front of the boat so the best view and better wine. We booked this in advance with top table on the net and it was significantly cheaper doing it this way.On our last night we ate at Pershing Hall. It is a French \/ Asian fusion restaurant, expensive, but we had a fantastic meal, excellent service, we really liked the ambiance, subtle lighting and d√ã√\u2022√ñcor. The main restaurant is on two levels with tables outdoors in the courtyard or upstairs. We had a table upstairs in a balcony over looking the courtyard, which was perfect.
