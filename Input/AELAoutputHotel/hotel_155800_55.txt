{"text":"A great place to party and meet a variety of cultures This is a wonderful, lively hotel with a fabulous pool and beach area; excellent, attentive staff; and great nightlife. The restaurant selections are numerous with outstanding food and great service. The rooms are spacious and clean. This is not a good hotel for sleeping; and obviously the hotel must know this because instead of providing chocolates during turn-down service, the hotel staff places earplugs at your bedside (no kidding, really). I have never been in a hotel that provided earplugs. Our room was near the elevator and ice machine (rooms X31, X33, X35)--people got off the elevator at all hours and continued their conversations and frivolity in the hallway. It got quiet at around 5 AM. You'll need to catnap at the pool and beach.The nightlife is electric and fun. Each night, the eclectically-adorned lobby area is filled with wildly-attired guests and visitors from a variety of cultures and age groups. The younger-hip crowd migrates to Bravo, the on-site, very popular club. The older crowd dances to the live Latin bands in the lobby with incredible flare and charisma--it's a blast just watching them. This is a fantastic hotel for a reunion of friends, bachelor party, sorority\/fraternity reunion, young people, families with older teens, twenty and thirty somethings. I know the hotel has a variety of rooms, and I believe honeymooners can have privacy and a great time, as well. The casino is like most hotel casinos--nothing remarkable.We loved the pool area--the landscaping, waterfalls, private areas are just magnificent. The staff is great about coming around and serving you yummy drinks and treats, fixing your umbrella, dispensing towels, etc.Tip: Move your shower dial no more than a half an inch to the right to turn on the water and set the temperature control. Any further movement to the right will result in a VERY hot shower.
