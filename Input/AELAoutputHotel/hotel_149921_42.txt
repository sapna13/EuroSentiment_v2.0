{"text":"Mixed Review I stayed here with my husband and 6 year old child for 2 nights in July. We paid $210 per night including the buffet breakfast. The final bill totaled $560 after taxes, fees and parking. Well what can I say? In December 2006 I stayed here and wrote a fabulous review on this website. Now, I am disappointed that all did not go well. As others have mentioned, there is a problem with rooms in the old tower. An employee mentioned that a big remodel will begin in the near future. The AC could not be increased above 62 degrees. We changed room twice. The general atmosphere in the lobby is beautiful. It is classic 40's modern and is very cool. The rooms however, were shabby. Paint peeling, rusty pipes in bathroom etc... When I complained the staff were very accomodating and understanding. I get the feeling that they hear complaints all day long and must change rooms frequently for customers. I heard everyone complaining and lots of room credit charges being given. I guess I should have asked for financial compensation for my headaches. Instead, they just kept changing my room. The rooms never seemed to get much better. The kid activities were minimal. The game room had broken machines and a change machine that never worked. I inquired about the kids camp but it never seemed to be functioning each day. The pool is kind of dirty. The pool cleaning guys tried to clean each day.The buffet Breakfast (forgot the restaurant name) at the hotel was very good! As others mentioned, no direction is given. The hotel amenities are not explained. The business center offers 5 minutes free internet use. There is a cute rear garden with rare birds. All of this stuff I just happen to stumble upon. The gym is free and very nice with new equipment. Bread is provided next to the towel stand for fish feeding (fun for kids). But again, no one told me about it. The 9th floor VIP lounge is pretty good. Continental breakfast and evening dvoudores, cookies all day. During the day you can use the computer and you have your own VIP desk person to assist you with check out and concierge services. No one told me this, I just again, stumbled upon it. I was granted VIP lounge use after the foul ups with my room. FYI - the kids movie theater is only open during the winter holidays. The staff are hard working and very kind. They just have a hard job because the rooms are pretty crummy. If you go, you must request the new Hilton Honors Tower, otherwise you will have room issues. I'll try the Marriott Stellaris next time.
