{"text":"Avoid at all costs I stayed here for 1 week in October 2008 whilst on a business trip. I selected the hotel due to its location and booked via the Accor Asia web-site. I booked the more expensive 'Superior Garden room' specifically to get the bundled internet access.I had requested an early check-in as I was arriving at 8:30am after an overnight flight. On arrival no room was available and I was told that a room would not be available until 'late afternoon'. However, they offered me use of the pool changing (which was locked and when opened no towels were available!)At check-in later I was asked to pay in full for the whole of my stay. I had booked a flexible rate as I was not certain of my dates - not a discounted pre-pay rate. I queried the pre-payment and was then told that it was non-refundable. I refused to pay whereupon the check-in girl said it was hotel policy that all guests must pay in advance otherwise she could not give me a room! I asked to see the manager - it took 20 minutes before he appeared. He repeated the hotel policy. I showed him my Accor reservation and booking terms. He said that the hotel belonged to a different company and they had different terms to Accor group! Novotel is part of Accor but not this Novotel! Eventually after some argument he offered that I pay in advance for the first night only and could pay the balance on checkout.The 'Superior Garden room' itself was OK inside and had a wonderful view of the traffic intersection outside the hotel. I could see a couple of trees across the street above a high wall - when I queried this the front desk claimed that this was a 'view of the Chinese Garden'! Breakfast - what a disaster! Every day there was some problem or other. They did not have enough staff to cope with the number of guests. Most days there was a queue of between 10 and 20 people waiting to be seated (typically a 15-20 minute wait), despite the majority of tables being empty. One person handling all payment and billing before seating just wasn't enough. Other guests were also getting angry and complaining.The problems ranged from no cups, no hot water, no coffee, no plates, no juice, no cutlery. no milk, no fruit, etc! At A$25 for breakfast I would expect rather better service! The wireless internet included in my room rate was painfully slow. It stopped working on the 4th day of my stay. Despite assurances from the front desk that it would be fixed shortly \/ this evening \/ tomorrow it was still not working when I checked out after 7 nights. Despite daily complaints, the response to a request at check out for a reduction in the room rate to compensate was that internet access was 'complimentary' in my room rate so no refund. If I had booked a standard room internet access would cost around A$30 per day!Overall this is not the standard I expect from a Novotel (I use this chain regularly). The front desk staff were inflexible and unhelpful. Complaints were dismissed and not dealt with by the duty managers. The breakfast staff genuinely tried to be helpful but there were not enough of them. I made a written complaint to the hotel but they have chosen not to respond. You can draw your own conclusions what this hotel thinks about its customers.....
