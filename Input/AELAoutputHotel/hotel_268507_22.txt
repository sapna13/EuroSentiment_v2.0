{"text":"Beautiful decor; you might need the complimentary earplugs This boutique hotel is off the beaten path, located on a just off the main road back road in a very trendy part of town. I was surprised when the taxi stopped and thought, This can't be location, can it? But then I saw the nice entrance and waiting staff, and I knew I was in the right place.As others have mentioned, the decor is high modern. Like the W and other hotels adopting the trendy theme, green apples were used as decorations. I was told that the hotel was a converted warehouse.The good:* Room service was great. The food I ordered arrived promptly (within the 45 minutes quoted) and was delicious.* The room included plenty of creature comforts: complementary bottles of water (with an ice bucket filled every night), fluffy bath robes, a Bose radio, and Aveda products in the bathroom.* The working space was more than adequate. The desk in my room was surrounded by other flat surfaces that made it easy to spread out my paperwork.* At check-in, the staff was top notch. They had guessed who I might be and already started the process before I reached the desk.* Above-ground walking distance to lots of fun, small restaurants and bars (not connected to the series of underground passageways that make moving from building to building in Toronto in the winter easier).The not-so-good:* My room was on the street side, overlooking a little bar that had rooftop seating and, on one night, a movie playing outdoors. Fun, right? Also loud. Luckily, earplugs are provided. I was on the 9th floor, so the noise wasn't as distracting as it might have been, and I didn't have any problems sleeping. I am sure that this is not an issue in the Toronto winters!* I checked out at an odd time (6:30AM on a Saturday morning), and the staff was unprepared. I was running late, so I called downstairs to ask them to begin the process during my elevator ride. No one answered the phone. When I arrived at the desk, no one was there, and the bellman had to search for the gentlemen manning it. When he arrived, I mentioned that no one had answered my call. He never apologized, but provided an excuse: this was the time during which he did his paperwork.
