{"text":"hmm..where to start?? brother got MUGGED ON RESORT?..[--] front desk??... Well let's just start off by saying that the resort was beautiful and we had a prime spot close to the buffet, pool and beach. But it was too bad that their food was garbage, and although we had access to all 5 a la cartes the portions were very very small and everything tasted like garbage.I must say that the best thing about the resort was the activities staff!!...always smiling and having a great time around the pool and on the beach!!!And i must say that that was the best lobby parties i have ever been to before. Thank you activities staff,, you guys are awesome!Although we had an amazing time with the activities staff and bar staff, we had a horrible experience when we were ON THE RESORT....my brother ended up getting mugged outside of the disco and the man held a HUGE MACHETTE KNIFE to my brothers throught....my brother thought that that was the end of his life then and there. But thank god he could run as fast as he did. So the man got all of my brothers money, his bank card, which he somehow managed to withdraw over $1000, as well as his silver chain and braclet. We were just disgusted of how something like that could happen on a 4 star resort...doesn't make sense to me at all. It's horrible when something like that had to happen on the resort right in the middle of our vacation. To not even feel safe on the resort that we booked our 1 week vacation on is the worst feeling to have especially having 3 days left to spend on that resort.Bottom line, the front desk lobby staff and guest services staff were absolutly horrible. They didnt help us out at all. They screwed us around more then anything. HORRIBLE when you have to go to the front desk for help and no one is capable or willing to help!! DISGUSTING...so due to the mugging incodent and the usless front lobby staff I STRONGLY DO NOT reccommend this resort to anyone. STAY AWAY, it's NOT SAFE!!!! ","annotations":[]}
