{"text":"Nice hotel with bad service The hotel facilities are very nice, even though, lacking maintenance. The hotel main building has fountains all over the place, however, none is working. I guess that when the hotel was designed, the fountains were included to give a sense of freshness, since there is no AC at the lobby, bar and most of the spaces of this property, were the hot, hot, hot weather and high humidity are really annoying.The people that work here seem to be doing it mostly for survival, not because they like their jobs. Most of them are very unfriendly and mean, as if they are providing a favor to the customer. It is very interesting to see how all high executives are foreigners and dominicans are the ones in the lower ranks. The meanest of them all were the Reservations Manager at this hotel and Marilyn, the lady at the entrance of the japanese restaurant. By the way, food is not so nice at any of the understtaffed restaurants. The Servicio Real (Royal Service) restaurant, by the pool is filled with flies and nobody does anything to have them fly away. The Servicio Real at the beach its not worth the name.The gardens of the hotel are perfectly maintained, but again, the fountains in the gardens are not running, turning the nice ponds into mosquito reservoirs.The only person that made our stay gratifyng was the lady that cleaned our room, Veronica, who was always trying its best to provide an excellent service.The hotel is really beautiful, but service and maintenance are not their qualities.
