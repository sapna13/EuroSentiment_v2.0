{"text":"A pearl on Waikiki! We booked this property for our family vacation and were pleasantly surprised. We needed a place that could accommodate 5 people, since booking hotel rooms in Honolulu can be very pricey. When we arrived at the hotel the front desk folks were very friendly and helpful, they even upgraded us to an ocean view room from a partial ocean view. The front desk staff coordinated with the bellman to take all our bags up to the room, and the front desk person even escorted us up to our room to show it to us. The unit we were in, #801, had all new appliances, beds, and furniture, as well as granite counter tops. The room was spotless. To say the least we were very impressed! The hotel is directly across the street from Waikiki Beach, and a short 5-10 minute walk gets you to the heart of Waikiki. We never saw the housekeeping staff, but as stated in previous reviews, they do turn-down service and leave a treat for you, which is always nice after coming back from a busy say of playing tourist. We especially enjoyed having breakfast every morning out on the lanai, watching the surfers and beach-goers. BTW we never saw any critters in our rooms. There was wired internet access in our room, which worked well and was great to have so we could keep in touch with family and friends back home. We would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel, especially for families, and if we go back to Honolulu again, would not hesitate to stay with them again. ","annotations":[]}
