{"text":"Absolutely Amazing Excellence Punta Cana was an amazing all inclusive resort. The staff was always friendly and always had a smile on their face. If you had a question you could talk to anyone and they were always willing to help you even if they had to go out of their way to do it. The staff was also pretty much fluent in english, and if they didnt know what you were saying they were able to figure it out (but that happened maybe once and it was our fault with our lingo).They have so much to do here.. We were never bored and their shows were awesome and so entertaining. The food at all the restaurants was great and you had a wide variety to choose from. you will not feel that you are being hounded or watched. you can go here and truly relax and enjoy yourself. The water in the ocean was refreshing but warm and the pools were heated. One suggestion would be to bring bug spray but no one can control mosquitoes at night, but if you dont have bug spray they have staff walking around with it to help you out. I only heard complaints from other nearby hotels because the staff didnt speak english and the food was getting them sick. NO WORRIES with Excellence though. My stay was fabulous and if I could go on a honeymoon again I would go back in a heartbeat.. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESORT!! DEFINATELY GET YOUR MONEYS WORTH AND MUCH RELAXATION... ","annotations":[]}
