{"text":"I'm Hooked!! We travel once a year to Boston to attend a Red Sox game and usually make it an overnight to enjoy a dinner in the North End (such great Italian food) then a leisurely stroll around town. This year we decided to stay at the Nine Zero as we also had a great deal on travzoo. We had heard about this hotel from Conde Nast's great ratings. We cannot say enough about this Hotel. From the get go service was magnificent. We were checked in promptly and what I think is a good gesture is the staff comes from behind the desk to give you your keys making it more personal. We were given an upgrade to the 19th floor overlooking the Skyline of Boston from one floor to ceiling window and the City Govt Center from the other. The room was smaller than I expected but other than that no complaints from us. Very clean, large shower, very comfy beds on which you can have any type of pillows you want just by asking. We didn't use the minibar (never do) and didn't watch TV but did make use of the music. From 5-6 there is a wine reception in the lobby which we did partake before going out to dinner. A very nice touch. The staff goes out of their way to welcome you and make you feel very comfortable. Kudos to Shavangi who was just great. We checked out but left our bag there and when we returned she welcomed us with a smile and a genuine hello and offered us some wine. I thought because we had checked out already that we weren't eligible for lack of a better word. But she said we were still guests. We are now hooked on this hotel and will be staying on our next trip to Boston. Nine Zero should be very proud of their staff, the best I have seen yet.
