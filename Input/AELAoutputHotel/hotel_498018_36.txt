{"text":"Pros and cons Pros: Good sized rooms, Great location for Icaria beach and marina with it's numerous eating places but a littel away from the City centre, however tourist bus stop only 50 yards away and the metro 300 yards away, substantial breakfast from 7-11 am. Helpful staff. Swimming pool, Reasonable bar prices for a hotel.I paid √ä√£¬¢360 for two rooms for 3 nights, breakfast included for two adults.Cons: Building work next to hotel which is ongoing and will eventually cut out light and is a little of an eyesore at present. The new work is nothing to do with the hotel and not their fault. Originally given two rooms on separate floors for myself and my wife and my children. Private function on Saturday evening which substantially put pressure on barstaff. I heard one couple being told a barsnack would take 2 hours. The air conditioning didn't work well in one of the rooms.At checking in, my wife said for safety reasons we needed the rooms to be next to each other and to be fair to the staff this was sorted without any argument. In fact I foung the reception staff very helpful throughout. The building work will have an impact. Work stops at the weekend so I think this would be the best time to go. It is noisy early in the morning in rooms with the pool view. The road side rooms are very quiet but I think a little more expensive.To me the pros outweighed the cons, and I would go back to this hotel. My family had a great time in Barcelona. If I went back with my wife I would book a road-side room and and go at the weekend. I might skip breakfast. It costs √ä√£¬¢14 euro and there is too much. I am not a big breakfast person.
