{"text":"A perfect, little gem! We were thrilled with our stay at the Hotel River! It's a charming hotel located right across from the Arno River. What I loved about it was the location. It wasn't right in the center of the city where all the tourists are. It was quiet and had a nice ambiance. Although, it was still in walking distance to most things. We did take a cab to the train station though. It's in walking distance to the Santa Croce and Ponte Vecchio and other major sites like the Doumo.The rooms were spacious enough and had a nice bathroom. Great shower and good towels (which is important). Beds were comfortable too. The room had a small flat screen TV. It was a very nice stay - not a super fancy place, but perfect for a city where you won't be really around your hotel much. They offer a nice continental breakfast and free internet access in the lobby. The hotel only has three or four stories, so I liked that it was small. There's a nice terrace too upstairs. The hotel has a home away from home feel to it. The best part of our stay were two of the concierages. Abbas and Salvatore! They were extremely helpful, kind and knowledgeable. They didn't steer us wrong especially in the restaurant department. I felt like we didn't go to typical tourist type eateries. They recommended two restaurants we loved - Ristorante di fagioli and Il Barrino. They were wonderful. Ask for Rita at Il Barrino and she'll hook you up with an amazing tasting of all different stuff. Get the Florentine steak and ask for the pasta with truffle oil (which wasn't on the menu, but she gave it to us anyway). Abbas and Salvatore did add to our experience with their hospitality and friendliness. Abbas in particular was very helpful and so wonderful! He also has a car service and took us on a day tour in Chianti. He knew so many charming little towns in Tuscany to visit and took us to a great winery for wine tasting including a homemade lasagna lunch. He truly made our trip extra special since we saw so many things we would've never had a chance to if we just went by a guide book. I would definitely recommend the Hotel River!
