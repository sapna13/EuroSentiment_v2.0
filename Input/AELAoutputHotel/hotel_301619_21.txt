{"text":"One of my favorites I stayed 10 nights in the Main Building at the Okura this past November, and this was the 7th time I've stayed at the Okura during my dozen or so trips over the past 25 years. I always look forward to returning to the Okura, and it feels a bit like coming home after a long absence. I just love the place, but I realize it may not be everyone's cup of tea. It feels dated, kind of stuck in the 1960's, but it is not the least bit run-down. It does not have the glitz of a brand-new hotel, but that is what I love about it. It feels a bit like staying at the UN, with a very Japanese twist. I love the architecture of the place, especially the lobby of the Main Building. One of my favorite public spaces in the world. The rooms are quite comfortable, but the beds are too firm for my taste. I usually get an extra comforter and sleep on top of it for extra padding. Prices in the hotel are high, but fair considering it is Tokyo, and the high quality of the food and service. Although there is not much in the direct neighborhood, it is an easy walk to Roppongi and Akasaka with lots of great (and less expensive) restaurants. I do like the Main Building slightly better than the South Wing, and it is a shorter walk to the Ginza subway line. Despite the Okura's shortcomings, it is still one of my favorite hotels in the world.
