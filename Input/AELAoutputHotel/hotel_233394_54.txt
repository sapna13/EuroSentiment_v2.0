{"text":"Superb stay at this outstanding hotel My husband and I were very fortunate to have found this hotel through trip advisor (thank you!) Every review you will read about this hotel does not do it justice. It honestly is a remarkable little hotel which feels more like an inn with an outstanding staff. We stayed for only 3 nights and it felt like we were not patrons of a hotel, but family. Alex (a very friendly staff member) greeted us upon arrival with a huge smile and knew our names like we were long lost siblings. And once we got over the shock of that we were greeted again and again by each staff member. Now how many hotels have you gone to that you know each and every staff member by their names and they know yours? And I'm not even good with remembering names! Matteo, the proprietor, is a charming gentleman. He is welcoming, and sincere, and he stops at no expense to make your stay the best it could possibly be. He is very knowledgeable about Venice and it's history and where to go and what to do. He even ran (yes ran) to a restuarant to make a reservation for us because they were not answering their phones and he wanted us to have the experience of dinning there. Every suggestion he made was bang on and I can without a doubt say that if it were not for Matteo and his staff our visit to Venice would not have been nearly as wonderful as it was. It is obvious that Matteo and all of his staff truly love what they do.The hotel itself is enchanting and very well appointed. Its decor is beautiful and quite luxurious. The terrace overlooks the Rialto bridge. You must realize how rare a terrace with this view is. The terrace is where you can have breakfast or a mid-day cocktail, or a pre-post-any-time cocktail which Matteo prepares himself. We have been lucky enough to have travelled to many beautiful locations and have stayed in many fine hotels and this hotel is truly a gem and one of our very favorites! Bravo Matteo!
