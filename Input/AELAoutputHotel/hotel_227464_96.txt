{"text":"Allround excellent hotel My Husband and I have just returned from a fabulous weekend in Barcelona, made even better by our choice of this hotel.The Regina is a 4* Hotel and in my opinion it really does deserve its rating. It is a smallish hotel, with nice quality, contemporary fittings. It is stylish, comfortable, well presented and clean.The reception rooms are quite small by some standards but they were more than adequate for the number of guests during our stay. The bedrooms are a decent size, with good facilities, all of which were working.Any 'problems' other reviewers have mentioned such as broken lifts and renovations seem to have been resolved and we had a most peaceful, calm stay.We found all of the staff, whether on reception, in the bar or in the breakfast room to be extremely friendly, efficient and helpful and nothing was too much trouble. We particluarly adored the barman who was really lovely and kept us plied with an assortment of cocktails! Do try the Cava, Gran Marnier  brandy cocktail. It's fab.Meals and drinks were delivered quickly and were excellent value for a city centre hotel. Breakfast was very good and there was a vast assortment of fruit, cereals, cold meats and pastries - No, its not English but then Barcelona isn't in England!The central location mean that many of the cities attractions are within walking distance (if you like walking!), yet the hotel is just off the beaten track and so doesn't suffer from the same level of noise as the hotels on Ramblas.I cant fault this hotel for all round comfort, service and value for money. It does what it says on the can!
