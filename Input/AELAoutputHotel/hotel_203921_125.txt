{"text":"Wonderful again !! My husband and I recently stayed at the Hotel David. This was our third stay in this lovely hotel. As always we were not disappointed. The quality of service was far above excellent as always. They have been doing some renovatiions, including some lovely improvements to the bathroom in our room. We were fortunate enough to stay in the same room as on our last visit. There is a lovely terrace for sitting in the mornings or evenings. Everything was spotlessly clean with wonderfully crisp and sweet smelling bedding. I always sleep well when I stay at Hotel David!! Breakfast again in the lovely breakfast room with Maria making wonderful capuccini has always been one of the highlight of our stays. There was a very good assortment of meats,cheeses,cereal,boiled eggs,rolls and delicious pastries along with the coffees and teas and juice. Maria herself is the gem of the breakfast room though !! The entire staff is always at hand to help us with all our travel needs. Bus schedules,train schedules,buying city bus tickets,restaurant recommendations and reservations,museum reservations--these are just a few of the services they provide with great detail and lovely smiles. The computer in the lobby is a lifesaver for many of us ! The early evening drinks and snacks in the parlour with a fire in the fireplace on cool evenings is another of the highlights of our stay at this hotel. We are always able to find other guests to talk to, to share ideas with and to learn from. This trip we even went to dinner with various people who were also staying there. One night we had a little party outside after dinner and they made cappucini and coffee for us. The hotel is not in the center of Florence but we always enjoy the walk along the Arno, or if not, it is simple to use a bus or taxi. There is a laundromat a few blocks away that we always make use of. There is a little grocery\/meat market next to the laundromat where we always purchase our cheese and wine to bring home. Our favorite trattoria, Trattoria GiGi's, is located across the street from the grocery store. There are at least three or four other places to eat in this area and all are very good.The owner, Gabriele Cecioni makes certain that the hotel and the hotel staff meets and exceeds very high standards. He is a wonderful man and it is always a delight to find the time to chat with him. His wife is also quite lovely and charming. And I can't forget to add that their son Marcco (one year old) is simply adorable !We have become accustomed to measuring the comfortability and quality of service at other hotels by the standard that we have known at Hotel David. Not many even come close. We will never stay anywhere else in Florence as long as the Hotel David has a room for us.Thank you to Signore Cecioni,Michele,Sabrina, Serena, Maria and to all the others at the hotel. Thank you for making Florence like a second home for us. Thank you for caring about your customers. You are all always in our hearts.
