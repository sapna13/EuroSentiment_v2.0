{"text":"Not to repeat :( I got a good deal for 3 nights but would had preferred to pay more for a nicer hotel.When I got to my room it was so small that there was not even space to put a chair to use the desk to work. I requested a solution and they were very fast assigning me another room with more space and a chair!Internet is fast but it has restrictions to access my work network. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the first time it happened to me. I could not use my email for 3 days√à√\u2020\u2022?This is unacceptable.First nigh there were no black out curtains meaning that I could not sleep with the light. I asked for a protection for the eyes and they were very efficient providing it.A telephone in the corridor was always ringing and as the doors have no sound proof at all. It was a nightmare being waken up all the time.In the morning I mentioned that the mini bar and the scale in the WC were not working.Nothing was done. In the evening I mentioned again the mini bar not working. A made came and just plugged it in a different plug and it started working√à√\u2020\u2022? (No follow up at all)Second night they put the black outs but the phone in the corridor was still ringing and worse than that there was a working area just outside the room and the room cleaners were talking very loud all morning. I had to go out and ask them to respect the silence.Reception staff is nice and I did not try breakfast.The location is not very central but this is not a problem at all as there are taxis all the time or you can even walk.
