{"text":"fantrastic time at ocean sand we just got back and had an amazing time. First off we had emailed the resort that we were traveling with friends who were celebrating a special occasion and if possible requested an ocean view. They were given a corner room 3rd floor villa 5 with a corner deck and the most fantastic view. We had the garden bush view which was fine with us as we are always on the beach. Staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help us with our Spanish. We did notice some guests getting rude with staff as they did not speak English and we always felt like asking why when one travels to a foreign country is the expectation that they speak English??? Having said that we found most spoke\/understood what we were trying to ask. Enjoyed the food was able to get fresh seafood no matter where we ate. Saturday evening is the Dominican theme night at the buffet we were lucky as the Saturday we were there it was served throughout the kitchen and it was spotless.Enjoyed the freedom to decided on a la cartes as we felt like not by when one could get a reservation. Yes some nights we had to wait ...but so you go and have a drink . Never did any of the shows we enjoyed the lobby bar and usually all that sun played us out.Us too had our battery go in the safe took about 10-15 minutes to get fixed and then had to replace safe door but again willing to work around our schedule. Forgot one day to lock safe and nothing was taken so can say we had very honest staff.Bar staff willing to make anything, and accomodate any requests.Beach is one of the most beautiful I have been on very clean loved not having to worry or watch out for rocks what a treat!
