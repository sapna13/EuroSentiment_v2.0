{"text":"Best Hotel I have stayed in I booked this hotel through Dial Direct Travel. When arriving I was dubious due to the fact that the bigger hotels had the first drop offs and our hotel was the last. Check in went well without a hitch. The lobby was modern and very up to date. Every where was gleaming new. We stayed in a suite and for 2 people it was great. The hotel room was spotless and airy and modern. It had a microwave, fidge and coffee maker which was all we needed. The bed was kingsize bed and was very confortable. Each bedroom had a large flat screen TV and freinternet access. The balcony was very big and it boasted table  chairs for 8 people. Now I am a fussy person who generally only goes 5*. I can honestly say that this hotel would rate a 5* without a doubt. We were situated in a great location for all the major shops. We did walk up to Aloa Moana Shopping centre twice but found that shopping was cheaper near our hotel. We were 3 minute walk from the Market Place and 3 shopping centres. restaurants and bars were on every corner. Public transport was also very close and there was a bus stop outside the hotel. the hotel does not yet have a resaurant but there was no an issue as the restaurants were so close. The swimming pool area was kept very clean and sunbeds were always available. If I went back to Waikiki this would be the only hotel I would stay in. I would liek to say well done the the staff at this hotel as they were all very friendly and professional. Thnak you too to Dial Direct Travel for finding this nice hotel.
