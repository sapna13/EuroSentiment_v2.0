{"text":"Benjamin Brilliance We were booked into a superiour guest room but upon check in were advised as it was my birthday we had been upgraded to a one bedroom deluxe suite. Upon entering the room I was greeted by a birthday card and home-made birthday cake. Both unexpected but greatly appreciated gestures which highlighted how customer-orientated the hotel is.The suite was spotlessly clean, large and well equipped - there was one flat screen tv in the living room, another in the bedroom, cd players in both rooms, access to the internet in both rooms and a fax machine and large desk area for those on business. The kitchenette had a well-stocked mini-bar, microwave, coffee-maker, ample cutlery and crockery and tea\/coffee\/chocolate for use. The bedroom had a large,comfortable bed and a pillow menu from which you could sample assorted pillows with variable fillings, memory foam, wheat-filled, etc. The bathroom was again large and clean, ample towelling and Elemis toiletries were supplied, there were also two bathrobes for use during you stay. The suite was cleaned daily and at night a turn-down service was provided and you would return from a busy day to relaxing, classical music being played. The staff were polite and helpful, greeted you by name and would go out of their way to assist with any enquiries. On the night we left the manager had invited guests to evening drinks - something I have never experienced in other hotels. The week I spent at The Benjamin was perfect - I will definitely return and recommend this hotel to anybody staying in the New York\/Manhattan area.
