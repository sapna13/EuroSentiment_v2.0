{"text":"We loved Hotel Fusion! We stayed at the Hotel Fusion for 2 weeks during August and September 2007. The Hotel was ideally located for exploring the city on foot. It is right in the middle of so many restaurants and shops, especially a wonderful icecream shop across the road called Coldstone Creamery. The Hotel itself was very clean and tidy with wonderful friendly staff who were happy to answer any questions we had and gave us lots of helpful advice about how to travel round the city. The free breakfast was scrumptious, offering toast, muffins, crossiants, juices, fruit, tea and coffee. Also free internet access was provided as well as access to a small gym! The Hotel was a two minute walk away from one of the main shopping centres as well as it being a one minute walk from the BART station which we used as transport from the airport instead of paying lots for a taxi! Pier 39 was a 45minute walk which was good offering lots of shops, attractions and you catch the boat here to Alcatraz. We also went on an amazing helicopter ride which was brilliant and i would advise everyone visiting the city to go on! The BART station was also linked to the MUNI which was ideal for visiting San Francisco Zoo where you can see the famous Gary the grizzly gulch and Wilbert the wonderful Warthog! The Hotel Fusion made our holiday perfect and is an ideal place to start exploring the fascinating city of San Francisco from.
