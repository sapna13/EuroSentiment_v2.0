{"text":"Very disappointed with the service I booked a premium double room for one week. When I arrived, it was very hot and humid in Sydney. I checked into my room around 2:00 pm on a Sunday and told the desk clerk the air conditioning wasn't working in my room. She didn't have another premium room for the price I paid. She showed me a regular room with two twin beds that was lower priced than my room and said I could change but would have to pay the same price. She also suggested she give me a humidifier to cool the room until the maintenance crews could check out the air conditioner on Monday. The twin room was too small for 2 people so I chose the humidifier. It didn't cool the room at all and I was miserably hot all night. The next morning I asked for some ice for the humidifier so I could cool the room enough to shower. The desk clerk said I could go to the Shell station across the street and buy some. Another desk clerk suggested I pay $30 more a night for an upgraded room. Since I was so hot and miserable I said ok and that I would speak to a manager about the rate.I spoke to the manager and told him I didn't think it was fair that they charge me more for an upgraded room when the premium room I booked was not available. He didn't agree and charged my credit card.The rooms are small and clean in this hotel. However, don't expect good service or special treatment. The superior room we eventually received was large and new but I think you can find a better location and hotel for the price. The hotel says its in Darling Harbour however, it is a 15 minute walk to the Harbour. I would not recommend staying in this hotel if you can afford something a little nicer.
