{"text":"Don't Go here!!!!!!!! Do not go here. I chose this hotel based on the reviews and was disappointed. To begin, the location...it was on a dingy street in a neighborhood I did not feel safe in! Later I ask the cleaning lady if this is a safe neighborhood and she said it's very old and I shouldn't walk it alone. Then the internet was 5 euros for 30 mins to use (ripoff!). The room: dingy! We had 2 twin beds that gave you a walking circumfrance of 6 along the table and couldn't open the dresser doors. We had to push the beds another 2 feet to access the safe. Bathroom had a dingy smell with no ventilation and you can tell the ceiling was painted over I don't know how many times. The beds were terrible uncomfortable as were the linens. The internet was down 1 night and didn't know when it will be back up, the elevator another and the staff just smiled and said  in 10 min it should be working NOT! I wanted to upload fotos from my digital camera and their computer was something I used in high school that didn't read the USB and no media slot! Stick to the Internet Cafe that was on adjacent to the rambla next to their plaza in the middle of the Ramblas. Their PCs were modern. The cheapest one was on the Ramblas next to the Subway. 1.80 euro for an hour. Travel within Spain, book via Spainair, Vueling or Easy Jet. They are the cheapest. We flew from Madrid for 60 euros. Sweet! The location was a long walk to the Metro. I would never stay at the place. The halls smelled of mildew and the linens must be washed in something horrible as my skin itched the whole day. Definitely stay along the Ramblas or up by Placa Catalunya! Their fotos look nicer than the real thing! ","annotations":[]}
