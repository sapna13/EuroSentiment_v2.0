{"text":"Not a nice place I was there for the Nike Marathon in October with 2 other groups of people. The carpets were worn in the older section of the hotel and the whole place needed a paint job. the ONE elevator held about 2 people and their luggage, very small. No Air Conditioning, but they don't seem to mention that anywhere on their website. Dude, the A\/C is not just to keep a room cool...it's to circulate the air in the rooms as well!!! If you step outside, you WILL DEFINITELY BE HARRASSED BY STREET PEOPLE! There was one man drinking a beer out of a paper bag and eating something while he leaned against the front of the hotel about 10 feet from the front doorman. I don't have a problem with homeless, but streetpeople are different....they are there hustling in the streets because they want to, not because they have to. In the one-block surrounding the hotel, I saw one prostitute, one schizophrenic (the cameras are watching ALL of us....who owns the cameras? They know...they know..), one hustler selling old newspapers, and about 15-20 'beggars.' The only saving grace was the owner\/manager of the new restaurant in the hotel who was dilligent in shoo-ing all these street people away. There was human waste on the sidewalks, fights every night and sirens ALL NIGHT LONG. Bring ear plugs. There is no A\/C so you can't drown out the noise. It was a really run down crap hole. Stay at your own risk! ","annotations":[]}
