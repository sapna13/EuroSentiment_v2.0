{"text":"So-so stay at Dreams I didn't know exactly what to expect after reading the wildly mixed reviews of Dreams; after our recent stay (returned on 9\/24\/08) I would say it's fairly accurate to put it somewhere in the middle. Transportation:Yes, the roads there are not great. The first part of the drive from the airport was fine. As we got closer to Dreams, the worse the roads got. Yes, the drivers are generally very aggressive. I didn't exactly fear for my life though, as other reviews seemed to state. I think the more annoying part was that it was so far away; if you hire a shuttle shared with other travelers, it's almost a guarantee that you will be dropping everyone else off first. It took almost an hour and a half to make it to the resort. It rained - a LOT - so the drive back to the airport was worse. Muddy, rocky roads. But it's not a deal-breaker by any means. Hotel staff:Again, a mixed bag. We had plenty of servers who were extremely helpful and friendly, and others who were pretty ambivalent and slow. We weren't in any hurry though, so it was fine. Check-in staff - not so great. Details below. Bellhops, pool attendants, etc. were all very friendly. Room:We had a rocky start as far as the rooms went. Our first room had hair all over the bed and on the blankets, there were opened\/used beverages in the fridge, and was generally rather dirty. We called to request a different room, and their solution was to send a maid with fresh beverages to replace the used ones. We called back, and they didn't understand why we wanted to change rooms, yet still refused to send anyone out to look, and made us come back to the desk. They finally relented and gave us a different room. We walked into it, only to discover that someone was already IN that room! At this point, we were infuriated, not to mention a little concerned that they would give out keys to occupied rooms. We went back to the desk again, and after 30 more minutes and more debacles with our baggage and rude check-in staff, got yet another room. This one, too, had hair all over the bed but at least it was otherwise clean. The maid gave us new bedding and we left it at that. Terrible first experience. Food:Not so great. Wasn't bad and it was edible, but by no means did I look forward to meals. Bordeaux had pretty good steaks, and the breakfast buffet was generally okay. We didn't ever have to wait for a table though, which was nice. Room service 24\/7 is a nice perk, but it's a rather limited menu.Pool\/beach\/grounds:All very nice. We never had a problem getting a chair (with shade) at the beach or pool. Attendants came by frequently to take drink orders, and there's always a bar nearby, no matter where you are. The grounds are very well kept, and there are peacocks and flamingos wandering around. Overall, we had an okay trip but there are definitely other countries\/places to go that we want to visit and probably won't be going back.
