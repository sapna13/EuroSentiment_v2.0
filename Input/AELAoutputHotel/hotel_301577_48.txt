{"text":"Service worst than McDonald in the US Service is very poor. When I arrived at the counter at about 1:30pm, the room was not ready despite requesting for early check-in during reservation on the website. I was told that it will be about a 2 hours wait. OK when to get a bite and came back 2 hours later. Approach the front desk again and was rudely informed to go sit down while the room is being made. OK so I went to the sit down at the lobby. During this time, they knew that I was waiting and a huge crowd shows up to check-in. When the crowd was gone and about 1\/2 hour later, I approach the front desk again and this time the key was ready. I was so mad as they knew that I have been waiting. They did not bother to call me up to finish the paper work. In the US, when you order the food at MaDonald's, when they could only fill portion of your order, they will bring the rest of the food to you at the table. This hotel don't even bother to inform me when they are ready, despite knowing that the customer is waiting. That is the least a paying customer can expect. What a lousy service!!!Also, the room is tremendously small compared to Fairmount Plaza at City Hall (which has very good service), where I was fortunate to stay after this bad experience at Merchant Court.DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL!!!
