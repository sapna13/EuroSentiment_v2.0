{"text":"Location great, hotel wasn't. I went away to Barcelona for a week with my partner. On first impressions, the hotel looks good. The bus from the airport drops you down the road (which we only realised when we saw it go past - after we walked for about 15mins).I had booked a double room - but got a twin room. I went down to reception to ask to be moved (only because this had been a surprise birthday trip for my partner) but they said they were too busy and couldn't do anything. But my partner was fine with it - so it was ok.Staff were ok - most mornings the cleaner would just walk into our rooms without knocking - which got annoying after 3 days as it was always around 8-9a.m. We mentioned it at reception - and she never bothered us again.The hotel is noisy and if your a light sleeper don't stay here - luckily I had read previous reviews so took some ear plugs - however, it didnt help.Breakfast was not great at all - dishes that we picked up always had food stuck to it - was not impressed. And this seemed to happen throughout the whole week we were there.Location, however, was good. I prefer not to stay in the city, but slightly out of it and this hotel was convienant. However, me and my partner have decided that when we go back to Barcelona - we will stay somewhere a little bit closer to the city - as at night times we had to make sure we didnt get the metro back so late as the area around the hotel did get a bit dead.We loved Barcelona, but sadly the hotel was not for us. Will def. go back to Barcelona soon - we felt a week was not enough for us. ","annotations":[]}
