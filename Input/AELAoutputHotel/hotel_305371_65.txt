{"text":"Good hotel in a good location I stayed in the Conrad Hong Kong twice on my way to and from mainland China in April 2007 with two other work colleagues.The first time was for one night, and we got rooms on the 42nd floor, one of the lowest. Not all the rooms were refurbished, and mine was an old one with a very small TV in a cupboard and old-fashioned flowery decoration. Despite booking three rooms with king-size beds, they only had two available, and one of us had to take a room with two beds in it.The second time was for longer, and this time I asked for a higher room, and got one on the 49th floor which had been refurbished. Much better, with updated decor and a flat-screen TV. However again they didn't have three rooms on the same floor with king-size beds.Plus points:Very large and comfortable bed; large flat-screen TV with DVD player attached, and also all cables to attach a PC or iPod to it; Bose radio again with cables for mp3 player, wired broadband, very large wardrobe and very large bathroom with bath, separate shower, separate loo and two sinks. Hotel is linked directly to the Pacific Place shopping centre, where you can get breakfast - don't pay the minimum $200 for hotel breakfast - and walk to the MTR or tramway. Whenever something was wrong - no hot water out of a tap, burst light bulbs, telephone not working in the bathroom - it was fixed straight away. Oh, and you get Conrad the bear :-)Minus points:Broadband is not free, I paid $600 for a week's worth; The coffee maker was primitive compared to the rest of the hotel; and the gym is in a small windowless room with the old equipment crammed into it, not at all what I expected. The outdoor pool is also small for the number of guests.However the staff are - in the main - very helpful and approachable. I have to say though that if I wasn't on expenses - and a special company rate - I'd have to stay somewhere else.
