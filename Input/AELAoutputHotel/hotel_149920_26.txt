{"text":"Comfortable and friendly This is a well-maintained property that caters to families, couples and business people. Our king-size bed was comfortable with high-end Marriott bedding -- lots of those special pillows that you can now purchase commercially. Our room was slightly smaller than others -- possibly because of the big bed but was not a problem for the two of us. We paid more for ocean-view and it was well-worth it because we spent a good deal of time on the balcony. The room was well-appointed with pretty art and a large flat screen television. Bathroom was clean although a bit small. Our ac worked but it took time to get the moisture out of the room. I don't fault the system -- this is the Caribbean and I have stayed in other hotels where the ac needs time to get rid of the humidity.My wife and I used the beach where an attendant set up chairs and an umbrella as well as the pool. The pool has a supervised water slide -- great for kids. This was off-season so I cannot comment on the usage. Bar personnel did patrol both the pool and the beach. Staff on this property was helpful and friendly. The hot tub was under repair -- boarded over, so it was difficult to tell if and when it will return to use.Food was hotel-priced but there is a coffee bar in the lobby for light breakfast takeout and a Starbucks and Duncan Donuts across the street. There are take-out alternatives and fast food as well as some very good restaurants along Ashford Avenue. Every three months (we were told), the road is closed down for Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings for a huge block party. Restaurants brings out tables, and bands -- salsa, jazz, even a mariachi -- play. Quite the scene and a lot of fun. Other amenities: The front lobby has a high noise level as it includes a very large bar and music\/dance area. The casino is right off the lobby and was very busy while we were there. There were lots of gambling alternatives -- slots and tables and lessons are offered by the hotel. We also booked a tour to the El Yunque rainforest with a knowledgeable guide. I thought it was good value -- $53 for a 4-5 tour. I have stayed in Miramar, Isla Verde as well as Condado, mostly on business. While Isla Verde has some very nice hotels and is closer to the airport, I found the Candado presented some alternatives to hotel eating that happened to be very good. In all I would certainly recommend this hotel for families, couples, and parents with teens.
