{"text":"Excellent Hotel - give it a try! I recently had to go to London on business and needed a reasonable place to stay on Sunday 13th April 2008. My colleague Clare and I stayed at the London Bridge Hotel and I must say it was impressive. We stayed in Room 223, which is a twin room overlooking London Bridge Street. The beds were really comfortable and the room was very clean and well decorated. The bathroom has an extra mirror (great for plucking eyebrows or pondering whether botox time could be impending!!) fastened to the wall near the sink. Lots of fluffy white towels.Selections of up to date magazines were thoughtfully provided by the hotel along with all the usual tea, coffee etc. The wardrobe also lights up when the door is opened which saves any rummaging in the dark. There is also a safe, ironing board and iron, spare blankets, pillows in there. The staff were friendly, helpful and even send you an email after your visit to thank you for staying and that they look forward to your return √à√\u2020\u2022?a nice touch, whether they mean it or not!Breakfast was included in our price, this is taken in the lower floor Londinium restaurant. There was a good selection of both cold and hot fare, fruit juice etc which would offer something for everyone. If you require a taxi there are usually lots outside due to its proximity to the London Bridge rail station. However, noise at night is not an issue here. The photographs on the hotel website are accurate and I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone staying in London.from Ava Noliday ","annotations":[{"endOffset":565,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":560},{"endOffset":676,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":673},{"endOffset":684,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":678},{"endOffset":1017,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1013},{"endOffset":1017,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1013}]}
