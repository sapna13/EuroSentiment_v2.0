{"text":"Very good... and should be 'excellent' very soon Stayed from 10th - 26 January 2005Grounds and gardens - supurb with interesting plants which were overgrown, but the new Management are working hard to make them immaculate. Small lakes  ponds with friendly animals, rabbits, flamingos, peacocks and the 'cheeky' two parrots. They love peanuts, but also like glasses, buttons  hair bobbles. so beware the wreckers!Buildings  rooms - clean, but need painting. Lifts don't work. So if you are on the third floor, be prepared to climb stairs, often several times a day, because the room cards to open your door don't work sometimes. Our original room disappointing, it was dowdy and not equipt as brochure. Given new room with upgraded mini bar  DVD. P.S. Iron  ironing board are behind the left hand curtain...Comfy bed, but turn down service  fresh towels in the evening only available if you tip the maid every day. This shouldn't be necessary. The standard of the seating area was very poor and uncomfortably.Also, did not like the open plan bathroom \/ bedroom. My husband  I are very close, but we also like a bit of space. I usually spend some time before going out, relaxing in the tub, doing my hair, make up etc and come out looking radient. My husband likes to watch TV and 'chill' . But with the hairdryer on it wasn't easy. No privacy, but he has some interesting photographs! Management note, a small drape or pull down screen would sort this. Also as there is no where to dry wet swimwear, a pull-out line would be handy across the bath. Or drier on balcony.Restaurants and service - The choice and quality of food in all the eating places was very good. Supurb 'nouvelle cuisine' in the al a cartes. Excellent barbeques  buffets on the beach and round the pool. Fantastic settings with unusual wood fires. Huge logistical task for staff. Well done. You created a great atmosphere.Downside to eating - at breakfast, lunch and dinner, the food was often served 'luke' warm - cool. Not good, and some people did complain about tummy problems.Making toast was a disaster. Always a long queue.But the English tea was always very hot... great.The service and comunications with staff in the restaurants was excellent. Everybody was genuinly happy to help you. Tips were appreciated, but not expected.Entertainment - the team were adequate and did the usual Caribean daytime programmes. Their equipment was worn out, but you made the best of it, joined in and had fun.The same applied to the evening entertainment. It was ok if you hadn't seen it before. Also, as many people are there for two weeks, there should be more on to entertain them. There was one band every night with the same tunes. Not enough variety. People were playing Bingo for something to do!!Sport - my husband likes to windsurf, sail and snorkle. I like to go on canoe or pedalo. We did all this at Sunscape ( 1 mile up the Beach ) but there are no watersports here. The sea is so rough it is dangerous to swim in, because of the undercurrent. Saw several people rescued only a few yards out.Pool area - large choice of shaddy or sunny areas, but the beds and tables were dirty. The mats are left out all night, so if it rains, they get wet. The towels are rolled up on them, so they get wet as well. This needs sorting out.Another very annoying thing, is the selfish people who think that the rafts \/ floats belong to them. They put them next to or under their beds and hoard them all day, using them very rarely.Management should put note up saying that the rafts are for everybodies pleasure and should be left in the water.Tennis - we took racquets but couldn't get on a court from 5 - 7pm because the coach books it out for himself. Too hot the rest of the day. Other court both net and surface full of holes.Sports bar - all the equipment and games were completly worn out. Huge gouges in the the pool tables and the table tennis table was hardly usable. Cycles rusty. etcUrgent action required here management!Also, this is where you tend to get bitten by the mossies, so spray up before you go here to watch the sport on TV.Excellence Club had a private lounge with an all day mini buffet, and free internet access. Also, a larger variety of (serve yourself )spirits. On the whole, very good hotel which should improve greatly over the coming months under the new management.
