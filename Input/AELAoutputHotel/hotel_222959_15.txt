{"text":"Nice retreat from the hustle and bustle of midtown I stayed at this Ritz for 3 nights with my husband for my 40th birthday celebration. I come to NY several times a year, and we always stay in midtown or uptown. I decided for a change of scenery, we would try the Ritz at Battery Park. It is a lovely location, right on the waterfront. The evenings were quiet, and perfect for a relaxing stroll after dinner. We had a Harbor view room overlooking the Statue of Liberty, which was very special. The hotel is beautiful...definitely up to the Ritz standards. Service was always helpful and friendly, and there was nothing the staff wouldn't do to accomodate us. This is the Ritz though, and everything is pricey. It was painful to pay $350 for a 1 hour couples massage, although the spa was nice, and the massage was excellent. Breakfast in bed was $90 (1 order of waffles and an order of poached eggs). Dinner in the dining room downstairs was $185 for 2. Unless it is a special occasion, or you are on an expense account, the prices really sting. My weekend was a splurge, so I tried not to let it bother me.Battery Park is located right near the financial district. It is not the most exciting part of town. I was looking for a quiet, relaxing weekend, and I got it. The downside is, we had to take the subway, or a cab everywhere. There is not much in Battery Park to do. My favorite restaurants, shopping and museums are all uptown. Even the Village and Soho are not really walking distance. That will probably affect my decision whether to stay there again or not. I like being able to walk outside my hotel, and having everything right outside my door.The room was very nice and the bed was incredibly comfortable. The bathroom was very large for a NYC hotel room. Housekeeping and room service were friendly, professional, quick and efficient. The conceirge was always right on target with directions and recommendations, and the front desk staff was top notch.
