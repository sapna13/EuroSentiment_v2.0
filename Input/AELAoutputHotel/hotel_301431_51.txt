{"text":"The Regent Singapore: a fallen star I stayed in a Club Room at The Regent Singapore. Check-in was at the front desk whereby when I last stayed at this hotel 10 years ago, check-in was in-room. Another Club guest checking in at the same time was complaining that he was accustomed to check-in at the Club level.I was not accompanied to the room, but was given a note detailing Club benefits.On entering the ice-cold room, I found that the air-conditioning was set at 0 degrees and the windows were covered in condensation.The carpet in the room was well past its use-by date, clearly evidenced by too many shampoo treatments over the years.The room was gloomy, with the exception of one orchid plant working overtime to breathe life into an otherwise soulless room.The soft furnishings were also well worn and the bathroom wasn't much better, with a shower above the bath and a low-cost shower curtain.The hand basin had, at some stage, suffered porcelain damage and had subsequently been repaired in a DIY fashion by the hotel's handyman.The Club's selection of wines was below average and, when I enquired about a sparkling wine for an aperitif, I was told this was not available.The hotel boasts about its recently refurbished Club, however I found the seating worn, crammed and uncomfortable. I was discouraged from venturing onto the deck as it had rained earlier in the day and the staff must have decided it was too much trouble to wipe down the outdoor furniture.I opted to take breakfast in the restaurant, rather than the cramped confines of the Club. I found the buffet breakfast to be mediocre and service lacking.I'm delighted that I was subjected to this hotel for just one night and what a difference 10 years has made from my last most memorable experience of The Regent Singapore.
