{"text":"Good value, but mediocre Am a seasoned Caribbean traveler, so please keep that in mind when reading my review. Was disappointed when our luggage was delivered to the Bavaro lobby and was told we had to check in at the smaller one. Also was embarrassed when refused entry to certain restaurants and events because we were not Bavaro guests, but Principe guests. We were not aware there was a distinction. In fact, there are three classes of service. ROOMS were great, they are all-suites, and for the most part, were kept exceptionally clean. FOOD was disappointing. A big problem we found was that when eating at the buffets, the food was not hot enough for us. By the time you sat down to eat, everything was lukewarm. The themed restaurants were another disappointment, other than the Gourmet restaurant -- it was excellent! POOL area was beautiful; had to get chairs very early however. Although, there were three other pools that were not as crowded, so I guess it depends on the villa you were staying in. BEACH was beautiful, but packed every day. SAND was gorgeous - and you never even needed beach shoes. Distinctive shipwreck off the coast; plenty of beach activity. STAFF could have been more courteous and attentive. Did not get the feel that they were happy to serve us, although there were a few exceptions. SHUTTLES were fun, although we were apprehensive at first. It is a large property and the shuttles run often, so you are rarely waiting for a ride to the beach (we were in a villa closer to the lobby and pool area). ROACHES - several were spotted in the lobby one morning. Again, keep in mind that we are seasoned travelers. The members of our group that had never been to the Caribbean were very happy with almost everything - the temperature of the food being the exception. There is definite value here, just go with an open mind. ","annotations":[]}
