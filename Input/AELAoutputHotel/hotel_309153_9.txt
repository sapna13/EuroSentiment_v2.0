{"text":"Not 5-star worthy You can among other parameters judge a hotel on its capability to handle problematic situations. In that sense Kupu Kupu Barong in Ubud is not justified its 5 stars. We booked a stay in an Ayung River Pool Villa but was for some reason downgraded to a Duplex Pool Villa (huge difference) our first 2 nights. Discussions with the hotel staff did not do much good. First they tried to explain that this was in line with our reservation. Since we could document that this was not true they just said they were sorry. They day we should move villa the house keeping were more than two hours delayed in preparing our new villa (which is a lot when your a staying four days and have prepared the move to be on time) and the front desk kept saying it was not delayed. Disappointing and untrustworthy service from the front desk. Again! Beside these situations with the reception\/manager we had a great stay but I would never rate the hotel as a 5 star hotel as they do. The villas are with some variations not cleaned very well and look old. We saw\/stayed in three different villas (no. 3, 28 and the Royal Suite) The Mango Tree Spa offer spa treatments like it was a factory and the quality is not what we experienced in other hotels on Bali. The butler service is okay but as they try to make it very personal they fail. They cannot keep track on all the information and keep asking the same questions over and over.Overall conclusion. Great location, beautiful setting and view. Ayung River Pool villas are the best pick but do not expect 5 star service (spotless rooms, 5 star interior etc.) or high quality spa and if problems arise do not expect much from the front desk.
