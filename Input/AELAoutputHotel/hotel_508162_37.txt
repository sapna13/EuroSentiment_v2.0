{"text":"Just as I Remembered I returned to Dreams in October this year, having stayed there in January.Most of the improvements have been done - the gardens are wonderful and the pathways much better than before.The road to the Hotel is still as bumpy - but that's all part of the experience of visiting other countries.The Hotel lobby is wonderful, and the Reception staff are very friendle and efficient - as are the bell boys!!This time we were in Block 3 - fairly central to the pool beach and theatre. The room was good, the air conditioning worked well and the bed was comfortable.The room was cleaned daily - and the turn down service was sometimes a little early - but it was done each day!!There were plenty of beds around the pool - and I didn't have any trouble with beds being reserved!! Beach towels were plentiful and they always smelled clean and fresh.The pool is beautiful - clean and clear - and is huge!! There are quiet sections and noisy sections - it's up to you which you choose.The beach \/ pool bar is well stocked and there was never long to wait for service - as were all the bars thoughout the Hotel.The entertainment was good - you have to remember that it is provided by the Hotel's own entertainment team - and they work hard and do their best - well done to them all!!! Joseph is lovely -such a gentle person.I did the Monster Trucks excursion and that was really worthwhile - and gave me a chance to see the real Dominican Republic.Well done Dreams - another wonderful holiday experience.
