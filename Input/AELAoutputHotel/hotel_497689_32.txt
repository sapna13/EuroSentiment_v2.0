{"text":"Gorgeous hotel. Patchy service My boyfriend booked the Soho as a romantic treat for us. The idea was that we'd check in, order feasts from room service, get into bed and not surface again for 24 hours. We wanted romance, privacy and sleeeeep. This didn't happen. First, however, the good stuff: this hotel is one of the most stunning I've ever seen. The room was enormous - I mean really, really enormous - with gorgeous furnishings (although I was surprised they didn't have blackout curtains - they were almost see-through), with a great big bathroom and lovely toiletries from Miller Harris. Also lovely little details like the aromatherapy rollers etc. The bar downstairs was buzzing with groovy international types, the interior design of all the rooms downstairs is stunning, and the reception was charming. The bad stuff:1. Room service food was seriously unexceptional. The menu is very impressive, but the food wasn't up to scratch - especially breakfast. A small bowl of congealed, cold porridge, a scattering of fruit salad and three pieces of cold dry toast is not what you expect for √ä√£¬¢18. General attention to detail was ordinary, ie, a very small pot of milk to share between the porridge, a bowl or muesli and two large cafetieres of coffee.2. We got two automated wakeup calls that we hadn't asked for. At 8am. And then at ten past 8am. So much for sleeping in all morning.3. Room service knocked on the door loudly and shouted something unintelligble at us every twenty minutes from 10am. Couldn't they just find out once we've checked out? So much for privacy.4. The bed was two singles pushed together, and there was no way you could cuddle across them - the middle was hard as wood. We had to sleep far apart, holding hands across the bed. So much for romance.I am sure this is an unusual experience as everyone else loves it so much. But for a √ä√£¬¢500 night away, I expect more.
