{"text":"An excellent hotel,  We are just back from 4 nights at the Hotel Estherea. It is an outstanding hotel. It is beautifully decorated and extremely well run. The hotel staff is very helpful. Some of them might be a little formal, but all tried their best to help us in any way they could, from getting dining reservations to having a room for us when we arrived at 7 am - amazing! The location was unbeatable - no matter where we wanted to go in the city, it was an easy walk. We finally took the tram the last night, just for the experience. We had a double without the canal view, but it was very spacious. The bathroom, though small, was both spotless, and well equipped. The price was very fair. Even with the sad state of the dollar, it average the same as a recent stay at the San Diego Embassy Suites. I can't thank all the reviewers enough for all the great information that they have given in their reviews. They helped make our trip go smoothly. From needing our credit card pin number to get the train tickets from the airport to finding the Gollum - a neat brown cafe -your advice was invaluable. I strongly recommend reading all the reviews you can- I felt so comfortable choosing restaurants and finding places - like the advice from about 25 close friends!Don't hesitate trying the Luden - just around the block. The food was terrific, reasonably priced, especially in the Brasserie in the front,and felt like being in Paris. The Cafe Luxembourg was also fun, and just a little further down the street. The soups and fries were especially good. The hotel's location near so many great restaurants is just icing on the cake. We tried the hotel breakfast, and it was very good, but also crowded because they were full while we were there. So we only ate there once. Broodje Bert on the corner serves a bargain full breakfast or just a roll if you want, simple but fun to sit down and watch the world go by in front of you while sipping your coffee.Yes, we had a wonderful time. The weather was cold and rainy - it even snowed. But it didn't matter, we had such a good time in Amsterdam - we recommend it highly- and everyone spoke English!
