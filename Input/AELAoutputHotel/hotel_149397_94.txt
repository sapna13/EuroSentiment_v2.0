{"text":"Worst service I've ever had Just returned from 5 days at the Bavaro Princess Resort.We have travelled extensively around the world and a lot in the Carribean. We love to mix with locals when possible and really enjoy the culture. Unfortunately, Punta Cana does not make that very feasible. The place is filthy dirty, runned down and generally not safe for tourists. The grounds of the resort were very nice, however really needed better upkeep. The rooms were in dire need of upgrade renovations.The resort offered a Platinum Package which Vacations to Go were not aware of. However I was able to negotiate that when I arrived. The package gives you access to premium liquors (or all they have is no name brands) it allows you free internet access, slipper and robes in your room and clean beach towels delivered to your room daily. Also entrance to the specialty restaurants for free. (normally a fee of $30.00 per person)It also gives you a private butler on the beach...or just someone to take your orders so you don't have to keep going up to the bar\/restaraunt.We did not recieve the slippers, robes or beach towels until our last night! There was no Premium Liquor. They only had 2 brand name liquor and 1 brand name beer Corona at any given time and they were sold out by 2 in the afternoon. So we never did have premium liquor. The free entrance to the specialty restaruant was allocated to us at by a date determined by the resort...and in our case fell on the day before we recieved our vouchers...then when we tried to re-book the restaurant was closed to private functions. ( how pathetic). I never saw a server on the beach once and we were on the beach from 8:00 to 4:00 everyday. The cost to the upgrade was $35.00 per person per night. It is a must that both people in room pay the cost. It cost me 285.00 for nothing. I was very disappointed. Also out of the 50 people working at the resort. Only 2 spoke english. No one at any bar or restaurant spoke english at all. We tried every night to order wine...there was a list for those who wanted to pay extra. The first night we ordered...they came back to us after we finisheddinner with a different bottle saying they were out of what we ordered but that this was similar. We order a differnt bottle every night of our 4 night stay and ended up getting the same stand in bottle as apparently they don't really have a wine list...just a facade.Other than the fact the beach was very nice and water was great. It was a poor excuse for a resort. I would never go back. There were less than desireable people occupying the resort which I'm not at liberty to describe due to content control of this website. In my opinion they don't deserve a tourist industry.
