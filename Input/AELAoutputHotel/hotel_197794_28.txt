{"text":"Slept Well at the Black Tulip Hi we just found this website so we will be entering the six vacations we have taken of the past 3 and a half years. Small boutique hotel that was not very far from the train station. Others had told us that the rooms in Amsterdam were small and the were correct it was. We only stayed two nights and went on to Paris. I think the two fellows that were the staff also owned this hotel. We had been in London for four days before getting here and all we did the first day was sleep. the second day we went to the museums and the Anne Frank house.The hotel is okay but I guess you have to get used to different things when you travel. The bed was comfortable and it was mostly quiet. The hot water was very hot and you need to be careful not to be burned. We had breakfast once and it was fine. We really can't say anything negative or anything great about this hotel it was average in quality. Didn't realize that it had a theme but it didn't matter to use as we mostly want a quiet room so we can sleep. We have been back to Amsterdam once since this vacation and will enter that review soon. We are glad we found this website and wish we would have found it four years ago when we retired and started to go on one to two vacations a year. ","annotations":[]}
