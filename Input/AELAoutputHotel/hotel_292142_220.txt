{"text":"Very satisfied The staff at the Affinia Dumont could not be more friendly and try very hard to be helpful. I stayed here with my husband and two teenagers in a one bedroom suite. We had a wonderful time with plenty of space for the four of us, especially for New York. The beds were very comfy and we liked having the choice from 6 different types of pillows. All our requests were met with ease and efficiency including room service (which was just fine but there are definitely better options in the neighborhood) to an extra blanket to a dvd player in the living roomWe would definitely stay here again. We had a room on the river side on the 22nd floor and it was nice and quiet and the view decent. There was a small dog that yapped quite a bit, somewhere near us but it did not bother us enough to complain. The kitchen had a microwave and a full size refrigerator, which was great to have. There is also a full set of dishes and silverware. The gym was a little disappointing as this is billed as a fitness hotel. The spa treatment area was probably nicer than many hotels but the workout area was suitable but not great. If you only use cardio machines you are all set but if you want to use weight equipment this is just okay. Try the running routes from the map from the front desk - this was great fun. The Murray Hill area has a lot of restaurants and is a more residential area so it is a little less hectic than other areas. We enjoyed going to La Giara (3rd), Artisanal (Park) and RIce (Lexington) all in the vicinity of the hotel. The hotel was completely full the three nights we stayed but there was never any problems with this. We will come back again. ","annotations":[]}
