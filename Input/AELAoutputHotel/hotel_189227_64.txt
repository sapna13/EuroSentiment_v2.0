{"text":"Very close to perfect I will tell you what I was looking for and I think you will see that the Hotel de L'Abbaye Saint-Germain came very close to being perfect. My husband prefers a 5 star hotel that has American type amenities like a stall shower and big screen TVs. My daughter and I don't care about the stars, we want something with personality, charm and lots of nearby strolling opportunities. We booked two rooms - one standard, which had two twin beds and a bath with handheld shower. Very charming, very comfortable - a little roomier than the European standard. The other room was a suite and it was just huge! It was actually a duplex with one floor having a small parlor with TV, couch, easy chair, desk and a full bath with tub and shower stall. The upstairs had a very roomy bedroom, queen size bed, half bathroom (just a toilet \/sink) and a terrace that looked over the courtyard with two chairs and a table. Charming!!!! And the bathroom turned out to be my husband's favorite ever - heated floor in the shower, real water pressure, gorgeous marble. Not to mention that all TVs were large, flat panel. I heartily agree with previous posts that mention how very special the service is, on this level they can compete with any 5 star. And the public spaces for breakfast \/ evening cocktail \/ relaxation are great too. One very small criticism - the beds were just average in terms of comfort. The mattresses were quite firm and the sheets had that starched feeling, something I thought had gone out of style a long time ago. We had stayed at a Sofitel in Dijon the night before and while that is a very businessy hotel, the beds were incredible. Since Sofitel sells these mattresses through a brochure, I would suggest that the L'Abbaye grab a few of them ASAP.Well worth the price, even the upgrade cost for the suite.
