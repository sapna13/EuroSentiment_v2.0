{"text":"Becareful of vendors (fake cigars) I would like to share our feeling about the Grand Oasis Punta Cana. Firstly i would go back to this hotel anytime. Food was very good, hotel was good, and service was good. Obviously it could get better, but the resort is pretty good.We stayed in room 5307. block 5, 3rd floor. The room was nice, 2 queen beds and nice bathroom, very high ceilings and space. The buffets was great, good al-carte restaurants. beach and pool was very good.My problem or warning to anybody going to this or any resort, is BE CAREFUL OF THE VENDORS THAT COME TO THE RESORT TO SELL, CIGARS BRACELETS, RINGS AND SO ON.We purchased Cigars Montecristo #1 a box of 25 and found out later they were fake! There was only 24 cigars inside and the green label was not real and obviously the cigars were not as well. If your going to buy cigars from these people that come to the hotel with green shirts and love to use the calculator, make SURE YOU KNOW WHAT TYPE OF CIGARS YOU ARE BUYING! If you don't you are going to get SCREWED!, THEY START at a very high price and will come down, if you keep to your lowest price. There prices are way to high, ex. for the whole kit of bracelet, necklace and earings with the dominican stone, MAX 35$ usd, DON'T PAY MORE BECAUSE YOU'LL BE SCREWED.! THE CIGARS, ASK TO OPEN THEM, AND MAKE SURE YOU KNOW REALLY HOW THEY ARE! AND COUNT THEM! IF THE guy refused, then don't buy them, once they are bought...its too late.Also there is acouple of shops near the grand oasis, 2 minute walk,there they will deal, if you know how to deal....REMEMBER THEY ALWAYS START AT THE CRAZY HIGH PRICE, SO you go to the lowest price and stay there, never mind about the calculator they will show you..... its a stupid pressure tactic.!Remember don't buy cigars from them, unless you know ABOUT CIGARS!, most of the time they are fake!, open the box and see and count them,The whole jewelry kit with the Domincan stone 35$ max or lower!Go to the flee market, 2 minute walk and deal!Forget about buying anything at the airport, its too expensive, buy the liquor at the flee market, for the Canadians (Montreal) becareful, buy the liquor at the duty free, they may not have it available in the plane or at the flee market, unless you want to buy Dominican rum, which is good!Good luck and remember don't get screwed, deal and know what your buying!Remember your the one with the dollars, not them!
