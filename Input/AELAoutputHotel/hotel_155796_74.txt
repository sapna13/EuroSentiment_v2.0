{"text":"Less than Impressed We were in Fajardo for approximately 4 days. Certainly, there is a lot to do in this area. The hotel is central enough to be able to do all these activities, although keep in mind, although they advertise that they are close to the beach, they certainly are not. You require a car at all times to get around - beach, sightseeing, restaurants.The rooms were clean and satisfactory. The restaurant was also good. Its menu was varied and reasonably priced for the level we went to. However, we were repulsed, though, by the attitude by the barmen. We sat ourselves at the bar, for about 15 minutes. There may have been 4 other people in the entire bar. We were completely ignored despite multiple attempts to make eye contact. Others were being served the minute they came up to the bar. When we finally opened our mouth, and attempted to order a very simple drink, we were advised that they could not facilitate that. Certainly, it prompted both of us to leave expeditiously, and never return. We refuse to pay money in a place that would treat us with anything but respect. The managers of this bar and the hotel should be advised that such behavior is unacceptable.Would we stay at Fajardo inn again - probably not. There were a few such episodes with the staff. Unfortunately they seem to have a monopoly in that area as the only other reputable place was El Conquistador - which, after speaking to a variety of other tourists, were less than impressed with their expensive stay there.
