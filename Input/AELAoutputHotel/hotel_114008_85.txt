{"text":"Lovely Honeymoon, but intimidating.. After spending many years visiting Hawaii and staying with my aunt in Hawaii Kai, my honeymoon was my first stay in a hotel, (other than Turtle Bay), in Oahu. It was a lovely experience, beautiful beach, nice room - with comfy king size bed and gorgeous view over the golf course. Plus we were upgraded on arrival due to it being our honeymoon - and knowing our travel agent had connections there!! I was apprehensive about the hotel due to many 'bad reviews' on trip advisor, but i knew the Kahala was set in a gorgeous area and on its own private beach. My fiancee chose the Kahala after learning we could swim with dolphins there..Overall, we loved the hotel - especially the dolphins and the experience of swimming with them - but felt quite intimidated by the restaurant prices, price of hiring equipment, internet etc.... We were treated to our honeymoon accomodation at the Kahala as a gift from family, and felt deserving of the experience, but sometimes felt like we were out of our league due to intimidating prices and patrons. We were thankful to have our car in which we could drive to local restaurants, the Kalaha Mall, and even up to Koko Marina in Hawaii Kai...I also struggled to make it to the lobby by 8:30am for my free cup of tea or coffee! The lack of coffee\/tea making facilities in our room was disappointing.All in all we loved our time at the Kahala, and would recommend it.. But as a relaxed, young Aussie couple not wanting to spend hundred's of $$$$$$$$ each day, maybe only spend a night or two here before moving onto another island or resort.. We headed to Turtle Bay and relaxed completely once there...
