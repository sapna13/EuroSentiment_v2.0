{"text":"Wow, what a fantastic hotel We stayed at the Afinia in late June and were lucky enough to have a corner room on the 34th floor with views of the East river and the Chrysler Building. We often use Trip Advisor to help choose a hotel and I think the reviews here are fair. The hotel itself is good, the rooms are big, the beds are comfy and it is useful to have a kitchen area if not just for the huge fridge. The real reason to stay here is the location, it is great. A couple of blocks further up 34th and you start entering the hustle and bustle of the city, however it is relatively calm in the hotels district. There are countless restaurants and bars all within walking distance and having a Duane Reed across the street helps. We ate at the Barking dog, once for breakfast and once in the eve. The breakfast was OK however the evening meal was not up to much. Beware if you sit outside as water drips off the top of the building even if it isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ raining and the staff seemed adamant that the customers were crazy! With all of the choice just outside the hotel the Barking dog should really be given a miss √à√\u2020\u2022?go to Penelope√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ instead if you want the freshest and tastiest food for both breakfast and dinner! Some people have commented on noise, and yes there are a few ambulances in particular because of the two big hospitals that are just down the road. All I can say is that if you think this is noisy go stay in a central hotel and then compare it!All in all the hotel itself is very nice, the staff very helpful and yes the room is a little dated, but you know what, every thing worked and was spotlessly clean. The location is the main reason to stay here. We will stay again! ","annotations":[]}
