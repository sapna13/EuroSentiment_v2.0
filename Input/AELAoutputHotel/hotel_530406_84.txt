{"text":"Ocean Sand is our favourite My husband and 6 year old son were at Ocean Sand from Dec. 20th to the 27th and we enjoyed it very much. We ended up at Ocean Sand after having to cancel our booking at Colony Bay because the resort wasn't ready.We have absoluetely no complaints about the ocean sand. I had emailed the resort prior to arriving and we got upgraded to the Elite Club however we had a room facing the back of the resort. Having arrived at 3:00am because of airplane problems, we went to bed. The next morning I spoke with the Manager Joel who was very accomodating. At 3:00^pm the bell boy was moving us to a perfect room (the 2nd from the end of the building closest to the beach) with a pool and ocean view. We were in building 10 on the Ocean Sand side room 10204 and it had an amazing view!!! The room was always very clean and very spacious with lots of dressers and closet space to put your clothes away. As for the lighting I have no complaints, it is a bit on the dim side however it is fine.This is our third time to Punta Cana therefore the beach is as amazing as ever. At Ocean Sands the pools are also amazing. Two huge pools with lots of chairs and umbrellas. We were there over Christmas and even if the resort was at capacity we never had a problem finding a lounging chair at the pool or at the beach. Yes there are some tiles missing in the pools and it will eventually need repaired however it is not cause for complaint. The only complaint we have is not with the resort or it's workers. The people are genuine, friendly and always gave us excellent service. The complaint is with some of the tourists who visit these places and unfortunately I must say it was a Torontonian!! At the pool bar, there was a young man (maybe early 20's) who parked himself on the stool at 9:00 am drinking, using absolutely foul language, loud, but to top it off at 2:00pm still there, at this point having a hard time standing and spitting in the pool several times. That is absolutely disgusting and disgraceful!!!The food to our opinion was very good. The buffet breakfast was excellent. For lunch we always at the beach grill and yes it was repetitive but always good. (Salads, french fries, fresh burgers and hot dogs, pizza and lots more) which is perfect for lunch! Dinners, this is the part that we quite enjoyed. You do not reserve your a la carte restaurants, you just show up and you can go as often as you like. The Mexican was good but don't expect the same Tacos or fajitas like they are made at home. The Italian and Dominican were excellent and the American was quite nice to have somewhat of a copy of American foods. The longest we had to wait to get into a restaurant was about 10 minutes but we always tried to go for dinner in between 6:30 and 7:00pm. They seemed to be busier after but who cares, you are on vacation!!!! They have little tables outside to sit and wait till they call your name, go to the Lobby Bar and get a drink! Cheers!The Lobby bar is awesome, big and comfortable!!! It's quite refreshing to be able to get premium liquors at pretty much any bar. They had Grand Marnier, Bayleys, Corona , Bacardi.They have tons of activities for kids, teens and adults if you want to participate. We did not go to the bowling alley but heard it was good. I did a beach massage which was well worth it.They have about 5 or 6 staff photographers that go around the resort and take pictures. We booked a session with them and got awesome family pictures all around the resort, dressed in nice clohes and then beach shots....what a wonderful souvenir.As said previously this was our 3rd time to Punta Cana. We had stayed at the Bahia Principe and the Punta Cana Princess. The size of the Ocean Sands, the service, the food, the pools and activities have made it our favourite and we are contemplating returning again.PS. I do have another complaint and I will post it in the forum. It is in regards to the amount of garbage that travellers leave at the Punta Cana airport. Go read it and keep it going!
