{"text":"Riu Bambu needs new beds Awesome beachLoved the resort - only complaint were the hardness of the beds and the rock pillows. Heard this from other people too so wasn't just our rooms. We also needed an extra bed as there were three people in our room - they gave me a single bed that sagged in the middle. Really was not up to our expectations for a 5 star resort. The others travelling with us had very little air conditioning in their room throughout the week. Food was the typical all-inclusive - and we've been to plenty of them. Breakfast was good and dinner had no complaints. Lunch needs to be varied more - same every day - but typical of everywhere else we have stayed. A la carte restaurants were mediocre - buffet is better for dinner. If you want a bar\/snackbar on the beach this is not the place for you - there wasn't one. Bathrooms are also back at the main complex. Found the pool too small and crowded for the size of the resort. Both my daughters got a mysterious rash and I suspect it might have been from the pool. Lots of palm trees and shade though - always a good thing - but hard to find a chair unless you get up before 7:00 a.m. Day trips we booked through the Sunquest agent were not worth the money. Don't go deep sea fishing. For $90 they put you on a rickety boat for 4 hours - suckng in diesel fumes - and didn't catch a thing. Not fun.We were lucky to have a room close to the main lobby - make sure you ask or you will end up in the back forty and it's pretty far. Overall, despite the above, we had a good time and would consider going back if they fix the beds.
