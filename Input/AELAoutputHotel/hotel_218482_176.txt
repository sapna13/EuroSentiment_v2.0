{"text":"Okay for the price. Penny from CalgaryWe stayed at this resort from Jan. 10 - 17 \/08. After having read the reviews previous to booking, I was pretty well expecting the type of quality of resort it was for the amount we paid per person.It's about a 31\/2 star by Canadian standards. Rooms were okay and they were clean but the hotel is older and it shows in the bathrooms. But we didn't stay much in the room so it wasn't a big problem. We had our fridge filled and fresh towels most days and when I didn't get as I had requested a call to housekeeping brought them fairly quickly.I didn't find the staff very friendly either. We were in Cuba last year and I found the Cubans a very happy bunch while the D.R. staff were not as friendly and as noted by others did not smile often or even say hola when you greeted them with it. Tipping didn't seem to make any difference and I got the impression that the items we left for the housekeeping staff plus tips were just expected.Food was not great. Breakfast was pretty good but I tended to live on chicken, pasta and salads otherwise. Beach buffet has good chicken, chips and decent hamburgers although I agree it is not well stocked or staffed.We attended the Mexican, Japanese and French resturants.The Mexican was okay, the Japanese was good and was fun but the French one was very poor. Terrible service (none after we had got our food and couldn't even get more wine as the waiterdidn't come back to offer anymore.) and the food was not great.My husband and I ordered the lobster after having people from the UK at the Japenese resturant the previous evening telling us how wonderful it was. We don't know what it was but it didn't look or taste like an lobster we eat in Canada. It had a very strange mushy texture to it and it had been baked to death. My son had a bacon wrapped tenderloin and although he said it wasn't what we would get at home, he was satisfied with it.We did do the Bavaro Runners tour and it was fun. Our tour guide was very good and we tipped him heavily.The beach was good. Yes some seaweed and maybe could have been swept and cleaned more often but all in all we had no complaints about it. But you do have to get up early (by 8 am) andput towels out or you will never get a covered spot.Grounds are well kept and hotel looks good otherwise. The lobby bar was always busy and had great coffee and danishes every moring also. Had a nice little shopping strip also if you ddn't want to go to the flea markets. Could pick up small souvenirs here for a reasonable price.If you're wanting a cheaper holiday and don't mind an older hotel and are not a real picky eater this will do you fine.I don't think we'll go back to this resort again but will certainly go back to Punta Cana.
