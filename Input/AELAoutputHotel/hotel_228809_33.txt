{"text":"Just as we expected Our family of 6 (2 grandparents, 2 adults, 2 children) stayed here in early July for 5 nights. We had 2 rooms. One was a club room for 2, and the second room was a Suite for 4, which had a separate bedroom and a livingroom with a pull out sofa. The suite had less streat noise. I believe that all the suites face the rear courtyard which is quiter.The hotel and rooms were very clean and nicely renovated. The bathrooms were very nice. There is a small elevator to bring up the suitcases when checking in or checking out. Otherwise we used the stairs. As is common to most Paris hotels in this category, the walls are thin. We expected this and came prepared with earplugs. Without earplugs, we were able to hear people talking in other rooms and doors opening and closing in the hallways late into the night. With earplugs it was no problem at all. We definitely recommend bringing earplugs.The front desk staff were all very helpful and pleasant. They all spoke excellent english, and did not seem to mind speaking english instead of french. Lily was especially nice to us, and made us feel very welcome. She gave us good information regarding which restaurants in the area were good with children, and the location of grocery stores. She provided us with a kettle, cups, plates, and some utensils, so we were able to make instant coffee and tea in the rooms, and prepare snacks for the kids. They allowed us to use the fridge to hold our own drinks and food, rather than using it as a minibar. This made the hotel much more functional for us. We were able to bring in breakfast and save a lot of money. Instead we spent money on eating out for dinner.The location of the hotel was very good. It was a very close walk to Arc de Triomphe and the Charles de Gaulle Etoile Metro Station (Wagram exit). It was also a very short walk to the Air France shuttle stop on Ave Carnot, which took us to CDG Airport at the end of our stay. You can take this shuttle irrespective of what airline you are flying with.The streets in the area seem pretty safe, although it is important to use common sense. We did see some homeless people on Ave de Wagram, as well as youth hanging out into the night. Pickpockets are present in most tourist areas, so consider using a money belt and avoid taking out your wallet on streets and metro.Overall, we were quite pleased with this hotel for our vacation in Paris.Enjoy your trip.
