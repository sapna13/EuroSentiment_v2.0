{"text":"poor value, good location The Dylan has a wonderful location, within walking distance of almost everything you'd want to go to and nestled in the interesting 9 Streets area. There is a lot of staff, ranging in competence from very high to very low, generally coolly impersonal but always polite and attempting to accommodate clients' needs - from printing out documents to getting train information. Internet access is available in the rooms at no charge. There are nice towels, robes, slippers, and toiletries. The hotel is highly designed - actually, so highly designed as to be contrived. It has enough drawbacks that I'd advise booking a different hotel if the price to quality ratio matters.The hotel is in love with the colors terra cotta and black. Black works well in rooms that are large and get a fair amount of sunlight. It works badly in small rooms with little natural light. But the hotel uses the same palette regardless of size and light availability.I occupied 3 rooms over a 4-day period. Two of them were luxury singles (19 and 6); they should be avoided. At 325 euros, they are exceptionally poor value.One room was a double (41, in the new annex) and was excellent, with a few qualifications: no bedside reading lights, no tub, a soiled slipcover on a chair, a window very difficult to raise and lower, only a single small ledge in the shower enclosure. Those may sound like significant qualifications but they are minor compared to the problems with the luxury singles.Number 19 is on the small side; the walls are painted with deep horizontal bands of terra cotta and black and curtained with a heavy material using vertical terra cotta and black stripes. The curtains puddle on the floor but are so heavy that instead of puddling they drape in an ungainly fashion. The bed is a fourposter. The room is overpowered by the furniture, which also includes two rattan armoire-type cabinets flanking the bathroom. But the real problems with the room were a toilet that flushed very sluggishly, finding 3 squares of toilet paper a trial; flaking paint in the bathtub where the shower attached to the wall; a shower curtain that was dirty at the bottom; light switches that could only be reached by sliding one's hand between the wall and the armoire; a television that faced a bedside table instead of the bed; a door to the bathroom which could not be slid shut because it ran into one of the armoires.The staff apologized and courteously put me in another room - 41, a double - when I asked for one that was more comfortable. That room wore its black and white theme well, got copious sunshine, and was spacious.Because someone else had booked 41 I moved again to a luxury single, number 6. This room seemed even smaller than 19, appeared cheaply furnished, and was extremely depressing because of all the black and the absence of natural light. Here too the toilet labored.An odd feature of the tubs is a marble ledge which runs around them. The ledge is nice, because you can put things on it. But if you want to lie in the tub for a good soak, you have a problem with that ledge which juts out over the back of the tub. A doubled-over towel ameliorates but doesn't completely solve the problem. This is one of many small examples of overdesign that reduces comfort.The buffet breakfast was 25 euros and was tasty, if overpriced. It is very easy to eat in the neighborhood instead.
