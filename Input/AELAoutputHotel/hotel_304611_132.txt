{"text":"Good Hotel, nice location I stood 4 nights at the Royal Plaza on Scotts in end July 2007. I'm coming since quite some years to Singapore and I have found my favorite hotel here already (and I didn't change my mind after this stay) - but this time I thought its time to try somthing else. The Royal Plaza location is very good, more or less in the center of Orchard road - just a few steps out of the hotel and you are in the middle of this shopping street. Even though after years I have discovered that nothing is cheap here. At least there are probably few places in the world where you have such a high rate of premium brand stores. Walking on Orchard is simply a good entertainment, even if you buy nothing. So this I consider as a big plus. Food: of course the hotel has a restaurant but on Orchard you find many more. I prefer Hawker food - which are these nice little boothes where you can order many dishes and share with your friends - and the best of it: outside with no aircondition! That Hawker food is typically less expensive and quite original is the other plus. So staying in Scotts you can easily walk either to a newly built Hawker center on Orchard - just follow the road down to the center of Singapore and you find it shortly after the visitor center on the left or you simply follow Scotts road down to Newton Circle - there is one of the most famous Hawker places in SG - but typically very crowded with tourists. For more original good food you better sit in a taxi and ask the taxi driver for more locations. I also like the Old Market very much which is in the business district. An old market hall from the early 1900's. Now lets talk about the hotel: checkin and the service are excellent and much above the standard. Very friendly and competent. The hotel itself looks every time I go there like just been build. I guess constant renovation is the key. The rooms itself are very tiny. The bathroom was my highlight: I don't like having a shower in the bathtub - I want a real shower and this is what you get here. Even the bathroom is very small, it has a nice and big shower with a real glas door to it where you can simply enjoy the morning. The rest of the room by the way is unspectacular. Nicely equipped to a high standard, with plat panel screen attached to the wall. But the most important: a high speed internet access for free. The free minibar you can forget about: 2 little water, 2 beer, 4 soft drinks. I only had water and 2 is in a location like SG simply too less. So I still have to buy it outside and carry it in the hotel.The pool and the gym: I didn't use both, because I had too less time. But I checked the pool area and I have to admid that it is ok, but much bejond my favorite hotel in SG. The pool is small, the pooldeck is even smaller and you have no view over Singapore. For just a bit of swimming ok, but not for spending there a full day.The breakfast: this is really good and can compete with my favorite one. But one big disadvantage: no pork! I like to have bacon in the morning, but here they either serve beef or turkey bacon - both not my tast. Beside this the food is excellent! Lots of egg choises and they make that fresh for you. The best waffles and pancakes I ever had in a hotel (of course at home that's better ;-). Fruits, salats, bread, cerials etc - as much as you like. And not to forget the asian bar with stuff what we consider as dinner. I can eat that for breakfast as well and it was so good! Most obvious I put on some weight :-)Finally I was very pleased with this hotel and by sure I will come back here. But even with this wonderful experience I do not change my favorite hotel in Singapore because of the nicer pool. But for just being there over the week where I have to work most of the time anyhow, this will be my clear choise in the future.
