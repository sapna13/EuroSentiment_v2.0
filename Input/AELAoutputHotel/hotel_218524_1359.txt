{"text":"We had a great time My husband, I and another couple stayed at Secrets Nov. 12-19, 2006. We left out of St. Louis thru Apple Vacations. Check in and flight USA3000 out of St. Louis was great. We landed Punta Cana, right on time. Getting the tour card and luggage was easy just follow the crowd. The trip to hotel was what everyone had said bumpy and educational. Stopped at Sunscape to let people off and then on to Secrets. Check in was fast and easy and our room was ready at check-in. We were offered an upgrade for cheaper than what you get upon first making your reservations. So if you are thinking about upgrading, wait until you check-in you'll save some money. We had room 5203 over looking the cascading pool and it was great! The grounds are just beautiful lush and green. The animals add a nice touch. I think we hit all the restaurants except the Dominican one and thought the food was good. There was always something to eat, I would not say any meal was the best I have ever had but everything was good. After talking to many people on our plane who stayed else where, I have come to the conclusion the the food is the same, just good. I believe this to be true for the entire Island you are in a third world country and if you didn't notice on your trip in you where probably sleeping. I loved the soft brown sand and the beach with no high rise condo's. There is no trash, (except what is left by the people from the resort), and no seaweed. Secrets seems to have been built in the middle of a coconut grove it is beautiful. The staff was excellente, we always had great service all over the resort and never had to wait at any of the restaurants for very long. It did rain everyday at sometime of another, but they had things going on in the Theater if it was raining. We did the outback safari and that too was very educational. Our tour guide Luis knew more about the USA, than we did. We stopped at a ranch and had lunch that was good also. We seen Nancy at shack #6 and bought some things from her, the vendor at the hotel can be pushy, but if you tell them no, they will leave you alone. They also had some neat stuff. Hubby went to casino, and lost a little. I was never sick at all the whole time. Hubby had some trouble one day, but he has a very puny stomach, he gets this at home after eatting anything spicy. I called home using the rented cell phones at Secrets internet cafe for $5, and the calling card was $10 for 21 mins. The day we had to leave was very organized and the staff came out and hugged us all before we had to leave I thought that was wonderful, but depressing. We did not run into one staff member that was rude, every single staff member was always willing to please! As for the drinks, the drink of the day may be a little weak, but if you ask for something specific like pineapple juice and malibu, Jack and coke, you got 3\/4 booze and a splash of the rest. The wine was good also. If I you have any question respond in the forums, I'll try to answer all of them. Sorry if I have left anything out, I tried to cover everything. I don't understand all the bad reviews. I did not run into anybody that was upset or having a terrible time. You make your vacation not the resort ","annotations":[{"endOffset":806,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":802},{"endOffset":1927,"mention":"ranch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ranch_dressing"],"startOffset":1922},{"endOffset":1927,"mention":"ranch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ranch_dressing"],"startOffset":1922},{"endOffset":2863,"mention":"coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":2859}]}
