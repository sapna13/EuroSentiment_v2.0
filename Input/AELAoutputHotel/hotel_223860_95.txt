{"text":"Beautiful resort My husband and I were at this beautiful resort for 2, all too short days, for a conference he attended May 9 - 11. While my husband attended meetings I floated in a tube in the lazy river pool (and I was certainly not the only adult in the lazy river pool). This property is absolutely stunning, gorgeous grounds, tastefully decorated rooms and a bathroom I wish I had in my own home (marble, granite and travertine). The beds were comfy, though I would have preferred firmer pillows.Neither my husband nor I found the hotel staff to be snotty or rude as another reviewer mentioned. Everyone we encountered was helpful and friendly. The concierge even gave us a much better suggestion for transportation back to the airport (and made the reservation for us as well) than what we were originally planning to do.We took SuperShuttle from PHX to the hotel for $19 p\/p. A little time was wasted in making various stops within the airport to pick up more passengers and then having to stop at another hotel to drop someone off, but this is the nature of SuperShuttle. However, the driver was quite competent. But for our return to the airport we took TransStyle Limousine for $22 p\/p. It's a town car that takes just 4 people. We were at the airport in 20 minutes.One other convenient (and free) perk was that you could print out your airline boarding passes at a computer in the lobby near the front desk. The computer only prints boarding passes, but for about 20 airlines. We appreciated this convenience.Food at the hotel: the restaurants are pricey, as one would expect them to be at an upscale property. My husband brought me breakfast from the spread at his meeting, but I did have lunch at the pool one day. I thought the prices were reasonable ($12 for a very large and filling spinach salad and $5 for a smoothie). I had seen other people's orders and knew, before I ordered my lunch, that the portions were plentiful.For dinner we took the complimentary shuttle to the Desert Ridge shopping\/dining\/entertainment complex across the street from the property (the property is large and also encompasses the Marriott Vacation Club, so the shuttle is necessary). There were many good dining choices with many price ranges at Desert Ridge.My only disappointment was some of the equipment in the fitness center. My husband and I are both gym rats, and we both love the elliptical trainer. Some are better than others and the ones at this Marriott were not good at all. Very awkward and uncomfortable to use, so ended up running on the treadmills (which were quite good and had personal TV's with complimentary earphones).Though we were here for a short conference, I would definitely consider returning for a long weekend sometime, perhaps even a sisters\/girlfriends trip. It's perfect for that.
