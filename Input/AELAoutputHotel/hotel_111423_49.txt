{"text":"Cream of the Crop - The Eliot Hotel SUPERB in every way.....My husband and I had never been to Boston and we were absolutely thrilled with our choice of the Eliot Hotel. His business conference was next door at the Harvard Club, which was perfect. But the best part for me was the proximity I had to the entire city for 3 days while he had meetings. We stayed an additional 2 days to enjoy Boston on our own and LOVED the city and the Eliot Hotel! Our one bedroom KING suite was outstanding....we had 3 large windows, as our room was on the corner of Commonwealth\/Mass Ave. and our suite was huge. We knew the bathroom was likely NOT going to be large, by others accounts-which was fine, but it was a gorgeous suite, lovely fabrics, very cozy\/comfortable bed with lovely sheets\/duvet\/pillows, and the closet space was immense, as well as our foyer with wet bar. We ordered room service coffee each morning, which was wonderful, although a coffee maker in the room would be welcomed. We had the BEST service I believe we've ever experienced in a hotel....the staff knew who we were, along with the bellman, who hailed a cab for us several times....and the staff was always eager to please, but they were not annoying in the least....just the opposite. The e-mail contacts I had with various staff members was so helpful, prior to our arrival. Everyone went out of their way to make our stay special.....and we loved the entire experience. We were able to walk to Fenway for a RedSox game one night, hop the train one block away, walk to Newbury Street for shopping\/coffee\/meals whenever we liked, and we always felt safe too. What is not to like about this hotel!!! We strongly recommend booking a one bedroom suite, as we loved the additional space vs. a regular room. Other reviews mention the noise - but traffic is something you cannot prevent in a location like this, so you have to put up with that. We will always recommend this hotel to anyone we know traveling to Boston!
