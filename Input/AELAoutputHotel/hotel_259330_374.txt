{"text":"Read reviews and listen to advice  Where to begin√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>The reviews were correct in saying this place has a beautiful beach. The waves were very high for most of the stay but really warm waters and clean beach. I had a great time in the waves. Let me also say I am not a complainer. I make the best of anything and did the same with this trip but after traveling down the beach and seeing what others offered I would hate to see someone waste their money like I did or have it stolen by the maid like I did. (which by the way the hotel did not even acknowledge and anyone I tried to talk to about this pretended they couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak English all of a sudden even though they were just talking to me in English) I had no way of getting any American money and was thankful I had someone who had some extra.Other then the beach this place does not have much to offer. It is tired beyond its years and not many things have been updated or repaired in a neat or timely fashion. Our room had a king sized bed that sagged in the middle and had wires sticking out. Much of the furniture had pieces missing off of it and the shower head fell off the wall and hit my fianc√ã√\u2022√ñ on the head.Food was ok√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√Æothing special, very bland. I knew this going in but many didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂\u201AÑ¢O NOT DRINK OR BRUSH TEETH with bathroom water. Tour operator made reference to seek medical attention immediately if you did.Disco was dead every night more workers in the place then guests so if you are looking for that this is not the place for you. The entertainment in my opinion was not great. It was ok but rather amateur. I expected to see a more professional show. Water activities cancelled everyday even though other resorts safely operated them. Pool was nice and clean though.The trolley that transported guests around the property was a health hazard. The fumes were bad better off to walk.BATHROOMS√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√Æo soap in a lot of the public washrooms. Many many times no toilet paper or paper towels and often the toilets didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ flush. I am sure you can imagine what that was like. The resort was not close to full either so imagine what it would be like if there were more people.There were a few really great staff members who smiled and worked very hard. Really alls it takes is a smile and an attempt to understand each other but I found either they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try or when you needed something they couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak to you even though they talked to you in very good English a few moments before. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ask for much and I tipped well.Ask anyone who was there and they will tell you the girls in the gift shop were beyond rude. They would ignore you for as long as 10-15 min and huff about what you asked them or in one case push you out of their way. I was shocked really at how they are.I would go on but I would like to say despite everything I did have a good time but that was due to the great people we met while we were there. Being able to make the best of a situation is key. I had more things happen while I was there but too much to write. I am sure anyone reading this will say I am just one of those people who picks on anything and everything and I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stress enough that I am far from that. I spent 5 days with NO money and still had fun. I believe that the only way to make things better in the future is to be honest about is wrong so they have the chance to fix it. I think though that after the many bad reviews this resort has chosen to ignore the reviews.
