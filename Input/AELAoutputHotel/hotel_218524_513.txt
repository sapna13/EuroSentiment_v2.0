{"text":"Paradise Found My girlfriend and I booked a week at the Excellence to coincide with my mum's wedding which she had arranged to have at the resort. A soon as we were let into our room we knew we were somewhere very special, from the elegant 4 poster bed to the giant 2 person jaccuzi spa in the room! We were on an all-inclusive trip and were delighted to find that the resort had a choice of 8 restraunts all with varying cuisines from French to Mexican to Pan-Asian, and were more delighted to find that the quality of the food was even more impressive than the choice! The breakfast buffet was the stuff of dreams: smoked salmon, caviar and creme cheese bagels washed down with champane was one of my firm favourites (and remember this was all-inclusive!) With 7 or so bars and a huge selection of national and international alcohol, as well as a huge variety of cocktails, the drinks continued where the food left off..Facilities were also top rate, with one of the best-equipped gyms I have ever seen, multiple tennis courts, a Spa (which isn't included) and special mention has to go to Lucas and Julio Cesa at the sports bar, we certainly enjoyed playing pool, ping pong and fuzball whilst being well watered by our favourite waiters!The resort had a great entertainment team that organised daily activities from water polo in one of the 3 swimming pools or beach volley ball on the resorts half mile private (and utterly spectacular) beach. There was also a gigantic stage\/theatre area with high quality nightly entertainment and a casino (where we managed to double our spending money!)Back to the beach... The water was rough, and on a number of days there was no swimming due to an Atlantic storm, however, the gorgeous sands, swaying palms, along with the resorts variety of hammocks, sun loungers, double beds and even 4 poster beds with curtains, easily made up for this. We had a number of lovely walks along the beach, as well as a horse ride, my mum's wedding ceremony and a private dinner where I proposed to my girlfriend under the stars, so I have verybfond memores of the place!The staff are fantastic and friendly, and the attention to detail, such as making your towels into animals and putting rose petals aound the sink, is first class. They clean your room twice a day, making your bed in the morning and turning it down in the evening, and really make you feel like a king!This is certainly top of my list of places to go back to, and I strongly recomend it to anyone else looking for a highly pampered and relaxing holiday in the sunny Carribean.
