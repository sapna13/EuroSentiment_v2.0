{"text":"Lovely! Another great Four Seasons hotel! We stayed at the Chang Mai resort for our honeymoon earlier this year, and while we preferred that particular hotel, that's not to say the Sayan resort isnt fantastic. We found the architecture at Sayan a bit bold and blocky, while the grounds at Chang Mai are more beautiful and spectacular. Nevertheless, we loved Sayan. The service is fantastic and understated, the rooms (we stayed in a suite) do the job very nicely, and the food is pretty good. As for restaurants, we tried most of the recommended names. We didnt like Mozaic particularly - we thought the dishes did not work that well and the atmosphere was rather serious\/formal. Our favourite meal was at the Amandari (just down the road from the Four Seasons), while Casa Luna was a nice spot in central Ubud. The Lotus Garden was the worst - nice view of the dances at the Palace but poor food. Kafe Batan Waru was pretty good.We did a lot of shopping for antiques and handicrafts. Generally, we found the shops outside the four seasons to be the best (for some reason much better than those in Ubud). It is true however that if you shop around you can probably find the same products a little cheaper elsewhere, but at the end of the day it's up to you whether you want to put in the extra effort. If you're staying in the one of the beach resorts in South Bali it's well worth checking some of the antique and handicraft shops in Seminyak, Kerobokan and near Jimbaran bay. Particularly worth checking out is Cempaka near the Bali Galleria near Jimbaran, plus a lot of the wholesale outlets on the same road. Cempaka is not cheap, but their mix of main comtempary crafts, furniture and ceramics were the most interesting we saw while there.
