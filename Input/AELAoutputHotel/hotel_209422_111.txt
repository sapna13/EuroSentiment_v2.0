{"text":"Great location, Well furnished Rooms, Service Levels not there yet We just returned from a nine night stay in an Executive Level ocean view room at this hotel and found the location to be great, the rooms immaculately clean and the staff professional and friendly.The location on the quieter Diamond Head side of Waikiki is on Kuhio Avenue and is a very easy walk to the beach. While not right on the beach, you also do not have the traffic and crowd noise.Rooms at this hotel are somewhat smaller than most Hilton hotels and are very well appointed with great furniture, fixtures and the Hilton trademark bedding. The bathrooms are spacious and are equally as well appointed. The decision to only have showers and not the cumbersome shower\/tub combination is more than fine with me.Surprisingly after paying for the upgraded Executive floor (32-37th floor) ocean view room you would have thought that chairs would be provided on the balconies. In order to enjoy the spectacular view of the ocean Wal-Mart came to the rescue with $9 camping type chairs that worked, but the expectations for a Hilton are much higher.As part of the Executive level of service, in addition to the higher floor locations, is a continental breakfast and evening hors d√à√\u2020\u2022?oeuvres. Management of the hotel has really messed this up.The website and the hotel explain that a temporary banquet room has been established for the Executive Lounge and another banquet room for the fitness center. The lounge has four small tables and a couple of couches. On many occasions we and others left because there was no where to sit. The room is totally inadequate for a potential of 150 or so guest.Evening hors d√à√\u2020\u2022?oeuvres are served to the entire guest in the bar area off the main lobby starting at five in the evening. On many occasions the food was gone within a matter of minutes. The management and the staff do not properly manage for the volume of guest and more importantly do not appear to be present to manage the situation.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and will consider staying on my next visit to Waikiki. I anticipate that once the refurbishing project is complete that the management can work to resolve the serve issues.Money Saving Tip #1: St-Germain bakery is located at 2301 Kuhio Avenue and has the best bakery products, custom made sandwiches, bakery style mini-pizzas and one of the best spinach quiches that I have ever had. $10 buys a great lunch for two and it is gourmet quality food to go.Money Saving Tip #2: Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget to shop Wal-Mart and Costco for Hawaiian candies, nuts and souvenirs. You can save several dollars a box on candy and nuts and find name brand T-shirts and other apparel at Costco. Wal-Mart and Costco are an easy drive from Waikiki.
