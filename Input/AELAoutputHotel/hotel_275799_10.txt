{"text":"If you like modern design you will love the W Hotel We were able to inspect this hotel operation during our last 2 days in Mexico DF, we did use a number of service in the hotel but did not stay overnight, however had the chance to inspect each Guest Room category; here is what we found:The W Hotel is very well located in Polanco next to other International 5 star hotel operations; it will take you about 30 minutes to 1 hour from the air port to the hotel. The hotel is in its 3rd year of operation, very modern dressed up and may be not for every once taste.The Front desk is fast, does handle guest request promptly, fast and efficient, the lobby bar offers all kind of international beverage, the cocktails taste very good, price value is fine, the decoration and furniture are very nice.We took lunch in their 1st floor Restaurant which also is connected to a very nice and large out door area overlooking the parts of Polanco. The food was very well presented, outstanding in taste, the service extremely friendly, very well trained and fast. The price values for both FB are perfectly in line with the product.We used their Spa for Spa Treatments; it is a very nicely decorated Spa on the 4 floor with small pool area, GYM, Temazcal and relaxing area, please note this is a City Spa and decorated with a very modern D√ã√\u2022√ñcor. The Spa Service was very good; the bar does offer health beverage very low prices, keeping the limitations of a City Spa in mind this is a very good choice.The Guest rooms are large, well decorated, fully equipped with all amenities needed and are well sound proved; again the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor is very modern however fits perfectly into the overall design concept.Looking at the over all Hotel Product, keeping all Guest Services and Standards in mind, looking at a perfect price value, the W Hotel for sure is a very good place to stay while in Mexico DF.
