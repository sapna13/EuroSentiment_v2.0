{"text":"Quality Stay! During my one week trip to Barcelona i stayed at Barcelo Sants Hotel as park of a pre-booked football package for Nou Camp home of FC Barcelona so i didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a choice of hotel so i didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really know what to expect although before my trip i knew the hotels location was extremely good as its located fairly close to the airport and also has a metro station within a 30 seconds walking distance.I read quite a few reviews and they were mixed, most of the negative comments were regarding too much noise, poor service etc. I found the staff quite competent and polite and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have any problems with any of the staff, there was no noise issues whatsover and the rooms really shocked me in a good way as they were so spacious and for around 40 euros per night too. The shower and bathroom was very well kept and cleaners made sure towels etc were replaced.This hotel is so unique because of its location which is set inside a huge mall area where there are newsagents, shops, and even restaurants (McDonalds) and cafes and a train station! Once you leave the mall area you just cross the road to get to the metro station and from there you can travel anywhere in the city within ten minutes which was fantastic.The only negative i can find for this hotel was the buffet breakfast (10 euros) which is very overpriced and over-rated, some of the food was ok but there simply wasnt enough choice so thats the one area that they need to improve on but the bottom line is i would stay here again in future and would recommend it to anyone.
