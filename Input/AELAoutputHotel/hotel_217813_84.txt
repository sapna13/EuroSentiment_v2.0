{"text":"GREAT PLACE!!! - Modern, clean, large size rooms, Free Full Breakfast +Internet Holiday Inn Express - Fishermans Wharf was a great value. I would highly recommend it. I stayed 2 nights at this hotel March 7 - 9th 2008 and the staff were very friendly, the FREE breakfast was more than I expected (biscuits+gravy, eggs, bacon, sausage, juice, bagels, cereal, pancakes), and the rooms were clean with granite countertops and a wet bar, mini fridge, and comfy beds. The last night of my stay in San Francisco I stayed in the Sheraton Fishermans Wharf which was a nice hotel but I would much rather stay at the Holiday Inn Express next visit as its breakfast are FREE and the internet was FREE plus there was a big difference in price...I saved lots of money at the Holiday Inn Express. The hotel is new and very modern, perfect for families, couples, or even the business traveler. The location is perfect as you can easily walk to everything..the cable cars, buses, and all the attractions. My suggestion is to purchase a Go San Francisco Card you pay one price about $75.00 for 3 days and it includes all the tourist attractions you can visit...museums, Palace of Fine Arts, Exploritorium, Aquarium, Wine Tours, Alcatraz, Boat Cruises, Cable Car Rides, bike rentals..and much more. Great upbeat attitude when I called the front desk and a pleasant experience checking out. I travel 3 weeks out of a month for Business and It was a home away from home.
