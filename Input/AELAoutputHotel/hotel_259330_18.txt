{"text":"Don't Go unless you have a strong stomach and Immodium!! I'll keep it short.Check in was O.K. The rooms are very sparse with no clock, night stand lights but they are clean. If you stay in the club section it has nicer rooms but it's a walk to the beach. We stayed in block 6 so it was steps to the pool and beach.Tons to do if you have kids..there is alot of activities and the Beach is really beautiful. You can walk for hours on the Beach.The resort is huge and the gardens are well maintained. The service is not like Cuba or Jamaica, some barely acknowlege you for service and that's with tipping.We were sick most of the time. We don't know if it was the food , the handling of the food??? so we didn't get to really drink. The beer was bad draft and the drinks were very ruff like they had a barrel of raw alcohol somewhere. We lost 3 days just with stomach problems which left us stuck in the room. Everyone we spoke with had the same problems and everyone had their own suggestions as what it could be???. We would not return for that reason. My system has yet settled. Definately didn't get our $$ worth of drinks or a la cartes. We only made it out one night which is not like us..we are usually out every night..Air Transat was another story..short story is there was a 3.5 hour delay leaving...plane turned back around to Punta Cana after .5 for engine problems to have all firetrucks meet our landing on the runway. They left us locked on the plane for another 3hrs..long story..bad experience.We plan on spending our $$ Jamaica Negril never again in the Dominican...
