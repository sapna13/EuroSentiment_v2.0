{"text":"So Much Fun! We got upgraded to the Palace, and it was the best vacation ever! If you are in college and looking for a good time, go here! The alcohol is kinda nasty, but we didn't care, it got us drunk. The food was not the best, but there were so many different things that you can definitely find something. The beach was gorgeous and the pools were awesome. The rooms were great. We usually started drinking at our closest bar and then would maybe hit up our little disco at the Palace. Then we we would venture out to the other bars at the other hotels. The main disco was amazing especially if you are sufficiently drunk. They play loud music and they have ladies dancing on poles. It is sometimes hard to getr a drink, but you will eventually. EVERYONE goes to that disco, and you are pretty much guaranteed to get lucky because everyone is so blackout. One thing that kinda sucked was the booze cruise. Granted we were hungover from the night before, but we had to take this awful bus ride that was like 1 hour and then a boat ride that was like 1 hours again to finally get teh booze. The catamaran does note ven come until the way back. If you are not hungover and the weather is nice, go on this, but otherwise it was kinda ridiculous. The little island was pretty though where we went. GOOOOO HERRRRRRRE AND HAVE A BLAST AND GET VERYVERY DRUNK AND MAYBE INAPPROPRIATE!
