{"text":"Mind the Gap! It was our frist trip to England and I was there with my wife to celebrate my birthday, But London is cold at this time of the year...who cares, never been there and had to make it special. London is magical, feeling like Peter Pan although I'm older, I felt like a kid entering Disneyland for he first time, never felt tired until the end of the day, after a day of walking, sightseeing, watching shows at west end, shopping, and dining...but to end my day on my goose down king size bed and pillows just made resting a much different level. The Milestone did not idsaapoint at all even thought they were doing construction during the day, the noise above me at one time was just not tolerable..but any old hotel with so muh character will show its age...and will need upkeep. The room was elegant, though small and cramped...this is London. My wife said that our stay at the Park Palace at Victoria Stationwas roomier and I agree, but it was not even close to the character of the hotel and the room. It felt like my home away from home. THey know you the moment you walk out the door and when you come home. Nothing is spared, they just care. I haven;t felt like that from a hotel, ever...is it pricey. yeah but if you want cheap, thn don't go to London, or Europe for that matter. Go there as if money doesn't matter then you will really enjoy London. THe day we arrive, it was my birthday and they made my afternoon tea so special by making a delicous chocolate cake and giving us champagne....that's service. By the way, they made the cake whn they found out it was my birthday because they asked me if I can have it later after my afternoon tea...never got that at the Ritz! The service is very british, subtle yet very classy. The location is near the tube and better yet, a Starbucks just around the corner. WHat else could make you feel at home...one thing about London, once you're there, top converting your dollars if you want to enjoy the rest of your trip...and the best part of the trip is coming back to America....you will realize how blessed we are in this country...we plan to go back to London again soon...and Milestone is definitely on our list....Mind the Gap ","annotations":[{"endOffset":245,"mention":"Pan","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pan-bagnat"],"startOffset":242},{"endOffset":902,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":896},{"endOffset":914,"mention":"Victoria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Victoria_Bitter"],"startOffset":906},{"endOffset":1438,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1435},{"endOffset":1438,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1435},{"endOffset":1438,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1435},{"endOffset":1438,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1435},{"endOffset":1485,"mention":"chocolate cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_cake","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1471},{"endOffset":1485,"mention":"chocolate cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_cake","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1471},{"endOffset":1559,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1555}]}
