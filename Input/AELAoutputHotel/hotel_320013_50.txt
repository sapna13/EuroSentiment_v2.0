{"text":"Wonderful hotel My boyfriend and I booked the Conrad, after seeing other reviews on TripAdvisor, as a last-minute getaway for my birthday. We were, admittedly, slightly irritated by check-in procedures (the member of staff tried to sell us a suite at double the price of the room we had booked, followed by a sales pitch for their club facilities, before finally admitting that our room wasn't ready, even though we had arrived after their advertised check in time), but that was quickly forgotten.Our room was great - not a very nice view, but we had no intention of sitting in the room looking out the window, so it didn't matter. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, and the pillows were fantastic - so good that I wanted to buy some of them. There was also a decent sized balcony, which was nicely shaded. The hotel gym is very well equipped - plenty of machines, and the trainers are willing to help you but don't get in your way. They do, however, bring you lovely, scented, cold towels regularly throughout your workout! Bliss.The main pool is lovely - a perfect temperature, and of an even depth, which suited me perfectly as I don't like to be out of my depth in water. Again, you get a cold towel at the poolside in the morning, along with a complimetary water spray. There are plenty of activities every day, such as yoga, aqua aerobics, stretching classes and so on, but these are conducted away from the main pool, so you're not disturbed if you don't want to participate.The staff are terrific - the doormen are particularly nice, and are genuinely welcoming. The hotel also gave us a really nice surprise by delivering a birthday cake and rose to our room on the day of my birthday, which was a lovely touch, and a good indication of the attention to detail that is shown throughout the hotel.The food in the hotel was nice, and not expensive by UK hotel prices, but as someone else has pointed out, there are far cheaper (and probably more authentic) places further along the road. We did notice a comment by another guest saying that the road was not very good to walk along, but there is also a jogging track along the beach which you can use, and then cut through one of the side roads (or sneak through another resort!) - we did do this a couple of times at night, which may not have been wise, but there's certainly no problem doing this during the day.I'd definitely consider staying here again if we ever returned to Bali ","annotations":[{"endOffset":335,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":331},{"endOffset":335,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":331},{"endOffset":335,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":331},{"endOffset":335,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":331},{"endOffset":335,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":331},{"endOffset":534,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":530},{"endOffset":534,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":530},{"endOffset":1612,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1608},{"endOffset":1612,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1608},{"endOffset":1651,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1647},{"endOffset":1651,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1647},{"endOffset":1651,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1647}]}
