{"text":"Price was GOOD, noise was NOT. We arrived at the hotel early, so we had to stow our bags for a while.... the front desk lady was somewhat helpful but it seemed more like we were bothering her than anything. We asked for a good place to eat breakfast and she looked at us an said that there was a Starbucks on the corner. Sorry but I am not going all of the way to Spain to go to a Starbucks... so we found a good tapas place a few buildings over for breakfast (it was wonderful!!!! I will review that later). We found that the location of the hotel is great. The neighborhood is nice, has great shopping and the metro is right there. When we finally did get our room we found it to be a bit cozy. Some reviewers find it small and cramped, but if you are a traveler then most likely what you want is a bed and a bathroom... so we were fine with the size. However when we finally did go to sleep we found that we could hear the elevator screeching.... and everyone walking up and down the hallways. The fact that there is tile everywhere is very elegant and easy to clean but it is LOUD as heck!!! I truly believe there is no insulation in the walls, I thought someone was in our bathroom while we were sleeping, but it turned out to be the people across the hall running their water. The point of this review is to state that #1 it is LOUD #2 the help is a hit or a miss and #3 it is LOUD. If they worked on the noise issue... I might go back. ","annotations":[]}
