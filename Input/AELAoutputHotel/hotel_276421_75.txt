{"text":"Don't Stay at this resort! From Washington, DC area visited the IFA Villas Bavaro Beach ResortDate: July 3-11, 2007We just returned from the Dominican Republic, Punta Cana. I would not recommend staying at the IFA Villas Bavaro Beach Resort, my reasons are as follows: a lot of the resort is under construction, which they fail to tell you, there is one entire pool not in service, they rennovating 3 or 4 buildings so you when you walk past you see the construction, not what you really want to see on your vacation. Two of the restruants that you have to sign up to eat at you MUST wear pants (if you didn't bring pants don't expect to get in.....oh but you can wear jeans......that doesn't make sense!), but a nice pair of shorts you can't wear........We saw guards walking around the beach with guns and outside the resort. Our room faced the beach which was a very nice view it's still a hike to the beach. Problems we ran into with our room: the air condition leaked all over the floor which they had to fix; the key to the safe got jammed, which they had to fix; the TV went out for 3 full days; found a big bug in the bathroom, bathtub paint peeling. The restruant that we could eat at the food was pretty good, the pizza bar was good .....we pretty much lived off of pizza and chicken nuggets. We couldn't wait to get home to eat American Food. We did try to leave early; however what we found out was that US Airways wanted to charge us over $1,000.00 to change our flights so we ended up staying the entire time. There are a lot of other nicer resorts to stay at..... pay the extra couple of hundred of dollars it's well worth it in the long run. Oh yea! You need to do the excursions as you will be board at the hotel they only really have a disco at night time, and bring your own booze the drinks are terrible.
