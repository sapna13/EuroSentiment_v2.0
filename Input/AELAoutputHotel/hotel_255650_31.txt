{"text":"Beauty is only skin deep I travel constantly for business, mostly overseas but also within Australia. Despite being a high level Hilton HHonors member I've started moving my international business away from Hilton earlier this year due to a range of concerns. I thought I'd try the Hilton in Sydney on a recent business trip just to see if it was any better at home, especially after a multi-million dollar renovation. Short answer: NO.I think this hotel has targetted itself very much towards Asian visitors. The bed was very low and ROCK hard, much like what you'd invariably find in Singapore, Vietnam and other major Asian business destinations. And as a previous reviewer pointed out, the king size bed is two singles pushed together with a thin veneer of a cover over them. Hideously uncomfortable. Mine were slightly different heights to boot!The decor was very edgy and chic - glass desk, lots of odd angles and interesting features - but totally unintuitive. Two examples:1. The blinds open with a push button that's on the bed head, but clearly most people can't find the button because there is a great deal of bending and lifting on the sides of the blinds where people have obviously tried to pry them up manually (take the hint, Hilton....). 2. The towels hang nowhere near the shower and you can't even rest them on the toilet because the shower opens the wrong way. So you have to leave them hanging across the room and then drip water all over the floor on your way, making for a slippery walk back. Bathmat you say? Nice idea. But the shower door is too low to open over the bathmat, so when you open it, the bathmat is pushed way under the sink. Ridiculous. My worst criticism is that the food was the most ridiculously priced I've ever seen in all my years of four star and above travel. A basic cooked room service breakfast is $40 (two small eggs, two pieces of toast, bacon, some cereal and fruit. A curry with rice is $35. Wedges - yes potato wedges, not wedges of pure gold - were $22 a bowl! I was mortified by the price, and didn't feel any better about it when I saw the quality. Made without an ounce of care . Tepid food slapped unlovingly on a plate. My travel is not greatly constrained by budget, but I do expect value for money and most certainly comfort from a four star international hotel chain. This hotel delivers a chic edgy look that photographs beautifully but does not offer a pleasant accommodation experience. This hotel should be ashamed to charge what it does. It's certainly justified my decision to move the majority of our company's accommodation spend to the Marriott chain. Haven't stayed there in Sydney, but around the world they've got Hilton beat by a mile.
