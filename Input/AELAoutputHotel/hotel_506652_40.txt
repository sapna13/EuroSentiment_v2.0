{"text":"Great Value, Great Hotel! My husband and I stayed at the B hotel between Christmas and New Year. When we arrived the very polite receptionist apologised that there would be a slight delay in checking in due to a large party arriving just ahead of us. She then arranged for a free drink to be brought to us in the bar, to apologise. The delay was no more than 15 minutes, and before we had finished our drink she came back with our key!The room was stunning, very modern and very clean. The space is nicely laid out and has lovely views of the The Arena and The Palace. I can not praise the staff or the hotel highly enough, both made our trip very comortable and relaxed. The only odd thing with the hotel is the lighting system, the combination of lights is a little baffling, and takes time to get used.The hotel is located very centrally and is very close to several bus stops and 2 main Metro lines so getting around is simple. It is even close to the Hop on Hop Off Bus stop, so it is perfect for tourists.The hotel is also reasonably priced, with our 3 night stay costing just over √à√\u2020√ü?00, which for the quality of the hotel and its location, was extremely reasonable. Overall I would just say that it is a great hotel, good value, pleasant and helpful staff, and it is in a great location. If you get a chance definately stay here!
