{"text":"We expected more My husband and I spend 12 days in May 2008 in the Westin Resort. Last year we also stayed at Nusa Dua but in the Laguna Resort next door.Overall, we were a little disappointed by the rooms, the service (especially the breakfast service) and the resort itself.The resort has a really impressive reception area, suited to receive very large groups, which is not a coincidence due to the fact that the hotel is attached to the Bali Convention center. Check-in was very fast and nice and we were promptly escorted to our room.The room had a pool-view, where we had also a small view on the beach. It was quite spacious but there were a few too many negatif aspects for a 5 star resort:the walls in the room had all kind of stains, the furniture was a bit too old and scratched. While the bed itself was a dream, it was quite annoying that it would move away from the wall, while one is moving. The light switchsystem was not correctly wworking, so that we have to try a few times before having all the lights out. The air-condition was not properly functionning. The curtains had very ugly stainsThe bathroom also was a bit too old (compared to the Laguna next door). And the worst were the little insects we had in our room: you could not open a can of lemonade and leave on the bedside for more than 5 minutes without it being infested with ants.Also we had a few problems with our key cards which suddenly, for no obvious reason, stopped working .The service: even though the personnel in the breakfast room was very nice and always smiling, the room was very crowded, there werent at times not enough tables. A few times I had to reask for my coffee. It all seemed a bit disorganised. During my holidays I want to be relaxed and not stressed out during breakfast. The pool area was really great, there were enough places and you never had the impression that it was overcrowded. We took a few snacks at the pool and I trully fell in love with their go chocolate nuts ice cream.Their spa is also really good and relaxing.The resort is great, but at this price we expected a bit more.
