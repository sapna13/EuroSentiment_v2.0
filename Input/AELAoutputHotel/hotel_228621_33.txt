{"text":"Good value on the sea front Stayed just the one night whilst on a business trip on my own in Barcelona.The property is located on the sea front, which wasn't particularly handy in January, but I can say that at this time of year, this location is especially quiet. If you are worried that it's going to be difficult to get to the main attractions, please don't be. It's an easy 10-minute walk to the nearest metro, then 6 or 7 stops to the centre, perhaps a single change and another couple of stops depending on where you're headed.Onto the hotel itself: it has a clean, modern feel to it. The reception staff were friendly enough. The ground floor is all open-plan, the bar round the back of the reception area, and the dining area separated from the lobby and bar by a large arty screen. There's a computer area and national and international newspapers between the entrance and the dining area.I like booking hotels with gyms, and although the gym here was not state-of-the-art, it was passable, with a decent treadmill, multigym and loose weights. I thought the stereo in there was a nice touch, but unfortunately it was broken.I was a little distressed at the lack of minibar in the room, although a positive quirk of the Front Maritim is the presence of fridges packed full of bottles of free still and sparkling mineral water positioned at the end of each corridor! This was a lovely touch.It's a bit weird these days for business-oriented hotels in major cities not to have wireless internet availability. They must have invested in cable internet socket installations just before Wifi took off, and they are stubbonly insistent on getting their money's worth. If you don't have a cable with you, you can buy them from reception for √à√\u2020√ü?.Breakfast was OK, but there was no hot option.I was grateful that they had a flexible attitude to my leaving the car in their garage for no extra charge for a few hours after I had checked out. Good on them.I'd definitely stay here again, and would recommend it for like-minded business travellers. If you need to be in the hub of the action, or if you don't like taking the metro, then it might be less appealing to you, but it could be worth a look just for the comfort level that you get for the price they charge.
