{"text":"Will never stay here again...EVER In Miami for the first time for a wedding. The bride suggested this hotel as a more reasonably priced option for accomodations. I will NEVER come here again and even considered changing hotels. However, since we were in town for only 3 nights, with most time spent with family and friends for wedding activities decided not to. Especially since we'd have to pay rack rates anywhere else with such last minute notice.PROS: - Close to the wedding ceremony and reception location- Cheap (you totally get what you pay for though)- Food wasn't too bad. We had breakfast one morning and lunch at the Seabreeze cafeCONS:- Quite remote. No place to even walk to if you wanted a cup of coffee or snack elsewhere. We had to eat at the hotel or jump in a cab to go to Lincoln road or Ocean drive. Cab cost us around $15 each way- Horrible service. After long delays getting in we finally arrived exhausted around 10:30pm. At least 5 staff members watched me try to drag my heavy suitcase upstairs to the reception area. Only when I got to the top did they ask me if I needed help with the bags. Generally, found the staff to be very aloof and not at all helpful.- Accomodations were appalling. The room needed major renovations. The carpet was filthy and the bed was hardly inviting at all. Seriously, the worst pillows I've ever slept on - old and flat. Mattress was hard as a rock. Bathroom was dark and dank and the sink and tiles needed replacing.- Pool was old and dated. Didn't even want to jump in with my swimsuit or even laze out by the pool.Even though we saved some money at this place, it totally wasn't worth it. I felt stressed and uncomfortable the entire time I was there - didn't feel like it was a vacation at all.
