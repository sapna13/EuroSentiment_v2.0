{"text":"great friendly service and staff, great location and room I found out a week before that I needed to be in Amsterdam for business for just one day. Since that was a Friday, I decided to stay through the weekend and enjoy Amsterdam (my second trip). My company was trying to get me to stay by the airport, but I did a little research here and found the Nadia.I emailed regarding availability and they got back to me quickly to confirm. Since I was travelling solo, and knew of the small rooms I picked the basic accomodation. I also added an additional day a few days before I arrived and was given no hassle at all.I arrived very late on friday following my meeting. Since it was late, cold and rainy, I took a cab from centraal station. Even though I knew the fare was escessive, and commented on it, I still got taken advantage off by the driver. Please beware of this!My reception was warm and I was offered a drink by the gracious man at the desk (sorry I didn't ask his name). He was very helpful my whole stay. The rooms are very small, but typical of the other places I've stayed in Amsterdam. Accomodations were clean and confortable, my top 2 requests. The bathroom was very small, it was hard to wash my face in the sink even!Very close to trams and Dam Square. Excellent location. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. Although if you need western\/'american style hotel rooms, you're best to look elsewhere. Thanks for a great stay! ","annotations":[]}
