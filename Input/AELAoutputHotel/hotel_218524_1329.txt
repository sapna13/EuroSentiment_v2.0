{"text":"Great vacation My husband and I just returned from five days at Secrets Excellence. I must say, we went with much hesitation after reading all the negative reviews. We learned quickly that the people that wrote these negative reviews obviously have unrealistic expectations. Just remember this is a 3rd world country. Sometimes it was so embarrasing to be an American, the Americans had the worst attitudes and were always the first to complain about everything. They forget how lucky we are to live in such a great country. Just remember your on vacation...RELAX for goodness sake!!! People have to realize that a 5 star resort in the Dominican Republic is not the same as a 5 star resort in the US. Overall the hotel was clean, the rooms were not the most glamorous but who goes to a beautiful island to stay in their room? The rooms serve their purpose. The grounds, the beach and the pools are magnificent. It was a tropical paradise.As far as the food, it was fine. What do people expect for an all inclusive??? We took all sorts of medicines with us for sickness and did not use a single thing. I have an extremely sensitive stomach and never got sick. You just need to eat like you would usually and not over indulge in food and alcohol and then blame the hotel for being sick.The staff was so friendly and helpful, we never had a problem with the language. You can definately get by without knowing Spanish. We did tip alot but not because it was expected but because this is a poor country and the money is appreciated.If you want to buy any souvenirs while your there I recommend going to the shacks just outside the hotel property. Just walk to the left when your on the beach and you'll run right into the shacks. Go see Nancy in shack # 4  6. She is so nice and will give you the best deal. She also has Cuban cigars if your interested. We travel alot and Punta Cana Secrets is definately one of our favorite places. Go and enjoy! We would certainly go back to Secrets. We had a very nice vacation at a very nice resort.
