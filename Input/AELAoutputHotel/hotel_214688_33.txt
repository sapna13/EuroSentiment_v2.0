{"text":"Pretty nice place! We booked this hotel through Expedia based on other people's ratings, and the star rating, as well as the Outrigger name. I read some negative reviews about insect infestations, and bad customer service experiences - and I have no idea where these came from! The hotel was great - the staff was friendly and courteous, and I didn't notice any insects anywhere. Besides - in Hawaii, cockroaches will show up even in the nicest 5-star hotels - that's what you get for being in the tropics. Anyways - the room they gave us was pretty nice - a studio with two queen beds, a kitchenette, and a lanai with a city view. The kitchenette didn't have a microwave - which would've been a great amenity - but otherwise, everything was clean and in good condition. Since the floors were marble - it would've helped if housekeeping had swept the floors during their daily cleaning - as the sand you accumulate at the beach starts to accumulate. The pool was nice, there was a big patio area to relax and sunbathe on - with some shaded areas for those who preferred to stay out of the sun. It was a small pool, but clean - and refreshing. The location was good too, not far from the beaches - but close to other attractions as well. There were lots of places for food around - a short walk to the other hotels in Waikiki - and there was an ABC store right across the street (which anyone who's been to Hawaii knows - you're in there numerous times over the course of your stay). I'd definitely stay here again, and recommend it to other people who are looking to travel to Hawaii. However, there were plenty of hotels I'd also like to try out - hoping that the service and amenities match, or rival that of the Luana.
