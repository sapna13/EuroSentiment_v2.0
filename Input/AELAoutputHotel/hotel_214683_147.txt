{"text":"Loved the view and the location We went to Hawaii for our anniversary. We are two late 30 somethings with double income and no kids. The 3 Marriott resorts we stayed at varied alot. I was glad we stayed at this hotel due to the location. Our check in experience was good. I asked for a king size bed because it was our anniversary and the guy at the front desk said he would rather see us in a room with a great view and two double beds. We took his advice after he showed us the rack rate. The room was on like the 10th floor but it was deceiving because there are like 4 floors of restaurants and a roof top pool on part of the 3rd floor. Our room overlooked the pool and the ocean. It was awesome. The rooms have been refreshed but are typical hotel rooms. I laughed because they had done the ugly tub remodeling to the bath (you could see how it was painted on). It didn't bother me because we love the location and view. The room was clean too. We ate at the Sansei sushi restaurant onsite. It was excellent and the prices weren't too bad for Wakiki. There was a white wine that was a riesling made for sushi and it was awesome. Sorry I can't remember the name of it but you'll see it on the menu. This hotel has all kinds of travellers young, old, families, tourists, etc. It's also a very big hotel but it was easy to go to the beach and they gave you a coupon for free chairs on the beach for 4 hours one day which was nice. My husband took a surf lesson on the beach. It wasn't much of a lesson but it was only $35 a hour and he got up on the board. The place he used is down by the Hyatt food stand on the beach (walk toward the pink hotel, it's before it). I was advised that the Marriott has a surf teacher onsite that is excellent. We didn't find that out until after the fact. I have no clue about the prices. We had a 10pm late flight on our last day and they gave us a key to use lounge to take a shower, etc . Just so you know be sure to take some soap from your room before checking out as the facilities had ran out and they don't have staff there. Also they didn't have wash rags just towels so if you like a wash rag keep one from the room to use here. They only have one shower for the women and no hair dryer. I made a friend in the ladies room who was kind enough to let me blow out my hair with her dryer. I bet you can borrow one from the front desk but I was in the middle of getting ready before discovering this. We spent most of that day at the hotel pool and they have a great mai tai that can be ordered in a fresh pinnapple. It's a $14 drink but it's attractive. We had excellent salads at the pool for lunch but they were expensive for a pool bar at $21 each (shrimp salad  tuna salad). It was very tasty. There is an ABC store onsite. We found the valet was needed and it's pricey at like $25 or something. I think self park was $18 but it felt like too much work for me and I opted for valet. The baggage guys watched our luggage but weren't helpful in bringing it to the car when we were leaving. I think they were fussed that we got in our luggage to get cleaned up and came back later to get it. My husband had tip ready money for these guys but they didn't help so they didn't get a tip. I've never had baggage folks that didn't want to help. Oh, well we did it ourselves and it reminded me of the days went we would stay at the Red Roof Inn. We needed to get to the airport so we weren't going to wait or beg for help. I recommend going to Hula Girl's for breakfast at the Outrigger. It's next to the pink hotel. They have Macadamia and Banana pancakes with coconut syrup. Also they have a great view of the ocean and Diamond Head. The pancake order is huge. Like 3 big ones. My husband and I should of spilt the order. Also the fresh fruit plate is excellent. It had pineapple, strawberry, banana, mango, papaya and a dipping sauce. Excellent coffee and juice too. We are generally diet watchers but this was a special treat.
