{"text":"Treated like royalty Absolutely nothing too much trouble for the staff, friendly, helpful and taking great pride in their work.The room was beautiful and the bathroom to die for! My husband wanted to fit the large LCD TV into our suitcase.Each evening the beds were turned down and little pastries left on the pillow. Sumptuous bathrobes per person, iron board, safe in the closet, which was easy to set with your own pin number, and an umbrella. Everything felt luxurious and the thought that went into the furnishings was incredible.The Azure restaurant served an elegant breakfast at a reasonable price; the Solas Irish pub did a very hearty plate of simple but good food (bring your appetite).The City Bar was lively but elegant, the staff were very thorough on checking ID to ensure no under age drinking.The hotel was central for walking into Boston, or if you did not want to walk, the dooman would wave a cab for you, however the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022√¶√à√\u2020\u2022?was only one block away with $2 per trip.To use a Bostonian quote, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬¢ place were everybody knows your name√à√\u2020\u2022? unlike larger chain hotels were you are just a number.We did not want to come home  we can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait to go again.A word of warning which was not any fault of the Lenox was a rogue taxi driver when we were on a trip, claimed to be our transport back and then tried to claim extra money and was very demanding.. We called the police and the Concierge dealt with all of it for us, ensuring that we got inside in the warmth and even arranging coffee for ourselves and three people who were not even guests. Ask to check ID and always make sure you know who is supposed to pick you up ","annotations":[{"endOffset":297,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":289},{"endOffset":297,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":289},{"endOffset":855,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":849},{"endOffset":855,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":849},{"endOffset":855,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":849},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"Lenox","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Lenox_Hotel"],"startOffset":1244},{"endOffset":1527,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1521}]}
