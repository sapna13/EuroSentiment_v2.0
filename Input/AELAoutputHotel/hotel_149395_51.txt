Shuttle runs constantly if you need it.Issues: Communication is very difficult, if you don't speak spanish quite well. Misunderstandings frequent. Rooms towels and spoons in short supply. Heat is INSANE from 1-4, so seek shelter. Difficult to book included specials such as sailing  snorkeling - a big pain. Reservations for restaurants  water sports seem to be held mostly for those staying in the very high-end Reserve. Do NOT do the tour of the Reserve. Staff gets a commission for sending people  it's worth a lot of money to them, but it's a time-share concept, even though they deny it. We did it to help out the gal who wanted the commission, but it was a sleazy concept to charge a ton of money to provide extra pampering concierge service - and those of us who pay thousands are just regular common folk.... Be warned, horseback riding is off-site. Some folks did it and liked it, but said that the horses were very skinny and the ride there is rough to see, if you know what I mean. (Not sure about the implications of the foot-mouth disease and the customs questionnaire about visiting a farm or ranch during your visit.). Lastly, bring a glade plug-in, a bar of soap, your own shampoo, and your spanish\/english dictionary. Contact me if you want more info.
