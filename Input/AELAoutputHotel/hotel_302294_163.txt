{"text":"A Great Hotel, Dont Miss Out! What a great Hotel. We stayed here at the end of March 07 for three nights. Having travelled from the UK with Singapore Airlines we used our 'Boarding Pass Privelage' to book an offer direct with the hotel which included breakfast. We arrived direct from the airport at 08:00 hours and asked if there was 'any likelyhood' of checking in early as check in time is 3 pm. We were given our room at 10.45am.Breakfast at the hotel is buffet style with an extensive range of foods to suit all. We were on the 19th floor and had an excellent view of the river and city district. Yes we could hear the music and singing, but it ends before midnight, so why not go down to the bar and enjoy? Alcohol in Singapore IS expensive especially wine, but then you do not see any drunkeness on the streets.The location of the 'Pan Pac' is excellent for the Marina Shopping Centre and the MRT. The MRT is an underground train system which is Very safe and cheap.The hotel rooms are spacious, clean and have very comfortable large beds. There is a business centre on a higher floor which allows you use of a computer and Internet for a small charge.There is a 'tour desk' on the 2nd floor where you can book many different trips including the Night Safari. Don't miss Swimming with the Dolphins at Sentosa Island ( Book at .'Underwaterworld' before you go for only √ä√£¬¢50 each.)
