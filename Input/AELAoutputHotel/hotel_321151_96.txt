{"text":"Amazing time at the Jurys Boston Hotel I stayed at the Jurys Boston Hotel for a week at the end of March with my boyfriend and had an absolutely incredible time. It was my boyfriends first time in Boston whereas I was returning after 11 years from having lived their previously. We had an incredible week and were very sad to leave. The Jurys Hotel was by far one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at, and I've stayed at a fair few. The hotel staff were very friendly and very accommodating through-out the whole trip. The room was lovely, some have said the rooms were quite small but I thought it was a great size. Everything about it was wonderful. We had breakfast in the hotel a couple of times, we didnt have the buffet as we didnt think we could possibly eat enough food to justify spending $18. But what we did have was great. It's in an absolute perfect location for everything, a two minute walk from the 'T' station, some great restaurants in the area, one especially great meal was at the Bonfire Steakhouse, a bit on the pricey side but so so worth it. We had a great night there. The complimentary internet in the Jurys business centre was very useful as it was the only means of communication with some friends I had in the area. We had drinks in the bar Cuffs a couple of times too, it had a great atmosphere and we weren't disturbed by it at night at all. I don't have a negative thing to say about our stay at the Jurys, and when we go back to Boston we will definately be staying with them again.
