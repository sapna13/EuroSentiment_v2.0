{"text":"Exceded all expectations My Husband and I (3637) Stayed at the Ocean Sand from Dec 6-13 2006 and loved it. We had been to DR before, stayed at Bahia Principe San Juan and althought the resort was OK, we did not have an overall great experience in the DR. We thought we would not go back as we are avid Mayan Riviera travellers.Our experience at the Ocean Sand changed our minds!!I had emailed ahead with a few requests and all were granted. We stayed in room 9104 which was a perfect spot, the rooms were large with great balconies that even had drying racks, a nice touch for hanging towels and suits.As far as the staff they were great, we had no issues what so ever, the food was the best of any AI we have stayed at. I know this sound strange but you have to try the Dominican Restaurant and have the goat. It was amazing!! The mexican rest. made the most flavourful Fajitas ever and the Italian has this great Shrimp in an orange batter that my Hubby said was to die for.We did not try either of the Pay restaurants as the one is French food and nothing really cought our eye and the Seafood is only seafood with a set menu and I don't eat it. The buffet was great and lunch by the beach at the beach buffet was enjoyed every day, The House Wine was even pretty good.The pools are huge and the staff at the bars do their best to keep up.We went on this vacation specifically to take our open water dive course and let me say the staff at Pelicano Divers was exellent!! Our instructor was Wellington Adames, a local fellow who was amazing, he was so patient and knowledgable. If I had any other instructor I don't know if I could have done it!!If you go into town to shop, BEWARE, the vendors on the front street are Very bold, We just bypassed them, went a block further down and to a shop near the back, found a nice young man who was not pushy, told him exactly what we wanted to buy and he ran around to find it. We then bartered on it all as a package and got a great deal with great service and gave our money to someone who earned it not bullied us into spending too much. If you don't want to leave the resort to shop, the store is not too badly priced.We would recommend this resort to anyone. The layout of the resort in a long rectangle, totally flat so no issues with stairs or hills for people with kids or limited mobility. Oh Yeah did I mention they have the largest, most beautiful beach ever!!We lucked out finding this place because we got a really good deal and it worked with our time frame, what a lucky score!!Enjoy ","annotations":[{"endOffset":566,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":562},{"endOffset":566,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":562},{"endOffset":878,"mention":"Fajitas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fajita"],"startOffset":871},{"endOffset":878,"mention":"Fajitas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fajita"],"startOffset":871}]}
