{"text":"continues to be great Stayed at the Mandarin for a couple of nights in mid-December and then back again for the period over Christmas, with young family. The hotel is one of those where I am always surprised by the quality of service, but then on reflection think that I shouldn't be because I already know how good it is. We found (and have found in the past) all staff to be excellent and prompt to sort any requests - from the front desk, through the waiting staff to housekeeping - and this was even during a very busy time over Christmas (when they did a great job, with carol singers around the hotel, dancers and presents for the children).In terms of rooms, we used a variety on this trip - and would highlight that, unless on a very short business trip, better to avoid the smaller rooms facing the George's building and pay the extra for a proper city view, ideally over Chater Square (and even here the rooms are of different configurations, depending on floor I guess and how they sorted out the former balconies during the refurb). I think refurb has been a great success, both in the rooms and in the restaurants (although still a shock to have windows in the Grill ...) - and rooms feel high quality (although not so sure about the 'podium' basins or glass-fronted WCs in some rooms). Only issue with the rooms (and I've heard this from somewhere else as well) is getting the lighting right - can be quite low-level unless you play with the system for a while. Elsewhere, now have to pay for i'net access in the business centre, which was free of charge when I was there in May.Other points- (1) barber shop refurb a bit over the top, but the team remains intact, (2) the hotel remains a good spot to get taxis from in busy times and a good place to be dropped at, to avoid going round a busy Queens Road, if you are going somewhere in Central, even a few mins walk away from the hotel and, (3) for a non-business stay, you can avoid paying up for b'fast by going across the road into Princes Building 2\/F and buying croissants etc at Olivers Deli.I haven't stayed at the Four Seasons or the Landmark, so can't compare directly with those, but Mandarin remains my choice when in HK, not least for being in the middle of Central and so close to offices\/shops etc..
