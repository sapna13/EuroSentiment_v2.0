{"text":"Very Nice Hotel in a convenient location We just returned from a 10 day tour of Spain followed by a Mediterranean Cruise. We stayed at the Hotel Jazz one night following the cruise and found it to be a wonderful experience. Prior to the cruise we stayed at the Rick Steves recommended Hotel Continental Barcelona, paying almost the same price for much inferior accommodations. We did this to meet up with some traveling companions who had already booked the Hotel Continental. The Hotel Jazz is one and a half blocks off the west end of La Rambla and Catalonia Square. There are numerous good restaurants and other facilities in the neighborhood. We found two excellent restaurants on the streets just west of Catalonia Square. Back to the Hotel Jazz. The check in was easy, with the staff speaking English very well. We checked in at 10 am and the room was surprisingly ready. We had asked for a room away from the street but none were available. This turned out not to be a problem as the windows were double paned and the Spanish traffic is much quieter than in Italy. Not a problem for a light sleeper. The room was very large, clean, and bright, just as shown in pictures on the hotel internet site. The room and lobby are very modern. The bed was excellent, this from someone who is extremely critical. My wife also loved her tub. They have two free internet computer terminals. They do not have a printer, but claimed you could email things to their address and they would print it at the front desk. On the same floor as the computers there is a pleasant bar and two large rooms where breakfast is served. It is 15 euro per person and looked very good, although we did not partake. Our rate was 110 euro plus tax. Not inexpensive, but very reasonable for Barcelona, which seems to be the most expensive city in Spain for hotel rooms. Highly recommended.
