{"text":"Truly a Dream I am not going to write the traditional review that has been done so well by others breaking everything down. I just would like to start by saying please do not be mislead by the negative reviews. I have to laugh when people say they have traveled all over the world and put this resort down what world.AMresorts we believe to be a cut above all the others. There are many resons why we feel this way. To numerous to go into just a personal feeling we have. I will say the Dominican people are the nicest most sincere people of all the Caribbean Islands we have been too.Unfortunately the people who post negative reviews for whatever reason seem to outnumber the positive reviews and I believe the reason is when people have a negative experience they want everyone to know which I understand. However people who have a wonderful experience do not take the time to write a positive review. Its just the way it is!! What we need is for everyone to just take a few minutes and let everyone know of there experience even just a few words will help others know they have made the right choice. People just have very high expectations and are very hard to please no matter what the circumstances. Dreams is not the Four Seasons it is a Carbbean resort that caters to all young and old.We met so many great people on this trip and not one had anything bad to say except for some minor proplems which were corrected immediately. All of the people we spoke to are experienced travelers and know what to expect from an all inclusive vacation. There were others who were vacationing for the first time at Dreams and said they would most definitely come back.In closing I would just like to say get to know the staff it will make your vacation a true memory from the bellboys, waiters, bartenders, housekeepers, and entertainment team they are there for you to experience a wonderful vacation.People who don't have Dreams don't have much!!Keep the Dream Alive!!
