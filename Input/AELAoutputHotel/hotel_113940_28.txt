{"text":"Home away from home I was SO delighted with my stay at Petite Auberge! I picked it because of a combination of location, price,  projected ambience. Upon arrival, I was very pleasantly surprised at how the hotel exceeded my expectations. It was indeed convenient  extremely affordable. It was also such a cozy, comfortable place! The set-up makes it feel more like visiting Grandma's house than staying in an urban hotel. The fun part about visiting shortly before Christmas was having a gorgeous tree  presents in the living room, an environ made complete with a comfy sofa, a real fire in the fireplace,  an endless supply of cookies  hot chocolate. My bedroom felt like my own, not like an impersonal hotel suite. The bed itself was great - excellent mattress, pillows,  linens - making it difficult for me to get out of the room to do anything else! Hotel staff was very courteous  helpful throughout my stay. And the delicious breakfast was a great treat on a sleepy morning! Not everything was delicious...but most of it was! ;-) My only criticism (if one can call it that) is that the shower was EXTREMELY small. And I'm a rather small girl, so I don't know how a tall, broad man would fare! But the building is what it is, so there's only so much that can be done about that situation. It didn't make my stay any less enjoyable or relaxing. I REALLY love this place  will absolutely stay there again.!
