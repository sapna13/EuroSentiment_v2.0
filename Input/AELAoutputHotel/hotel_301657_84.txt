{"text":"Would definitely go back! We just got back from a 10 night stay in Tokyo and found this hotel to be perfect for our needs. We stayed in a standard queen bedroom on floor 33 looking out at the park and the bay. While the room is small, I thought it was extremely space efficient and didn't need anything larger. The room was stylish and very clean, and the housekeeping was fantastic. Our room was on the train station side, which I was quite wary of due to the reviews here and being a light sleeper, but strangely enough they didn't bother me. I found it more of a white noise than anything else. Your mileage may vary. I did not find the hotel front desk staff to be rude; they are certainly not as friendly and welcoming as most Japanese customer service staff we met elsewhere, but nothing to get your knickers in a twist about.We didn't use the room service or hotel restaurant, there is just so much choice in Tokyo that I didn't find it even remotely necessary. Keep in mind that my partner and I are both in our early twenties, and were keen to explore the city every day and most of the night. So really all we did at the hotel was sleep, shower, and watch a little tv. While Shiodome is not exactly in the heart of the action, so to speak, this can be a positive or a negative depending on how you look at it. I loved Shibuya for exploring at night, but as far as staying there? Not really that relaxing. Shiodome on the other hand, was clean, brand spanking new, and almost like a little retreat from the hubbub of Tokyo for us. We used the nearby Caretta mall restaurants and the convenience stores on a daily basis, and the walk through the underground passage to Shimbashi station was really convenient. Overall I adored this hotel, its amenities and services, the location and the room. Would love to go back some day.
