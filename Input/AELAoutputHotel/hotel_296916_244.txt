{"text":"Fantastic Hotel and city My partner and I stayed in the hotel Jazz in May for 4 nights and could not fault it at all. Ideal location, only 5 mins walk to Las Ramblas, shopping area, Gothic area. 2 mins to nearest Metro stop. The rooms were modern and spacious, great bathroom, satelite t.v. mini bar which wasn't too over priced, comfy beds and very clean. room service is very good and reasonably priced. We had breakfast in bed on 2 of the mornings at no extra cost which is a great service. Free wi-fi plus ethernet conections in all rooms as well as 2 free to use pc's in the bar area. hotel staff very freindly and helpfull. would recomend this hotel to any age group, business or pleasure. The pool on the roof is a nice addition although only used it once, the water was a bit too cold in May but nice place to unwind and catch some sun after a days sight seeing. Barcelona is probably the best city i have been to and i am quite well traveled, it is a very lively place with lots to see and do but laid back at the same time. A must is the open top tourist bus service, 19 euros for 1 day or 23euros for 2 days, there are 3 different routes which stop at all the main tourist sites and you can get on and off as many times as you want, there is a bus every 5 mins or so, it is an ideal way to see the city without missing lots of it by using the underground system (which is very good) and a lot cheaper than getting taxis everywhere. A must is a visit to the sagrada familia, which is absolutly out of this world. We will be staying at the hotel Jazz again no doubt about it.
