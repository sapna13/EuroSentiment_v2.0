{"text":"Nothing to critiscise Returned From Palladium Bararo last week, we had read some of the mixed reviews on Trip Advisor - after we booked and although some were very critical we went with an open mind and looking forward to a great holiday.Travelled with Thomsonfly out of Manchester, England, in their Premier Class cabin, excellent service, great legroom and comfort and a good flight, not impressed with the Aldo Zilli menu though!Arrived in a very hot Punta Cana airport had the obligatory photo taken with two lovely Dominican senoritas, which we bought on our return for $8US. Travelled the twenty minutes to the Hotel on a bumpy but well Aircond sharabang. Very impressive entrance and reception lobby, choice of chilled fruit juice and water available at the entrance. Checked in in record time complete with wrist bands, probably less than five minutes. Porter took us to our Junior Suite which lay half way between the beach and the lobby, where four of the complexes eleven restuarants are situated.Suite was excellent, clean, comfortable beds, Large bathroom with jacuzzi which was good fun. A\/C and fan, with well stocked mini bar topped up every day with water and every other day with bear and soft drinks. Clean towns everyday for $5 tip left every other day. Maid service was excellent.Fabulous beach with plenty of loungers, although you do have to get up reasonably early in order to beat the Germans for the best positions. Watersports and beach activities were plenty and varied and we didn't find the beach sellers in any way a problem.First night we dined in the La Catedral restuarant, what a fantastic choice of food, so good we never got around to trying any of the A la carte restuarants, mainly because my wife and 15 year old step daughter fancied most of the waiters, who filled the wine glasses after every sip. The range of food was extensive although I am sure had we have been there for more than a week would have become repetative, but then we could have tried one of the 9 A la carte restaurants. Le Arrecife restaurant by the beach, for lunch was also excellent with the same varied choice of dishes. All the staff on the hotel were very friendly and helpful, right across the board, pool staff, beach staff, bar staff and restaurant staff. The condition of the hotel, the rooms and the grounds was a credit to the hundreds of people involved in the running of this complex.The entertainment in the two theatres was okay, the Michael Jackson Show being the best, live music in the Lobby Bar and on some nights in the restuarant was good, we did not have enough nights to check out the other two hotels on the complex, next time definately two weeks.I am usually a constructively critical person and found it difficult to find anything to complain about.Only down side was a Thomson booked excursion to Ocean World at Punta Plata, the othe end of the Island. We went swimming with Dolphins and sharks, a great experience, although most of it is geared to photo opportunities. Our day was marred by very bad transports arrangements and lack of communication, late pick-up from the hotel, arrive at the airport to fly up to Porta Plata to find a plane with no fuel, arrived late at Ocean World and were rushed to fit everything in. Then we were rushed back on to the coach for a hour tour of Porta Plata which was not on our itinary, and then when we arrived back at the airport there was no plane and we had to sit on the pavement outside for an hour waiting for a plane, which we were told would be here in ten minutes. All in all an excellent holiday, highly recommended.
