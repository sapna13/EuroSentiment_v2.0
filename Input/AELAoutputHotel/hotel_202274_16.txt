{"text":"Perfect for Airport I have stayed here on a number of occasions for business - probably 4 times at this stage. It really is perfect for the airport as it is acutally in the airport and no shuttle bus is required. The train station is also in the airport so it is very easy to get into the centre of Frankfurt. I have some affection for it therefore as it does make things so much easier and if you are looking for an airport hotel in Frankfurt, look no further. As I suspect 95% of people staying here are staying one night, I think it is an excellent choice to be close to the airport. The room is comfortable and good to work in (good work desk). The corridors need a bit of a renovation but I have always found the room\/facilities functional - gym and two restuarants.I have two complaints. The first one is that I wish the Frankfurt Sheraton would turn off the airconditioning in empty rooms. When you arrive, the airconditioning is on. While this may be a big plus for many US guests, I really wish the Sheraton would think of the environment and the other guests it really offends. If I want A\/C I can put it on myself, thank you. End of rant!The other complaint is that there are some real problems with housekeeping. General sloppiness. A colleague of mine flew in from the US, checked into her room and was disturbed an hour later by housekeeping telling her she should have checked out by now - not realising that she was a new guest that had just checked in. I was disturbed at 8am (!) by housekeeping wanting to clean my room. If am leaving the room by 9am, I do not bother to put a do-not-disturb sign out. I was up as I was working but if I had been woken up I would have had a few words to say. Additionally, housekeeping cleaned my room and left two empty bottles from the minibar ourside in the hall. They were still there the following day when I was checking out. ","annotations":[]}
