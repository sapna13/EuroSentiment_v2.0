{"text":"Not the luxury expected Arrived Sunday after an early morning flight and a busy Saturday night for the hotel, so as we expected we were not able to check in. We were provided with a map of the city, and we checked our luggage. Unfortunately it was raining, we were exhausted and with little else to do on a Sunday AM we sat in the lobby\/lounge for about an hour waiting out the rain. Returned to the hotel at 1 and were told our room was ready. We were brought up to a room right off the elevator, which normally I would have asked to switch from, but we were so exhausted we looked forward to a nap. The bellman brought our luggage behind us, but provided no introduction to the room. Maybe its because we were tired but it took us a minute to figure out the bathroom door was a slider, and that the safe was inside the desk. We pulled the drapes for a nap, and there were little pinprick holes throughout them that let in light; I'm not thinking these were intentional. So much for the soundproof rooms...housekeeping was so noisy right outside our room all afternoon, and there was noise from the street outside, so we were unable to sleep. Then at 7, there was a knock on the door with our cava (we booked the romantic package); apparently room service did not see the do not disturb sign (he did apologize), but we finally gave up trying to sleep. The front desk provided us with a very good recommendation for tapas, and we headed out to enjoy the city. We enjoyed a drink in the hotel's rooftop bar, which is worth a stop, and the bartender was very informative and nice to talk to.  The room was very narrow, as noted by other reviewers, and the bathroom tile was stained to the point that my husband thought it hadn't been cleaned in a while. The breakfast provided a good selection, but all the hot food was cold because they didn't use warmers. All in all, our stay was not up to the level we expected with this hotel being rated best luxury in Barcelona. We stayed at another hotel upon our return to Barcelona a week later, right on Las Ramblas, and found it nicer, a little less expensive and it was actually quieter despite the location.
