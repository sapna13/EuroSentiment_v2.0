{"text":"A Good Modern Hotel I stayed at the Metropark for 6 nights in November and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The Metropark is a modern hotel located right next to Victoria Park. The location is on the main Hong Kong Island in the district of Tin Hau.Within walking distance, across Victoria Park, is the Causeway Bay area for shopping and restaurants and five minutes walk around the corner you have the Tin Hau MTR station which quickly gets you to most of the tourist attractions.The hotel is a modern 31 storey hotel. The hotel reception on the 1st floor is accessed from the ground floor lobby by escalators, or the lifts adjacent to the concierge desk. Adjacent to reception is a bar, which host lounge singers each evening.On the second floor is the restaurant and Business centre. The restaurant serves a breakfast buffet consisting of cereals, cooked English style plus noodles and continental. In the evening there is both an a la carte and a buffet. The buffet serves a mix of all nationalities; I would have preferred a few more Chinese style dishes, but the choices on offer attempts to suits all tastes.The main purpose of the business centre is to sell tourist excursions but it also has two public access PCs for surfing the internet for free.On the roof is a swimming pool, hot tub and fitness room with great views of the harbour and city.Most of the rooms are on the front of the hotel so offer views of the harbour.I had a double harbour view room on the fourteenth floor. Room 1416 gives what I would call a side view of the harbour, although I was perfectly happy with it as it did give a great city and park views as well as the harbour. See photos. The hotel has a slight curved front so other rooms may get a more substatial harbour view.The room was small but adequate, with the usual layout of shower room on the right with the room opening out containing double bed, TV, fridge, coffee  tea facilities and a desk in front of the window. The room has climate control air conditioning which was quiet.All the staff were pleasant and attentive.Close to the hotel is a supermarket and a seven eleven good for bottled water and very cheap sandwiches. To eat the best place to venture is Causeway bay which is a ten minute walk across the Park or one stop on the MTR. Victoria Park is worth a relaxing visit plenty going on day and night.All in all I enjoyed my stay at the Metropark and if I visit Hong Kong again I would consider returning to this hotel.Best bits: Close to MTR station, clean comfortable room, close to Victoria Park.Worst bits: Sausages at breakfast, not on the harbour front or in Causeway bay, Hong Kong air pollution.Best Tip: Get the Airport Express train from Lantau Airport using the tourist Octopus Card which can then be used for travel on the MTR for three days. Then you charge it back up with cash and use it to go on the ferry, peak tram, buses and use it in the supermarkets such as Seven Eleven.
