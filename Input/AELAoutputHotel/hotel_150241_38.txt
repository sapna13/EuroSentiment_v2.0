{"text":"Really liked this hotel My boyfriend and I booked the Hampton Inn for 2 nights pre-cruise. We were very happy with this hotel. The price was much cheaper than most other hotels in the area. Though the area is expensive as a whole. The hotel was clean, the bed was very comfortable, the breakfast was better than adequate, the pool bar area  grill were very nice also. The burgers are huge and juicy. We walked about a block or 2 to Isla Verde beach which was very nice. We also took the bus into Old San Juan. You catch it out front for .75 cents. I would not suggest it. Pay the extra money and take the cab. The bus was packed wall to wall people and the driver had people flying all over the place because he drove crazy. It also took triple the time as the cab ride home. We waited at least 30-40 minutes for the bus to pick us up also and the locals told us that is the norm because the drivers get paid either way so have no incentive to be on time.We did not have any problems with air conditioning in our room. Ours worked very well. It was freezing in the room. We also had no problems getting pool towels. They had an area at the pool whee u get get towels\/dispose of towels. The grill outside does run out of things (certain beer,etc) but we just chose something else then. All in all we had a very good time here and would stay at the Hampton Inn again.
