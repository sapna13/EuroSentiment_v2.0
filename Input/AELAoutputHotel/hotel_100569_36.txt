{"text":"Old Fashioned Atmosphere I wasn't sure what to expect from the Sorrento Hotel after reading other reviews but I was able to book a free night there with credit card reward points and that made it more appealing than surrounding properties. Yes, it is an old fashioned hotel with a tiny elevator and older rooms. However they have been appointed beautifully with luxury linens, coffee makers, TV and stereo, wonderful robes, lots of niceties etc. The bathroom while smaller than other high end hotels was wonderfully equipped with drawer organizers, a scale, hairdryer etc. It was also brightly lit. The desk in the room was a business center with free Internet access and a fax\/printer under the desk. Opening the drawer I found a complete setup with tape, paper clips, stapler etc. The only downside was the AC system. It was a window unit that even running on high all night never seemed to rid the room of stuffiness. This was a 70 degree day in Seattle, I can't imagine what the summer is like. The windows in the room do open but the street noise was annoying. I heard one siren go by early in the morning through the closed windows.The front desk staff was very friendly. I didn't ask much of them but found no fault. I did not try the car service. I parked on the street since it was a Saturday night and avoided the valet parking fee. Room service came quickly and was delicious. I went to the Fireside Room to listen to a live jazz trio. This would have been more delightful if there were more servers. Service was VERY slow. The real mood killer (and this isn't the hotel's fault) was the 10 year old boy sitting in front of me with his parents who were allowing him to entertain himself by taking 30+ photos with a flash digital camera. In a dimly lit room, this was very hard on the eyes. Overall I enjoyed The Sorrento. It reminded me of the Algonquin Hotel in New York City with it's clean and freshly painted but original interior.
