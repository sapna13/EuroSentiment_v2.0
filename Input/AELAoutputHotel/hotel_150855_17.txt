{"text":"Great resort! My husband  I just returned from the Riu Taino. We had booked this trip 5 months prior to our arrival. I had emailed the resort shortly after booking asking for a room on the second floor with a view of the ocean. When we arrived at the hotel  went to check in (which took less than 5 minutes) they mentioned my email that I had sent to them. They gave us a nice 2nd floor room with a nice view of the ocean. We really liked the resort. The food was great. We never tried the restaurants. We stayed with the buffet. The food was always good. They have such a wide variety to choose from. We never had anything that we did not like. The housekeeper did a great job. We left a couple of dollars each day  she did a wonderful job cleaning our room. We also left her some notebooks, pens, pencils, toothbrushes etc a couple of times. The employees at the resort are very nice. The bartender Luis Miguel would see us coming towards the bar  have our drinks ready for us by the time we got to the bar. Very nice guy with a great personality. They do warn you not to drink the water which we did not  did not have any problems whatsoever.We did the Sanoa Island excursion. This was alot of fun. We will do it again next time we go bacl.We plan on returning to the Riu Taino in a couple of years  want to bring our daughters  their husbands with us.
