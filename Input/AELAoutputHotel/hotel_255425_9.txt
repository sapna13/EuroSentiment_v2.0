{"text":"Clean rooms  I thought the Vibe hotel was pretty good  would recommend if you can get a room for about $120. The Vibe Room I stayed in was a decent size  my bed was made everyday with fresh clean towels in the bathroom too. Room was very clean throughout. The Mini-bar was well stocked although I didn't need to use anything - there is a Coles supermarket about 3 mins walk west from the hotel on Goulbourn St if you need anything, Reception staff had no problem finding me some cutlery when I walked in with a take-away at midnight. Didn't get a chance to try out the restaurant but if you are on a budget then the pub over the road has a cheap menu with good food like a thai green curry for $12. You can order a Pizza from room service for $20.Internet costs seemed somewhat overpriced at the hotel, I think it was $2 for 15mins, they have 3 computers in the lobby area so at least the facility is available if you want to pop on quickly. Otherwise there is a really cheap Everywhere Internet place just about one block away (3-5 mins walk) its combined with Gloria Jeans Coffee Shop on the corner of Castlereagh  Liverpool St. You get something like 150mins for $5 or an hour for $3. The banana muffins are nice too ;-)Darling harbour is about a 15-min walk. You can catch a train from Museum station, only a block away, on the corner of Hyde Park, if you don't fancy walking all the way up to Circular Quay.
