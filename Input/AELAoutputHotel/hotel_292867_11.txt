{"text":"Enjoyed this hotel very much!!! First of all after reading the reviews I was a bit nervous about going to this hotel but I truly believe everyone's experience is not the same but I did get a load of good solid informatiion from the reviews that I did read.Upon arrival our room was ready and our bags were taken directly to our room and the trolley that passes by the hotel periodically will get you to anywhere you would want to go around the resort. Our room was very cold and very clean thanks to the wonderful maids like Mirta. Our fridge was always stocked with bottled water and diet soda which is what we requested. The hotel pools and beach were magnificent and the people and staff like Jose from the pool bar were very pleasant and made our stay enjoyable.The breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets were all excellent and always had a good variety of selections and good service from our waitor Alberto who always greeted us with a smile.We took advantage of the resorts tennis courts, shows, archery, pool table and bicycles for extra things to do and they even supplied the trolley to take us to their casino for free which is only 5 minutes away. We went on 2 tours the monster truck safari a full day which was awesome and for the low price of $70.00 per person we did everything including riding on horses and it included a delicious lunch. The other tour was the atv crazy wheels which was a blast and that was 1\/2 day.To shop for souvenirs you best bet is to go to plaza bavarro which is also about 5 minutes away to bargain with the locals and we got good prices for our items including $2.00 key chains and shot glasses. You do pay a one time fee of $10.00 to enter their country and these people work very very hard all day long and they deserve tips and they appreciate anything you give to them.All in all our trip was excellent and you should bring your own suntan lotion and bug spray etc because at the resort they are very expensive. We would definitely go back to this resort in the future and again our stay was truly wonderful.
