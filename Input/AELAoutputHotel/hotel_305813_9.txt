{"text":"TripAdvisor reviews didn't let me down! What previous reviews have said were true! This hotel deserves to be on the very top list of Hong Kong. The room was very well decorated and with a little integration of technology has made it a whole lot better. The only bad thing is that internet is not free.The CISCO IP Phone thing that they have is actually quite fun to play with. Did you know that you can text (SMS) anyone in the world from that phone for free? This made my meeting with friends in Hong Kong a whole lot cheaper and easier. This was the first time that I didn't have to buy a local prepaid SIM card because of this functionality.Fitness center was very awesome. Loved the views. You should go there even if you are not planning to work out.. just for the view.As you know, it's right on top of an MTR subway station and it's only three stops away from main shopping area, Tsim Sa Tsui.Free internet at 5th Fl at Portal is quite disappointing to me. I was there during Xmas 09 and there was not enough machines! And I found out that some machines actually blocked the access to Facebook and some other websites which I don't know why. Later when I used the iMac it was fine, no blocks... strange.The shopping mall next to the hotel has the longest escalator I have ever seen in my whole life. Also, shopping there is also a great idea if you are bored at night. During Xmas, stores close even after midnight. That's what I love about Asia\/Southeast Asia!Staff were very friendly. We wanted to try new places to eat but most of the places were full and had to prebook (bc it's Xmas), staff recommended a place called Goungzhou Garden in that shopping mall on the 3rd Fl. Wow the food at that place was amazing! It's Chinese food but it's also more like a fusion Chinese food more suitable for those who comes from Southeast Asia or Australia I'm sure. Should give it a try.Over all, a perfect place if you don't mind the crowd at the MTR station.
