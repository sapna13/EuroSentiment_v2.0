{"text":"Fantastic value and a well-kept secret LOCATION: The hotel is located just off the north end of George St. It is closer to The Rocks and Circular Quay as well as the new Ivy complex and the nearest train station is Wynyard. ROOM: Upon arrival, we were informed that we had been automatically upgraded to a more superior corner room on the 25th floor. We were impressed with this, as we hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even requested an upgrade. There was a wonderful view of the city from our room and it was well-appointed with a very comfortable king size bed, armchair, ottoman, work desk, lamp, TV (with various cable channels) and wardrobe, etc. There was also a mini bar and ironing board and iron. The design of the room and the whole feel was clean and quite modern. The only downside of the room was that the blinds were quite thin and therefore didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really keep the sun out the next morning. The windows are probably double-glazed but even that high up, it still didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stop some of the noise from the street below from being heard. The bathroom was very spacious and there was a bathtub and separate shower area. The hotel provided toiletries i.e. shampoo, conditioner, moisturiser, bath gel, hand soap. SERVICE: Everyone at the hotel was extremely friendly, willing to help and efficient. AMENITIES: The hotel has a small gym with relatively modern equipment as well as a pool, sauna, steam room and jacuzzi. There is also an Angsana spa (wonderful service) with various treatments and massages √à√\u2020\u2022?we were able to book at a moment√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ notice and were very happy with the service there. DINING: There are a couple of restaurants in the hotel. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get a chance to eat at Charr but at the other restaurant where the buffet breakfast is held) on the same floor, just opposite Charr). Both the dinner and the breakfast were delicious and quite good value and the service was fantastic both times. This is one of the few hotels I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed at that offers soy milk during breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?impressive and rare.
