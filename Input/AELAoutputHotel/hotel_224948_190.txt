{"text":"Flawless Booked a room using Priceline and was lucky enough to get the Omni San Francisco. The hotel pays attention to every detail, and I mean EVERY detail. Upon arrrival at the centrally located hotel, we were greeted by the doorman and others willing to help with baggage. There was a bit of a line at the check in desk and one of the bellmen quickly realized the need for additional resources. After advising those waiting he would secure additional help, he did just that. Soon the line was gone and everyone checked in quickly. The reservation was under my name but they allowed my wife to check in while I parked the car, simply asking that I return to the desk with my ID and credit card at some point durign our stay. Now that is service.When we arrived at the well appointed room, there was a hand written note from the housekeeper welcoming us. That is a first ever!That evening the room was turned down, chocolates were left and the television was tuned to a station that was entirely soothing music and beautiful scenes. Again, what an amazing touch.When we returned to the hotel on day 2, another hand written note from the housekeeper indicating she hoped we had a wonderful day, this time the note was personalized to us (vs. Dear Guest). We visited the bar as well and while the drinks were quite pricey ($15 for a martini) the atmosphere and service were perfect. I would highly recommend the Omni. Many others before me have given high ratings and I completely concurr. Excellent, absolutely excellent.
