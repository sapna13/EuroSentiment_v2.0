{"text":"Nice, but not 5-star This is a beautiful hotel in a great location, with decent service and so-so rooms. If\/when I travel to Bali I would definitely consider booking here again, but will look closer.The hotel grounds are beautiful. We stayed in a garden room with a stunning view of the lush gardens on the hotel grounds. If you like the night sounds of bugs and birds chirping, you will love tihs place. These rooms were also cheaper than the ocean view rooms, which, unlike the garden rooms, were not right on the ocean. The garden rooms were definitely a better value for the money.The rooms themselves are showing their age. Nice decorations and feel, but a tiny TV and an older bathroom are items you don't expect in a top resort. The one aspect of the hotel that was a real turn-off was the system of reserving beach and pool chairs with a towel. Its one thing if you're getting up to get a drink, but another when you're gone for several hours. I noticed a lot of people would do this, particularly on the beach where the number of chairs with shade is limited. I would hope that the hotel changes this policy in the future and limits the unoccupied time to 30 minutes--its simply not fair to the other guests.I was also disappointed when I left the hotel. Taxis are quite abundant in Sanur--just wait for 30 seconds and one will pass buy--and it was our intent to take one to the airport. The hotel first tried to sell us their shuttle (at 3x the price of a metered taxi), and then offered to call a taxi in using their service for 2x the price of the normal metered rate. It was only when we started to walk to the street that the offered to flag down a taxi. It was a shameless way to try and make a few extra dollars.Last gripe: what's up with not having an alarm clock in the room?
