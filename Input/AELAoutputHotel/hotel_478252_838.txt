{"text":"We just got back and MISS IT SOOOO MUCH!! Feb.24th-Mar.3rdMy husband and I just got back from the Bahia Principe, and after staying for one week, we are missing it VERY MUCH!!!As the other reviews state, the resort itself is extremely large and beautifully landscaped. There is a shuttle that brings you back and forth to wherever you'd like to go, and you never have to wait more than 2 minutes for one. We found the guests to be of all ages, which was nice. Lots of families with young children.Lots of Canadians and French also.STAFF:We found the staff very friendly and helpful, although some don't speak english, but don't worry, because most of them do, and are always glad to help you out with anything.It's true about the tipping - it goes a LONG way with the maids and servers, so don't be cheap!FOOD:We found lots of variety at the buffet, especially for breakfast.Just like any buffet, it did get repetetive, but I expected it.Lunch was great as well (in the main dining room buffet). We ate at the beach snack bar once, but were a bit weary of the food sitting out in the heat.Buffet dinners were always good, and the restaurants were even better. Just stay away from the grill restaurants near the beach.Four of us went, and only one got a bit of a stomach ache (but that could be the result of the unlimited drinks!)POOL \/ BEACH:Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous!3 HUGE pools, and the beach is to die for (nice and warm)If you get there by at least 10:30, you should find enough beach chairs. FYI: BEWARE OF OLDER MEN WHO ENJOY WEARING THONG BATHING SUITS!!!  NIGHTLIFE: The nightlife is what you make of it. We had a blast at the shows, the casino, shopping, and strolling on the beach.There's also a small nightclub, but we didn't go. Lastly, take advantage of the excursions, they're worth it. We went horseback riding on the beach, and we rented some ATV's for a few hours and it was awesome.If you plan to book here, ENJOY!! ","annotations":[]}
