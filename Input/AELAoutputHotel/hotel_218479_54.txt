{"text":"Please for your sake o somewhere else.... DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!!! Well lets begin by saying when i ARRIVED I had paid for a prestige room which said that it had an oceanview room and of course never recieved that. The food was nothing less than mediocre, the service was nothing more than a 2 star and the hotel is older than I am. I will give you examples on how they treated me and the group that I went with. We had attended the Mexican A la carte restaraunt and as we got there we were told to wait outside for it was to busy...but looking in there was at least 10 tables available...finally after 15 mins outside they let us in an pointed us to our table, yes thats right I said pointed, not walked pointed. After seating ourselves we had waited 35 minutes to get menus and another 10 mins after that to get drinks, but the reataraunt was not even busy, so I kindly went to the manager and asked directly for menus in english and he resonded in spanish very rudely, but what he did not realize that I spoke spanish fluently and then when I told him that his face went beet red!! The hotel staff was always rude and it felt like it was a chore for them to do things. For the money I paid I would recommend The Bahia Principe....now thats a hotel not this not by far. There is so much more to say but there is only so much room to write, so to end off do yourselfs a favour if you are trying to make a good choice for a hotel take my advice I go away 3 times a year, dont waste your money here its not worth it at all. I am not picky, I just want to expect what I pay for thats all. Its like going to the grocery store and paying for a ponud of tomatoes and recieving a quarter pound!!!
