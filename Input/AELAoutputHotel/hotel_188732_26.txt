{"text":"A wonderul hotel, with wonderful staff My husband and I, along with our 2 daughters, Sophie and Amelia (aged 15 and 11) spent 9 wonderful nights at the Meurice Hotel in Paris in late September. We had travelled from Sydney, Australia. My husband is completely paralysed in a wheelchair (with ALS\/Motor Neurone Disease), so we required a specially adapted room with a shower. The rooms at the Meurice were very spacious with enormous marble bathrooms. There was a separate shower and lovely bath, with beautiful toiletries that were replenished twice a day, along with big fluffy towels. Slippers and bathrobes were appreciated, as was the turndown service each evening. The rooms were beautifully decorated, spotlessly clean, with a really welcoming ambience. There was a stunning vase of fresh roses in our rooom on arrival. We had 2 rooms - next to each other - so the girls were only steps away. The check-in was extremely efficient, friendly and welcoming. Especially helpful at check-in and throughout our stay was Sophie at the front reception. Nothing was ever too much trouble for Sophie and the other staff. Shortly after we arrived and settled in our room, we were surprised with complimentary bottle of champagne and chocolates - and this really set the tone for the remainder of our stay. The rooms also had free ethernet internet connections - a real plus - along with a flat screen cable TV and DVD player. The breakfast room was spectacular - the service was always extremely efficient and friendly, and my husband's needs were always anticipated and met with grace and discretion. We had originally booked another hotel (Les Halles Novotel) from Sydney, but when we arrived at that hotel after travelling for 30 hours from Sydney, we realised we had been very badly mislead about their disabled accessible rooms, despite phoning from Australia 3 times to confirm they had an accessible room with accessible bathroom - as advertsied on their website. Upon seeing the room, we realised it was impossible to stay here: it was impossible for my husband to even get his electric wheelchair into the room or the bathroom. So, fortunately, I had read about the Meurice and we rang them in the hope that they would be able to accommodate us at such short notice. They were - and we are infinitely pleased that our initial bad experience at the Novotel led to us statying at the Meurice. The location is perfect - minutes from eveything we wanted to see. I would love to return there one day and I would unequivocally recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Paris.
