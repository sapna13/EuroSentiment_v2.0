{"text":"Nice and quiet corner of the town We wanted to stay away from mid town but at the same time experience Manhattan. So, my husband and I booked Ritz in Battery PArk. My husband uses a wheelchair so it is important the the hotel room is reasonably spacious and accessible. For the price that we are paying, we are actually getting much more square foot. Many hotels did not understand that we need a roll-in shower, they will tell us that they have an accessible roll-in bath room but really all they have is a additional hand bar. And as I have expected from Ritz Carlton's standard, the Ritz hotel staff is well-trained and totally understood our needs and we did not have problems checking into the room we need for 2 nights.The lobby is very modern and understated, not your typical Ritz Carlton, it is more a business-trip hotel, or that's the feelings that I got. It didn't bother me since we are going out in town most of the time. We just want something that is comfortable and nice.The hotel is located at the southwestern tip of the city and offers a spectacular harbor views. There is absolutely nothing blocking your view and you can see the status of liberty right out your window. But you need to ask for a harbor view instead of city view, it will set you back $50 for that. Each room comes with a telescope but we couldn't get it to work. Parking is expensive, about $60 each day for Valet services. This hotel also has a very neighborhood feelings to it because it is surrounded by condos instead of hotels. You will see people walking the dogs, running, and the presence of police is everywhere. There are not many eateries near the hotel, you need to at least walk a few blocks and there is a grocery\/convenient store that we loved. They serve really good hot breakfasts under $5 and $1 coffee that is awesome. They have snacks, deserts, pastries and hot sandwiches and sushi in a box. Awesome. There is also a new waterfront eatery which is beautiful at night and you can dine outside and watch the beautiful night scene.There is bus stop across the hotel so it is great. We took local bus to travel everywhere in town. In fact, that is the best way to explore Manhattan. Don't join the tour group which you pay like $70-80, because you can do the same thing by just spending a little more time reading the bus schedule and get to where you want as well. Since my husband uses a wheelchair, so public transportation is actually the best way to go, they are guaranteed accessible and it is so inexpensive.Overall, we feel that we are very happy with our rooms and the services are very good. It is quiet at night and away from the city buzz, if that's what you like, you will enjoy this hotel.
