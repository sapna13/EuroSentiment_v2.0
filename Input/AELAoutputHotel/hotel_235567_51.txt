{"text":"Hotel Keppler je t√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√âime Hidden away in a side street off Avenue Marceau lies Hotel Keppler; a trendy boutique hotel with real charm. My experience of Parisien hotels hasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ always been the greatest but the Keppler changed all that. The hotel has been tastefully furnished and the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor is extremely slick. Admittedly, the rooms are a tad on the small side but what they lack in size they make up for in quality. The bed was arguably the most comfortable hotel bed I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever slept in. Just what we needed after a hard day√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sight-seeing! The bathroom was again small but beautifully decorated and fully equipped with all the usual mod cons. Our one complaint was the lack of hot water from the shower.We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° booked on a bed and breakfast basis and the buffet spread was yummy. There was an endless supply of good French coffee, croissants and pastries and the chef was only too happy to whip up a couple of fried eggs upon our request.The staff at the Keppler were extremely accommodating especially when ordering taxis which can be notoriously scarce in Paris. Location wise the hotel is good. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not fans of the nearby Champs Elysees but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a five minute walk to George V on Line 1 or Kleber on Line 6 and in any case the Metro is so easy to use we hardly noticed.Overall, we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° definitely recommend the Hotel Keppler for any kind of stay in Paris after all this is the most beautiful city in the world!
