{"text":"YMMV, (your mileage may vary) Well I must say the hotel is central to the sites you'll want to visit in Florence, but... My wife and I stayed 2 nights, 2 different rooms. 1st nights room #206, faced the indoor roof line, (center of a square doughnut), room was of decent size, double bed, small 13 inch t.v. mounted high on the wall, hardwood floor, thin walls noise outside room came right in and I assume our noise carried back out. But the bad news for this hotel is the bathroom, ugh. Mold in the shower, walls grout etc... the worst was the shower curtain, looked like it hadn't been changed in years, moldy, water stained, inexcusable for an item that retails 5 euro or less. Complained that night to move, but no other rooms available, next morning we were ready to move to another hotel, but they then agreed to switch us to another room that was coming available in the afternoon. Room 202 faced Via Strozzi, so there was a bit of street noise from below, much better room, carpet on the floor, nice double bed, (actually 2 singles put together) - but again, the bathroom, no visible mold... but, you know the smell, this hotel has a problem, I suggest they fix it quickly. Our experience was with 2 different rooms. I would think you can find something better, we choose it out ot the Rick Steves Guide, I would hope he drops this place in the 2007 edition. Breakfast was standard European fare, staff was nice, friendly, air condition worked well in both rooms. But mold, just say no and pass on this place.
