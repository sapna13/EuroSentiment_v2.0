{"text":"Clean, bright and modern Checking in was great, room ready early. Room very nice and clean with lovely toiletries; although it has to be said that we were much too hot despite using air conditioning. Bed comfortable, nice crisp, white bedding. Staff very helpful and friendly, especially young chap at reception who gave us maps and directions, could not have been more helpful.We had choice of cooked and continental breakfast. Good choice of fruits, breads, meats, fish, juices. I am a vegetarian and on first day asked for vegetarian breakfast which when arrived, consisted of tomato, one mushroom, 2 tablespoons baked beans and very small potato cake. This was just normal breakfast without meat but a minute portion. Think they could have given me few more mushrooms and tomatoes and beans to compensate; not very veggie friendly! On second day, waiter got very confused by veggie breakfast and offered us a pancake, which we accepted. Unfortunately when it arrived it was covered with bacon so waiter removed bacon but was unable to remove bacon fat so unable to eat pancake!!! Very nice hotel with very nice staff, lovely clean and fresh but combined with theatre tickets (was in a package) was very costly and room looked right at a brick wall. Would have expected better view for the money.Little bit more difficult to get around from this location than, say, if you were staying at Covent Garden or Oxford Street and this wasnt helped by the fact that there was severe disruption on circle line on the saturday night and on the sunday some stations and lines disrupted because of engineering works (although this was not the fault of the hotel). Just look at map to see if this location suits your needs.
