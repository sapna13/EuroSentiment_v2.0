{"text":"Brilliant Hotel We stayed for 4 nights and though we had booked the 99 euro a night deal, we took the upgrade to the business class room which was even still at a great price. The extras included a room facing the Dom with our own balcony(great place to sit in the evening having a coffee or glass of wine while watching the boats drift by on the Spree), full buffet breakfast, espresso machine, free pay-tv, bathrobes and upgraded toiletries. Worth every penny!The hotel is in a great location and close to all major sites - we walked a lot but also got a great value 'day ticket' and used the buses and trains a lot also as Berlin is bigger than expected. The hotel itself is fantastic and the 'fish tank' just caps off the experience - we found the room to be a good size and well maintained and clean - staff were friendly and helpful - the breakfast kept us going until at least 3pm every day. Also the room had to be one of the quietest we've ever stayed in - we didn't realise how good the soundproofing was until I opened the balcony doors one morning early and was greeted by very loud building site noises...not even a whisper when the doors were closed and never once did we hear a sound from the corridor. We flew into Schonefeld airport and got the S9 train to Hackescher Markt for 2.10 each. The station was less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel and easy to find. Overall we found Berlin great value and very cheap to eat out in - you can literally buy food on the street for a euro or 2 and at night can eat out very cheaply even in the better restaurants. We plan on returning to Berlin sometime in the future and will defitnetly be booking the Radisson again.
