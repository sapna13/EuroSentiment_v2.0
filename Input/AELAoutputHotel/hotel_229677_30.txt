{"text":"hit the jackpot with this hotel Moved in from the Plaza dEspanya to the Condes de Barcelona and thoroughly enjoyed our three day stay there. There were teething problems; the reception staff are pretty inefficient and mucked up the booking, and we accepted the third room they offered, but we still loved the place. The central atrium in the foyer is impressive and the view from the rooftop terrace over the Passeig de Gracia and over to the La Pedrera rooftop was just breathtaking! The pool was tiny but fine for popping in toes! The room was lovely, well sound proofed considering its location overlooking a very busy street.(The Passeig de Gracia is the best shopping street ever!) The bathtowels were the thickest and fluffiest I have ever seen. We had robes, slippers and Bvlgari toiletries. Didnt go for the overpriced breakfast but there is a Jamaican cafe around the corner where we had coffee and a danish for a song. The hotel has two buildings, the second is still a work in progress but we saw one of the rooms and it looked very nice. Bit too much of a building site yet tho.. We only had two gripes; the cushions on the (six) terrace sun beds were inexcusably filthy (the hotel did supply large towels for bathing) and there is no pricelist for the rooftop bar; we paid 13euro for two regular coffees and a bottle of water, nearly fell off the roof in shock!! The staff, while inefficient were very friendly. All in all a great hotel with a great vibe and in the most amazing location for e129 plus 7% Vat for a standard double per night. We're just back and already making plans to return. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":903,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":897}]}
