{"text":"Excellent Stay  My family  i stayed there on 24  25 Dec 2007 for 2 nights in room 2117 to celebrate Christmas (with our friends, total 4 rooms) and we were impressed with the room  services! The staffs at the front desk were friendly  helpful! The room we had has a King Size bed, it is big  comfortable enough for the 3 of us (my husband  i are of average size  our daughter is only 6 years old). I love the toilet as it is big with a bath tub  a separate shower room with mirrors all around! Also we were given complimentary chocolates  small Christmas cake  a Christmas bear which my daughter loves alot, all these little gestures gave our stay a festive feel!As for the swimming pool, it is at 1.1 to 1.3m deep, no children's pool, so not really suitable for family with very young children!If possible, try to book the room with complimentary breakfast, the buffet spread at Oscar's was superb! We had fresh juices which extracted on the spot, the cereals were at least 12 types with many choice of dried fruits  nuts to add! The cooked food were at least 15 types to choose from with Western  Chinese dishes! Plus all kind of salads, breads, ice-cream, candies, waffles  fruits! Our kids were very happy when they saw the dessert counter! Yummy!However on the first day, we didn't manage to eat at Oscar's as it was full  we were arranged to sit on the other side (as my group is big with 12 people)  the buffet spread was disappointing! But on the second day, we were glad to eat at Oscar's  found out the great difference of the buffet spread! So if your room stay comes with complimentary breakfast, try to wait for a table in Oscar's!For overseas friends, the location of this hotel is quite central to the 3 major shopping malls. Nearby is a bus stop to catch a bus to other places  the duck or hippo tours' counter is in Suntec City just opposite the hotel! Food wise, you will be spoilt for choice! I believe it is a convenient location except it is quite a far walking distance to the MRT (subway) station for the time being, the new MRT station nearby is in the process of building which i'm not sure when will it be completed!Overall, i find this hotel excellent!
