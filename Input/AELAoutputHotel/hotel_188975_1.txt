{"text":"Commedy of Errors We stayed at The Four Seasons George V last week over The New Years Holiday for six nights. First the good news, The Aesthetics of this Property are beautiful. I give Jeff Latham a lot of credit. Here is the unfortunate news, this hotel is not worth one dime over $500.00 a night. A Hotel that charges $1500.00 dollars a night needs to pay much more attention to details. A few examples would be the linens are not that great as a true luxury hotel uses Frette Sheets, Not here. A Luxury Hotel provides water at turn down service. Not here, they want you to pay extra for water at $1500.00 a night. Room service was constantly forgetting details of our breakfast order and God forbid you would like an extra piece of bread as this hotel will charge you for it. The Towels are not in good condition and they are not even monogramed. One Vodka and Orange Juice will cost you $38.00 American Dollars. Get the picture. The staff are polite but in a robotic manner as to suggest give us as much of your money as possible and we will put up with you. I can understand why celebrities stay here because the property is very descreet and movie stars have there own staff and do not have to rely on the hotel for services. In the final analysis I would really think twice about residing here for a week like I did as the bill at checkout was almost $12,000.00 and I felt as if the staff were completely cold and unfriendly. If your going to Paris stay at Le Grand Inter-Continental and save yourself a small fortune and the staff may actually care about you as well.
