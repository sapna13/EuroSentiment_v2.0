{"text":"Wonderful trip to Paradise!! My husband and I along with our 2 kids (ages 6  7) just returned from a 7 day stay last night. WE LOVED IT and can not wait to go back. Excellent service from the minute you step off the cab and throughout your stay!! Thank you Mr Caban for the gorgeous oceanfront suite. We loved it!!This hotel is just steps away from the ocean with great ammenities. We ventured off on the island and saw some top resorts but this is the place to stay and as close to a lovely beach as you can get. We will be back next year for another week stay.Our kids loved the yummy treats (fresh cookies, ice cream and etc) at Bananas in the Lobby and I enjoyed my morning iced latte made with Puerto Rican coffee there without having a starbucks. Jean at the concierge desk with a lovely smile and a friendly attitude is ready to guide you to great restaurants and fun things to do. The minute you step on the beach, there are staff ready to set up lounge chairs, cabanas and get you drinks\/food from the poolside bar\/grill (Papayas). Loved sipping on our awesome Pina Coladas made by Luise the bartender at the swim up bar!! Rooms were very clean and serviced each day before we returned from the beach. The room had an oceanfront suite with 2 comfortable large queen size beds, large flat screen TV. We listened to the ocean sounds just steps away from our room. Talk about service...each time we requested anything from guest services, we received a follow-up phone call within 10-15 minutes to assure that our needs have been met and that we are enjoying our stay. GREAT MANAGEMENT and customer service!!All the locals recommended Metropol for good authentic Puerto Rican\/cuban food. It is a very casual place within 5 minutes walking distance from the hotel and we went back several times for the tasty cuban pepper steak and shrimp with garlic sauce. You get lots of food for as little as $10-15 per person. Within walking distance you can rent all kinds of watersports for a very reasonable price (sailing on hobbie cats for 1\/2 hr @ $25 and jet skiing for 1\/2 hr for $65). OUR FAMILY CAN NOT WAIT TO GO BACK FOR ANOTHER MEMORABLE STAY AT THIS HOTEL. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
