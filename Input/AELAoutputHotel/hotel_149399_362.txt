{"text":"Absolutely awesome family vacation We spent an amazing five days at the Melia from July 8th-13th. I read many ratings prior to going and frankly many of them made me nervous. After being there I wonder what some of those people were writing about. It was fabulous!!! We did book Royal Service and I would definitely do that again. With the Royal Service, you have prefered access for reservations at the ala carte restaurants and all you have to do is tell the front desk which restaurant you want reservations for the next day and they book it for you. If you do not want to make reservations, the private RS restaurant-The Gabi, is available for royal service and the food is terrific. The service is also above average. We also ate the the Japenese Restaurant-terrific, The Gourmet(International food) -fabulous, The Dominican Restaurant-very nice, and the Chinese-not good at all!! That is the only negative I would say about the entire resort. With the Royal Service, you also have a private pool which my husband and I enjoyed but you are only a ride away from the larger pools if you like a little more action. Our boys, 14 and 16 liked hanging out at the Caribe pool. There were more teenagers there and they had a great time. The resort is huge. We really enjoyed the walking around, but if you have difficulty walking this is probably not for you. The train that ran from the RS lobby to the beach came very often. The young man that drove it, Benjamin, was one of the nicest persons - always smiling when he saw you.Be sure that the men bring closed toe shoes. They really enforce the closed shoe dress code. And bring strong sunscreen, my husband and son burned thier shoulders with 30. I wore 45 and tanned but did not burn.One night we went to the Caribe Lobby were they had local music and dancing. They have young men who know how to maranga? and salsa and are willing to teach you. After watching for a while, I even talked my husband into trying it as well. Only the ala carte restaurants and the casino are air conditioned, everything else is open air so it is warm. But, I loved it. We were on vacation in a tropical paradise. What makes it so special are the DR people. They are very warm and friendly. From our maid to the bus driver, they all made us feel very welcomed and comfortable and we do not speak Spanish although we tried to use our sons Spanish class experience to learn a little while we were there.
