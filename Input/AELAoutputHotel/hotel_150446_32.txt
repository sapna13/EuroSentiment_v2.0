{"text":"Beautifull Property - Terrible Service This resort leaves a lot to be desired. The place is very, very old. The lobby and public areas have been somewhat re-done. But not to the standards of Intercontinental property's in the US. Check in was a breeze, courteous, and very efficient. Except that I was charged an additional resort tax and fees that where never mentioned when I booked my reservation. A resort fee at a resort that charges a fortune for water in your room, charges for everything. So not sure what the resort fee is for.My room was dated, worn, and torn. The furniture was very old rattan and wood. The french door with mirrors for the bathroom was very 1980. The A\/C was loud and did not cool to well. Carpets where frayed, stained and torn. Not the room that you would expect at an Intercontinental Hotel. It was actually a Jr. Suite with a separate bedroom and living room. Old style box televisions and no mini-bar, no robes, no upgraded amenities. I faces the lagoon. My friend had a room facing the ocean (#820). Those rooms have plasma TV;s and upgraded furniture and bedding. But the rooms (mine was #821) with odd numbers that face the lagoon are old school. Make sure u make it clear ar check in that you want one of the newer rooms.Turndown service is a joke. Its not included automatically. You have to request it. All the do is come in and close curtains. That's it. No chocolate, no refreshing of room. no extra towels. Nothing. Why even offer turndown service if they are not going to do it the right way ?Pool area is absolutely amazing. What a nice pool and bar area. I really enjoyed that part of my stay. Except that the hotel has this crazy policy about (1) single pool towel per guest. You have to sign for it, get a bracelet, the whole thing is in convenient and more Cancun all inclusive $79 a night hotel then 5 star resort. I mean at almost $400 a night on average here. You expect a certain level of service.The chaise lounges have comfy blue cushions on them. But they are all dirty, old, mildewy . and stained. You need (1) towel to cover them and then (1) towel for yourself. There are no bar attendants that come to you. You have to go to bar yourself and get your orders in. Drinks are expensive and taste terrible. Spa was ok. I had a massage with a male therapist. He was good. But they cheated me out of 5 min of my service. He finished earlier. This is not honest and not right. I was upset. But they did not seem to care. The girl at the desk did give me a 5% off for my inconvenience. But an apology would of been better then 5% off. The spa has a relaxation area with bottles of water and tea. But there is no sugar for the tea, no honey, and nothing to stir the tea with. When I asked or honey or sugar. I was told they had none ???Breakfast at Alfredo's is cheap at only $22. When you consider the variety and quality of the food. Its a good deal and the selection is fantastic. I did the buffet every morning and highly recommend it. But the service from the wait staff was mediocre at best. They where slow and no responsive to guest needs.At check out. I had an early flight. I tried to check out the night before. I was told at 12AM that I could not do that because system was in audit to do it in the morning, I tried at 5AM to check out. Again was told that they would charge all to my Credit Card on file. They could not take my cash because they where in Audit. I waited until 5:30AM and almost missed my flight. I had to leave there without being able to pay in cash and they charged my Credit Card. This is not fair as I intended to pay in cash. If this where like any other Intercontinental in the US. This would of never happened. Hotel is in a great location and right on the ocean. If you get a good deal on hotwire or priceline then I guess its ok. But DO NOT pay the rates on intecontinental.com. You will be sorry !!!
