{"text":"Fabulous resort, great service This resort is truly one of my favorites. I loved it! From the moment you arrive, and drive through the beautiful grounds, with golf courses, tennis courts, the view of the El Yunque rain forest, to the lobby and the rooms, I can't say enough good things. The staff was so unbelievably nice and friendly, they are unsurpassed. Constantly asked,what else can I do for you, and was extremely helpful all the time. Called your room to confirm that whatever you requested was taken care of.The grounds are gorgeous, the pools are nice, there is adequate beach with rentals (the surf was a little too rough for us to go out). Several restaurants, five free computers with free internet access in the lobby, a casino, a spa, a lounge with piano music, etc. etc.We rented a car, which I would recommend unless you want to just stay at the resort and veg out. Unfortunately, while the car was parked off premises, someone vandalized it by scratching the doors. That said, though, it happened at a nearby Hacienda, where we were able to drive ATVs through the rain forest. That experience, especially in the rain, was exhilarating, although the vandalism was not.It was a very easy 30 - 40 minute drive from San Juan, and we had a lot of freedom. If you don't have a car, they have a free shuttle that runs every 10 minutes or so to take you to the golf club, some of the restaurants, the tennis courts, etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1380,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1376}]}
