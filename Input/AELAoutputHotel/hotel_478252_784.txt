{"text":"Enjoyed the Bahia We were a group of 8 that stayed a week. Overall the stay was good. We had been in contact with the resort prior to our arrival and much to our surprize we received a free upgrade to the Royal Golden Club. This gave us 1 extra a la carte (4 instead of 3), slippers and bathrobes and turn down service that would replace your beach towels.When people say this resort is huge they are not kidding, many people used the tram service. We would usually walk as with all the stops the tram has to make you don't actually save any time. The resort is so big we left with the feeling that we didn't get to see everything. Food-The food at the a la cartes we went to was fabulous. We did the Japanese, Mexican, Steakhouse and Meditrianian (sp). Service at these we great. Food at the buffet was very hit or miss. There was nothing offered at the buffet that made you say boy that was really good. But it filled the hole. Make sure the hot food is hot and cold food is cold, quite a few times I left food on my plate because it was ice cold and should have been hot.Beach-Very nice, lots of seaweed this week, but the beach was kept clean. Waves were a lot of fun. Pool-Lot of pools to chose from, all very clean. Not much activity going on at the pools. I had read some reviews stating it was to loud and busy at the pools, I'm not sure about that as we could barely hear the music and the only activity was people looking for chairs.Beach\/Pool Chairs-Its true, if you want a chair at the beach or pool in the shade you better reserve it before 7am. I was up really early (5:45am) one morning and went down to the beach to sit there and watch the sunrise....there were people scrambling around in the dark reserving chairs. Actually it was quite comical as they were tripping over stuff and walking into other things.Rooms-Very nice, king size bed, jacuzzi tub...no problems here at all.Entertainment-Surprizing very good, no it is not broadway but still very well put together. We went to every show except the Michael Jackson one and thats because we had late dinner reservatations.Service-for the most part it was very good. Still some strange stuff goes on.. for example we went for breakfest one morning and when we were seated the lady asked if we would like coffee, after a quick yes we were off to the buffet to get our breakfest....I am still waiting for that coffee. Little stuff like that happened a few times..not sure why but not really a big deal. I just asked someone else for a coffee and it was there shortly there after. Another example is if you throw your beach towels into the bathtub the turn down service should replace them. Everytime we did this all the turn down service did was hang them up but our friends in the very next room would do the same thing and get new towels. Again not a big deal we just traded them in at the pool the next day.....but strange service.Weather-2 full days of rain, what can you do, we made the best of it.All in all a good vacation, Bahia met all of our needs. Probably would not return though as there was nothing provided that made this resort stand out from any other AL resort.
