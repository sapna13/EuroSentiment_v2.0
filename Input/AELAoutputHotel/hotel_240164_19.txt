{"text":"Worst Hotel Ever! Inside is my letter to the hotel. No reply... April 16, 2007Casablanca On The Ocean6345 Collins AveMiami Beach, FL 33141Casablanca:My family (wife, kids, and 84 year old mother) stayed in your hotel in room TH12 for three nights (3\/28\/07-3\/31\/07). For a AAA three diamond hotel, we were very dissatisfied with the quality of your property. This ranks as one of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. TH12 was roomy, but certainly not three diamond quality. I left an extensive list when I checked out, but am following up with this letter.The following were unacceptable for any hotel, let alone a AAA three diamond hotel:1.The washer worked, but the dryer did not. No repair.2.The windows would not close correctly in the master bedroom resulting in a whistle. We had to tuck towels around the window at night. Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ help much.3.The balcony outside our room was great, until I saw that it was being held up with emergency braces because of what looks like an imminent collapse. That balcony should be repaired or closed.4.The light switch on the table lamp was missing. Very difficult to turn the lamp on and off. Only I could do it - my wife, kids, or mother did not have the strength to turn the thin wire that normally holds the switch.5.The vertical blinds were in disrepair and for the main one at the sliding glass door, were not closable.6.The stereo on top of the TV did not work.7.The microwave oven on the stove did not work, but there was an extra microwave on the counter as a backup. The main one should be fixed.8.Six light bulbs were out including the bulb in the refrigerator and the freezer. Maintenance came quickly to fix some of them, but not the freezer light bulb.9.The safe did not work. I was credited with the $2 per day charge, but it would have been nice to use the safe. It was a feature that I appreciate having in a hotel.10.There were wild cats in the pool area and in the alley between the pool and the beach.11.The alley behind the pool and beach was a mess. There was trash all over and gang graffiti on walls.12.The whole property looked worn down and in disrepair. It certainlyis not √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≤ew√à√\u2020\u2022?and that adjective should be removed from your name.Our stay here was the first three days of an 8 day vacation √à√\u2020\u2022?perhapsthe last for my 84 year old mother. I was completely dissatisfied with your property and believe that I should receive a refund of at least one night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ stay.I will wait for your reply before I send a letter to AAA and the Better Business Bureau.
