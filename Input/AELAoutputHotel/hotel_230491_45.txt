{"text":"Paris' Best! My wife and I have been visiting Paris frequently since 1998 and this is the single best hotel we've stayed in, bar none. While I have to agree with all of the other comments here about how wonderful the rooms are, the great location, the fantastic bakeries and wine shops in the area, what really sets this hotel apart is the professional, friendly staff. They go out of their way to ensure that not only are all your needs met, but that you are made to feel welcome in their hotel. I am a native English speaker, but get along quite well in French. One of the small things that I appreciate from the staff is that they continue to speak to me in French even after noting that my accent, rather than switching to English. I enjoy their willingness to help me perfect my French!We stayed on the top (6th) floor (yes, there is an elevator) in one of the standard rooms (not an apartment). It was plenty big enough, especially the bathroom. Tiny little balcony was cute, but really too small to make use of, at least for more than one person. There are only two rooms on the top floor, and the single negative thing I have to say about our stay was that the other folks on the floor had no concept of how loud they were!The kitchenette was nice, as it allowed us to keep bottled water, chill some wine, and a few snacks. It's not really robust enough to create a big meal, but who wants to eat in their hotel room in Paris anyway?Lastly, do not be put off by the rate listed here on TripAdvisor or on the hotel website. We were able to get a really good rate by booking through Expedia.We will definitely be making this hotel our go-to choice when visiting Paris in the future. ","annotations":[]}
