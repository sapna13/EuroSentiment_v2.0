{"text":"tranqulity at the griya after checking out the internet for different hotels in the sanur beach area which is where we wanted to stay after staying at sanur on previous trips and seeing how beautiful and tranquil it is walking along the path at beach front to most of the hotels in sanur, months prior to booking our bali trip this year griya santrian would have to been one of my better choices of places to stay in bali after visiting the island for the 8th time and each time staying at different areas! I had contacted griya direct after booking the trip through our travel agent which had alreadygiven us a good price for staying in the beach wing room and asked their customer service people to try and put my son andhe's friend both 16yrs old sharing a twin room either next to our room or close by!! Kadek from griya's customer service had come back to me saying he had up-graded us to the deluxe rooms which were next to each other and what beautiful rooms they were... They were right next to the pool and beach, and sitting on the verandah of a morning was so pleasant and peaceful, just looking out over griya's beautiful and immaculate gardens and everyone walking past would always say good morning no matter what nationallity. My husband and I would go for a quiet swim around 9pm and stay in the pool for over 1hr just to hear the musicians playing and to gather our thoughts, because that is how peaceful it is and you can do that at griya! We all loved every thing about Griya from the staff, the area and the place itself, I cannot say enough about it, definatley will be returning and will tell everyone we know that is interested in travelling to bali about griya santrian and the tranquility feeling you get by just staying there!!
