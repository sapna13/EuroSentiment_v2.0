{"text":"Very disappointing! I stayed at The Brunelleschi Hotel last week, thankfully for one night only. On the positive side the staff were very friendly and helpful but unfortunately this did not make up for the Hotel itself (which certainly did not live up to its fours stars). I would note the following points before considering making a reservation: * the Hotel is in desperate need of a refurbishment: entering the Hotel was not particularly pleasant \/ or welcoming (apart from the staff) - it's quite dark (even on a bright summer's day); the entrance carpets were rugged and old * the rooms: we booked a double room and a single room which were far from spacious; the room walls and carpets were filthy!!;* the bath in the double room was not stable (fixed properly to the base) ; it moved (wobbled) every time you stepped into it (which we had to do to in order to use the shower!* we saw a dirty pair of socks lying behind one of the room chairs (obviously forgotten by previous guests) - the cleaners missed it! * the room windows have no double glazing and therefore noise from the outside was very audible* the terrace, which has views of the Duomo, is small.* Finally: I would not advise driving in Florence - it's a nightmare - but we did rent a car for our holiday because we spent most of our time just outside of Siena (highly recommend the Borgo La Bagnaia Hotel)...it basically took us approximately one hour to find the hotel (thanks to all the one-way systems!). We ended up paying a taxi in the end to help us get to our hotel! the street which the Hotel is on was so narrow that we could not believe that this was a road we could turn into with the car (i think it's called Elisabeth). - As a suggestion, considering the difficulties of travelling in central Florence by car, it would be very wise to get directions from the Hotel beforehand so you don't struggle with the one-way systems like we did!
