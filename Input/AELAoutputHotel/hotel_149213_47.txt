{"text":"If you have already booked, then look away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was our second visit to barcelo bavaro and i wished we hadn't have bothered. We lasted 3 days!! We are really not ones to complain ,but I have never been to a place before where you get a dirty look when you arrive at the bar. I think it would have been easier to just go behind it and help yourself- save them the BOTHER!! Thats what it felt like-it was an effort to then to serve you. I know us Brits are not too great at speaking foreign languages but i knew pleases and thankyous in spanish and asked for everything I could. If you don't speak spanish expext to be the last to be served (whether or not you were the first in the que!) I don't know whether they expected us to learn a whole new foreign language-fluently for a 2 week holiday!?? We always tried to be as polite as possible but the attitude towards us was horrendous. We waited at the pizza snack bar for over 30 mins one day and we were the first in the que! The que built up quick and there were loads of people behind us. When the 'chef'' came out with a load of unordered pizzas he then spoke fluent spanish to everyone behind us the que and passed the pizzas out over our heads! while we stood there empty handed. The other two people in the que were spanish\/english speaking and when he then started to take their order they very kindly spoke to him in spanish and said what about us!! Yes the beach is breathtaking and the view from the room was amazing, but if you are thinking of eating or drinking or need help with anything- forget it!Thankfully we booked up to do a Scuba Dviing course so this was a distraction for a few days- (this we can recommend!!)The rooms are fine also, nothing special.The food was just about OK (when you managed to get served).Like I said ,we have been to this hotel before and had a great time (about 5 years ago). My sister and her boyfriend had never been to the carribean before and with our wonderful memories of this hotel and all we had said good about it, they excitingly booked up. How embarrassed were we?! We had raved on about this hotel so much and it was a total let down when we got there. Funnily enough when we spoke to our rep he was very understanding and didn't put up an argument, he offered us an alternative hotel and we moved on the forth day :Catalonia Bavaro Golf and Casino-(this we could highly recommend!)You work hard all year round just to have two weeks holiday to relax and enjoy ourselves, so if you have booked up already change it or ask for a change, don't put up with it, your holidays are too precious.PS. By the way if you are going at this time of year the resort isn't actually a resort of five hotels, as it is a quiet time so there was only the beach and casino open, so don't think you can go around all the bars and restaurants because they are closed!Sorry if I have spoilt this for you but I am only trying to warn you!
