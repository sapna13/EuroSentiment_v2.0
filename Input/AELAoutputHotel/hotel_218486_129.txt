{"text":"905 Crew Punta Cana Jan27-08 to Feb 3-08 This hotel was not our first choice. But we were 4 of many people who got bumped from Sunscape, or Dreams or whatever its called .The hotel had overbooked Ive heard alot of this over the last 3 weeks This was the choice Nolitours gave us,that or cancel and rebook at another time. We had planned and saved for a girls weekend for a year and we were already to go! So we took it!There are 2 resorts on one. The Barcelo Cana, and the Barcelo Dominican Beach. We were on the Dominican Beach.After reading some of the reviews I wondered where some people had stayed! We stayed in block 98 and were on the third floor. The ceiling was atleast 16 ft tall!! Our room was clean and cool!! I dont know if all the third floor rooms were like that, but if you have the choice, stay on the third floor!! The other half of the party had stayed on the first floor, with low ceilings. This made the room warmer then normal. We had no problems with running water,our fridge was stocked daily,our room was cleaned every day. The grounds were clean, the beach was fantastic and we had no problems getting a seat at the beach or pools! No problems with sand fleas or mosquitos. But then again,maybe they only come out after a rain fall? Kinda like at home?? There was lots of food to eat! Lamb,chicken,pork chops,fish,turkey, hot dogs,hamburgers, and the pasta at the buffet was made to order and you could put in it what you wanted! Fresh fruits, veg,desserts and no problem with getting pop or coffee during meals. I dont even remember having to line up at any of the services.The a la carte resturants were wonderful!! The Japanese is a must!!! The Cafe was great for fancy coffees!The pizza place made pizzas to order! And the was even stuff the the kids would like! Its no wonder people get sick from all the food and booze!!! I dont normally eat and drink like that everyday!The general staff was fantastic! Maid service was fantastic! The grounds keepers were always cleaning,or pruning the plants and always said hello. If I had to complain about the staff, it woud be with the front desk. The didnt make it a point to go out of their way to help you,but the rest of the staff made up for what they lacked.-Calling cards are needed, but pick your times to call home. The phone lines tie up quickly not the hotels fault-You have to ask for a safe key or tv remote. People leaving the resorts tend to think they own them and take them home.-The pools were cleaned every day. -There are lots of palms trees on the beach for those who want to sit in the shade,and at the other side of the beach there are none for those who want to suntan!-Tours are not cheap on any resort! Bring extra money for these-There is a bus that will take you to the local mall,buy your souveniers there or barter on the beach. The gift shop is expensive! Plus they list their prices in Euros. They will take American money,and if they have to Canadian. There is no atm machine on the reosrt,and the one just outside the resort only gives Pesos.-Bring a beach towel or reuse your towels. They are doing their best to save the environment by doing less laundry.- Volleyball,beach excercise,basketball court,tennis court,bikes,big chess boards,playground,We had a great time! Would I go there again? For sure!
