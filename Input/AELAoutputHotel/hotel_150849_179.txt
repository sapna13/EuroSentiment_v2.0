{"text":"Not over impressed We have just returned from two weeks at the Riu Bambu, and were a bit disappointed, having previously gone to Riu hotels in Mexico (I think we were expecting the same good service). I know the following sounds very negative but we did have a good time generally.First the bad bits√à√\u2020\u2022?The Dining room staff seem to be always on the lookout for tips, and just about every mealtime we found that the table had not been set completely. There does not seem to be any organisation where waiters should look after dedicated tables. It seemed like there could be two or three waiters looking after one table and none on the next table to it.The food in the main restaurant is generally pretty good, but it does get to be much the same each day. We went to the Steak House one night and had to ask three times for a menu in English (the third time a waiter asked if we were German for some reason). The steak was quite good, although the vegetables were cold.Several people went down with upset stomachs, but I guess that can happen anywhere. The cocktail drinks at the bars (Banana Mama etc.) were so sweet that we just couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ drink them √à√\u2020\u2022?even the self serve Pepsi and 7up dispenser was very sweet. Most people that we spoke to said that they mixed in plain soda water to reduce the sweetness.The gardeners collect the Coconuts and sell them on the beach, and when we told him we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have change for twenty dollars he promptly brought out a bundle of cash √à√\u2020\u2022?I think he must have had one hundred dollars in change. One morning when my wife was sitting on our balcony, the same gardener brought her a flower arrangement (a Flowerpot with a few leaves and flowers placed in it), and asked for a two dollar tip. It did brighten up the day for us though and gave us a laugh at his cheek.The trips are expensive compared to other places that we have been too, but we booked the Monster Truck Safari and really enjoyed it. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ afraid the cynical side of me has to ask what the children want with all the pencils and paper that we are told to take for them. They must have more than enough with one donation a week, but the Monster trucks travel much the same route every day. Anyway yet again, the children were asking for √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠ollar√à√\u2020\u2022?more than anything. It also felt uncomfortable being told that we could photograph the children taking lessons; I would not want my children to be put on show to a bunch of tourists in this way.There is not anywhere to go √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥ff site√à√\u2020\u2022?by yourself locally unless you take a taxi, but then I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not sure we would feel that safe anyway.Now the good bits√à√\u2020\u2022?.The beach is a very good standard, is wide and goes on for miles in either direction. We took a walk along the beach one morning to the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ælea Market√à√\u2020\u2022?which is a row of huts where locals sell their goods. You can buy anything here from Cigars to Spirits and wooden goods to jewellery √à√\u2020\u2022?don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget to barter though.The beach towels are free (as is usual) and the sun beds are good quality, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see any that had been broken.The Pool√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ were very clean and appeared to be well looked after.The room that we had was cleaned every day and plenty of fresh towels were provided (although some people complained that they did not get fresh ones very often). The room bar was kept well stocked, but we did not use this too much anyway.All in all a good holiday if you just want to relax in the Riu complex, but for us it did not come anywhere near Riu Yucatan in Playacar Mexico √à√\u2020\u2022?we will not be going back to the Riu Bambu.
