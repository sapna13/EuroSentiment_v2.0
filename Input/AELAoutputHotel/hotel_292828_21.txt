{"text":"Great time in Barcelona Just returned from four days at the Prestige Paseo de Gracia. This is an elegant, boutique type hotel (45 rooms) in a fabulous location on Passig de Gracia. The metro\/train station is just outside the door, Las Ramblas was about a 10-15 minute walk. Plenty of shopping and interesting restaurants nearby. The desk staff were very helpful. This was our first trip to Barcelona so we had lots of questions which is why we found the two gentlemen who worked in the ASKMe service so helpful. Alvaro (hope I spelled that right) even helped us with some arrangements before we arrived at the hotel. We also made frequent use of the free internet service provided in the Zeroom. We booked our room on the hotel website and therefore our breakfast was included in the price. The breakfast was exceptional (much better than what we had in Madrid) with delicious fruits, yogurts, meats, sweets and fresh juice. Another nice touch were the free sodas, beers and candy available in the minibar. The room was rather small and the bathroom was downright tiny. However, the bed was super comfy and a joy to retire to at the end of a long day. With all these pluses, we did have a couple of problems. This is a smoke free hotel, however, our room smelled of smoke. Since the hotel was full our only resort was air freshener and opening the windows. This did help but nonetheless, I continued to smell smoke off and on in the room and definitely in the hallways. We had some problems with our toliet which they attended to immediately but it never did work properly. Despite these glitches, we enjoyed our stay here. The ambiance, personal touches and excellent location made up for the minor problems.
