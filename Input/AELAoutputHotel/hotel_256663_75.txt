{"text":"Great Value City Centre Accommodation We chose the Travelodge because it offers good value accommodation in an excellent location. Situated 2 minutes from Museum station by foot and a 15 AUS $ shuttle bus ride from the airport, the hotel has excellent transport links. All major local tour operators offer pick ups from the hotel for a wide range of day trips, and the hotel offers a good information service with plenty of leaflets, brochures and maps available. The hotel is a ten minute walk from Darling Harbour which houses a number of tourist attractions including Sydney Aquarium and the Imax Cinema as well as a wide range of shops and restaurants to suit every budget and taste. There are plenty of dining options even closer to the hotel in China Town and on Oxford Street, which is, as suggested by the array of rainbow flags, one of the main gay social districts of the city and also home to a range of cosmopolitan restaurants. The Rocks, Opera House and Harbour Bridge are all within 20-30mins leisurely walking distance or can be reached by public transport.In keeping with most Travelodge properties the hotel has relatively basic facilities with no restaurant or bar, although breakfast is available. There are plenty of food and drink vending machines and coin operated laundry facilities, and microwaves and basic crockery provided in bedrooms. We found that our room smelt a bit, probably due to the previous occupants having used the microwave, but it was clean and comfortable in spite of relatively basic furnishings. Being high up in the hotel our window did not open, but the room had adjustable air conditioning which made for a comfortable night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sleep. The hotel was always busy and seemed to be popular with organised coach tours which meant the reception area could get very crowded, but the staff seemed to be very polite and quick to help.There are no leisure facilities on site but being right in the heart of Sydney you do not have to venture far to find a wealth of different activities. If you are looking for a luxury hotel experience then this is not the hotel for you, but if you simply want a comfortable base from which you can explore all that Sydney has to offer then the Travelodge is an ideal choice.
