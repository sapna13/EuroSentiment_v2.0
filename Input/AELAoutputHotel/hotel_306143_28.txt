{"text":"Good location but rooms badly need refurbishing This hotel is near enough to Orchard road but not right on it so it is more quiet and feels more neighbourhoody, which is great. 3 minutes walk to the main part of Orchard road and MRT station. Sadly,that's where good things about this hotel stops. I had booked a non smoking room with one queen bed so I was not pleased to walk into a room that smelled of stale cigarettes with 2 twin beds. The room was very old, furniture looked like it was from the late 70s, TV didn't look much newer. But it was super small though, maybe that was supposed to be modern back when they got it in the 80s. I requested for a room change and they said yes they will be right up. I finally got it after falling asleep for a couple of hours waiting for them, literally, no kidding.The non smoking room I got was even smaller than the first one. Can't say I like the linen in this hotel. Duvet was very thin and bed was not very comfortable. Of course I would not be complaining about most of this had I not been expecting a 4 star hotel like expedia said it is, and had I not paid the price I paid. My Singaporean friends all said that I had been majorly overpaying and that if I wanted to, I could've stayed at the all newly renovated York Hotel right across the street for the same price or less.It's a shame that they had let the hotel get this old inside, given they are in a very good location and could do so much better.
