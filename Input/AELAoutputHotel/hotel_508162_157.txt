{"text":"Awesome Vacation My husband and I just returned from Dreams Punta Cana today and I had to write in to let other people know that this hotel was absolutely incredible. I was so worried before we left after reading the reviews of disappointed people, but the overall experience was awesome. The service of the staff is so friendly and they can't do enough for you. The entertainment team are absolutely fun and excellent in what they do. They truly entertain you day and night and you can participate in as many activities and contest as you like to win Dream Money which you can use at the weekly auction for prizes. We had so much fun everyday. The bartenders are so much fun and will keep your drinks coming! The food was better than I expected after reading the reviews. There are 7 restaurants so you can dine at a different place each evening. The bordeaux, oceanana,sea side grill, and the Hibachi restaurants were our favorites. There was only 2 negative that I could say, but wouldn't keep me from going again. The air conditioning could be cooler, but I don't know if it had to do with the incredible heat. The other would be that although we enjoyed our room in building 1 which is on the beach, it is a hike to the main lobby where there are lots of things to do. I would definately go back to Dreams. They make you feel so welcomed. We had an absoutely incredible time.
