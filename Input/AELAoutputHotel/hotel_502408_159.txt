{"text":"location location location Location really is everything here, New to New York, we just took a chance on what seemed like a good spot to base shopping and sightseeing. This is pretty perfect. It's 5 minutes from the nicest part of 5th Ave, 1 minute from a well linked in Metro stop and you step out and see the Crysler building within seconds - on a beautiful winter morning with clear blue skies and gorgeous light that's a pretty great start to the day!Finding the hotel is easy so long as you have the address with you. Fixed price cab ($49) from the JFK made a late arrival easy. It's not huge - and doesn't have a large entrance like the Marriott or Waldorf just close by, but it does have really helpful friendly staff. Their recommendation for local sushi was spot on -tiny restaurant we would never have found without them. Great quality compared to our UK versions (although not a patch on the real thing in Japan still). Red Stone pizzeria, (head south on Lexington) did the best breakfast bagels etc we found). The room seemed a decent size compared to our expectations of New York. Average decor, could do with a little TLC in places, but the basics are great - comfy bed and clean room. Quiet. Nice big mirror for trying on all those new clothes!Tourist-wise it's easy to get about as mentioned above. Do try to book tickets to the Federal Reserve bank if you've got time. They have to be sent to your home address). It's a really different experience.
