{"text":"Perfect but Noise at the Back What a fantastic location! A 2 min walk to Plaza Cataluna and The Ramblas. Have just come back from a 3 night stay. Got the Aerobus from the airport to Plaza Cataluna, only 3.50 euros! Then a short and very easy walk to the hotel. The staff on arrival were ok. Friendly enough. Free wireless internet access and the safe cost 2.50 euros a day.The room we had was a twin at the back of the building. Spacious with two over sized single beds. We even had a little gadget to raise the head of the beds!! (not to sure how useful that is though). The decor was a bit woodchip, but had been painted fairly recently and was amazingly clean. I wasn't expecting any more from a three star hotel. I have stayed in hundreds that were much much worse.The bathroom although not a sparkling new as a higher grade hotel was also very very clean. Marble everywhere. Had a very powerful shower with no problems with hot water.The room had wooden floors which were thoroughly cleaned every day, along with the sheets and towels being changed. Breakfast was a fairly typical spanish hotel buffet but was served till 12pm, which is great for those who fancy a late morning..... which brings me on to my only criticism.There were major building works going on behind the hotel which were very noisy from about 9am onwards so if you are travelling within the next few months, I would try and get a room at the front.Overall though, we thought this was an excellent little hotel and for the location and the price, couldn't have asked for more!
