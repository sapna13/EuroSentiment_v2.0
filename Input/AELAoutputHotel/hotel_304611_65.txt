{"text":"Great stay at Royal Plaza on Scotts, even with teenagers! A family holiday for us (family of 5) normally means staying in budget-priced motels\/resorts. The kids are getting older and probably won't be holidaying with us much longer, so this year we splashed out with a 10-day stay in Singapore and chose the Royal Plaza on Scotts. Despite booking 7 months in advance, this was the only hotel that I could find that had two rooms available on the same dates for such a long stay. I ended up booking directly through their website, which was easy and straightforward. A few weeks before our stay they emailed me, asking if we had any special requirements. I reminded them that we required adjoining rooms and an extra bed in one of the rooms and they confirmed that this had been noted.Upon arrival, check-in was quick and easy. We were put on the 5th floor, handy for the swimming pool. Rooms were adjoining and a reasonable size with king-size beds. Previous experience (on other holidays) led us to expect the kids to argue over who was going to sleep in the crappy, tiny rollaway bed - but no, here in this hotel the bed has a proper mattress and was a standard size single bed, so all children were able to sleep comfortably. The bed was made up ready for our late arrival but we had to remind them to bring an extra set of towels, this was done within minutes of our request. The suitcases were brought up quickly too. The rooms only had showers, not a problem with our older children, but might be if you had little ones to bath each night.The rooms were very clean, bathrooms were always clean, all-in-all we couldn't fault the housekeeping service. The kids loved the way their pj's were folded up neatly for them and teddies placed on pillows! The mini-bars were topped up daily (complimentary beer and soft drinks). On the first day I left a note asking that no beer be put in the kids fridge, instead they replenished the fridge with extra soft drinks. We always had plenty of soft drinks\/water bottles to take out with us on our sightseeing trips, so this was very handy. The staff noticed that we were big tea drinkers and always left extra tea bags and milks. We only needed to ring down to reception with one small problem during our stay; the remote control wasn't working and needed new batteries and this was fixed straightaway. There was no view from the window but we were never in the room long enough to worry about that.To use the lifts and to get back to your room from the swimming pool, you have to remember to carry your keycard with you at all times, but they do give you 2 for each room. The swimming pool was about 15metres long, so ok for lap-swimming, ideal for kids cooling off, plenty of sunloungers and towels available. Clean changing rooms and toilets, and a sauna available. A function room is located on the other side of the pool and this was often in use, but for the staff and business people to get to it, they had to walk along the edge of the pool, which seems to me poor planning and could be dangerous due to the permanently wet floor, especially with the waiters walking back and forth with food and crockery. It was a little off-putting sun-bathing in a bikini with gents in business suits walking back and forth during breaks.The hotel rooms were pricey, but no more than other similar hotels in Singapore, and it's a fact of life for those families with 3 children that you always have to fork out for 2 rooms. So to pay $30+ per person for breakfast each morning, wasn't going to happen! We're not fast-food people, but on this occasion it was very handy that there is a McDonald's and a McCafe located just a few metres up the street. Just a bit further up is the entrance to the MRT, very handy. Outside the hotel, getting a taxi was never a problem, with porters always ready to wave one in for you. Going back into the lobby after a day's sightseeing was always welcoming, it looks so bright and clean with very cool air-conditioning and it always looked lovely at night with the candles lit up.Upon check-out there were no discrepancies with the bill, no extra charges to query which is always a relief. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to family and friends and would gladly stay there again.
