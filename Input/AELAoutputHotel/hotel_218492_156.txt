{"text":"Beautiful Location Just returned from a week's vacation and had a wonderful time. We stayed at the Grand Oasis Bavaro Suites which is adjacent to the Grand Oasis. The rooms are new and much nicer. Absolutely no complaints or problems with the room. Ate at three of the four a la carte restaurants which we enjoyed and would recommend you make those reservations. A nice change from the buffet and more relaxing. We thought the food was very good but did not like their house wine. The staff was very friendly overall - maybe noticed a couple that weren't. I think the only drawback we had was they could not understand English at all and any communication\/correspondence we received was in all languages but English and a few people mentioned this. So not a major problem. Also both my husband and I did get sick and think it was from the glasses they use around the resort.. Last year in Cuba we noticed they used disposeables but here they were plastic that were rinsed - I am sure they clean them properly at the end of the day but they seem to run out of them during the day so quickly rinse them out when you order a drink. All week we carefully used bottled water for absolutely everything but had no choice but to drink out of unsanitary glasses at the snack bars. The pools are all warm and clean and the beach is spectacular. We would definitely go back, but would want to again stay at the new Suites.
