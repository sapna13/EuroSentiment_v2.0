{"text":"Would go back in a Heart Beat! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana the week of October 14-21. We had a great time!! She had never traveled outside of North America before and had absolutely no expectations. The resorts grounds are amazing, and huge, thank heavens for the train that runs around the grounds letting you get your bearings as well as seeing the whole area. We used it many times for going to dinner at the a la cartes as most are located in the Bavaro section of the resort. Our room was wonderful, the beds were actually the most comfortable I have had at any resort in the Dominican. The only thing that I did not enjoy about the room was the tub\/shower. I guess I just don't like not having a door\/curtain, as well as not enjoying looking at myself as I shower in the mirror over the sink. The closet accomadated two women travelling, which was good, the safe is located on one side while hangers are on the other. We were in room 2022, and overlooked the pool, and very close to the beach. The pool was really nice, and always clean. Never had an issue getting a lounger, or shade as there was plenty to go around. I will say this, that the towel guys every morning would go around and place towels on loungers, so those of us who have been around would think the loungers where taken, however being as we were both early risers I can tell you if you see a towel all neatly folded on a lounger chances are its not taken. Very confusing to us seasoned people. Beach is as always amazing, clean, white, and soft. The water was so warm, and just a great place to sun and people watch.Food-we had absolutely no problem with the food. Enjoyed pretty much all of it. I will say that we ate at the Italian on two nights and the first was so much better, but I guess you can just figure it depends on who is in the kitchen each night. I would say our favorite was the Asian, then the Italian, Spanish, then the Steak and Seafood. Did not make it too all of them however we tried, as they close one or two each night rotating them. The buffet for breakfast always had many choices, and I love having a omelette bar!  Shopping, on the resort is very limited, however the prices are not as bad as they are at some others. Coffe is $6US at the resort for a pound, $8US at the airport, and $3US at the grocery store found just up the beach. So depending on how addverturous you are is what you will pay. Venders are as they always are a little bit pushy, Hey pretty ladies Cheapie cheapie, if you are not into bargaining don't go. They have venders that do come to the resort as well for an evening, but they too are a bit pushy and really turned me off.  Would I go back, absolutely. The staff, the pool, and the beach were wonderful. I would try the adults only section next time I think, however saying that there really were not many kids, and it was a great time!
