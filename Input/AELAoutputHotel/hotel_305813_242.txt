{"text":"Just what the Dr ordered Stayed at the Langham Place for 9 nights from 8th November. I had booked the hotel following such wonderful reviews on Trip Advisor and was not disappointed. The trip was a suprise for my husband's 40th and it certainly was a trip to remember. I had booked a club level room with access to the club lounge. When we checked in - not in the lobby but in the club lounge with a cup of tea and a hot towel - they asked us if we'd like to upgrade to a suite. I was quite happy with the room I had originally booked so declined. However, they gave us the suite anyway. So, just keep this in mind. What can I say about the hotel which has not already been reported. The staff are wonderful. Concierge can tell you anything you need to know and give you the easy way to get around. They were just wonderful. We purchased an Octopus card which is the greatest creation going and travelled everywhere by MTR; Star Ferry and Bus. The transport system is one of the best I have ever come across. The location of the hotel is, in my opinion, perfect. The markets are all on your doorstep, I felt safe everytime I went out on my own to do a spot of shopping whilst my husband and son had a swim early evening. We had breakfast in The Place each morning as the variety is so vast compared to the Club lounge which is just continental. But the lounge itself is well worth the extra if you are considering. Afternoon tea from around 3pm- 5.30; Canapes from 6pm - 8pm and dessert from 8pm - 10pm. A good variety of wine; spirits; soft drinks and champagne. As first time visitors to HK, we never tired of sitting in the window with a drink in hand looking out over the skyline towards HK island and watching the light show around 8pm. The two massage chairs in the lounge are wonderful, and have loads of settings including one just for your feet and legs which was much needed after a long flight. Ellie in the Club lounge was excellent - she would arrange anything for you and could not do enough to help which must be said of all the staff. I could go on and on about how wonderful the Langham Place is - however,it would take you days to read! If you need to know anything in particular, please feel free to ask. For a treat of pure luxury in the busy lives we all lead, the Langham is just what the Doctor ordred! Enjoy!
