{"text":"Very homey place The Hotel Casci is a warm respite in the heart of a busy, noisy city. Although it's not fancy, it's cozy, and the staff is terrific. Every time we entered the lobby after a day of sightseeing we were greeted with a friendly, Ciao! The staff was wonderful about helping us book museum visits (before we even arrived) and getting us dinner reservations. The Casci has a library of travel books that can be borrowed during your stay, and even a small selection of English-language magazines. Breakfast was excellent, with Signora Lombardi and an assistant showing us to tables and making sure we had our coffee or cappuccino just as we liked it. Signora Lombardi remembered how I like mine after just a few days, and she even went so far as to get me reduced-fat milk after I saw that she was using it herself (not normally put out for the guests). The only problems we had with the room were that the air conditioning sometimes made a very loud crackling noise which disturbed our sleep, and there was a neighborhood blackout in the middle of the night which resulted in a bright overhead emergency light going on in our room. Other than that, it was quiet and peaceful. The rest of the guests seemed very happy, and there was a nice communal air at breakfast as people compared notes and talked about where they were from. It's not the Ritz, but then again it's doubtful you'd get such familial service.
