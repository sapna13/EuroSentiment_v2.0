{"text":"A little dated but great location The Keio Plaza is one of those older hotels that was once a grand 5 star hotel. These days it's a little more run of the mill. The hotel lobby and surrounds are a little dated but pleasant and functional. We were placed in the older part of the hotel and the rooms showed it. There was quite a bad musty cigarette type smell in the room which initally prompted me to call down and asked for a different room - but the hotel operator didn't understand english and so we kind of got nowhere. As I was only staying for 3 days I decided to just live with it as I knew I wasn't going to spend alot of time there. The decor seemed dated and worn, however the rooms are quite spacious and the bathrooms were really big. The best part of the htoel is the location. Shinjuku is a pretty hip part of town and is Tokyo's only real skyscraper district. The hotel is also right near Shinjuku station which is one of Tokyo's biggest and busiest stations and as such is surrounded by hundreds of restaurants, shops and department stores. Just north of the station is also the red light district - which is unlike any red light district I have ever seen and is quintissentially japanese and certainly an attraction rather than a detraction. In the opposite direction to the station from the hotel is Shinjuku Central gardens which is a nice little park to get a break from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo. Oh and if you cross the park to the northern side you will find Denny's if your craving a little more western style food though even at Denny's it has a distinctive japanese flavour, which after all is why you'd come to Japan!
