{"text":"GREAT VACATION Our first,impression once we landed was it was going to be awful. This was a mother-daughter vac. So, it was very important to have activities for each of us. Somethings that we were both able to attend together. The service desk was very busy, but pleasant. Any questions we had the women behing the counter would try her best to answer and to accomodate us. We asked for a room close to the beach, and she right away changed our location. They could defintely improve the service with more employees. Than, we sat and started to ask about the dinner reservations at the rest. That was the hardest blow,a four day wait for a reservation, otherwise we hould have to eat at the buffet rest.I never encountered such a difficult time making reservations for even one rest. The place was getting to me,but it got better. The servers, the rest.manager and the server manager Alejandro, and Elvis were the kidest and nicest to us eaach and everytime we came in. We felt at home and like family. Their hospitality was top notch. Actually, i didn't want to leave anyone out, they were all exceptional. Than when it came to ask questions about some other things, Jasson was so interested in what i had to say. He always had a smile on his face and always so hepful... These people know the meaning of work and customer service. I would highly advice going here, everything was wonderful. The dancers, the shows,the activities, were to our liking..... We want to go back and visit out friends..... ","annotations":[]}
