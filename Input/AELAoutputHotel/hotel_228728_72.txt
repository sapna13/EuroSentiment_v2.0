{"text":"I've stayed at the best...and this is better! There's a reason this hotel spent years ranked in Trip Advisor√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ top 20 out of 1700 hotels in Paris and it belongs back there. I don't know at what other hotels the people who gave this one bad marks have stayed previously, but I've stayed at Ritz Carltons, Fairmonts and The Breakers in Palm Beach and the service, facilities, and accommodations at this hotel are on par with, if not better than, the best of these.As others have reported, the hotel is in a beautiful building on a nice, quiet street one block off the Rue de Rivoli. The location is amazing! We were five minutes from the Louvre or the Champs Elysees, two minutes from the Tuilleries Garden and its Metro station, and within easy walking distance dozens of great caf√ã√\u2022√ñs, including Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ Angelina with the best hot chocolate on the planet, not to mention the fun and friendly Carr√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Irish Pub across the street! The d√ã√\u2022√ñcor is warm and inviting and the staff is friendly and efficient. We had decided to upgrade to a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠eluxe√à√\u2020\u2022?room and it was a good move. Was the room a bit small by American standards? Yes, but I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in smaller and this one was quite comfortable, with plenty of closet and storage space in the nice, wood wall units. There was ample room to move around, and the flat screen TV was very cool, especially with the DVD\/CD player hooked into it (I could play my CDs through the TV!). Also, it was really nice having windows that opened, but they also sealed up tight and the double-paned glass did a great job keeping out what little noise there was. We also loved the queen-sized bed, from the foam pillows we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° requested in advance to the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®ust right√à√\u2020\u2022?mattress to the soft, cozy comforter. I usually don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sleep well in hotels, but I slept great in this one!I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe read the comments about the showers, and this would be the only thing I might be tempted to complain about. I confess I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not clear on why they wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ just put in a shower curtain or a full glass door on the tub, but I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ assuming there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a good reason. However, the bathroom was very nice and we adapted to the situation with very little effort. My wife decided to take a bath instead of a shower each morning while I shaved, and when it was my turn, we just put down the bath mat and her towel and that pretty much kept the floor dry (the towels are so huge, it covered half the floor anyway!). This was a very minor inconvenience and we were not bothered by it at all.The service was excellent. We took advantage of the free breakfast every morning, ordering pretty much whatever we wanted, and our meal was delivered promptly every morning at the time we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° specified the night before. We had a little trouble adjusting the A\/C (which we needed because it was unseasonably warm the week we were there), but one call to the front desk took care of that. And, the concierge was very helpful, obtaining our museum passes for us and steering us to a nearby √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢abac√à√\u2020\u2022?for the phone card we needed. And, the icing on the cake for this hotel is the pool! In a beautiful room decorated with tile and teak wood, it was actually a bit larger than I expected. It even has those big water √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®ets√à√\u2020\u2022?at one end so you can swim toward them and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ like you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e swimming laps without moving! Not that we were looking to exercise at the end of the day! The pool was the perfect way to relax after several hours of walking and admiring the sights and if you stay here, definitely take advantage of it.Location, amenities, service, comfort, this place has it all. The Renaissance is an outstanding hotel that will help make your special trip to Paris even more so. We will definitely stay there again.
