{"text":"Holiday of a lifetime NUSA DUA BEACH AND SPA HOTEL BALIWOW just got back from Bali , Nusa Dua Beach and Spa Hotel and have to say what a great holiday. Having waited so long to get away from all the stresses of work and such like, i can honestly say this is the first holiday where i felt i could have stayed for at least another week. (was there for two weeks) Normally there is something that always spoils your holiday but this was faultless, great food , great prices, hotel was spotless, (seems they just love to clean) room was attended to at least twice a day and never anywhere ive been have i met such friendly staff, everyone was so kind and helpful. If you are looking for a holiday where u can really relax then this is the place for u. There is a certain amount of night life but not the place to go if you are looking for wild nights but Kuta offers quite good entertainment. One small usual problem which i didnt expect was that you have the same old problem of getting sunbeds round the pool, and as there was only about three familys of the usual suspects at this resort, (you know who i mean ) i guess this is now a world wide problem which cant be labelled at one particular nation. For me and my wife this has been our best holiday ever and would have no hesitation jumping back on a plane tomorrow and heading back for another two weeks of paradise. . ","annotations":[]}
