{"text":"A home away from home We stayed at the Hotel Ungherese one year ago this week and Sabina and Leonardo were the most welcoming and caring people we met in Italy (and we met a lot of great people so this really saying something). Our first night at the hotel and I was worried about seeing the sights and what to do and Sabrina reassured us telling us we had 'all the time in the world.' That night, we got lost on the bus coming back and it was so nice to be able to call and get help. When we called, they told us they were wondering what happened to us and where we were. Coming from the States, this surprised us because here when you are at a hotel, no one cares where you are and if you're lost. It felt like staying with family or close friends. Before we left for Italy, Sabrina made all of our arrangements to see the Gallerie Academie (so we didn't have to stand in line--I really recommend getting your reservations in advance) and the Uffizi (again, I recommend getting the reservations in advance, and devoting several hours to walk through. Oh, and try the cantucci in the upstairs cafe--they're great!). Emailing with Sabrina before we left for Italy added to our enjoyment in planning the trip and made us feel like we were going to visit friends. She also recommended we see the Bargello, which ended up being one of our favorite sights in Florence. Also, had we not sayed at the Ungherese, I don't know if we could have gone to Fiesole, which is so easily accessible by bus. It's worth the quick bus ride to see the great views of all of Florence. Also, the breakfasts at the Ungherese were the best we had on our trip. Wonderful lattes, food, and conversations. My only regret is that it has taken me a year to post this review. We had a great time and think of our experience often and Sabrina and Leonardo were a high-point of that experience. ","annotations":[]}
