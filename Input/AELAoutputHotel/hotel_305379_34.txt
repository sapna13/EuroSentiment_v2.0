{"text":"Nothing Special I was there along with my fiancee in the month of October. The room was so small that we felt suffocated. It was cramped up with the twin bed, side table, main table with a small TV on it. Dont think of spending 90HKD and watching one of the movies. Its not worth it. Did i say carry your laptop? Oh, incase if you are running short on your digital camera space and want to download the pictures onto your flashdrive, dont try the business center. A very small room, with one PC (Running Windows 98). Was a nightmare. Happened to go to their Karaoke? The place is reserved after 9pm for their gambling stuff. No tables can be occupied after 9pm. Location is good, but if you want to try chinese food, please stay away from those restaurants. McDonalds is walkable distance, with tasteless food. Gosh, terrible stay altogether. Only best part was when we were out of the hotel, moving in city.Receptionist at the hotel cant speak in proper english. You cannot change the rooms. Elevators (2 in no.) are small. By the way, i could not have any view of the sea from any of their floors. Why is it called Seaview??Yau Ma Tei is flooded with lot of hotels, and with our experience, no more Dorsett. My fiancee almost broke up with me, coz of the hotel. We would not want to go back to Hong Kong just coz of this living experience. All the best to folks who wud want to spend and live in Dorsett.
