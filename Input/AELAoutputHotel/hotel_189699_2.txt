{"text":"Over the Top Raphael Just returned from a magical week in Paris with my two adult daughters and cannot say enough nice things about the staff at the Hotel Raphael. The concierge group was ever-ready to arrange, to assist, to interpret, to inquire on our behalf - even to order a pizza when we collapsed one night after a long day of walking. We wake up every morning at our respective homes wishing that the Raphael staff was there to prepare the delicious breakfast in such a lovely setting. The Hotel style is Old World - filled with beautiful artwork, lovely flowers on each floor, tres, tres elegante. Yes, the elevator is tiny, but it is the most charming elevator you will ever see. Our rooms were spacious and had a wonderful narrow balcony where we could step out to check the temperature or just watch the world go by. It's not on a busy street, so the noise was just ambient city noise. The bathrooms are deluxe - fantastic showers and the housekeeping staff was incredibly diligent - everything was beautifully cleaned and the ironed sheets were heavenly. The location of the hotel just steps away from the Metro station makes this a great location for exploring the city. There is no dinner service except for the summer season - not a drawback for us, but some might be concerned. You can always get room service or order in. Do NOT miss the view from the terrace atop the Raphael. Although the restaurant was closed, we went up with a glass of champagne on our last night and saw the most spectacular view of the light show at the Eiffel Tower (maybe at 11 p.m?) It was the perfect end to a most wonderful week.
