{"text":"Good place for familes; enjoyed our stay What a great place for families! Great pool, great beach. Good service pretty much everywhere at the hotel with only small issues here and there. Biggest drawback was the closed casino. The hotel will shuttle you to the nearby Gran Meila (15 to 20 minutes) but we're talking small kill some time casinos, not Las Vegas destinations, so even though I did this a couple of nights, it wasn't worth it. Especially not a good idea when the shuttle bus is full getting back to the Wyndham and I had to wait an hour for the next one. Just plan on skipping the casino experience (which was a big drawback because this was a factor in selecting this hotel in March and I never got any notice that it would close the day we arrived). As I write this review and rate this hotel, I have to look past this factor because it made me very angry.When we first arrived, food prices blew us away, but food anywhere in PR isn't really cheap. When you figure in the convenience and extra safety factor, I would say this goes with the territory. Reasonably priced kids menu, but it's limited. That said, we didn't eat or drink ($10 a drink) at the hotel much as a result. We got a small fridge for our room and bought some drinks to keep around. Hard to figure that this was something they would do, but I have to not knock them for high drink prices if they make it easier to have my own. Strange business practice, but works for families.Staff was very nice to us almost all the time. Front desk and Concierge were pretty busy most of the time and didn't move quickly, but that was a result of staff working to take care of each person. They had printed directions to almost everything ready to hand out--very helpful. Valet parking was a little slow at peak times, but that should be expected. We learned to call ahead and they always had it ready to go. This was the nicest (most expensive) resort in which we have ever stayed, so we weren't the big tippers. We focused on being nice to the staff, even when we were tired, and tipping modestly. We were treated well in return.In terms of places to eat, we are apparently just too darn Americanized. Our favorite family places were Wing Hut (next to Pep Boys and North of Hwy 3 at the same turn where Walmart is to the south). Go figure, the standard Hibachi Grill which did a great job and entertained too; Don Pepe: combo mexican and local dishes just west of the turn on Hwy 3 into the resort and Antojitos, a local food menu right on the road from Hwy 3 to the resort. We also stopped quite a few times at the bakery on Hwy 3 which we found to be good food and excellent baked goods and sandwiches. Service was difficult and not well organized, but we still enjoyed it and met one of the owners who was a very nice lady.We organized most of our own off-resort activites to save a little money or tailor it to our needs. You do save money, but you also have a little more stress. All of our activities went well, but don't hesitate to ask for referrals, you'll probably get a good one and that's more reliable than a web site.Other than the casino, we didn't really have anything to complain about and the hotel was full during our stay including some business groups and graduations. Occasionally you might have to wait a little, but if you can check your attitude and recognize when you are tired, you will realize that most of the people there want to help you enjoy your stay. Frankly, I think most of the negative posts on this site are by people you couldn't make happy in a million years. They want a $500 room for $100 and everything to revolve around them. Just know you're going to have to pay up to stay here even if you get a good room rate--this is a great resort and its staff and owners deserve to make a living. All things considered, this was a great resort we could enjoy year after year. And the closed casino probably saved me money and got me more sleep.
