{"text":"Stay here if you can This hotel is FANTASTIC. Such a great location. We looked a number of properties to stay in in Hong Kong\/Kowloon and choose this property for a combination of price, location and the room being offered. We looked at staying on Hong Kong island but having visited during the stay were so glad to have not. You get the best of the buzz of Hong Kong while being absolute waterfront and by far the best view in the house. The nightly light show is right there and you feel like you could almost touch it. You're also so close to everything. It's about 2 mins walk to the underground, 5 to the star ferry and about 30 secs from the start of the shopping. We were on our honeymooon and decided to upsize for this part of our trip (we'd been backpacking in europe) and stay in a junior suite. I'd like to see what else a 'full' suite offered as this had everything. Each suite comes with a butler service which included really nice touchs like a pot of green tea brought up shortly arter arrival which was a blend to help you acclimatise. We had a corner suite which meant the suite had a two section hallway, the main room (which had a sitting area, bed, corner desk area and views of the island and kowloon) a large dressing room, room with the bath and off this a shower room and separate toilet room. I've stayed at other places where a two bedroom two bathroom suite is smaller.The room also had all the appropriate technology components - great television with a nice bose sound system which was mostly hidden away (good sound without being intrusive - both new ideas for hotels), internet line in the desk area etc. The pool area was perfect to chill out in after a shopping\/sightseeing trip and the spa treatments were great. Highly recommended if you can.
