{"text":"Straight shooting review on the Bahia Principe We have just returned from the Gran Bahia on December 30th.My wife and I are 47 and 52 and my daughters are 21 and 19. Although from Thunder Bay ON CAN, we flew from Minneapolis with Sun Country due to the fact that it was much cheaper. Flight was uneventful, brand new aircraft,friendly staff. We have been going for Xmas holidays the last 5 years and have been to Puerto Plata,Aruba,Cancun,and Mexican Riviera.Airport was quick with the luggage.The drive to the hotel was quick and drove through small little towns. Checkin was fast and no problem.The rooms were fantastic, we were in the adults only section.The buffets were great with lots of variety and friendly staff.The restaurants were good with some better than the other, just like the restaurants in your home town.The beach was great with lots of chairs although there were lots of people.Weather was fantastic and only rained for a few minutes one day.You didn't get harassed like you did in Puerto Plata by the venfors.Shows were entertaining,bars were aplenty with friendly staff,room service was great.Checkout and ride back were no problem. Overall, I would go back and recommend this resort.Bring a cheap DVD player-there are hookups on the TVs-buy the upgrade to Golden or Diamond (worth every cent)-if you're buying from the vendors, never pay more than 35%-50% of asking.Learn some Spanish-it won't kill you to learn words like coffee,thank you,please,hello etc.Just think if you were working in a restaurant in Anytown, USA and someone was ordering coffee in Spanish-you would say can't they even learn the basics!! Same thing here. Email me anytime for staight forward answers.
