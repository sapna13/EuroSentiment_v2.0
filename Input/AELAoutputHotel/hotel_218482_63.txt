{"text":"Amazing trip lovely beach! A group of us stayed at the resort from June 27th-July 4th. All in all it was an amazing trip! Flight: was with sky service and I must say that their customer service is not the best. Flight attendants were very moody with the exception of one. Flight was very bumpy and we were all happy to land in Punta Cana! When we arrived at the airport you walk into the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øain building√à√\u2020\u2022?It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ quite a long line because there are ladies dressed up and they literally make you take a picture with them, if you decline you get a wonderful sound (kissing teeth) its funny but be prepared! After all was said and done we took the bus to the resort.Resort: Wonderful so pretty and I wish I was still there! We were checked into Villa 21 which at the time seemed like a long trek from front desk with all our luggage! I have a HUGE fear of bugs and saw several roaches. (gross) I even saw a roach one afternoon by the front buffet crawling near the food with people all around in the daylight. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to think about the ones I did not see. This truly makes me sick, I understand where the country is located this happens, but its gross! Maybe I saw them because I look for them but they dirty buggers are not hard to see and find. The beach is wonderful and water is crystal clear. You will often see fish swimming near you so bring some goggles for a better look! You can rent snorkeling equipment for 20 US dollars for √à√¥√ú hour and you get the deposit back once you return the things but I never did this, as everyone uses the same mouth piece. To get the shade umbrella things you need to be there super early. The nightly shows are amazing and the entertainment staff work very hard. There are activities on the beach as well in the morning, yoga, water aerobics Spanish lessons etc. All lots of fun! Never stayed by the pool it was to hot without the breeze of the beach. LOTS of topless women and kids.. (Shocking to see preteens without tops) so be for warned! Rooms: We got to our rooms around 1030ish. We heard loud banging and wondered what it was. Looked out the window and there was construction going on. It continued late into the night and finally at 1am we called downstairs and requested a new room, which was given to us the next day. Be warned the construction is loud although no cranes are visible and you head banging and talking even through closed doors! We got 2 rooms in villa 7. This resort seems to have a problem with having rooms with 2 single beds but they will gladly bring a separate single bed to your room. The rooms are ok you get a small fridge which never seems cold enough but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ always stocked with pop water and beer. The rooms are never cleaned before noon and honestly they could be cleaned better. The first night we check into the hotel there was sand in the sheets, and it was not from us! The water was always cold, apparently they had issues with the hot water so if that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not fixed make your showers fast lol! They have a HUGE tub in the room but it looked dirty and gross so if you want to use it maybe bring Lysol wipes and you can clean it yourself you will be happy you did! The shower is small with visible mold in it. All this being said you are on vacation and you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ spend that much time in your room. There is no clock in the room. There is a TV but you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get many channels, maybe on the royal side you do but we did not. We did one day trip and it was a long one 750am-715pm but we are so happy we went to the island. Some troubles on the island but its not worth writing about becasue being there makes up for everything!Staff at the resort dont all speak english which makes it hard but if you take your time talking to them it all works out! If you stay at this resort you will have an amazing trip, all resorts have things wrong with them but this is truly a wonderful resort and I would go back even with some of the problems I had. ps There is a market thats a 7 dollar cab ride from the resort and you can get amazing deals. The people there at first seem pushy but when you get to know them they are as sweet as pie!!
