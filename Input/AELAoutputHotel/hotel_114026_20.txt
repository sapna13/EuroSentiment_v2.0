{"text":"Room 1714 Great location and friendly staff service - bring earplugs Stayed here for 3 nights in mid-February during Pan Am Soccer week when hotel of choice nearby was full. Stylish lobby, and then the battle with the elevator security card keys begins to get to your floor. Ask for two sets of keys and expect to turn them in periodically when they don't work in the elevator or your hotel room door. Room was ok - city view cheapest level with nice bathroom and toiletries. Free room safe, and bless them, an empty mini fridge that actually kept drinks and snacks chilled! Didn't need to beg to have the mini bar cleaned out like most hotels I stay in.Room wear and tear visibile with cracked floor tiles and some scuffs on the furniture but quite serviceable with plenty of drawers and closet with ironing board and iron. Another smart thing - the duvet is cotton instead of down. Don't understand why so many hotels in hot climates think guest are impressed by down duvets so you can sweat all night.If you have time and the budget skip eating the boring breakfast here and go across the street to the Halekulani for the fabulous buffet, ditto drinks at sunset.Things you'll need to stay here - earplugs that damped the chorus of dumpsters being emptied, delivery trucks going into the Sheraton next door and tour bus backing up that start at 6AM. The empty bottles get emptied at nearby restaurants and hotels between 3am - 4am. And then the construction crew arrives at nearby hotel being revamped and starts precisely at 7am. If you are an early riser this is fine, but don't plan on sleeping in. Also the plantations shutters don't really block out the light so bring a sleep mask along too.Do not get into a taxi anywhere in the city unless you know that the driver A) speaks a few words of English and B) is carrying change. Take lots of small bills with you in case of B. Also limo drivers hang around the hotel with vulgar large cars seeing short trip customers to earn some cash. No meters, so if you take a limo be sure to agree on price up front. Drivers not very friendly and the cars cannot get in an out of driveways easily so opt for the metered taxis once you know the driver speaks English ","annotations":[{"endOffset":120,"mention":"Pan","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pan-bagnat"],"startOffset":117},{"endOffset":450,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":446}]}
