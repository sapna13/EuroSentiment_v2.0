{"text":"5 star? Yeah Right. I stayed at the Observatory Hotel in Sydney with my fiance in Feb of this year. We booked a romantic weekend getaway. First off, reception couldnt find our booking and were not apologetic for having us wait 20 minutes until they found it. They then told us the room wasn't ready, even though we were checking in 3 hours after check in time. We had to wait a further 40 minutes to get into our room. We were not offered any refreshments while we waited and when we finally got to our room, our luggage wasnt even there yet!We thought that would be the last of our problems!It wasnt!We ordered room service which didn't arrive for an hour which would have been fine if the order wasn't cold and, alas, wrong. Throughout our stay, staff did NOT make us feel welcome and also stuffed up a request from my fiance. He ordered chocolates and flowers to the room for 8pm the Saturday evening. By 9pm they still hasnt arrived so when he asked staff about it, they had no clue and could only organise a plate of strawberries - three of them and 2 were old.Upon leaving, there were several problems with the bill and check out took over 15 minutes. A few days after arriving home, we received a late charge of $120AUD for the minibar which we did not consume. The hotels manager tried to tell us that we had when in fact it was his staff's incompetance.I wouldnt bother with this 5 star dump. Try the Intercon Sydney instead if you want a slice of heaven.
