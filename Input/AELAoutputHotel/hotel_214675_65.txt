{"text":"No problems at all at Maile sky court My wife and i booked this hotel thru NWA vacation packages, and we read all about the Maile sky court on here before we left, not aware of the great time that was ahead of us.The worst part of the hotel was getting there, dont take a taxi, it was 40 dollars from honolulu intl. to the maile sky court, instead take one of the shuttles for 9 dollars each, much better way to go.The hotel itself was great, and after reading of all the problems on here of the elevators and jacuzzi's, we found both to be spot on.We never waited more then a few minutes for any of the 3 lifts that were on our side of the hotel, the other 2 lifts went to higher floors, we were on the 17th floor, and yes the room was alittle small, and i would compare it to a motel 6 type of room, with a small bathroom, really for only 1 person at a time, also the furnishing were few, and out dated, but you know what! who cares really about these, we only slept in the room, and we spent all our time out in the beaches, and restaurants of the area.If you go out the right hand side of the hotel, walk up to Keo's for breakfast, or continue up the street to Eggs and things, there was a 45 minute wait there, and so we went back to Keo's and glad we did,It is only 1 block right of the hotel, and had a great breakfast.The beach was only 10 minute walk straight ahead thru a park like area, and it drops you off at a public beach, where you can go left or right to the hotels area.On Friday nights at 7:30 sharp there are fireworks at the hotel to the right, as you go to the beach thru the park, There are all kinds of ABC stores around, like 2 per block and is a lcal joke of there being so many, and you can really find anything you want there almost, we bought wooden place mats to lie on in the beach areas for only $1.69 each.Tons of great restaurants on the main strip that Ohana is on as well, also there is another main strip 1 block up from Ohana, Highlight of the trip was walking behind the hotel 1 block to the canal and having the wife spot a 10 pound puffer fish swimming near shore, it is also just a nice walk along the canal by yourselfs, with very little people, not unlike the 2 main strips, which were packed.We had absolutly no problems with the hote, rooms, or staff at all.The staff were very helpful, both at the info booth, and the front desk.The info booth guy did try to sell me a timeshare presentation but a firm no, and do you have a map please, welded a great response from him.Also must say, that we have never had a hotter shower then here, the water was HOT instantly, and never seemed to run out.We checked out the pool and hot tub area, and both were working great and the hot tub was HOT, the pool was a bit on the small side, but i never used it anyway, preferring to go for a swim in the ocean.I wouldnt go to the bar there though, it seemed to be a locals kind of a place, and really stank like a bar, like really old beer and old smokes.It was on the 5th floor and there were a few people that looked like locals in there.You only need to use your key to go up in the elevators not down, hence how they got there i guess.Would recommend this hotel for everyone, and would come back in a heartbeat.
