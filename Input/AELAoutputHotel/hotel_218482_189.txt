{"text":"Beautiful Hotel My family and I stayed at the Catalonia just before Christmas for two weeks. Having been to the Dominican before, I brushed up on my spanish - however, found for the most part that the staff spoke english quite well.The grounds were very nice, there was a tropical storm the first week and the ocean turned up quite a bit, but staff cleaned the beach daily. The pool is beautiful and alot of fun. Activities are in abundance, from snorkelling to ATV's (which we recommend). There is shopping in the resort as well as a short walk to some venders on the beach.The restaurants were very good and even my picky eaters enjoyed the food! I highly recommend trying all the restaurants!I was a little worried after seeing some pictures about cleanliness. However, I did not see this. But I suppose if you're looking to have a bad experience you'll take up close pictures of whatever proves your point. (and might I add... this IS a third world country... everything is different, and not the same standards! its part of the experience - maybe, be humbled and grateful!)If I was going to say anything negative it would be; the resort is away from populated areas - so, you will have to travel to see anything else.And there is an age group gap in the activities - kids club goes up to 12, then the other activities are directed towards adults. So, if your teens are okay keeping themselves busy and won't get bored, your fine.All in all, I would recommend this resort.
