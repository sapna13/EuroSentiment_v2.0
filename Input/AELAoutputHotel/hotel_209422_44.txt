{"text":"Prince Kuhio - good value and stay. We just returned from a 9 night vacation stay at the Hilton Prince Kuhio. Booked a very cheap rate at the hotel website several months in advance. We arrived late afternoon and within seconds had the key cards to our executive level - oceanview room on the 32nd floor. Front desk staff was welcoming and efficient. As reported, the rooms are freshly decorated with a lovely bath, linens and large HD flat screen tv. We encountered no negative staff experiences from any of the Hilton employees. Restaurant, lobby, bellman, housekeeping, executive lounge staff were always friendly and welcoming. We ate the the MAC 24\/7 restaurant for two meals during our stay and had good food and service. The location is 2 long blocks (closer to 3) from Waikiki beach, just diagionally behind the Marriott Waikiki Beachfront Resort. Two downsides for us -- (and so subjective of course, as everyone has their own preferences on vacation) -- the pool was disappointing for us. Large patio with plenty of loungers . . . But --- No umbrellas, or cabanas -- so shade most of the day was non-exsistant. And no poolside wait staff or service. (which they show on the Hilton website) There is a pool bar staffed with a bartender, but we like to rent a cabana and spend the whole day lounging, eating and drinking - without having to leave our lounge chairs when we want a break from the sand and surf. No can do at the HPK. Also, the lobby bar, which is lovely to look at -- never opened or closed very early every night. One could go to the restaurant and sit at the counter for a drink, but not the same ambiance for a night cap. Those two things -- will probably take us back to the Marriott, Royal Hawaiian or Hyatt on Waikiki, which we have stayed at on previous visits and not back to the HPK. But generally, one gets what one pays for -- the Hilton Prince Kuhio was $100-$150 per night cheaper than what we have paid at the afore mentioned hotels for an oceanview room, poolside service, cabanas, etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":650,"mention":"MAC","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Macaroni"],"startOffset":647},{"endOffset":1726,"mention":"Royal Hawaiian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Royal_Hawaiian_Hotel"],"startOffset":1712}]}
