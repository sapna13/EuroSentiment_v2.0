{"text":"Great Vacation! We stayed at the Excellence Nov. 22-29th. We took are two young adult children as our last family vacation together. The resort was very good! Required to pay $10.00 a piece at the airport. We rode on the tour bus to and from the airport - it took about 1 hour 10min. each way- with no stops in between. The roads arent that bad - but my daughter did get car sick. Everyone was friendly at the resort. Our kids were upgraded to the Excellence Club - they enjoyed the extras. We felt that it wasnt worth the money. We could go to their room, use the same beach and pool as they did. Our room was on the 2nd floor Excellence ocean view room. It was big with two sliding doors. Great view. We always tipped - and they are very grateful for $1-$5. I think that they would be nice and friendly either way. Make sure to bring plenty of money (dollars) there the ATM machine only gives pesos and they dont give out dollars at the front desk. We didnt have any trouble with finding chairs at the beach. It seems like everybody wants to be at the pool instead. The water is rough - but if you walked to the left of the resort on the beach and go to the bend t(big piece of wood in the sand) the water is smooth and great for swimming! The horseback riding was fun. The spa was the best! The foot heaven and excellence massages are the best! The food was good. Toscannas and Oregano we liked the best! Michael Jackson concert was good. We didnt see any mosquitos or bugs - probably the time of year we went. Best prices on buying stuff - see Paco at the resort store in the back. He gave us some great prices and better quality stuff!
