{"text":"Loved it! Stayed at the Mandarin Oriental hotel with my daughter as a weekend getaway. We had reserved a corner Hudson view room and were upgraded at check-in to a Central Park view room on the 46th floor.The view was fantastic! The window had a full view of Central Park. The Trump International hotel took up just one small corner of the view off to the side. The park really commanded the view. It was great!The plasma tv with DVD player and laptop capability was very high tech. The tv was programmed with a special welcome message which went away after use. The plasma tv in the bathroom was a nice touch as well. The all marble bathroom was nice with seperate shower and big walk in shower.The service was awesome. From the room upgrade to the doormen. The doormen were at the car as soon as we pulled up, welcoming us. Upon departure, I forgot to call in advance to get my car so it took about 5 minutes (no big deal) for them to retreive it. The doorman offered us bottled water while we were waiting since it was a hot day. The front desk person showed us to the elevator and then handed off the key, offering to carry my shoulder bag up to the room. We ordered room service and it arrived in 30 minutes. The food was good. My daughter called the front desk for bubble bath and they went out and bought some, delivering it in a cute bag.The lounge in the lobby was excellent. My teenage daughter was excited because we actually met a couple of celebrities who were staying at the hotel.
