{"text":"Awesome My wife and I stayed at the resort from May 28 thru June 8. From the moment we landed we were impressed. For some reason I was expecting the airport to be small, dark, and dirty. However, the airport was beautiful, and everything went smoothly. We booked thru Expedia with the hotel transfers. The van was waiting for us and off we went. We were the second of four stops, and after about 30 minutes we were at the hotel. The ride was entertainment in itself as we almost ran over a few folks on scooters, and narrowly missed sideswiping a few other vehicles.As we arrived at the lobby, we were once again impressed. It was beautiful. Check in was smooth and fast. We got lucky and got a second floor room (deluxe) in Building 30 with an ocean view. In addition, it was right next to one of the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢rain√à√\u2020\u2022?stops, so my wife was happy she didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to walk very far for anything. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know it at the time of booking, but this was off season and one of the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢rains√à√\u2020\u2022?was out of service for maintenance. Even so, the train was pretty regular at around 20 minutes.The first week it rained almost everyday, but sometimes for only 30 minutes. However, when it rains, it pours. I enjoy the rain, so it mostly didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother me. The only effect was that the entire resort is very slippery. All the floors are marble, and even the wooden walkways and stone pathways were very slippery. I slipped and fell the first night, but luckily no harm was done. If this resort were in the USA, it would be a personal injury lawyers dream.All food and drinks were excellent. We tipped most everyone, but I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see many others doing so. It appeared that the service was excellent whether you were tipping or not. As mentioned above, this was off season and some of the restaurants and entertainment were closed. However, we never had to wait for anything, and the place wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ crowded at all. They gave us 3 ala-carts but we asked for a fourth and they gave it to us. We had no difficulty in making reservations and always got the day and time we wanted. In fact, the ala-carts were more than half empty each time we went. They were a great break from the buffets. I thought the Mexican was the best, but my wife like the Spanish. In the Seafood restaurant, I ordered the steak and the lobster ($31). They were great. The Italian restaurant was our least favorite.Casino √à√\u2020\u2022?Bwaa ha ha ha ha ha. Always empty. Very limited choice of games. $10 minimum. Doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even sound like a casino. The best part about it is the CASINO sign out front.I highly recommend the Limon Lagoon VIP tour. I thought I had my moneys worth just by the bus ride and trip to the top of the mountain. Throw in the rum drinks, cock fight, langostine lobsters, Cigar rolling, horseback riding on the beach, secluded beach swimming and the lagoon boat ride and it was a real bargain.For shopping, if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to walk, take the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢rain√à√\u2020\u2022?to the royal suites lobby, and you can walk next door to the shops. Behind the shops on the beach is a little city. We found that the better prices were in the shops that were not on the beach.Return thru the airport went smooth and the wait was comfortable. The only snag was that when you first arrive, one of the airport personnel were pretty adamant to know if you had any mamajuana (a Dominican local drink). My wife had bought two bottles for gifts, and when we showed him, he damaged the packages. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ notice at the time that he also broke the seals, therefore, half of each bottle leaked out before we got home. Make sure you check it before you put it back in your bags.All in all, it was a great trip, and a great value. ","annotations":[]}
