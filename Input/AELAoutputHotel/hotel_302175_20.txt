{"text":"Works for families We went to Hong Kong for 8 nights and then on to Shanghai and we stayed at this hotel as it was one of the only hotels that don't charge for 2 extra kids if sharing existing bedding. Please note though that we intended to buy a air mattress for them to sleep on, but don't bother looking as they don't exist in Hong Kong. So make sure to bring one with you if bringing kids. I read from other viewers that this hotel was out of way, this is far from the truth. Except from staying at the Shereton or Penisula which are in great spots,amd 3 to 4 times the price, i think that the Regal kowloon Hotel is in a wonderfull spot near very good hotel's like the Mandarin and interconinental hotels.The rooms are small and be sure to get the upgrade to a least the superior room. We payed $1000 hong kong per night, the cheapest i have seen is $950 on wotif.com. The Hotel looks like it was state of the art in say the mid eighties but hasn't got out of that era!. Lot's of gold splatterd throughout the lobby and lifts, does look a bit tack y. But at the end of the day it is clean, staff were helpfull and we found the spot great. as we didn't get breakfast included we found the Delifrance excellent over the road. They sell a hot breakfast with coffee for only $24 hong kong dollars, we ate there each day for the 8 nights we were there. Also there is a starbucks right across the road and a seven eleven for all needs including wine or beer\/spirits. don't use mini bar!. I would say hotel is approx 700-800 meters to Nathan Rd and can travel this in the underground subway if raining. Make sure to ask for room with harbour view, we were in room 605(great view). There is only a handful of rooms with view as there is a big glass building in front.i would say only 4 rooms per floor have the harbour view like on their website.Thera are also many western restraunts\/bars around this hotel and only maybe 100 meters from the harbour where their is the boardwalk and view of light show on every night at 8pm. Much better spot than a lot of hotels in Kowloon up Nathan Road which is grotty and where you get hassled by hawkers. I feel Kowloon is the best place to stay as you get to look at the wonderful view over to Hong Kong island. I think Nathan Rd is tacky and dirty.I much prefer Hong island for the shopping and wonderful restraunts near the peak esculator.To travel across to Hong Kong island is dirt cheap by ferry or MTR Train. Get an Octipus card from the Train station that you can use on trains and buses everywhere so you don.t need cash. We took kids to the Science and Technology Museam which is only approx 400 meters from Hotel, worth a look. Be sure to go to Stanley Market over the other side of Hong Kong Island a beautiful spot right on water, be sure to have a seafood platter at The Boathouse, very resonable and delightful. and was the highlight of my trip. Families or people who want to have good western restaurants right on your doorstep where you can eat from Mcdonalds's to great steakhouse Restaurants on yor doorstep this hotel for the money is very hard to beat.Happy HolidayCheers ","annotations":[{"endOffset":682,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":674},{"endOffset":682,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":674},{"endOffset":682,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":674},{"endOffset":682,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":674},{"endOffset":682,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":674},{"endOffset":682,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":674},{"endOffset":682,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":674},{"endOffset":1266,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1260}]}
