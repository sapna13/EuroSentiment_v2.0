{"text":"Nice central hotel. Being a 17th century building, we were not expecting the hotel to be like the Ritz, and were prepared for the small rooms, so-so bathrooms and lots of little quirks, and as we were only there for one night it was never going to devastate us if things were a bit less than perfect. Having said that, it is fair to warn others who may be staying longer that there are some things worth considering. Looking back on others reviews, I would say that the vast majority of comments are very accurate and I would say look closely at them and see if anything commented on is a 'deal breaker' for you.We were in room 40, which is situated at attic level involving going outdoors over a small section of flat roof to reach the room. It was slippery due to damp weather and if you are at all infirm or intend to go out drinking while you are there, request in advance that you are not given this room. The previous reviewers have comprehensively covered the main issues with this hotel. There is no soundproofing between rooms and we couldn't get to sleep due to a noisy group who talked, laughed, argued, and in the childrens case, whined, long after bedtime. It was loud enough that if we had wished we could have chatted with them without raising our voices much. Be warned...take earplugs just in case you are an 'early to bed, early to rise' type. The room itself was warm and clean and the bed was very comfortable, but the bathroom in number 40 is horrible, very damp with mouldy tile grout. The bathroom itself, other than needing some serious work on the grout, was adequate and was otherwise clean with a good hot shower.My children stayed in room 42, which was at the front of the hotel, again at attic level, and had a nicer bathroom. They all commented on the comfortable beds.As commented elsewhere, the staff are amongst the nicest I have ever come across in a hotel, and were extremely accommodating. Breakfast was more than adequate and everything appeared to be fresh. I would stay in this hotel again as it is very central and in a quiet street without a lot of hubub. The aforementioned prostitutes in the window at the other end of the street do exist but, hey, it is Amsterdam and it is not a sign that you are in a bad and dangerous area. One word of caution for car drivers. There is metered parking on the street, but if you overstay your time, they do clamp in Amsterdam, as parking spots are at an absolute premium.
