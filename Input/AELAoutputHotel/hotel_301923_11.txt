{"text":"Bring your own clubs I stayed at the Nirwana for just 2 nights, I have recently taken up golf and needed to get my fix after a month long holiday. And my husband and I needed a break from the budget hotels\/hostels we had been staying at for a couple of days. Let me first begin by saying this place is gorgeous, the grounds are beautiful, views of tanah lot, the waves crashing on the black sand beach, and the sunsets here are breathtaking. The room was very clean and large, linens and beds, comfortable.Location: Far from everything, extremely secluded. Impossible to walk anywhere from here. This hotel was good for a few days of relaxation by the pool and having a clean shower :) but not really the best way to experience Bali for your entire holiday. But this place does cater to the crowd that likes to be pampered, so if that's you book away. Prices: For a 4 star resort in the west, excellent. However for Bali, way expensive. It's all relative, I suppose. The food is western prices, and very western in taste (i.e. burgers, pizzas, rib eye). Again depends on what you are looking for.Golf: The only complaint I had was with their club rentals!!! I went out on the driving range the day I got in, with their rentals, which were so old and heavy, i felt like i was using dumbbells, I did not bring my clubs with me so I had no choice. The next time, I asked if they had a better set for me to play with on the course, and they did, they showed them to me and they seemed a bit better, though not what I'd expect at a 4 star resort but when I asked if i could take them out on the driving range to practice with them, they refused. I knew I would be disappointed with my game if i went out with those clubs, especially with the provided caddie watching so I cancelled my tee time. :( Staff: For the most part very friendly and attentive. Though sometimes staff can get a bit too attentive. Just make sure you put up your do not disturb sign when you're in your room. Spa: I did not check out the spa here, I took a look at their prices and decided not to bother. I could get a massage for what they were asking back home. After being in Ubud for a week paying less than $10US for an excellent 60 min. massage, how could you expect me to pay $80 here. What I can say is this place loses that extra star, because of the details. Old club rentals at the best golf course in Asia, uninteresting cuisine, staff that don't let you relax, (must've knocked on our door 5 times within our 1st hour), Old tv. Little things that can easily be overlooked given the beauty of this place. But it is a bit stale for Bali, if you want to see the real Bali, do not stay here, if you are here to have a clean shower and relax by the pool then yes this is the place for you.
