{"text":"Beautiful I recently stayed at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort  Spa Phoenix for a medical conference. Let me start by saying that this place is magnificent!! The scenery was spectacular and the grounds were well maintained. The rooms were nice and cozy with modern day d√ã√\u2022√ñcor. The bathrooms were contemporary and spacious with large showers for two. The restaurants located on the premise were a bit pricey ($20 for hamburger  fries), but the food was very delicious. The staff was at your beck and call. The pool scene offered everything you could imagine or want (multiple pools, water falls, hot tub, lazy river, torch fountain, and even a small water slide). The location was also great as there was a shopping complex with many restaurants and attractions directly across the street from the resort. Although I was there for business, I was certainly able to enjoy a great deal of pleasure. I only had one negative situation to occur, which had been previously reported by another reviewer. After leaving the resort, I just so happened to check my credit card statement (as advised by another reviewer who had a similar situation), which revealed a $2 phone charge. First of all, I never used the phone in the room. Secondly, I found out that the call  fee was placed after I had checked out and cleared my bill. I had to jump through a few hoops to prove my innocence (when it comes to hotel fees, you are guilty until proven innocent) and eventually get the charge removed. I believe that it was a honest mistake on Marriott√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ part, however these post-check-out charges that show up on your credit card statement seems to be a recurring theme. So I would advise everyone that after having a fabulous time at the JW Marriott Desert Ridge Resort  Spa, check your bill and statement for a possible unexpected surprise.
