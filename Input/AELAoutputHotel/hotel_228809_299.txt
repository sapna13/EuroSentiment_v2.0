{"text":"Wonderful Boutique Hotel This is not an exaggeration! This place is really a must stay. It is two blocks from the Arc de Triomphe and metro. One block away from the Champs Elysee! Location usually means expensive prices or seedy accomodations. The Royal Magda has all the benefits but none of the disadvantages of a ideally located hotel! It was my mother's birthday and I wanted to take my parents to a nice Paris hotel for their first visit to Europe, but I did not want to spend a fortune. I searched everywhere until a found the reviews for the Royal Magda. It looked amazing on the website, so I decided to book. It was also quite affordable. With all of this going for it, I was quite anxious that the hotel would be completely booked, but they had one room left that met our needs!When we arrived (in the wee hours of the morning), all my expectations were exceeded. I found the pictures on the hotel website to be true to life. The staff is wonderful (especially Yohan who helped us through flight cancellations). The hotel accomodated us without interruption for one extra night when our flight was cancelled. The rooms are clean, pretty and modern (flat screen television). The bathrooms are so clean and HUGE! There is also cute little bar and dining area. You can eat breakfast in the hotel but we did not so I can't really say how it was.I will be staying at this hotel the next time and every time I come to Paris until I start making enough money to stay at the Ritz. Even then, I may still choose to stay at the Magda!
