{"text":"Beware. Alila will bump you for more profitable bookings. Picture this...it's the first day of your honeymoon, you have just travelled 20+ hours and have arrived to check in to your hotel. You hand over the booking voucher, which has a confirmation for 5 nights, only to be told that your room will only be available for 2 nights. The initial message from the hotel was that there was no confirmation sent, and no record of the booking. When I pointed out that I had all booking numbers (sent to our travel agent by the hotel!) and confirmation receipts, one of the members of staff let slip that they had a wedding party in the next day. This was something the hotel obviously knew about, and could have told us months before. This could have allowed us to amend our plans with ease. Unfortunately, because they decided to stick their heads in the sand and hope for the best, we had to change our holiday plans at the last minute, and quite frankly I was disgusted.I think a hotel which manages to reduce a newlywed bride to tears on her first night of honeymoon deserves to be named and shamed.If you decide to go to Alila be aware of these things:The rooms are small and not very private.The beach is black volcanic rock.The food is pretty good, but overpriced as you are a bit of a captive audience.The management will become mysteriously scarce if there is a problem, leaving unfortunate local employees to cope.Bali is a wonderful country. We visited the Chedi Club, and Four Seasons. Both are absolutely fantastic (especially Chedi). So please dont be too put off!
