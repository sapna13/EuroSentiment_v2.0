{"text":"The Royal Ripoff Just got back from what was supposed to be an ultra luxurious, care free vacation experience at the Paradisius Palma Real in Punta cana. We booked the Royal Service in order to give us that extra level of service and unfortunately this is where they fell short. I have traveled extensively but never felt so compelled to leave a review, but our experience and those of many we met warrants this evaluation. Grounds: The setting is beautiful and well kept. The pools are large and have built in Jacuzzis and the temperature is always comfortableRooms: Good size and clean. But don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ take for granted that they will make the room every day. Turn down service was also inconsistent. Minibar was kept well stockedFood: Acceptable for an all-inclusive but for a supposedly 5 star resort is marginal. The buffets lack for presentation and service is poor. The restaurants are much nicer but the food no better. The restaurants will not seat you without a reservation even if there are few people there and are unaccommodating.Activities: Very sparse for an all-inclusive, very little going on at any given time. The evening shows where low budget and low quality. The casino is uninviting and everyone from the dealers to the cashier were downright rude. Water sports staff was extremely rude and difficult to deal with. Had a miserable experience parasailing. They charged $85 for a 10 minute ride on the parasail the whole experience took over 2 hours because they crowd you on a boat like cattle with a bunch of other people.Annoying time share people: They are everywhere and do not leave you alone. Very devious in ringing you in. They should not be given the run of the place.Royal service: It is anything but. One guest put it best when referring to the bracelet they have royal service guests wear √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂t√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ like the scarlet letter√à√\u2020\u2022? Their website is extremely misleading about the level of service offered. They make it sound as if everything is taken care of for you. We saw our butler on the first day and never again. Reservations for dinner were never made and we had to fight on a daily basis for a palapa by the pool. In my opinion the bare minimum of any vacation is to have seat in the shade by the pool and be able to eat at your convenience. Both these cannot be taken for granted at the Palma Real. They have no problem telling you sorry you cant sit by the pool today come by tomorrow and we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l see what we can do. A few individuals were very nice and friendly specifically Pedro at the pool, and a few waiters but for the most part they made you feel unwelcome, almost as if your presence was an inconvenience to them. Many we met at the royal service pool shared the same feeling. Some even went to complain but nothing was done. Security: We heard about several thefts while we were there so lock up all valuables including cell phones.In summary I would not recommend this resort unless your expectations for service are far below what they promise on their website. My suggestion to the ownership is to give the staff a crash course in customer satisfaction ","annotations":[]}
