{"text":"Bad food and drink...and lots of cream...spoiled a great trip The best thing about Iberostar are its incredibly dedicated and friendly employees. Next, the subtropical plantings and multitude of peacocks make for a lush, humid and quite colourful setting. A great deal of care involves maintainance of the physical plant, and it is flawless.While there are activities such as snorkling, tennis, shopping, and group exercise by the immense pool, the main components of a tirp to Bavaro are Sun, Sea, Relaxation, swimming and eating, which may be done ad nauseum practically 24 hours a day. Drinks, including alcohol, are free, which is nice for hydration, and suprisingly, I didn't see anyone passed out around the bar.American-style food is almost non-existant; every dish is tempered by creams, jellies and what my daughter refers to as wilted cheese. Many items are pickled inexplicably, and may have been recovered from a nearby shipwreck. :)....If you simply want to relax in a free-form atmosphere, this is a great place. However, we spent the first 2 plus hours searching for a room that didn't smell of mold. Accomodations are on par with an American budget hotel that needs renovation and an air purification system. The better sleep arrangements would be in pods near the pool, which leads to a commodious beach. A short walk connects everything in the Bavaro complex.Note: Speaking Spanish will help you communicate with employees and in understanding television programs. NO clocks, radios, or turndown service is available as far as I know. Its an all-inclusive. We traveled via American Air to Miami....then a 4hr layover before a four-hour flight to the Dominican republic. At the airport, expect antiquated (non-hip-hop) native music, and many employees looking for your euro or USD. Be careful as you would in any airport. This is a charming one, with thached roofs. Also, the trip from the airport to the beach is a lesson in harsh reality, and the good life of the beach is in harsh, direct contrast with the status of the local villages.
