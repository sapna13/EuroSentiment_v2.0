{"text":"Just Lovely My husband and I drove from Vermont to see a Red Sox game, and spent one night at the Doubletree Guest Suites. We booked the room on Priceline and were pleased at getting such a good rate. When we arrived at the hotel and went up to our room, we found a beautiful 2-room suite with TWIN BEDS in the bedroom. Priceline had given us no indication of this, of course. Well, this wasn't what we had in mind. I called the front desk, and a very pleasant young man listened to my story. He could not have been more helpful. I've seen that with Priceline reservations, people don't know what type of room they're bidding on. You'll want a different room, of course... let me see what I can find for you... I have a room with a king bed on the 6th floor. Would that be all right? Goodness, yes, I replied; what will the extra charge be? Oh, no extra charge, ma'am, we're happy to accommodate you. Rarely do I see this level of service when I travel. What a pleasure! The hotel itself is beautiful, with a center atrium, 14 floors, glass elevators... beautiful views from the room of rowers sculling on the Charles River in the morning. The hotel's shuttle brought us to within a 15-minute walk of Fenway Park, which was very helpful. The suite itself was roomy, spotless, with plenty of room to sleep, work, relax, snack. Big screen TV in living area, second TV in bedroom. Mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker were very welcome. My ONLY quibble with this hotel, and many others -- in this day and internet age, it's silly to charge ($10\/day?) for high-speed internet. It would be like charging for telephone or TV 30 years ago. Lesser hotels all over the country offer internet\/WiFi for free; it's time for the Doubletree (and the Boston Four Seasons, for heaven's sake) to do the same. In any case, this hotel would make a wonderful base from which to explore Boston.
