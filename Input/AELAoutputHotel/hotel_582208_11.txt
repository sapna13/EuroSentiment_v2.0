{"text":"Over-rated; a shame as could be great Stayed in 2 different rooms as was in\/out of HK over course of 10 days in April\/May. Second-stint was a suite, which cost almost as much as any luxury hotel room in HK. A suite it wasn't, just a normal room with another half-room bolted on with lots of empty\/dead space. There was no-where to put my suitcase or unpack except against a wall miles from the dressing area near the main door. The closet, on other side of the room was squashed into the desk\/work area. Despite this design flaw, someone did ensure there were 3 TVs throughout the suite. As other people have mentioned, it can be very noisy - the suite is a corner room facing Wyndham Street, so less noisy than the rooms facing LKF. I had an early arrival and room not ready, so I had to pace throughout HK for a few hours in the morning (not a big problem but a place to shower or get changed would have been nice). Similarly, when I departed for evening flight and wanted to change from sweaty clothes\/suit I was offered use of the staff loo, which required finding someone to get a key -- there isn't even a washroom in the lobby, let alone a changing room. I heard 2 different customers complain that their fancy shower was leaking water throughout the bathroom. My gripe is that I almost killed myself by crashing into some silly glass partition in the middle of the bathroom. For these prices, the hotel's accommodation is inexcusible. Oh, and the coffee is horrendous. It's a great location and could be a great little hotel. I cannot recommend it.
