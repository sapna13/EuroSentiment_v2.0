{"text":"Padma was awesome Husband and I went to the Padma Hotel in Bali for 8 days at the end of March 2008. I've stayed at the Padma before in September 2005. This is the 6th time in Bali for both of us. Stayed in a deluxe room on the 2nd floor. A bit disappointed that our room was not ready on arrival but we got put in a temporary room for about 1 1\/2 hours. Location was really good for us - 30 minute walk in to Kuta, restaurants along JL Padma are excellent - recommend Bianco - chocolate volcano dessert rocks, Indo National for cleanliness and awesome cocktails and super cold beer at Posers Bar. Legian Pub staff were also really friendly - drank ourselves stupid on cocktails our last night to pass the time until the midnight horror flight, Agus from the pub was great company. Anyway, the Padma. Well the breakfasts were exactly what we hoped for. Massive amounts of different foods, really clean set up. The waffle and pancake stand was sugar heaven for me. Staff in the breakfast area could not do enough to feed us and make us happy. It's a huge outdoor area and duh! of course it's busy. The hotel has about 400 rooms. But there is never a short supply of food, you might have to wait a whole minute in line once or twice - big deal. Custom made omlettes to boot. We paid about $22 (AUD) each to go to the Japanese restaurant at the hotel - Tenkai, for a buffet dinner one night. Must be said I am a bit of a girl when it comes to Japanese food. I was blown away. It was bloody fantastic food. I could not get enough. And the green tea\/ chocolate pudding thing for dessert - I am still dying for more of it. We usually never go more than about $10 per person for dinner in Bali but holy moly this was so worth it. Highly recommend it. Hotel is quiet, gardens beautiful and clean and security at the gate 24\/ 7. The pool area is large (don't listen to anyone who says it's not - rubbish!) and no there is not an abundance of towels draped over the loungers in reservation. We got a selection of good seats by the pool every time we went there. Staff friendly. Room clean and spacious. Hallelujah, there are DVD players in the rooms now. Highly recommend the Ambiante Reflexology spa about 200 metres from the hotel too. Padma was great value and above average by far. Going back again in September. See you then!
