{"text":"We Loved This Place!!! Staying at the Aqua Palms was an amazing experience! We came for our honeymoon and were upgraded to the deluxe room which had a lovely lanai and a pretty decent view (we were on the 9th floor, so no view of Diamond Head, but we didn't care). This was our first time in Hawaii and we were happy to see that all of the hotel staff were very very friendly and accomodating at all times. The room was quiet and very clean, our bed was big and very comfortable, and the microwave and small refridgerator came in handy. We never heard any noise from other rooms and the only time we heard construction noise (they are doing construction across the street) was when we kept the door to the lanai open. Our room had it's own AC control so we could stay as cool as we needed to in our room, but the temperature in the hallways was pretty hot.The elevators are quite slow, but there are three of them so we didn't have to wait too long to get on one at any point. The free breakfast of danish, yogurt and juice was a nice touch and we liked the fact that we could either have it delivered to our room or take it to go on the days when we were heading out early for various island tours. The pool was a bit small but we never used it because we preferred to go to the beach, which was a short walk away via the Hilton Hawaiian Village across the street (the lobby of that hotel has a lot of cool birds and fish, so it's definitely worth walking though). The front desk at Aqua Palms gave us free use of beach towels anytime we needed them, so that was a great bonus.The 24-hour coffee shop next door had really great food which was dirt cheap (cheaper than McDonald's) and if you mentioned that you were staying at the Aqua Palms and showed them your room key, you would get an extra 10% off!We never rented a car, so the bus system came in quite handy for us, it was affordable and it took us anywhere we needed to go.Since the hotel is located a fair bit away from the heart of Waikiki, we were always either the very first or the very last hotel to get picked up and dropped off from for the various tours and fishing trips that we took (they all provided transportation to and from the hotel).For those on a budget, there are coupons everywhere! Anywhere you go, you can pick up different brochures with coupons for food, tours and attractions, which come in very handy.All in all, we would definitely stay at this hotel again!
