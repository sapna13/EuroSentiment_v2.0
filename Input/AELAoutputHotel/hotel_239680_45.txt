{"text":"The Best little 4 star in Paris Returning to Paris for the 5Th time I wanted a small boutique type hotel rather than the large 5 stars I had used before. The staff alone make this hotel worth staying at. I was badly let down by a local restaurant ( The Cafe L'Homme ! )  the day before my trip emailed the hotel who gave me many wonderful suggestions for special occasion dining at every price level. Pascal  Karin were the perfect hosts. They assisted us with referrals, reservations and transfers. We arrived a lot earlier than planned  dallied around the Champs Elysees for longer than was required for our suite to be ready. When we returned Pascal stalled us for a few minutes so ice could be renewed for our champagne and candles freshly lit in the room ( more Four Seasons than 4 star ) Everything was simply perfect.The address is a great point of origin for all sights and the buffet breakfast was of a very high standard. Whilst we had no need to avail of room service we noted the prices were more than decent. In fact the minibar was such good value for a hotel we availed of it - which is something I usually never do. We had the loft suite, which included a comfortable seating area  a wonderful multi-jet massage shower. A view over the rooftops of Paris  yes it did have an Eiffel Tower view whilst it was just about the top 5Th of it you couldn't complain - you know if the staff would bring it closer they could.
