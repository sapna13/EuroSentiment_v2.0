{"text":"Wonderful Hotel, not dissappointed! We stayed at the Hotel during the weekend 6th Oct to 8th. After extensively searching Tripadvisor hotel reviews I liked the look of this hotel. I booked via Eurostar package (the best rate for this hotel). I initially upgraded from a standard room to a superior room and had requested a room with a view, but was told on arrival that the superior rooms were on the courtyard side of the hotel. So if you do want a room with a view be aware of this. However, I was not dissappointed with the room. It was gorgeous, albeit smaller than I had expected from the pictures but still elegant, clean and a little piece of luxury. Our room (double) had a magnificant bathroom that could be accessed from either side of the room with a bath, separate shower and two sinks. Our friends had a twin room on a different floor, again very tastefully decorated, with a corner bath. Both rooms had products, clean towels, hairdryer, iron and ironing board, tea\/coffee making facilities (if your English\/Irish dont add milk to the tea, its better without, or better still take a couple of teabags with you), lovely little touches all round to make your stay pleasant and comfortable.The staff were excellent and couldnt be more helpful. We needed to get to the other side of Paris for an excursion and as it was a wet friday night we needed a taxi. They fell over themselves trying to get us a taxi, three phones dialling and even had someone in the street trying to hail a taxi. Now thats what I call service. Breakfast! Expensive if not included. We chose to have breakfast on the Sunday as we were returning early, 18 euros, be aware that this price includes cooked eggs (whichever way you want them) it is not very clear that you can order from the waitress and it is included, we helped ourselves to the buffet and ordered scrambled eggs and bacon. My friend had omelette. If you do not want breakfast dont order just tea, 5 euros!! The hotal reception is quite grand and has internet access if your interested in that. The bar is very expensive!!!!!! The location suited us, its not far from the Moulin Rouge or the Sacre Coeur.We loved it as our fist time in Paris, and if you want style\/comfort than the Terrass is definately worth the 4 stars. I would definately stay there again.
