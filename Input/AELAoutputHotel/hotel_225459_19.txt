{"text":"Nothing but problems!!!! This hotel is truly the worst experience we've had on our trips to Hawaii. This hotel is rated highly but the rooms are dated, with many maintenance issues that are not fixed satisfactorily. Our room stayed in the mid-seventies although our thermostat was set on 65, so the extra money we paid for an ocean view was lost as we had to keep our curtains closed to try and keep the room cool. The bathtub drain didn't work and you stood in a foot of water taking a shower - how did they clean the tub with that? While it got fixed, the toilet leaked all over the floor, while at the same time making an incredibly high shreaking noise every time it was flushed. The toilet had to have a part ordered - are you telling me that a hotel with twenty plus floors does not have extra parts for toilets - the most commonly used facility in the hotel?? We were unable to access the internet, had to have someone come in and physically turn it on, yet another time we had to wait in our room to get something fixed. The elevators - they are secure - but when you are supposed to go up you go down and vice versa. One day we had to walk down from our floor to get out of the hotel because the elevators weren't working. We were offered to change rooms but since we had already unpacked, the inconvenience should not be placed on us. This hotel is NOT anywhere worth the money we paid for it and definitely NOT anywhere near the rating given. The response from management was non-existent and the lacksadaisical attitude from the front desk staff was just insult to injury. Whether a family or couple, this is an awful hotel. The pictures are deceiving for the rooms, what you pay for and expect is NOT what you get. ","annotations":[]}
