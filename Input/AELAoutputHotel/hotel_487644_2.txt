{"text":"Fantastic Hotel - Deffo Going Next Year I was booked a trip to barcelona from my mum for my 21st and travelled out for 4 days in august this year.taxi ride was about 25 euro if not less (think i just over tipped) although trains and metros are easy to come by! i bought the rough guide to barcelona book, found the street point at it to the taxi driver and away we went!People in the hotel were so friendly its amazing, and so fluent in languages, kindly let us into our room at half 11 which was nice and clear and sunny - view not the greatest but your there to sight see not to look out your window for 4 days.The breakfast looked really good shamefully we didnt try it as we wanted to do so much but ven on our last day they looked after our bags for 8 hours, kept passports sepearate in a safe and let us go off on our way booking a taxi in time for us to be at the airport.they gave a lot of help regarding where to go what to see what ever.location wise about 3 min walk from Hospital Clinic metro stop, which was out of action ( only till 10th august then back working again) however the bus worked fine!We even walked to las ramblas one night which took about 20 mins but it is an amazing walk along.the is the industrial school ( i think this is the name) up the top which you are free to walk around along with local supermarkets which are cheap.i am going to go back to barcelona next year in winter and definatly plan on staying in this hotel again as its cheap, cosy yet close to everything.really good place to stay :-) ","annotations":[]}
