{"text":"A piece of paradise We stayed at the Oberoi from Monday night to Friday night during the week after the U.S. Memorial Day holiday. It was absolutely outstanding in nearly every respect. The hotel staff was incredibly courteous and helpful, from the gentleman who picked us up at the airport to the concierge who arranged our departure. We loved our ocean-view lanai, which felt luxurious by U.S. standards and had an incredibly wonderful, peaceful, romantic feel to it. One tiny quibble was that the wifi\/internet was expensive, and not that easy to use, but who really wants to surf the net when you're in Bali? The Oberoi pool and beachfront is fantastic -- the kind of place you can lie for hours (we did) and enjoy their drinks and food. The Oberoi sits on one of Bali's most fabled beaches, and it is quite spectacular. Definintely try to attend one of the dances or performances they put on -- they're well-done and fun. We also took advantage of the Oberoi Spa for a couple of treatments and a yoga class, and used the gym there as well. All were first-rate. We also booked a tour of Ubud through the hotel which wasn't that great; next time, we'll book our own cab and explore on our own. The restaurant was excellent too, especially the breakfasts and lunches, although don't forget to walk around Seminyak to try some of the other places. Bottom line -- you will have an unforgettable and luxurious vacation if you stay at the Oberoi. ","annotations":[]}
