{"text":"Good for the Budget Traveler We arrived in Sydney on New Year's Eve and had difficulty finding a reasonably priced hotel for a few nights before we moved into a holiday apartment. We found the Cambridge through the Qantas Ready Rooms site. At first I was a little put off by the location, but discovered that colorful Oxford Street has a lot to offer. There are many superb eateries and coffee shops that are inexpensive and delicious. The hotel is a five minute walk to the Museum stop of the rail system and close to beautiful Hyde Park. We did not roam around at night, which might be a little scary. However, during the day, it was fine. Our room was of decent size , however, it was a little dark and damp feeling with high windows(from the floor) that looked into another building. But, it was clean, quiet and proved a good place to crash after a full day of sightseeing. The bed was extraordinarily comfortable -- I think the best we experienced in our 8 weeks of travel. We enjoyed the extra couches in the room for reading our tour books and maps. Yes, the elevators were a pain, as stated by other travelers, -- small, slow and unpredictable. It took us 15 minutes to get from the 4th floor to the lobby to check out with our luggage. But, overall, for the price and the close proximity to the center of the city, this is definitely a good budget option for travelers. I would stay there again.Coffee at Gloria Jeans is a must!I recommend great Thai food at Wagamama one block off Oxford on Crown Street, just a couple blocks up from the Cambridge.
