{"text":"A perfect stay ! We stayed here for three nights at the end of May.The hotel is on the outskirts of Amsterdam in a quiet leafy street (adjacent to the Hilton).The room was large and was decorated in classic neutral colours.There was no chest of drawers but one was brought to us within ten minutes of asking ,along with extra hangers.If you like to use a powerful hairdryer then bring your own.They have a turn down service in the evening where they leave an apple on the bedside.Tea and coffee makeing facilities are provided although there is only powdered coffee creamer.The safe is large enough to take a lap top and wi fi is available in the rooms.There are also two computers in the basement for guest use.Everywhere is spotless.We had a meal in the restaurant and although expensive 88 euros (no wine three courses ) the food and service were excellent.It is the staff that make this Hotel so exceptional as at all levels they are friendly, helpful and courteous.They will recommend places to go, arrange tickets etc There was a charge on our bill for doing this but it was quickly removed.Get the hotel shuttle from the airport (buy the tickets from the connexxions desk in the arrivals lounge 19 euros return)These are 8 seater minibuses and take only 15 to 20 minutes to the hotel.Go left out of the hotel and then right over the bridge and this brings you to an area for shops, newspapers, cafes restaurants and a superbly stocked organic supermarket.Broms the hardware store sells tram ticket strips (15 for 6.80, most trips use two strips).Van Dams is great for Breakfast 3.00 for a large bowl of fresh fruit, yogourt and granola 5.50 for a bagel with salmon and cream cheese.Everything is fresh.La Joffiers across the road is more expensive and not such good quality.Palma is an authentic Italian restaurant (no pizzas) which is first class.this is a lovely area for a relaxed holiday and the centre of Amsterdam is only 10 minutes away( catch the number 2 from the stop just past Van Dams or turn left out of the hotel go to the end of the road turn right and catch the 5 or 24 at the Appollaan stop) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":494,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":494,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":494,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":488},{"endOffset":565,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":559},{"endOffset":565,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":559},{"endOffset":565,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":559},{"endOffset":565,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":559},{"endOffset":565,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":559},{"endOffset":1659,"mention":"bagel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":1654},{"endOffset":1832,"mention":"pizzas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1826}]}
