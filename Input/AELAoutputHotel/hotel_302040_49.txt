{"text":"I am seeing Green and Rolls Royce's! No question this hotel is a great hotel. I just have a thing about front desk people who work in these top tier hotels who think they are so damn high and mighty. Nothing burns me more then when the front desk people are sneaky and deceptive to were they are letting you know that you have come to a great hotel and their for you must bow. Screw that nonsense. After that the hotel is incredible. I loved it and the rooms are great in size and decor. I love the dim sum restaurant they have (Spring Moon very highly recommended rather staying here or not and make reservations) and lobby restaurant (The Verandah no reservation usually need and didn't try the food but did indulge in the over priced beverages) is cool for morning coffee, afternoon tea and cocktail in the evening or perhaps a night cap (smoking allowed if that is something that floats your boat as it is in most of Hong Kong)√à√\u2020\u2022?I liked having a martini and Cuban in the afternoon after seeing the sights. This hotel has the comforts and service of a great hotel. But really in Hong Kong the service I have experienced is pretty much exceptional so I really don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to rant about it considering a majority of Hong Kong is a service oriented place anyhow. Overall exceptional and it is what you expect in a round about way when pay the price you pay to stay here and it is on the Kowloon side. Hong Kong side has the other perspective with the Ritz Carlton and what not. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e after a high end super nice hotel on the Kowloon side of Hong Kong then this one should do it for you. I think all of the staff is very helpful but they sure do in my perspective have an arrogant side to them but some people like that and expect I guess. I would stay here again for sure. One interesting thing I looked into but didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do is a helicopter flight from the hotel to Macau. I thought that would be cool to do. I little expensive but available but the better side of my conservativeness said ah just go with the turbo prop ferry. Oh well always something to do on a later date.
