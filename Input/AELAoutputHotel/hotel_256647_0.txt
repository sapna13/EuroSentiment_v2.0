{"text":"Terrible terrible terrible We stayed here because it is close to the airport. This is something that I regret.I booked and paid for a room with an airport view, so keep that in mind while I go on.It took us 20 minutes to check in because they lost our booking. We got no help with our luggage. We went up to the 7th floor and I opened the room. The first thing that hit me was that the room was already occupied by someone else! Luckily they were not in there but their personal possesions, phones, laptop and everything were out, all for me to take if i was like that! The room didnt even over look the airport!I hailed down a porter and told them who didnt seem interested and told us to go back down to reception. We were given another room and I asked if it overlooked the airport and the answer I received was yes. Well when we got to the room it didnt, so I was lied to.I went back down to reception. Waited again and expressed my displeaseure. I said that I booked a room with airport views, the first one i got was someone elses room with no airport view, the second was empty but with no view and was lied to that it did have one! He then said that he will move us to a delux suite.I then went back to level 7 to get my wife, then to level 12. Opened the room and hey presto, it had a view of the airport. I dont know about delux suite, it was exactly the same as the other two rooms but with an airport view.The service here is terrible. How can you give out someone elses room! Even thought its close to the airport i wouldnt stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
