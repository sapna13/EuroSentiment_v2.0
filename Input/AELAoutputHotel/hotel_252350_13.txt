{"text":"Just try it! You'll love it! This place is truly amazing! Yes, it is a bit out of the way for the Seattle hot spots in downtown, but that is what makes it extra special. It is really only a 10 minute drive from all the action. From the moment we arrived, the staff was very nice. We came in very late, but our room was ready and it took less than two minutes to check-in. We had a studio suite and it was spacious, spotless and nicely equipped. The king bed was truly comfortable and our kids (5 and 10) stayed on the sofa sleeper and did not complain once. We had a gorgeous view of Mt. Rainier out one side. There is also a microwave with a free popcorn package, a coffee maker, and a little refrigerator in your vanity area.The hotel is VERY secure....front door locked at 10 pm and a room key is needed to access guestroom floors at all times. The FREE parking garage (YES, FREE) is also secured pretty well.The evening beer, wine and soda coupled with veggies and snacks was really nice and the breakfast in the morning was worth its weight in gold! Scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, cereals, yogurt, bagels, muffins, oatmeal, Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas...all made for a great start-up meal. Just remember to GO EARLY. By 9:00 the place was so crowded we were sitting on the couches to eat. Not many tables! We went at 8:15 and it was very nice.The hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all. I think they added about $.85 to a $1.90 quiche from the market up the street. It is a GREAT little store with drinks, snacks, microwaveable meals, etc. We also partook of the FREE washer and dryer on every floor. That was awesome!There isn't all that much around the hotel to walk to with the exception of Mamma Melena's up the street (excellent Italian food in a very relaxed setting with superb service). The neighborhood was a bit scary at first with a few rundown houses and homeless folks, but it wasn't bad at all. There is even a Trader Joe's market nearby and we got some microwaveable stuff for dinner one night and saved a TON of money. We also tried the Portage Cafe down at the Watertown's sister hotel, University Inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible (waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift) and the menu was mostly organic\/health food so it was different from what we are used to. It was not bad at all, but it wasn't all that great and the prices were a bit high, in my opinion, for a college town eatery. My advice, skip it.The staff at the front desk was always gracious and ready to help in anyway they could. We used the complimentary shuttle downtown to pick-up our rental car and the driver was very kind as well.My only complaints:1) The cart system, while a great idea, was a bust for us. We tried to get the movie cart so we could watch a movie (no DVD players in the rooms) but whoever had the limited number they keep onhand did not return them while we were there so we never got one. They either need to rewrite the policy on the amount of time a cart can be kept by guests or put DVD players in all rooms. We also tried to borrow a movie from the VERY limited DVD collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen. Bummer! 2) One elevator of the two was broken during our stay. This made for VERY long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage.3) There are no bellman so you do have to move your own luggage. Thankfully, they had two carts sitting by the elevators, but only two.4) There is no real drop off place in front. It is on a one way street and there is no driveway or valet or anything. You just have to pull up and get dropped off. At 10:15 p.m. when we arrived, there was a HUGE tractor trailer with cars on it so we couldn't even pull up in front!!!I would definitely stay here again if I wanted something a bit less expensive than the giants downtown but clean, comfy, and up-to-date just like the good guys!
