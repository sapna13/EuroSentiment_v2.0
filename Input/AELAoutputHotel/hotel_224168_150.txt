{"text":"What a change! We previously stayed at this hotel when it was the Holiday Inn 10 years ago - and when they say it has been revamped they aren't kidding! It is barely recognisable (a good thing!).. Very modern, very spacious, just a really good feel to it. The staff were very helpful too - our guy who brought up the bags insisted on getting us ice as we were a bit jet lagged  I'd lost my voice. (small things make a big difference). Hollywood itself is still what it is - quite tacky, but if you go there to see the sights, you know what to expect. We wanted a base to drive around  do the tacky star homes tours - this was perfect for that (you literally walk out of the lifts into the back of the Hollywood  Highland shopping centre beside the Kodak theatre into Manns Chinese theatre without even going on the street - to pick up the tours etc.A hint- I received an email the week I was to check in from the hotel asking if I had any special requests - I asked for early check-in and a refridgerator (very uncommon in U.S hotels)..The fridge was great. We got take out both nights, some wine  drinks etc.. No need to touch the super expensive drinks fridge already in the room!The only negative is the price of the valet parking - it was about $30 for 24 hrs.. you can pay about $13 for 24hrs to self park in the same carpark - but if you leave, you pay on re-entry, so if you're doing a bit of touristing and driving around - the valet is the best option.
