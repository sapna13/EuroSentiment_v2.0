{"text":"Recommend this hotel Just returned from a family trip to this hotel. Overall I was very happy with our experience. We traveled with our two children (13 and 11). We booked a suite with a king bed. Upon arrival, only a suite with two twin beds was available. We could have switched the following day but chose to stay with the original room. In addition, were able to have access to a hospitality suite on the top floor. Although this cost an additional $50\/day, we felt it was well worth it. We went there every morning for breakfast which was mostly cereal, yogurt, bagels, etc. Coffee and juice of course. This was perfect versus having to go to a resort restaurant for breakfast. In the evenings they had light snacks and an honor bar. The staff in the hotel couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating. The casino was pleasant and just enough for an evening activity. The gym was serviceable though 1 elliptical machine isn't enough. We had dinner in a few of the local restaurants near the hotel and they were quite good. The negatives were this property is located on a small beach with only about 1\/2 mile of beach. Pretty tough to take a long walk on the beach when it's so small. There were no water sports like wave runners or sailboats like other carribean resorts. The water slide was a bit small for my older kids though they enjoyed it. I felt this was more like a hotel with a pool on the beach versus a resort. Clean, nice rooms, eager to please staff, good location.
