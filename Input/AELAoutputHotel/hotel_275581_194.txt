{"text":"Great hotel location - Need to improve waiting staff This hotel makes a great base for exploring London as a tourist or as a business traveller, with good access to the shops and bars\/restaurants. Taxis are available outside the hotel at all times and only a 10 minute walk from houses of parliament - where you can get the London tour buses which are a fantastic way to see the city.On arriving at the hotel, we were greeted by a reception of 5 very friendly and helpful staff members. The entrance area was very clean and tidy and the check in process was quick and easy.Our bedroom and bathroom were incredibly clean with top quality (The white company) bathroom accessories. The bed however was very soft and on inspection very old. We mentioned this in the feedback form that was completed at the end of our stay, we received an e-mail apology in which they informed us that the beds were due to be replaced.We had room service on 2 of our 3 nights at the City Inn - the service was quick and friendly, although the food was lovely our order was short of a side item on one occasion.We had lunch on our first day at the hotel restaurant, my husband ordered the Seafood paella and got Mussels and Chips (!) We told the waitress of her mistake and she reordered the Paella for us, but this meant waiting a further 10 minutes for his main while mine went cold. The Maitre 'D came over and apologised to us and gave us 2 free glasses of wine. The same waitress (Whose English was not that good) made the same mistake at the table next to us, they ordered 2 salads and got 2 salmon!So although the stay itself was very good at the City Inn, the waiting staff needs to be improved. The atmosphere in the restaurant was austere and the waiting staff were too attentive at times, as we were being asked after every mouthful if every thing was OK!I would recommend the City Inn to tourists and business travellers, However, I wouldn't bother with the restaurant - just order room service instead!
