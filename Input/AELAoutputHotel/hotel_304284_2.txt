{"text":"Great hotel We stayed at the Asia Center for 4 nights and found it to be a great little hotel. There were 3 of us sharing the triple room. Ok, it was a bit small, but it wasnt that bad, not as small as we were expecting anyway. Besides, we werent in the room that much, only to sleep. The facilities in the hotel were great. The free bottled water and little packs at the desk are a great perk. The staff were friendly and spoke good english and always helped us with whatever we needed. You can also ask them to give you a map of the area, that was really helpful to get, but we didnt get it until the last day, so ask for it when you arrive. There isnt much in the way of restaurants around the hotel, but you can walk up to Roppongi in about 15 minutes, which has a load of sushi bars and restaurants, even a TGI Fridays if your missing the western food!The location was fantastic, just a short walk from the subway, which is on the Ginza line. This is really handy for getting anywhere in Tokyo. Its a really quiet neighbourhood and we felt safe walking back late at night from the station. They also have a good breakfast bufftet, it is 950yen, about √ä√£¬¢5, but there is so much stuff there to eat, from english, to japanese breakfast. I also have to say, that, although the bathrooms were tiny, the shower was lovely. Everything was clean, which is a real plus with us. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone wanting a cheap place to stay. I booked through hotelclub.com and got a good deal. ","annotations":[]}
