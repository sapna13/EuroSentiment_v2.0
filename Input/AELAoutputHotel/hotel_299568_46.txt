{"text":"Absolutely Perfect! My partner and I stayed at the Novotel Benoa from 18th-28th February, right in the middle of wet season. After travelling at this time, I would have to say, i would never travel in dry season. The wet season brings less crowds, and a beautiful lush island. It only rained once in our entire 10day stay! The resort, where to start! It was perfect, one of the most beautiful resorts ive ever stayed in. We stayed in the standard room on the opposite side to the main pools and lobby however we had 2 of the 3 pools, one of them had the only swim up bar in the resort. Everything from the staff, to the pool and beach areas, the well manicured grounds, everything was well above standard and cant complain about a thing. Upon arrival we wanted to upgrade our room however once we saw our standard room, we were more then happy with it. It was perfect, perfect location over looking the pool, size, and decor was amazing, very traditional balinese. The room was spotless, extremely clean and beautiful. The spa treatments are amazing, we got between us about 9 treatments! The restaurants are great too, Cocos Restaurant on the beach was excellent. Dont listen to people who complain about the standard rooms being on opposite side, its not a problem at all, if anything, it is much better because its less crowded and very peaceful. The balinese atmosphere through out the entire resort was beautiful and tranquil, it is a stunning resort. We cant wait to return to Bali and stay with the fantastic staff at the Novotel Benoa Bali!
