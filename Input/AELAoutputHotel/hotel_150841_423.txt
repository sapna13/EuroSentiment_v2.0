{"text":"Gorgeous Beach, Wonderful People Our adult family just spent 9 days at the Iberostar Bavaro and it was relaxing and wonderful!First, let me say that with the exception of the concierge staff (Kathy and Taiva were useless and rude--irony since they are guest services) the people who worked at this hotel were friendly and really fantastic people. Even without tipping they had smiles on their face and helped to accomodate what you needed--especially the wait staff. But this is a poor country, and small tips really do help people. The beach has white sand that feels like flour..and is cleaned every day by the staff to remove any seaweed. The water was crystal clear and we could snorkel on our own beach and see many different types of fish near an old coral reef. You can also take long walks on the beach because it is very extensive. The rooms are like little condos--everything is a junior suite here which makes it nice to have a bedroom and a sitting area. The one problem was that often you would get a sewage smell outside the rooms, this was at a lot of different rooms---not sure why, but it would be good if they could address this.The food was delicious. The general buffet has an enormous breakfast selection---freshly made croissants, waffles, pancakes, french toast, different types of sausages, eggs made to order, dominican breakfast food, cereals, delicious tropical fruits, and freshly squeezed juices--not to mention freshly made hot chocolate and fantastic coffee. We were fortunate to be there over Christmas and had an extravagant lobster, prawn, steak, lamb, dinner. The lobster tails themselves were huge! and the desserts were delectable. We drank the bottled water in the minibar (all included) and alcoholic drinks as well as the water at the restaurants and none of us got sick. The roaming peacocks, the flamingos and ducks and geese all make the experience even more tropical and delightful. General DR issues--highly dominated by Europeans which means lots of smoking (!!!) and lots of topless women (all ages...) and men in speedos. Makes the beach interesting!We highly recommend a visit to the DR---and to the Iberostar Bavaro.
