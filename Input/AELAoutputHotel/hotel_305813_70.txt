{"text":"Excellent value and great service at the Langham Place I have just returned from a 3 night stay in a club room at the Langham Place and would definately recommend this hotel to anyone, particularly the club rooms. Check in is done in the club lounge which was the only problem I had with this hotel. There was always a wait at the club desk whenever I went there including check in and check out as they seem to be doing the job of concierge and front desk for all the club rooms. At least you can enjoy a drink in comfort whilst you wait! The staff were always very friendly and efficient and apologetic if you had to wait.The room itself was on the small side but average for Hong Kong. However it had every amenity I could want with a modern bathroom with huge bath tub which you could watch TV in and separate rainshower. It had a huge LCD TV screen, DVD player and ipod dock. There was fresh fruit in the room and 2 bottles of free mineral water every day as well. The views were very good over to Hong kong island from the 35th floor.The club lounge was the best bit about this room. There was a selection of 7 different wines on offer 24 hours plus all the usual other drinks, all self service. There was also breakfast, afternoon tea, Mumm champagne, cocktails and a wide selection of canapes and a pudding buffet at various times. You could quite easily not need to eat much else during the day apart from the club food! There were 4 computer terminals, massage chairs and a selection of reading material too. I deceided to have breakfast in the main restaurant as it had a wider selection with everything from sushi and dim sum to omelettes and baked beans.I enjoyed the hotel pool which is outdoors on the roof. It is very modern and sleek by design with day beds and very comfortable loungers and free ipod rental as well. I used the spa and that was excellent - one of the best I have used. I recommend the heavenly scalp and foot treatment after a long flight. I also received a discount for this by booking in advance through the hotel website.Location wise Mongkok seemed perfectly safe to a single female wondering around. It is only a few blocks from Ladies market and the MTR is in the adjoining shopping mall. The mall itself had a large selection of restaurants, cafes, shops and a supermarket.I would definately stay at in this hotel again when I return to Hong Kong ","annotations":[{"endOffset":105,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":101},{"endOffset":125,"mention":"Langham","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Place_Hotel","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Hotel,_London"],"startOffset":118},{"endOffset":125,"mention":"Langham","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Place_Hotel","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Hotel,_London"],"startOffset":118},{"endOffset":125,"mention":"Langham","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Place_Hotel","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Hotel,_London"],"startOffset":118},{"endOffset":125,"mention":"Langham","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Place_Hotel","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Langham_Hotel,_London"],"startOffset":118},{"endOffset":206,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":202},{"endOffset":335,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":331},{"endOffset":473,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":469},{"endOffset":522,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":515},{"endOffset":1048,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1044},{"endOffset":1241,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1238},{"endOffset":1314,"mention":"pudding","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pudding","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Black_pudding"],"startOffset":1307},{"endOffset":1423,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1419}]}
