{"text":"Best Hotel Ever We had six days at the Pita Maha, please note there are several sister hotels also (Royal PitaMaha, Pita Maha Tehpujan? spelt something like that) the Pita Maha Resort my husband and I stayed at is a 24 villa property.The moment we were picked up from our Seminjak hotel for the trip to Ubud we knew we were in for something special, great luxury car, cold drinks for the journey, information brochure and the scenic route taken for our pleasure.We were upgraded to a deluxe villa which was just the best, we were getting married in our villa the next day and they really didnt have to but they gave us the best villa in the place at no additional charge to us. The rooms - mini houses really - are cleaned twice a day, loads of free bottled water, fruit, nuts, fresh ground coffe, coffee maker, flowers everywhere, more fluffy white towels and robes than you can count, silent air conditioning, full dvd library to borrow free of charge, dvd player with surround sound in each room, our own safe to place valuables. The rooms are amazing, thatching, marble floors, beautiful carved wood furniture, the most luxurious bed linen, everything was perfect. Outside garden and pool just amazing a tropical paradise, stone carving everywhere, mature trees, secluded and private. Breakfast was included in our deal, anything off the extensive menu, which was some of the best food we have eaten, especially our wedding dinner. The restaurant has the most fabulous veiws over the gorge, misty in the early hours and slowly clears while you enjoy your breakfast. The Staff were brilliant, they bent over backward and were so professional. My husband had developed a sore ear and we needed to get to a chemist, they said as soon as we finished our breakfast they would be happy to take us. Not only did we get taken free of charge they picked us up an hour later after having seen a doctor and gotten medication, with no mention of further charge, this was the professional way of Pita Maha,. The staff always reminded us when we were dropped into Ubud at night on the Pita Maha free shuttle bus, (running to and from hotel to Ubud to Monkey Forest from 0900 to 2200hrs) that if we could not make the shuttlepick up then ask the restaurant to ring the hotel and they would come and pick us up within 10 minutes. The entire stay was more like being taken care of by the most understanding friends than being in a hotel and I cannot recommend the Pita Maha more highly and cannot wait to return.
