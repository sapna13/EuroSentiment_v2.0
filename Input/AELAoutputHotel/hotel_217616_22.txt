{"text":"Great deal and location Got a great deal on a Kimpton online promotion for the weekend before Labor day weekend. Have enjoyed other Kimpton hotels (but no goldfish here). Great location a block off Times Square and in the midst of all the Broadway theaters. 5 blocks from the Port Authority stop of the Newark Airport bus shuttle. We also walked to MOMA, Rockefeller Center, etc. We got one of the recently renovated rooms (King Deluxe I believe) that was actually the biggest room I've had in NYC (last year at the nice and also boutiquey Hotel Mela a block away the room was barely big enough to fit the king bed). There was reasonable space along either side of the bed and a desk and TV\/dresser\/minibar area at the foot. There was an apology letter for the fact that the HD was not yet set up with the TV, but no biggie. We were on the 12th floor, and faced away from Times Square towards Sixth. Quiet. No business center, but FedEx Kinkos was a block away. We did dine at District before a show (very convenient). The 3 course pre-theater menu was a good deal, and the very unusual shrimp cocktail appetizer had me chuckling while we ate it. The lamb shank was a bit dry though. But overall a good meal, and a very convenient option for a nice pre-theater dinner (with the added bonus of being able to pop upstairs to your room before going to your show).Did not check out the fitness center (too busy with shows and restaurants). Overall, another fine Kimpton hotel experience, got a great deal compared to other area boutique hotels for my travel period, and roomier than I had become accustomed to in NYC. And you can't beat the location in the heart of Times Square (if you're into that sort of thing.).
