{"text":"Not as expected Overall my stay was satisfactory at the Hilton Prince Kuhio but I probably had higher expectations. I had booked 2 rooms using my points and had called up 2 days prior to my arrival. A very warm and friendly staff had spoken with me and assured me that being a Diamond VIP , I would get a suite room with a connecting bedroom with executive floor benefits. It made my day! Upon arrival, I was very disappointed by the lack of customer service initially and was told that they could only give us connecting rooms with a mountain view with no balcony access. They could not get any mention of the promised upgrade and asked me the name if the staff and rattled off with a lecture on the rules and regulations for upgrading Diamond members. I then went to see the connecting Mountain View rooms and found that the windows were covered with railings and scaffolding as repair was in progress. I returned back and refused to stay there. It didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ matter and they said I could go to the Hilton Village! What??? After offloading 7 bags and tired after a long flight!!! Then I asked for the manager on duty and he was able to give us the suite room that was promised!!! Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stop here. I went up happily to the room and found that it was a suite room with a living room and bedroom but no other connecting room. That meant he used 2 room bookings to give us 1 suite room. What a clever act! I returned back to the front desk and then was given an additional room. This was definitely not an experience I relished and left a very bad taste in my mouth. Upon check in repeatedly they asked for the points certificates for our stay and I patiently told them that I need to go to my room and get it printed from the website. I found out later that they directly contacted Hilton Honors and got it done from their side without waiting for me. I found it very cheeky and impolite. The suite room we had was good and had a spacious living room with a toilet and a separate bedroom with a bathroom. The rooms were brightly decorated and had plasma TVs and good views of the ocean. However, the balcony lacks privacy and is bare open unlike other hotels . Moreover the hotel is not very close to the beach and takes a bit of time to walk to the main road. Valet parking is very good but the space near the entrance is very tight and can barely hold 1-2 cars at a time, The executive lounge was undergoing repair and a temporary lounge was there on the first floor. Evening snacks ran out of supply in minutes and was not replenished. Breakfast was usual continental fare but space was at a premium and many were standing and eating. A plus point was the free business center access on the lobby level where you could access internet and print out documents as well. Overall an average place and I would stay either at the Marriott or the Hyatt next time I visit Honolulu.
