{"text":"Double Tree: What a versitle property: Three amazing experiences! I am a meeting planner from NY and recently held three seperate events at the Double Tree Cambridge: A meeting for 20, a bachelor party for 25 and a conference with over 60! All functions went splendidly well and I would recommend the hotel to anyone: familys, large groups and even Bachelor Parties.The Double Tree Cambridge, (located in Cambridge obviousely hence the name) and has beautiful views of Harvard and the Charles River. I saw a review where someone wrote the property was isolated- I have no idea why that was written because the hotel is just across the small bridge from shops and restaurants and even provides a free shuttle service to\/from atttractions across the city. It seems centrally located to me. Oh, and btw- its an 8 minute ride to Logan airport (do not stay at the airport, YIKES).The property is beautifully maintained and was recently renovated with a modern feel. On the top floor of the hotel are bi-level suites; the space and the views are incredible. The room features floor to ceiling windows (20 feet high) with 2 bathrooms, a kitchen and a loft bedroom. How can you go wrong. The hotel also has other great features: Free business center, full-service restaurant and seperate bar, the world famous Schullers Jazz Club and large meetings spaces for weddings, family reunions and large conferences. The hotel can also host small meeting like mine (15 people) where you are given the same attention as a conference of 200. I would highly recommend this property to anyone- for a weekend getaway or a week long event like mine. The Double Tree became my home away from home and I honestly cannot wait to return for another visiting in the near future.
