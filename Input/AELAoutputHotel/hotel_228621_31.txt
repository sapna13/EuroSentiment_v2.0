{"text":"Great place to stay to explore amazing city Being a frequent trip advisor user, I thought I should contribute back. My boyfreind and I stayed in this hotel last year and it was excellent, located in easy walking distance to a metro which quickly gets you to main centre. The hotel was brilliant, excellent service, the staff were very helpful and friendly.....We had a late departure and the hotel looked after our luggage and let us use the gym facilities to change and have a shower before our flight home in the evening!!The bathrooms were amazing, especially the shower, large enough for a number of people!! It sounds strange but I still remember to this day how the pillows were the best I had ever slept on !! We walked into the city on one occasion along the beach.It took a while but was an enjoyable walk. The breakfast at the hotel was also very good, well worth checking when you book that the price includes this as many websites did not. (we booked through GTA Hotels)Many people get pick pocketed along las ramblas, however if you are aware and sensible this should not happen to you as there will be many easier targets - let that not be you! We had our charactures drawn down this street and were well worth the money. The artist was very friendly and did a good job, providing entertainment for passers by - lets say the portraits are not flattering! :0)I would defintely return to Barcelona without a 2nd thought, and I would stay in this hotel again. It is nice to be out of the main city area sometimes, and it is very easy to get around the city. Also there is a HUGE shopping centre right next door, we had great fun, bowling and shopping one night! ","annotations":[]}
