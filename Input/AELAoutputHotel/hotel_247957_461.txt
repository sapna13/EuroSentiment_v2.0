{"text":"Occidental Grand Flamenco is a great resort We were aprehensive about the the bad reviews that have been posted, and were very pleasantly surprised once we got there as we loved the place. (I note with interest that most of the negative reviews came from Americans and the English - are Canadians just more forgiving, or less tight...ed?)So, don't be concerned by what others say - it really is a nice place.The weather didn't cooperate, though (rained 2 days, 2 days of sun, rest very overcast). Hot and still enjoyable, though.Day trip to marine park interesting but overpriced in comparison to other similar trips we've taken in Mexico. Ask what food you'll get before you book - we got stale bread, thinkly sliced meat and cheese, and ketchup or mustard as a condiment. We built our own sandwich - not very appetizing.Beach is second to none - worth going just to see it. Staff is great - English speaking staff never a problem - they always were very accomodating and respectful and despite being booked to the rafters, they always responded to our requests (slow but sure, sometimes needing prompting but they were busy).Take american one dollar bills (we took $50 and tipped our maid $2 each day, and other workers like the bartenders, serving staff etc. throughout the trip.) Our room (building 10) was clean, everything worked, and our maid took good care of us, stocking our fridge, etc.I got the trots (my hubby was okay) - invest in some antibiotics (specifically ciprofloxine) to take in case you get this. I suffered needlessly for several days.Pool and grounds are nice, and always clean.I heard Transat Premium clients complaining about their buildings being run down and not having evryhting working, poor beds etc. OUr building was far away from the ocean, but still nice.Food is excellent - buffet always was good, especially at breakfast..Drinks are NOT watered down and they will make whatever way you want it.All in all - highly recommend the resort and the town (but if you want to use the Internet, go to the town. It is only 10 minutes by foot, and the cost is $3 per 30 minutes whereas at the hotel they charge you $7 for 30 min.)
