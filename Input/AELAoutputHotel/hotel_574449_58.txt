{"text":"Rotten, Wretched, Regis This is an updated review - I wrote a review of the St. Regis in March 2007 and gave the hotel high marks - I returned this time because of the positive experience the first time. Unfortunately, this rating, I give the hotel a -10 rating on a scale of 1-10. This experience was just the opposite of my first stay. The first stay, the service was impeccable; this stay, the service was haughty and pompous; the room was dirty; and nothing in the room worked; the digital clocks had the wrong time and date (guests can't change the clock time or date and thus, I had to call engineering); the TV was inoperable - yet another call to engineering!; the internet was not working - yes, yet another call to engineering. After four calls to the front desk to have engineering come to my room - the front desk was less than cooperative. After my stay, I sent and email to the executive assistant of the General Manager and they never responded. Long and short, an horrible stay. After the stay, Starwood hotels and St. Regis sent me a customer survey - I filled it out indicating the above. The GM of the St. Regis THEN saw fit to contact me and basically scolded me for filling out the critique! and not giving them a chance to get back to me. In any event, the GM did not make it right. Starwood did a follow up survey and contacted me again and I reiterated the above - they were apologetic and explainded that the hotel had undergone a management change but there was no excuse for the poor behavior or poor service. Having said that, while I may stay at other Starwood properties, I will not go back to the St Regis in SF unless current mgmt. changes... ","annotations":[]}
