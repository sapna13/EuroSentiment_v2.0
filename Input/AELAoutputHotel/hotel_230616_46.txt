{"text":"Great experience This was our first stay at this hotel and we loved it and will return.Highlights were: the corner room...this is a must. There is more room and more light in these units facing the front of the hotel. Ask ahead of time. Even with the windows opened, you couldn't really step out on to balcony because there was not much room. There are better views around town but other things in this hotel make up for the lack of a balcony. Rooms are small but extremely functional and charming.The complementary beverage and food in lobby was great. We invited a friend over after a long day and enjoyed just sitting in front of the fire place drinking and snacking and enjoying it all. We liked getting extra water and coffee from this area to bring to room. NIce chocolates and rotating snacks all day long if you happened to be there. Bar in room and frig for other things.Free WI Fi in lobby at two big desks. You could check in on any info without using your room computer. They also gave you 50 minutes free WI FI in room.Bathrooms were great...not huge but perfectly set. Great big tub and fantastic rain shower. Very clean. Ice and shoe shine right at the end of the hallway.Bed was nice and hard but I did not like the seam down the middle. This would be so easy to correct with a proper pad over the seam! Pillows were rather lumpy.Breakfast down stairs in the basement was fabulous. We missed the first morning because we slept in but the second day we enjoyed all the goodies. Great selection of papers and magazines at breakfast and in lobby each day.The front desk was outstanding! Great help and extremely friendly.The only thing I thought odd was the lack of vacuuming of the carpet in all of the hall ways. This made its seem dirty but I could just tell that it really had not been vacuumed well...or in a long time. Odd... when every thing else was very clean.GREAT LOCATION.The tram was just outside hotel a block up. Very easy to get to train station, 10 minute ride. Not on a super busy street but close to every thing. Flower mart was 2 blocks away. Great cafes near by.Fabulous hotel... we will be back.
