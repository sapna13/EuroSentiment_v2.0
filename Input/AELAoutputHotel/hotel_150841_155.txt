{"text":"Beach was Great, the Resort was just OK. Our problems with Iberostar Bavaro came the first night we checked in. I planned a trip to the Dominican Republic for my husband's 30th birthday. When we got to our room we noticed that we were in a room with two single beds (even though I had specifically booked a king) and the window in our room faced a loud construction site. When I tried to change the room (I told them I had booked a king since we are married) they told me they had no other rooms but that they could switch us the next day. Since they screwed up on my reservation I asked that they give my husband a birthday cake in our room (for my husband) as a small compensation to which a man named Rafael at the front desk shook his head and promised exemplary service but no cake. Honestly I thought a cake was the least they could do since they screwed everything up. Oh, and our bags arrived at our room 45 minutes after we got to the room, we might as well have carried them ourselves! The bell boys told us Sorry and waited for a tip that they didn't get. The next day we switched rooms and there was no exemplary service as promised, just a room with a king and a better view of a walkway. Is customer satisfaction no longer a big deal for hotels? I mean, seriously, they didn't give a crap that they screwed up our reservation. Anyways, the resort is nice enough, the beach is amazing. The room smelled musty though and my husband got some sort of food sickness on the last day of our trip (something that he said was brewing for a few days on account of the food. It wasn't great). All of the people who worked at the front desk of this resort were so unhelpful - when you asked a question you'd often get a blank stare. And the questions we asked were easy - like, where is the cajun restuarant? When we booked a dinner reservation via the concierge they were so unfriendly and forgot to mention that men have to wear pants to dinner, so, of course, my husband had to run back to the room to change when we showed up for dinner. I stayed at the Riu Palace in Mexico a few years ago and we had a great time and the experience was SO different. As I was sitting on the beach at Iberostar Bavaro I was wishing I had booked the Riu for this trip; I've learned to stick with what you know and like.
