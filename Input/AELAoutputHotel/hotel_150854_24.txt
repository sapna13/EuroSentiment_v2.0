{"text":"3rd Time Back, and Still Amazing We stayed at the Riu Palace Macao the first week of August. We have been there already 2 times before and we absolutely loved it, so we went back again this year for the 3rd time. There was a group of us who went down, 15 people in total. There were 7 kids between the ages of 12 - 18 and then adults. Food: Just like the past 2 years..excellent. A variety at the buffet, everything you would want for dinner. Meat, fish, soup, pizza, pasta, salad...tons of food. It is obviously not like home but it is damn good enough. Rooms: Clean clean clean. I've read some of the other reviews that say they rooms smelled, they were moldy etc. Where did you people go? All of our rooms were very clean, smelled like the beautiful Dominican air, and absolutely NO mold. We found one ant on our bathroom floor but come on...it cant be perfect. Kill it and move on!Beach: Breathtaking. Thats all I'm going to say.Pool: Clean, warm, but pretty busy most of the time. I'm an ocean lover.Service: Great. Drinks came fast, the people were always asking to assist you, always trying to help. However, if you want ocean view rooms BOOK THEM. Because they wont be easy to get.All I can say is this hotel is my favorite. I've been to cuba and mexico as well, but this place is the best. My sister and I went to the club Pachaa every night. Let me just say...not for kids, but AMAZING for older teens and adults. The way these people move, and the way they feel the music..It's nothing like anyone else ive ever danced with. I LOVED IT.I recommend this hotel for anyone and everyone. It was and still is amazing.
