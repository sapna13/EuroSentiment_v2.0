{"text":"Best Vacation yet Me and my boyfriend stayed at the IB from May 6th- 13th and we had the best vacation! We stayed at the Iberostar Paraiso Beach in Mexico last year and we loved it and wanted to stay in the Iberostar chain. We both like this resort a little better for a few reasons.  The facility itself is beautiful! Just the perfect size (IB mexico was a little TOO big) We asked for a renovated room, king size bed on the second floor and we got it. We even got a phone call on our second night asking if everything was ok with the room!  The weather was pretty good. It rained a little more than we would have liked but for the most part it was sunny and HOT.  Beach was the most beautiful we've ever seen. We are definately beach people and spent most of our time here. The pool was great also. We usually went there around 2 in the afternoon to start drinking at the great swim up bar. It was a little dirty over by the bar, but whatever... it was still nice! Food at the buffet was good for all inclusive. The Ala carte's were great! We ate at Jumbalaya( cajian), the Steakhouse, and Gourmet. All were great!  Overall we had a great relaxing vacation. Make sure you tip the maids and bartenders and those who go the extra mile! Those star friends work SO hard! Have a good time!! ","annotations":[]}
