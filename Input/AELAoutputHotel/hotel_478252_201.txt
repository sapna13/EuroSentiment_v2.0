{"text":"loved the Bahia Principe Bavero:) I just want to start off by saying i have been to dominican 6 times to punta cana and 1 to puerto Plata and i do not wanna go anywhere else but Punta Cana i went to bahia from april 13 to the 20 leaving from toronto with sky service the plane ride was a bit tight but managed for 4 hours.ARRIVE- we arrived in Punta Cana at 10:30am and its perfect clear blue sky day i was a little worried because before i left i was checking the weather on the internet and its said rain so do not believe what that says.When we arrived at the bahia principe we where welcomed by a dominican lady with a cold drink and the theme bahia song check in was done on the bus so that was good we didn't have to check in at the lobby ROOMS- the rooms where big and spacious its was a perfect room to spend a week in the bed was comfortable and always had the maid do i good job with bringing us what we needed.we did tip the maid $1 a day so that also comes a long way  FOOD- breakfast was always good with eggs, toast, crepes, pancakes, doughnuts fresh fruit mmmmmmmmm its was great,-lunch i skipped i ate to much for breakfest but everyone else who came enjoyed it - For Dinner we where only suppose to book 3 a la carte but managed to get 6 just go to guest services and ask that doesn't hurti enjoyed the Italian, le gourmet, garden grill, mediterraneo and japanese loved those all i also went to the brazilian and didn't care for that one because i am not much of a meat lover so i found there was to much meat but if you like meat go there.ENTERTAINMENT- the entertainment staff was great every time i got to dominican i never have a problem with the staff there always so friendly and nice and always want you to have a great time they try to get you so involved with them.GROUNDS- The grounds are always kept so clean and nice and they really take care of it.POOL- the pool is so beautiful and big i just lied there all day and dipped myself in the water to get cooled off BEACH- the beach is beautiful clear blue water white sandy beaches what more can you ask for.WEATHER- Blue clear sky and so hot and sunny durning the dayand night very humid and hot OVERALL- my experience at Bahia was a perfect vacation for all 6 of us i would highly recommend this resort to everyone.Who ever complains about this resort should not go on vacation dominican people work very hard to make your stay a good one and if you let the little things bother you stay home.
