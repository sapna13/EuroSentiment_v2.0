{"text":"Wonderful hotel! We loved almost everything about this hotel!A family of four (kids 9 and 18), got a beautiful, large family room.The young man with a ponytail at check in spoke fluent English and was very helpful. Coffe\/tea\/biscuits in the room, mini-bar, even slippers. The location. WOW! Only a bit irritating bits were rubbish from previous guest under the beds (we found 5 pieces of sweet-wrapper and stuff), and the airconditioner not being fully controlable (set at 2 temperatures which weren't cool enough for us. Mind you, we're from Norway, and used to frost!).Also, it said that breakfast could be served in the room at no extra cost, and breakfast supposedly started at 7.30 am. As we had a taxi booked for 8 in the morning to get our flight back to Norway, we thought it would be a great idea to have breakfast in the room 7.30. No way was that possible. We'd be better off going to the breakfast room, we were told, but at 7.40, not everything we needed was there. When asking about it, one of the guys working there (who looked A LOT like the British Prime Minister!), reluctantly looked up from his newspaper, looking a his watch in a way that indicated what's the hurry, and said it will come soon. Of course none of us were finished eating before the taxi arrived. Access to the Internet was extremely pricey. We only had to check one thing which we said would take 3 minutes, but had to pay for half an hour. Yeah, The Prime Minister....Apart from this, we were all happy, and would recommend this hotel to all. ","annotations":[]}
