{"text":"Not a good expierience After reading all the great reviews we decided in the middle of our Bali trip to do a 2night break at KUPU KUPU BARONG. We agree with most reviews about the superb location and the friendly staff, but we were extremley disappointed with the lack of quality of service - way below any 5 Star resort we stayed in before. 1. No one makes the room at night. No fresh towels, only one set of towels per person. If you want hot water for a shower or bath, you have to let the water run for at least 10 minutes before its getswarm.  2. That a Frog jumps in your room happens in the jungle, but that food trays from Room Service in the afternoon were not picked up and stayed all night was disgusting - and the Ants were of course all over it. 3. Very limited selection of wine. A call at 11 pm for a bottle lead to a call back from the Butler that they were very sorry, but they did not have a key for the fridge were the wine is stored. Also the only open White Wine is a local Balinese Chardonay. While we wholeheartly support local efforts to grow wine on Bali, we don't think we should be forced to consume it more then once! 4. One time the battery of the Golf Cart died on the steep hill and we had to push it up, the next time we waited 15 minutes in the pooring rain, and had to walk all wet up the step hill to the Spa... We could continue the list of poor performances, all somewhat small in detail but if you know how smooth and excellent a 5 Star operation should run, this was way off. We had a feeling that while the individual staff member was very eager, there is clearly a lack of management focus in the overall operation. Too bad...
