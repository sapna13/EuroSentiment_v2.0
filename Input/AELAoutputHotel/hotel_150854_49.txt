{"text":"To each their own. My wife and I returned on June 16, from eight nights at the Riu Macao, with no good memories. We encountered a few problems from the very start. The first room they gave us was really messed up-with various broken things throughout the room. We were able to change our room within the hour, but the second one had problems also. Through the entire stay we were never able to get the A\/C to work properly. There were other problems with the room, but we decided to stay after a long,long trip just to arrive at the Macao. To make this review short, let's just say that the hotel was at best a 2-3 star at best. Even though we were allowed to use three other Riu properties, it just seemed like there was nothing to do. We have been to the Dominican Republic two other times before and this always seems to be the case. We booked though U.S. Airways Vacations and did not have any problems with our flights. Our problems started and ended at the airport. The transfer people we had to use were terrible! The Turinter people were slow, lost, and unreliable. If you can, do not use these people. It took them almost two hours to get us to the hotel, even though there was only two other couples with us. On the return, they were early as usual, even though our flight did not leave until 4:30 PM. All the so-called representative did, was lie to us and try to sell any kind of excursion. Also the airport was a zoo, because no one behind the counter knew wht they were doing. So in conclusion, the hotel was okay and after speaking to the Assistant General Manager-who was a wonderful woman named Magnolia-a lot of problems with our room were fixed. We have not givin up on Riu properties, but we are looking for another island to go to next year. One inportant thing: men have to wear long pants any evening at the buffet, not the a lacarte restaurants, where we have stayed before. ","annotations":[]}
