{"text":"Extraordinary!!! After reviewing some of the comments about Melia Caribe Tropical, I was very apprehensive about our vacation. Never fear!!!!!!!! The service was great....yes, there was somewhat of a language barrier, but after a day or two there, you soon catch on, and they do their very utmost to communicate and cater to your every desire.The room was okay. We loved the patio. Since we had a shower every afternoon it was so refreshing to sit and relax on our patio, and enjoy the lush gardens right outside our door.The bars...extraordinary!!! After several evenings at the one bar, our bartender knew exactly what we wanted- she was so sweet! She would bring my friends cosmopolitan in one hand and a glass of olives in the other (my friend LOVES olives). Give them a dollar or two of tip (they deserve it). They'll treat you like royalty!We had no problems booking a restraunt for dinner. We usually booked it at the guest services desk in the AM for that night or the next night. We're on vacation so who needs to be pushy about what time you eat?We stayed at a Sandals on our honeymoon and paid double the price, and the landscape here was more beautiful. For the difference in price, I definitely would pick Melia Caribe Tropical. We went on the ATV excursion. That's a must. You get quite an adventure for your money. We loved it, because you got to see more of the culture and lifestyle outside the resort, plus our husbands loved the excitement of four-wheeling. We also got couple massages. Okay, but not extraordinary. We had ours outside. Suggestion: Choose the inside one. We were so hot and sticky till we were done, because of the humidity. The massage therapists were good though.Transportation around the resort... no problem...we either caught the train if it was raining or we were to exhausted- which usually came every five minutes. They have very nice walkways and is was only a several minute walk to the lobby, buffets, pool, beach.If you like...the beach is beautiful at night, too! Take a stroll after dinner.You will LOVE it!!! Have fun!
