{"text":"Loved the Ritz Decided to take a quick pre Christmas trip to Puerto Rico looking for warmth ease of travel and accessibility with the family. Ritz was suggested by a family friend because of its proximity to the airport. Overall a delightful stay with a great ocean view room w two double beds, Staff service food overall quite good and the rooms quite nice and comfortable. Prefer ocean view certainly to city or pool view and no balcony available for two double beds but would recc a balcony if only king bed requested. We rented a car at the airport and the major challenge is getting in the correct lanes to enter the hotel. Probably we got it on the third try and the car is handy if you intend to play golf frequently ( nothing on site) or head to Old San Juan. Otherwise no car needed if you wish to eat and veg out on site. Food was good and service impeccable by the pool or restaurants. We also used the restaurants at the nearby San Juan hotel and resort which also were quite good Nothing is cheap. Self parking is convenient once you figure out where to get your ticket validated and once you figure out how to use the toll lanes if you dont read Spanish. . People were quite service oriented and no complaints whatsoever. Had a tub that would not drain well and they repaired it around 800pm while we were dining without any delay. Also they communicated in writing to us regarding a inroom bar change along with a fire drill just to keep us informed. All in all a great stay. The only challenge is for habitual golfers like myself who had to trek 30-40 mins by car each way to courses along the east coast. (played at Coco Beach Country Club which had some nice courses and an accommodating course manager who made some adjustments given the recent rains and some course adjustments) Nevertheless the trip out there gave the family an excuse to visit the rain forest and we also looked at the remodeled rooms of the El Conquistador . While they do not meet the service performance of the Ritz the newly remodeled rooms are a major improvement over their old digs. ultramodern and a bit hip ( white throughout) it is distinctly different feel from the Ritz and pretty far out ( 1 hour at least from the airpor and dont expect to come into town and dont rent a car) cheersekhpotomac maryland ","annotations":[{"endOffset":357,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":353},{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"toll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_chip_cookie"],"startOffset":1132},{"endOffset":1676,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1672}]}
