{"text":"A very vert amaizing surprice Our little vacation to dreams was great ! I was shaky to go at first after reading some of the reviews especially because it was only my son ( 10years old ) and myself. The almost one hour bumpy ride was well wort it. Since our arrival every one was extremely friendly but also very professional Every one at the resort made us feel welcome and safe. After the bumpy ride the sparkling wine, orange juice and cold towel were waiting for us at the front desk. The rooms are not the greatest but ok since with so many activities in the resort the entertainment personal the gorgeous never ending pool and the great tours will keep you out of the room. We took the Santo Domingo tour, El Fieston, The four wheel bikes, and Laguna Limon, they were all great and we had a blast! I totally recommend them all. Try not to miss them. The roads do need a lot of work, they were very bumpy. That didn't stop us from dancing and screaming most of the time.The Restaurant were OK My son enjoy the world cafe in the morning,they had something different every day, and the chinese restaurant, (don't forget to try the fry banana with ice cream dessert ) myself, I enjoyed oceana restarant. Taking pictures with animals at the resort was very exiting for my son. They had a different animal every day.Watch out for the vendor they try to sell me a T-shirt for 25 dollars! You can do your shopping at the airport they have more rasoanable prices and better quality.Try to have breakfast early so you can enjoy most of the activities. Every activity we participate we got paid for and with that money we got a cap and a 40 min, massage. So participate in as many activities as you can they were so much fun! My favorite activities were the joga and aerobics class at the beach every day at 10:00 am with Mike. All the Games around the pool were fun too. We also enjoyed the Core Center full of sports like tennis and ping pong,pool tables and much much more activities for my son and myself. The kids club was excellent very well qualified personal. You do have to dress up for dinner. So I did enjoy putting on my cute shoes at night but they weren't very strict with the dress code specially with kids. They shows were all very good, simple and fun don't be shy go ahead and participate.Also if you can, tip this people who will give you a very good customer service matter what.They do accept tips.I have to give special thanks to Melkis, Mike, 50 Cent, Sharon, with the entertainment team they work so hard to make us feel welcome. Thank you to Raul in the middle of the pool bar for being so generous and creative with the drinks. We can't wait to go back and with the all inclusive deal we will be back soon of course only to Dreams in Punta Cana.
