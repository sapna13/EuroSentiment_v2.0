{"text":"Definitely a 4 star resort A friend and I stayed at the Sirenis Tropical from April 12th - April 18th. Overall we had a great time and I would rate this resort at a 4 star level...with some aspects of it being a bit below 4 star quality.Check in was a breeze for us but I think that was attributed to checking in at 3 a.m. Check in took all of about 10 minutes and our room was ready right away.The rooms are a little shoddy and are definitely in need of a bit of maintenance\/upkeep but they were far from being horrible. You hardly spend time in your room anyhow. We weren't as impressed with the housekeeping as other reviews have mentioned but it was definitely adequate.I can't say enough about how beautiful the grounds are along with the pool and the beach. It was the first time in Punta Cana for both of us and it was amazing how much more beautiful the beaches are in comparison to places in Mexico. We didn't have a problem with reserving a hut by the pool. We would take turns getting up at 7 and reserving a spot with our towels and our books and everyone seems to respect this method of reserving a spot. All guests were curteous and kind for the most part. We were both a little dissapointed with the drinks. My friend was especially dissapointed with the lack of slushy type drinks. The general mixes that they use for the majority of their drinks are so overly sweet. I could not handle drinking them and my friend has quite a sweet tooth and she couldn't stomach them either. So we stuck to champagne, beer (very good), rum and coke and the like...the wine with dinner was also quite good. The lobby bar is a great place to sit and have a couple of drinks before dinner. The bartenders are great and they also serve great popcorn if you ask for it. I think it may be for the kids but we had no shame in asking for some also! The food in general was quite good. Everything was very tastey and neither of us had any real complaints about the buffets or any of the restaurants. You can only book one reservation per day but we had no problem getting into all the restaurants we wanted to try. We tried the Mexican, the Steakhouse, Jade (Japanese), Cinecitta (Italian) and the Vegetarian restaurants. Some better than others but overall no real complaints as I said before. Nightlife was pretty good also. There was a show every night usually followed by Karaoke or a live band along with the Casino and the Disco that are open all night. There is definitely always something to do and the Animation team was very good at involving the crowd and making sure that everyone was having a good time.The staff were all very kind and helpful. No one expects a tip at all but it obviously is a very nice gesture to these employees who work very hard. They are always smiling and singing and make you feel so welcome.As I said before...overall we had a great time. For the great price that we booked in at, it was definitely worth every penny. I don't think either of us will be back as we would both like to try other resorts in Punta Cana.
