{"text":"Very Disappointing It was over an hour drive to the resort from the airport and in my opinion, not very pretty scenery which scared me a bit as to what to expect. There were local men urinating on the side of the road in plain view as we headed to the resort. The resort property itself was very pretty. The staff were friendly but did not speak\/understand much English. We had a difficult time communicating with most. It took 2 days to obtain washcloths which we were told we'd have in 5 minutes. Our coffee pot was missing. The towels were like sandpaper. The toilet leaked all over the floor and we had an ant problem. There was an open bottle of water in the refridgerator and an open bottle of lotion on the vanity. The food was mediocre at best. The drinks were OK especially if you asked for a specific drink instead of one of the pre-mixed ones where you could watch them make it. The beach is OK as far as the seating, but it's actually on the Atlantic side of the island NOT the Carribbean as we thought and the water is much rougher, we were never able to get in. No snorkeling unless (so we were told) you walked around the bend to the calmer waters of the Carribbean...we never made it, because it was too windy and the vendors off the resort would harass you constantly. The nightly shows were very cheesy...impersonators of Cher, Madonna, Michael Jackson and Elvis pretty much every night in some form or another. We had a lounge singer with canned music one night. We never stayed long. I don't understand the 5-Star rating, other than their presentation is done very well...it is indeed a very pretty resort, but I would not go back and would not recommend it to anyone..in fact, I wouldn't go back to this island at all.
