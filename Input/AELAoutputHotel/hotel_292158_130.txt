{"text":"Loved evey minute We arrived at the Punta Cana quite late on Monday evening and were very tired. We went in the Punta Cana resort buffet for evening meal. This was our first and only mistake.. We found that the Bavaro or princess Buffet is much nicer for an evening meal if you are not looking to use one of the a la carte restaurants.Punta Cana buffet is fine for Breakfast though , but as with most resorts get there early before all the fresh fruit goes. Whilst I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ on the food I may as well talk about the other restaurants. Both I and my partner had different favourites. He loved the steak and seafood and as much as I thought that was a close second I loved the Italian. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try the Dominican, Spanish or Mexican but have heard good reports about the Spanish one. The oriental restaurant was nice but we went quite late and it felt like we were rushed through. One thing about the a la carte restaurants goes about 7-7:30 as at about 8ish they get very busy. The great thing about the a la carte is that you aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ restricted how many times you visit, when you see the host they will give you a disk that lights up and vibrates when your table is ready so you can go for a drink before your meal. However if its busy be prepared to be staring at your disk like a phone that wont ring. L√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∫va for lunch is perfect try the paella its fantastic and the black rice my look abit dodgy but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ lovely.The resort as a whole was very clean I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stress enough how helpful and friendly the staff are even with the language barrier. With regards to tipping our travel rep said to us that you get a better service if you tip before you order (no offence to our rep as she was great but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ absolute b***ocks), we would tip waiters and waitresses in the bar after our first drink (between $3-5) which meant the service was great and also we would only tip after our meal in restaurants and as far as both of us were concerned this made no difference to the level of service we expected.Our room was fantastic and the bed was very comfy and huge. If you book a sea view room √à√\u2020\u2022?DO NOT expect anything spectacular the view is mainly palm trees (we only paid a √ä√£¬¢50 supplement for sea view so weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expecting anything fantastic but its still very eye pleasing) One thing I will say is that our rep and other reviews Ive read have said to get the train as soon as you get there to have a good look around the three hotels and what they have to offer √à√\u2020\u2022?yet again I have to say its doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ take long to get around the hotels on foot so use your legs early evening and walk around if you are able. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ take the train once as everywhere was within walking distance. Any way there is probably loads more I could say but Im sure I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe babbled on enough, please go and enjoy. ","annotations":[]}
