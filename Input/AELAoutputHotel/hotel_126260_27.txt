{"text":"4 Perfect Nights in NYC I took my mom to NYC to celebrate her 70th birthday. I looked at over 20 different hotels in the city and finally decided on the Palace for location, reputation and recent reviews. We were not disappointed! The location is superb and the check-in, staff, concierge, maid service, etc. were friendly and professional at all times. We booked a package that included an American breakfast each morning. The food was mediocre (w\/ stellar service) - I would recommend many of the other little coffee shops in the area. There is a Starbucks across the street as well. The breakfast can run upwards of $80 for two people if it's not included in the room. Per all the other reviews, the rooms were spacious and clean - the bathroom was larger than most NY hotel rooms. The health club was large with state of the art equipment and a gorgeous view of St. Patrick's. The locker room and showers were great w\/ bathrobes, lots of fluffy towels and a steam room. We went to 3 Broadway shows and enjoyed all of them! Our choices were The Little Mermaid, Legally Blond and Orange\/Osage County. One thing we noticed is that it was really cold in all of the theaters so bring a jacket or scarf to wrap around your shoulders. The Palace provides a complimentary shuttle to the theater district at 7:30 each evening. However, it's only a 15 minute walk over to the theater district. We took the shuttle over and walked back. We did a self guided walking tour of SoHo and Greenwich village one morning and then went up to Central Park to walk around and people watch. We were also fortunate to encounter a huge street fair on Broadway that spanned about 5 city blocks - it was fun to check out all the vendors and bargains. Another day was spent with On Board Tours of NYC - we booked a 5.5 hour city tour which covered most of Manhattan along with a ferry ride to Staten Island. This was a great way to see all the sights and get acclimated to the city. The bus only accommodates 32 passengers so it was nice to be with a smaller group. We also took the bus up Madison Avenue to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. We had lunch in the museum cafe, however, I would not recommend it to anyone - 2 salads, 1 wine, 1 coffee was $75 - a meal with a memory but a hit on the AMEX. It's nice walk back to the Palace from the MET. We exited on the upper west side and followed Columbus Ave. all the way down and thru Central Park. We were blessed with amazing weather so we took full advantage of being outside. NYC is a wonderful place - We felt extremely safe wherever we went.
