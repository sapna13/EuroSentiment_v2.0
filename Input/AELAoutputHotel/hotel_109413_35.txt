{"text":"Sweet stay at the Magnolia I stayed here with my husband and my six year old son in August. We were in town for the Great American Truck Show that was being held in the Dallas Convention Center. We could easily walk to ithe show in less than 15 minutes. Upon arrival, the kind lady at the front desk upgraded us to a suite when I requested a room higher than the original 12th floor option. I've stayed in downtown Dallas (at several different hotels) and many times during the weekend it can be quite noisy at night (ex: people on the streets and cars). We were more than pleased with our suite (with full kitchen and spacious interior) on the 21st floor. There was a huge, long wall with tall windows, so the view was amazing. The couch was not in the best condition, but everything else was fine. My son loved the blue liquid soap, so I requested more from the front desk. To his delight, they quickly sent up at least 12 bottles. There is a Starbucks in the hotel, but it closes by midafteroon on the weekends. The valet guys were very efficient and helpful. They gave us wonderful directions to the nearby Dallas Zoo and even asked us the next day if we had enjoyed our trip there. The area around the hotel seems safe at night. We felt comfortable enough to walk to a restaurant (The Dakota - you ride a glass elevator down to the dining area) at night. The original Neimen Marcus is next door to the hotel, so it was fun to just go and look. We all enjoyed the milk and yummy cookies that were served in the lounge each night. Overall, the staff and the hotel made for a sweet stay in downtown Dallas.
