{"text":"a little piece of heaven visited the sirenis with 14 mates 12th may 08-26th may 08, have read the other reviews and they are all exactly what i think and would say so wont bore you all with repeats. one of our group was in wheelchair and access was great for him although not onto the beach or in the sea although if you were there at same time of us you may have seen a group of middle age overweight lassies hufting a large white sunbed with a big guy on it down the sand so he could get in the sea and have a wee swim. thanks to the security guard who helped us down and the english guy who helped us back (he only went down once lol) being in a wheelchair they were also on the ground floor of block P and on way back to room one morning there was a large tarantula (yes a real one we have photos will try and add later) needless to say they closed the door on it and killed the poor thing, other couple in wheelchair found one in their bathroom and it jumped on the lady (they also killed it and left it for the maid, not what i'd call a tip lol) but please dont let this put you off as the rest of us didnt see any.if booking quads go with the brothers on the beach to the left of the hotel as they are much safer than the guys who are in the hotel trying to book quads, we went on both and they were both great but the beach were safer (burnt my leg on the other ones) also we went on the banana on the sea and it was a scream and then me and my mates daughter went on Le tube please please dont go on the tube it was the most agonising 10 mins of my life and my backside is black and blue (both cheeks) yes everybody laughs when i tell them and them go oh my god when i flash the buttocks lots of bites from mossies so take plenty of stuff and the only other thing i want to say is that it is quite expensive in the shops, been up north in caberete before and was much cheaper for gifts. if you want to shop go to the little huts to the right of the hotel on the beach shack no5 a guy called emanuel and further along about 10 mins walk a guy called willie with one little shop our girls bought some pics off him and he gave them small one free as well,but the place is great the people are great and the food is great and remember to try the spa in this order steam room, small spa, large spa, right hand jacuzzi and then left hand jacuzzi its a waste any other way (trust me) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":431,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":426}]}
