{"text":"Highlight of our honeymoon! We stayed at the Chancellor for 3 nights last week at the beginning of our honeymoon. We booked at this property because of the excellent reviews on this site and also because we loved Wes Tyler's smart and funny management responses. It was absolutely the right choice.We arrived at the hotel around noon, and the checkin was smooth--despite our early arrival, our room was ready within 15 minutes. The room was lovely, and there was a bottle of champagne, glasses with the Chancellor logo, and a lovely picture frame waiting for us. The front desk and concierge staff were friendly and gave excellent directions to all the places we wanted to go. The coffee and cookies in the lobby were a homey touch, and the coffee was so good I never felt the need to go in search of Peet's! We used the pillow menu (the memory foam pillows are amazing), and we asked the first day for a refrigerator, which was delivered and cold by the time we returned from lunch in Chinatown. We had drinks in the bar each night that we were there, and found Alicia to be a funny and informative barkeep. Housekeeping did a wonderful job of keeping our room clean and comfortable.The location of the hotel is terrific. It was easy to get anywhere we wanted to go, and right on the cablecar line. We were just a couple of blocks from the bus line, Chinatown, the world's largest Macy's, and a mall housing some really wonderful restaurants. We especially enjoyed our meal at Out and About, a Vietnamese restaurant. My husband and I run a 32 room inn with a full service restaurant in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, and came home with lots of ideas to improve our own guests' experience. We loved that the Chancellor provided an umbrella for our use (found in our room closet), especially since it rained for most of the time we were in San Francisco. The guest computer, complete with printer, next to the front desk was easily accessible. We had a wonderful experience staying at the Chancellor, and will definitely return. Next time we hope to meet Wes Tyler to compliment him personally for his well run hotel and excellent staff.
