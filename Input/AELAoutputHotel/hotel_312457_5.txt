{"text":"Quite and pleasant Stayed for six days in early July coming from NZ's Winter. This is a clean and very tidy 4 star hotel in a relatively quite Legian\/Seminyak location not to far from AJ Hackets. (Can't be heard though at night). The entrance is on a short cul de sac with no walk out restaurants, however at night step out onto the beach and walk 100m south toward Legian and you are into food heaven back up on the beach's linking road. Note the Pelangi is direct beach with no road in between and that's a bonus. Try Lanai's upstairs for class and great price. The Hotel pool and restaurant are on the beach so another bonus, and morning buffet breakfast is a smorgasbord of choice and eating out on the tiled exterior in the balmy Bali morning air. I booked directly with the hotel and avoided the touts. Our Super Delux room room was sizeable and included an extra bedroom space for a young one traveling with us. There is a hint of a new development occuring on the Northern side so check with the desk to see its progress. If its underway book the Southern block. At the moment it is just a hole in the ground but things move fast in Asia! The property is a long narrow double blocks (2 story) complex so try to get as close to the pool and beach (Rooms 300 plus). Touts on the beach are intense as anywhere in Bali. No problem. The pool is magnificent and quite a bonus. Surf infront is closeout material all the time and you need to walk 100 meters either way to get a rideable shoulder. Overall neat stay and would come back for the location and solitude.Again nice place. Enjoy.
