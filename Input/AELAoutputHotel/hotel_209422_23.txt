{"text":"Outstanding Hotel in Every Way We stayed here for our first 6 nights in Honolulu and absolutely loved the hotel - we transferred to the Hilton Hawaiian Village and wished we hadn't left here (see our review for that hotel - it was a great disappointment).The staff at the Prince Kuhio were so welcoming - the entire property was in pristine condition, and our room was very, very nice. At first we thought the room size might be a problem - it was a bit smaller than an average hotel room - but it was fine. We had plenty of room and appreciated the ample storage space. The glass blocks in the bathroom wall were a non-issue - you can barely see through them as is, and with the blinds down, there is complete privacy. We had an executive mountain view room (AAA rate of $190) and it was great - we enjoyed the free Internet, continental breakfasts and the evening snacks - and loved the view from our room at night, with the city lights. If we had only stayed in an ocean view room, we would have missed some of the beauty of Honolulu, I think.The restaurant, MAC 24\/7, was so good - we ate there many times and found the food to be exceptionally fresh and delicious, and the prices were very good for Honolulu. We enjoyed being at the eastern end of Waikiki - lots of activity and people along the beach, great stores and restaurants nearby - but the hotel itself was very quiet. We enjoyed the business hotel atmosphere - it seemed more upscale, less touristy than other hotels we visited. The pool was fine - nothing elaborate, but very clean - and very few people (and no kids) on the days I went - and the ocean is just a block away. All in all, a wonderful hotel, with prices much lower than others in Waikiki - we will return!
