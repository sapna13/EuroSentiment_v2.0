{"text":"Loved loved loved it!!!! This places is so beautiful, i'm sitting here at work and wishing i was back at PCP! My boyfriend and i are 24 and 29 and we absolutly fell in love with this resort.The ride to the resort isn't THAT bumpy, i don't know why people complain. It's fun jumping up and down a bit. We arrived at the resort about an hour after we landed and were greeting with drinks and cold towel. The receptionist (jose) was VERY nice. He upgraded us to VIP, and we stayed in building 5, which i must say had the most beautiful view. One morinig we got up early enough to see the sunrise from our room, so beautiful!Food- since we are vegetarian the choices for us was very minimum, we never went hungry tho !! the pasta for lunch and dinner at the buffet is more then engouhg food. We tried 3 of the restaurant. please note that not ALL the restaurants are open everyday!! we tried the tex mex( surpriseingly they had no veggie food, but they did fo out of their way to make veggie fajitas for us) the fodu resturant which was really good and the italian place. all the restuarants we tried were amazing food! Didnt try any meat so can't comment on that.Beach!- Omg.. that all i can say. Just beautiful! the princesses beachs are the nicest, we went walking along the beach( only a short walk) and found the other resorts werent as nice as ours..I was happy! there are some vendors along the beach but just a smile and a no thanks will keep them away from you. and remeber the prices you pay should be less then half of what they ask. This is for stuff they sell on the beach.Services- The most friendliest people i have ever met. Eveyone has a smile and go out of you way to help you. We would tip everyone that would help us and they did a fantastic job! Please tip everyone they deserve it! the Animacion team do such a great job in trying to get people to join in on the fun!! from veronica, mosquito, chocolate and everyone else, they are sooo funny and knwo how to dance! the resort get a bit dull after the pool closes but they is always stuff to do in the lobby after dinner, like karaoke or going over to the sister resort to the club( which i had a lot of fun in!) the only bad experience i had and it has NOTHING to do with the resort is that we had our digital camera stolen by these 2 ladies( mid-40's) one of them had been diganise with breat cancer and had maybe 2 months to live. My bf ..being a doctor took his time out to talk to her and give advise. We eventually found out they didnt bring a camera, so we were like hey we'll take some pics for you and email them to you.. we had a bit too many shots and ended up leaving the pool bar at 8 45, drunk. we went upstairs to our room and with in 10 mins realized the camera was gone, we went back down and it was no where to be found. i remeberd one of them telling me thier room number so we went to thier room to see if they thad it .. they said no( which they liedddddddd!!!!!) The ladies were leavign the next morining at 5 am... but the staff was so friendly! I told Fransico what happened and he keept on calling security every day to see if the camera had been found but not luck! we bough a disposable and we madefriends with ppl and took pics on thier camera which they will email to us!! i Loved the resort!! Highly reccoment it!! did not get bitten by any bugssss nor did anyother person i met..!! but on of out resort friends did..
