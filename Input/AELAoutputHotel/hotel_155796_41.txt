{"text":"Cordial receptionist, Clean rooms, Great Flora on Property I want to thank the people who work in the reception area for their cordial welcome and assistance. It was a pleasure to meet you. I had a problem at a condo, bed rock beds, so I came to this hotel to finally get some sleep, and all was fine. Thanks. Lunches were fantastic at their facility. Unfortunately, evening dinners were the opposite. My pene macaroni plate with shrimp was about room temperature when served after waiting over 40 minutes. I think the temperature at seating was 45F, maybe they might need to turn the AC up? The waitress was pleasant, the delay wasn't her fault. Breakfast: A buffett was on the menu, but their wasn't one. I picked french toast, and three egg whites on the side. All tasted great but I was charged $8 for the egg whites on top of $8 for the french toast. I like that profit margin! The next day we ate dinner at Rosa's seafood, located near the ferry dock area. The red snapper was something to photograph, I felt bad wanting to eat it until I took my first bite. It was a skelton in about 20 minutes, fantastic. I wanted to hire the cook and take him home. Sorry I got off the subject, but that's the place to eat if you like seafood. Back to ' the inn'.In summary: The pros: clean rooms, good beds, wonderful receptionists, great variety of flora. Great lunches . The cons: food service in the evening was poor.Waitresses were very nice and cordial.Breakfast: was great with a few surprises.
