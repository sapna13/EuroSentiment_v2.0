{"text":"A Good Find If this is your first time to Hong Kong or if you are a leisure traveler then this hotel is probably a pretty good bet for you. If you have travelled to Hong Kong and stayed previously in any of the major hotels then you will notice that the service here whilst excellent compared to elsewhere in the world, is just not as slick and sharp and does not quite meet the standard of Hong Kong√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ many other better known hotels. I have stayed in most of the well know hotels in Hong Kong so I guess I may expect a lot.That said, the rate I paid was below current rates for the better known hotels and as housekeeping, choice of food and all other things met the usual superb Hong Kong standards, it was a pretty good deal.The location may or may not be a problem. Located about 1 hour walk from the main shopping areas around Nathan road (walking not suggested as busy flyovers in the way) the hotel operates a quick and frequent free bus shuttle service to the shopping area and the airport express station. Taxi√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ are also easy to find and cheap in Hong Kong. In fact although the hotel is in a residential area it has a greater feeling of space than is usual in Hong Kong.The harbor view from the hotel or the walk way outside is arguably better than from the better know harbour side hotels as you get a much better perspective from the distance. If you are on business and visiting the exhibition centre in Wan Chai (Honk Kong Island) this may not be an obvious hotel to stay. However, the hotel is 4 minutes walk from the Hung Hom star ferry terminal to Wan Chai and Central and is probably one of the easiest Kowloon hotels to reach the island from. In fact for an alternative and more pleasant way to reach the main shopping areas of Kowloon from the hotel, it is no big deal if you have the time (and costs less than HK$10) to take a ferry to Wan Chai and then from Wan Chai back to Kowloon and the main star ferry terminal\/shopping area.Would I stay here again, probably.
