{"text":"A reality check -- please!!! I just returned from three nights at the Hyatt Regency Paris Madeleine, and overall, the reviews on this site are accurate. I would rate the property a low 4, but I acknowledge that I have no familiarity with other hotels in Paris. Perhaps it really is as good as some claim.Check in √à√\u2020\u2022?quick, accurate but not that friendly. I was pleased that my room was ready on arrival at 1 pm. Entering the Executive King (204, right next to elevator, when I had asked specifically to be far from it), I was hit with blast furnace heat. I tried to adjust the thermostat, but could only turn it on or off with various fan settings. The room was very quiet, however, with double pane windows, but I knew that I would have to open some windows to relieve the heat. And it was very noisy with the fresh air. So I went back to front desk and asked to be moved. The room - they were happy to move me, and within a few minutes I was shown a second room, a Deluxe King, for 100 euro less a night. This room was extremely quiet, overlooking a courtyard, even with the windows open (although I agree with other reviewers about doors slamming, footsteps, construction pounding, and other interior hotel noise). The size of the two rooms seemed to be the same, although the Deluxe bathroom was bigger. It also looked a bit dingier √à√\u2020\u2022?carpet were not that clean, there were three insufficient lights (the room was rather dark), and other than an uncomfortable desk chair, no place to sit. There was very little tabletop space, and no clock anywhere. A large flat screen TV worked the first day but did not the day I checked out. The bed was hard as rocks (much like those in China) with a nice sheets and a good duvet (but a bit hot). Wireless internet access was available for 23 Euro a day. The minibar was the move anything get charged type, but there was a small area for personal stuff. The bathroom √à√\u2020\u2022?spacious, well-lit, sufficient towels. Tub was difficult to get in and out of and the rain shower, with water falling straight down, made it hard not to bump into the temperature water control knob. I had problems with temperature control throughout my stay (including in the shower). Whatever came out of the vents was very warm, so I opened the windows. But once the windows were open, the heating shut off. Meaning that it was have the windows closed and bake or open them up and freeze.Restaurants √à√\u2020\u2022?Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ M was the location of the continental breakfast each morning. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a dark, sexy space, with comfortable chairs and nice soothing music. I thought the buffet was very good, even at about 35 Euros. The attendants were polite and helpful and the food was filling and of high quality. I also ate lunch at La Chinnoserie and was pleased with the quality of the food and the service. Fitness center\/spa √à√\u2020\u2022?there is a small exercise room, a relaxation lounge, and locker rooms with steam and sauna. The Hyatt website is misleading about the services offered though. I booked a manicure and pedicure, expecting something like what you get in the US with a soak, scrub, moisturizer and massage, as well as a polish. The esthetician came in with a suitcase of equipment and I had to sit on a table like at a doctors office. I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sure about the cleanliness of the implements, and the services were really just cut, shape, and polish. Very, very expensive for this minimal treatment.Location √à√\u2020\u2022?good, but not great, in my opinion. A few blocks from two metro stations. Sidewalks in Paris can be bumpy and uneven, which makes for strenuous walks. Monoprix is a few blocks north, good to pick up stuff so you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to pay extortionist prices from the minibar. There was absolutely nothing open on Sunday. All in all, I was not bothered by the price or the size of the room, but the lack of a chair, poor lighting, little desktop space, no clock, and impossible temperature control made my stay less than satisfactory.
