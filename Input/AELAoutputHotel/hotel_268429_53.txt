{"text":"Nice hotel, close to the beach I stayed in this hotel with my wife and small daughter for 8 days at the end of December. This is a clean and well-kept hotel with modern furniture in the rooms, flat-screen TV's with over 100 free cable channels, and a wine fridge in every room. A basic continental breakfast is included in the price. There is a jacuzzi in a nice terrace patio in the third floor that is open until 9 pm in the evening. There is also a small pool in the first floor of the hotel, but it's not very sunny there. As far as we can tell, this is not a chain hotel, which is good because the staff were that much more friendly. We asked for a crib for our daughter and were provided with one free of charge. There is a very good Argentinian restaurant called Buenos Ayres just down the street with very tasty food and large portions at a moderate price ($18 to $25 per main dish). The beach is two blocks away. NOTE OF CAUTION: if you go to San Juan (or most other places on the north shore) during the winter months from December to March, the ocean rough - the waves are strong and the undertow is powerful. While we were in Condado beach we saw an emergency situation in which a person got too far out from the shore and had to be rescued by several other people. Afterwards we were told by some locals that this (and worse) happens several times each winter. Be careful.
