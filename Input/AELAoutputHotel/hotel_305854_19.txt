{"text":"Good value, liked location My husband has happily stayed several times at the Harbour Metropolis for business so when I decided to fly over for my first visit to Hong Kong at the end of a busines trip for him, he chose this hotel for my stay. We got a suite with a harbour view and frankly I could have spent the whole trip in a chair pulled up to the window watching the harbour!! The rooms were average, middle of the road-not luxurious but clean and comfortable. But the view was spectacular! one night we watched the harbour light show from our windows and it is a sight I won't soon forget.We liked the location of the hotel-after a day of sighteseeing in crowds and noise, our rooms felt like a nice, quiet oasis. It was VERY easy to take the shuttle to the downtown and that location was very close to the ferry, Nathan Road and the promenade,The mall was very handy and interesting-it is geared towards residents that live and work locally and I enjoyed browsing the supermarket, watching the people and having a light meal at one of the restuarants. I also got a kick out of the weddings and all the stores and decorations that support this hotel being a wedding destination. I kept trying to sneak pictures of the different wedding parties much to my husband's embarrassment!We had a couple of great meals at Knutsford Terrace (El Cid for tapas was particularly enjoyable) and found the History museum a good destination for a rainy day on the advice of the staff. The hotel staff was always helpful in getting us transportation for various ventures (writing out our destinations for cabs, giving advice on options etc..) although communicating in english wasn't always easy.We took the train from the MTR station to Mong Kok and visiting the Ladies Market was an inexpensive and fascinating experience. I don't think we would have done this if it wasn't so easy to walk from the hotel, through the mall and over a covered walkway into the train station.I was alone for a day or two and felt very safe in the hotel and was treated well by the wait staff when going to the buffet breakfast (which has a lot of choices but the food is average in my opinion.). I used the car service when arriving from the airport and the bus service going back-I would highly recommend both options-both were a very positive experience.Overall, if you are looking for a 5 star hotel for the ultimate Hong Kong experience, this isn't it. But if you are looking for a moderately priced stay in a comfortable environment as a base for visiting Hong Kong, then I would highly recommend the Harbour Metropolis. I will definitely stay there next trip.
