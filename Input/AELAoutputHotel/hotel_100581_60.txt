{"text":"Excellent Accomodations Me and my girlfriend stayed at the University Inn (in a deluxe room) from July 28-30. We had never been to Seattle and had heard such great things about this hotel in the U-District. Since we had to stay close to the Children's and UW Hospital, the University Inn had an ideal location. First off, it is really easy to find from the Airport (just had to take the UW exit and go down one or two streets (look out for the one-way signs!). The parking lot is big enough, and parking was free. The lobby and breakfast area is spotless and very modern looking; in fact, everything had a very modern and newish feel to it. The front desk staff was very helpful and accomodating; I was able to reserve a shuttle to downtown when checking in. Our room was on the third floor and since it was a deluxe room, there was a small microwave and refrigerator. The bathroom was a little small, but there was an extra sink outside the bathroom. The king bed was comfortable. TV was pretty large with free showtime. Everything was immaculate in the room and they even provide herbal essence shampoo, conditioner, lotion, and soap! The free breakfast was excellent as we made waffles both mornings. The 2nd morning, we had them deliver muffins, bagels, and fruit to our door by 6am (we had an early start). Free coffee, tea, and hot cocoa was available 24 hours. The free shuttle service was excellent; since there was a huge parade on the 29th, traffic was a bit heavy heading into downtown. However, the shuttle was prompt in picking us up, taking us to the Seattle Center, and finally picking us up at Pacific Place (nice mall in downtown). I highly recommend staying in the University District because of its college-town setting and wide variety of places to eat. There is even a Trader Joe's just up the street from the University Inn. I look forward to staying at the University Inn again in the future (will probably never stay downtown because of my great experience!)
