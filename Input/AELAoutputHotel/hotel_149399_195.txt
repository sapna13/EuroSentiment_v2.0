{"text":"Large and well run, a mixed blessing for families with small children This is a very large resort with a beautiful beach and overall good to very good facilities. The not too large rooms are in villas and spread out over a wide campus, there is some beautiful park in the middle, and the Lobby\/Restaurant area in front is connected with the bulk of the villas and the beach by a Diesel train. Distances are long, which makes getting around a little bit challenging (e.g if you are in a Restaurant, you cannot simply hop back to your room) . If you live in a a real suite (we considered upgrading with our children age 3 and 5), you will be quite far away form the beach and the kid's club (that's wh we didn't do that). I wonder why there are so few resorts with some rooms equipped with a bunkbed which you can separate from the rest of the room with a half wall and\/or a curtain - the gained privacy certainly would be great ....Some thoughts:-buffet food overall very good, especially the fresh seafood-a la carte restaurants: no limits for reservations, but the reservation system can be a hassle (call in from 9 am), esp. for the Japanese place which tends to book out within 30 minutes, and lines are always busy from 9-9:30 am. The italian place La Gondola is average (not comparable to an upscale big city italian place), the coveted japanese place offers the entertainment of watching the chef in front of you, but food is average (so don't be sad if you miss it if you can visit a good Japanese place in e.g Chicago). I found some most dishes in the Dominican restaurant excellent.-pools: nice; some slides for the kids would be great-beach: can't be much better-kid's club: up to 4 ys, well staffed day care with a\/c, toys and TV-5 and up: good activity program from 10 to 5 pm, also kid's disco at night. -no good playground (swing set etc.), and it is missed-sports: little beach- and very little water volleyball when we were there (in some resorts, some courts are busy most of the time). I played some tennis, there were 2 pros and a helper who hits with you for free if you don't have a partner (3.5 level), lessons are U$ 20\/hr, clay courts are uneven, would try the asphalt courts. Overall very nice hotel - but we will try to find a smaller resort with shorter distances next time (although the trend seems to go towards the huge places). Some extra fees can be slightly annoying, at least for an upscale all inclusive: room safe U$ 2\/day, kid's club was repeatedly 10 U$ (once for a paintable T -shirt and once for a fancy trampoline), and I think the climbing wall was 10 Dollars too.
