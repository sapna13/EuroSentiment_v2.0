{"text":"Fun weekend at the Adams Mark I don't know about others, but I would definitely stay here again. I went for a business conference and there were thousands of people from other business conferences including mine staying at the hotel. Everything was so lively and bustling and the building itself was right in the middle of downtown and it was tall, which was a breath of fresh air for me because I grew up in a big city. The sports bar was fun and the pool hall was full of people dancing. The restaurant was overcrowded and room service was great!I loved the walkways to the other buildings and the close vicinity to public transportation. Unfortunately, downtown Dallas is so large that it just looks empty so walking around there by myself on an extremely cold day felt dangerous, I wouldn't walk to far by myself, there are too many crazed homeless people because of the cold. The DART (kind of like a subway and trolley in one) was a very good way to get around the city and the buses were very punctual. There was a DART station right outside the hotel so that was convenient. The service was very good and the people were as helpful as they could be. I asked for a verbal tour so they had a lot of patience if you ask me. My room had a great view and a great bathtub. I would definitely recommend anybody who is willing to spend a few bucks to stay here. ","annotations":[]}
