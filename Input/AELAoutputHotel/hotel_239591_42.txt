{"text":"Excellent Experience I stayed in the Hotel Principal for the last week of November 2007. I had an excellent experience in this hotel. In fact it probably should be a 3 star rating instead of 2. I had a single room which was very comfortable and clean. This may be the first time I stayed in a hotel and did not experience ambient noise coming from adjacent rooms. The only issue for me was people arriving late at night and not having any consideration while in the hallways. But that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ another story.The hotel is a short walk to La Rambla and almost every sight in the old city and L√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©¬¢xiample is accessible from the metro . The breakfast -at 8 euros extra per day- is a western style buffet (eggs, toast, coffee etc...). Liceu metro stop is a short walk away on La Rambla and the marina can be reached on foot in less than 10 minutes. Warning: WATCH YOUR WALLET. Barcelona is rampant with pick pocketing thieves. Sadly, I was a victim of this while riding the metro (the last day of my trip). When I went to the police office to report the theft, there was a line of people who also shared similar stories with me. I also witnessed a theft while sitting inside a bus. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been warned!The hotel also has a nice rooftop terrace with ample seating. The outdoor bar\/caf√ã√\u2022√ñ at the end of the street is a nice convenience for the weary tourist at the end of the day. However I would avoid the restaurant across the street from the bar. There are many better options a short walk away.
