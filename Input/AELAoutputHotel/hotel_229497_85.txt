{"text":"Ask and it's yours! We booked interconnecting rooms at a fabulous rate of 230 euros per room per night for dinner, bed and breakfast. However once there the rooms we had been allocated were very small (we have three children who always have their own room). At the reception desk (even though the hotel was virtually full) the staff were incredibly helpful and showed me two other 'setups' that would have been appropriate. We decided to go for a bedroom with interconecting lounge (with sofa-bed) for a fabulous rate of 309 euros (for both bits). The rate incuded the minibar (the free chocolate went down very well with my three children) and the wine was a decent standard, in addition to this, it included breakfast at the club lounge which offered a wide enough range of breakfast choices and in the evenings from 5.30pm had free wines etc and hot and cold nibbles. It felt a little strange going into the lounge to get our 'freebies', but once the room filled up the atmosphere was like a very chilled but lively (you get my drift) nice bar. Our children were the only ones there, but we did not feel self conscious and the manager when she saw our children there even went downstairs to collect colouring things for the younger two. The decor is rather peculiar and you are definately part of a 'chain', but that actually worked in the hotel's favour in so much as the staff were all very well trained, the hotel was spotless and the 'american' attitude to customer service was very, very welcome!The restaurant (behind the bar) was fabulous and very inexpesive compared to other five stars we have visited in mainland Europe.
