{"text":"Good Sydney Location We spent 6 nights in a 2 bed apartment at the Medina Grand. The external appearance of the building suggested nothing remarkable but we were very impressed by the excellent quality of the apartments.The Medina Grand is in a great location for visitors to Sydney with all the main attractions within easy walking distance. Darling Harbour is a 10 minutes away and Town Hall station is 5 minutes in the opposite direction. Avoid the convenience stores in the streets adjacent to the Medina; they are horrendously expensive and there is a good Woolworth's food store opposite the Town Hall station with a bottle shop around the corner from Woolworths.As there are only a few apartments on each floor there was absolutely no noise from other guests. Only cooking smells in the lobby areas suggested that other apartments were in use. Some occassional vehicle noise and raised voices were heard from the street level below but as this is a city centre location this was not remarkable.We found the air conditioning to be out of balance between rooms and a comfortable night time temperature could not be achieved in the main bedroom. The worn out buttons on the temperature control suggested that we were not the first visitors to struggle with this. Even when the air conditioning was turned off cold air continued to emerge from the vent in the main bedroom leaving one room cold and the other hot!Despite this minor criticism we would definitely use the Medina Grand again.
