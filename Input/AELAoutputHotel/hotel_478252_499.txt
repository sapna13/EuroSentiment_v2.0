{"text":"A Restful Vacation We arrived at the resort not knowing how enormous the resort truly was. We were quickly checked in, and then dropped off at our room that was still being cleaned by the maid. We read through the hotel material, and realized that we did not have a copy of a map. (I encourage everyone to ask for a map when you check-in). So we stumbled our way around until we met with our travel representative the next day. He advised us off all of the hotel amenities and locations. The resort provides a shuttle service from one end of the property to the other. The beach itself was a long beautiful white sand beach; it truly was a tropical paradise. The grounds of the property are well kept and very clean with beautiful lush tropical foliage and palm trees. The pool was beautiful with the added touch of a swim up bar at each of its pools. Our room was nice, we had a king size bed; balcony; and Jacuzzi tub. We tipped our maid. She ensured that our mini fridge was kept well stocked with an ample amount of water and beverages. The room itself was well maintained and kept very clean. However we are non-smokers and at nights we constantly awoke to a strong smoke smell in the room.  The food was wonderful; we ate at the buffet every morning for breakfast and for four evenings. We were pleased with the food and it quality. We ate an ample amount of Seafood, fruit, and a large array of other foods. We believe that there is something for the pickiest eater. The waiters were very very attentive so much so that I always felt like I was being watched. As soon I ate the last morsel on my plate my plate was then quickly whisked away. We ate at three of the a la carte restaurants (Seafood; Grill; and Japanese) my personal preference was the seafood hands down. It was absolutely exceptional. There is much to do at this resort I went to the spa, my husband and I played mini gulfed, walked extensively, we also went on an excursion to the countryside. We would highly recommend this as it gives you a true reflection of the culture and the people of the Dominican. Our only concern with this resort was the excessive amount of smoking and smokers at this resort. There was smoking everywhere, people lit up at the drop of a hat with no regards for their fellow vacationers. Our room was on the third floor and the smoke from the other rooms would come into our room through the vents.
