{"text":"Very convenient hotel We booked the Intercity hotel because we were spending the time looking for places to live in Berlin and therefore wanted to be near a hub of S-Bahn, U-Bahn, which the Ostbahnhof is. The room was pretty small, not helped by the fact that we had a baby cot in there as well. I called before arrival to check that a kettle would be in the room in order to be able to heat up the baby's bottle. They said there would be but we would have to upgrade to a business class room. At this point we should have just decided to take our own kettle with us, but anyway, we didn't think about that. Upon arrival we were told that the double bed we had reserved was now actually 2 twin beds pushed together. On the plus side, though, included in the room price (any room price, not just business rooms) were travel tickets for zones A,B,C for both of us for the duration of our stay. This was a saving of about √à√\u2020√ü?0 over the 4 days, so that was good. There are quite a few shops and food places in the station, but there is a shortage of restaurants to go to in the immediate vicinity of the station. We tried the restaurant in the hotel one evening - the food was quite good, but the restaurant was pretty deserted - plenty of other options around Berlin, I suppose....I probably would stay there again, but only when travelling on business. The station is buzzy, and it is handy having supermarkets in the station basement. ","annotations":[]}
