{"text":"Wish we were back at the San Juan IC right now ! ! We recently came back from our second visit to the SJIC. What a great place. We stayed there from January 6--9th, 2007 to celebrate our anniversary. Our first visit was in January 2001. I can only agree wholeheartedly with the positive reviews this hotel has received. Our experiences both on this trip and in 2001 were first rate. Let me start by saying that I am VERY particular and I pay attention to detail. In fact , I think of myself as an unpaid AAA hotel critic, with lots of experience but no salary. We booked an ocean view room at $350 per night, including breakfast. Not cheap, but all of the top places in San Juan that I checked also seemed very expensive. They also charge the very annoying add-on √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªesort fee√à√\u2020\u2022?(as do many other hotels.) which can cause some sticker shock when checking out. Nevertheless, we decided to splurge√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√Önd are very glad we did.The hotel staff learned we were celebrating our anniversary and boy did they roll out the red carpet. I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe their generosity and thoughtfulness. They upgraded us to a huge suite in the club area√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√£ust beautiful and extremely comfortable. And not only did they give us complimentary fruit and chocolate covered strawberries, they also sent us bottle of champagne that was listed at $100 on the room service menu. Wow--did we feel like VIPs.Just for future reference, I walked around the hotel and checked out the standard rooms. The rooms were clean and in good shape, and the hallways were also in good condition. The rooms are average comfortable size, though the bathrooms are somewhat small, and each room has a small balcony. The balconies are really nice to have instead of the typical sealed up room. You can open your door in the morning and let in the balmy Puerto Rican breezes. Wish I was there right now with a cup of Joe.The breakfast buffet was open air, which we prefer in the tropics, with lots of choices including an omelet \/egg station.The hotel has a casual restaurant \/ bar right smack dab on the beach, with some tables actually in the sand. Fabulous location and worth a visit. The food was OK, but pricy, e.g., chicken burger about $13, but unbeatable atmosphere. There is an Italian restaurant, although it was closed for renovation. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try the on-site Ruth Chriss Steak House. We tried the casino, but didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have much luck. The lobby is quite stylish and up-to-date, with lots of activity. The pool area was beautiful, with a cool swim-up bar, poolside restaurant with an outdoor bar-b-q chef on duty, which was a great idea. Apparently the entire pool area had just been renovated. When we were there we had no problems finding a place to sit or swim as some prior reviews mentioned. The multiple pool areas and hot tub are big and beautifully landscaped. One of the best restaurants we ate at on the trip was the Metropole, which is a very popular local√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ institution. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just a five minute walk from the hotel. The place gets quite crowded but worth the wait. They serve terrific (and very inexpensive) Cuban\/Puerto Rican food. Turn left out of the hotel, cross the street and the restaurant is just past the cockfighting stadium (we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stop in there.)The hotel concierge, Jossell, couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have been more helpful. (In fact, the service at the hotel was terrific from everyone we encountered.) Jossell recommended a kayak outing to the bioluminescent bay (only at night), which was a great experience, even though we had never been kayaking before. I think the best time to go, if your timing is right, is on a moonless night. There really is a so much to see and do in San Juan and Puerto Rico, we hope to stay longer on our next trip.
