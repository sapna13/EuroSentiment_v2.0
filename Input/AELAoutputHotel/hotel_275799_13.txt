{"text":"Cool to look at, A pain to stay at Like all W's this is a visually stunning hotel with a clearly stated attitude of Cool. Tons of attention spent on lighting, building materials, primary and contrasting colors, and a casually cool staff all come together to make a clear statement. Great place to walk thru or to step in for an afternoon ... staying there is another thing.The endless techno music starts at 6am and goes until ... sometime in the morning I suspect and wears. Guest rooms are visually cool, but take a day or so to learn how to actually stay in. Small things like a neat industrial sink in the room that has water pressure that splatters the rest of the room. A great looking bed that defies comfort. Lighting that is better suited to seduction than reading. Special mention is the combo shower, sun, hammock, and bathroom space. The hammock is great (easily the most comfortable piece of furniture in the room) but over a tile floor which means a certain amount of prayer on getting in an out of. The shower is a rainforest head which drops so much water that the relatively shallow drain is defeated and the water flows into the bedroom area. Meeting rooms are set up too tight and quickly become to hot and stuffy. Food again looks good but tastes off. The bar area is really cool at night but uncomfortable to sit in for any length of time. The restaurant is OK in quality but overpriced to what is delivered to the table. Parking is expensive and car retrieval is slow at best. The staff is helpful, but non-directed.The W is located in a whole row of hotels that are priced more or less the same. Would recommend the Inter-continental or the Sheraton or the a couple blocks away the Camino Real before mentioning the W.
