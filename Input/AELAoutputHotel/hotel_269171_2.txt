{"text":"wish I lived here!! Found this hotel by the website easytobook, which I would recommend as being legitimate and trustworthy.Let me first say that I LOVED this hotel, everything about it. I was checked in by Will, a wonderful, friendly, kind man, who was very helpful and kind throughout my 2 day stay. The free, delicious breakfast the first morning was an added bonus, and I ate there again the morning after (good value for 10√à√\u2020√ü?. The rooms were comfortable, with DVDs to borrow from downstairs, free internet, and a direct line to phone home with (after buying a calling card). Pretty canal view from room 32, and a clean bathroom.Here`s what tipped this hotel over the edge: I booked into an apartment for 5 days after staying at this hotel for 2, because the apt had a kitchen. Let me tell you, I wished I`d stayed at Hotel Eureka. It feels so warm, friendly, inviting. Will with his classical music at night, have a cup of tea in the warm sitting room. I lost the keys to my apartment on the 2nd day and was able to come to this hotel and they helped me (gave us free tea and allowed the apt owner to phone me there when they got home). On my last night I went again and was given tea and a place to be quiet. If you dont need a kitchen, then I cant imagine why you`d stay anywhere else in Amsterdam. Unless you`re after 5 star accommodation. But at 110√à√\u2020√ü?night, the price was right. If I go ack to Amsterdam I will only stay here.PS if you read the other reviews you`ll see that everyone loves this hotel!! :=) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":936,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":933},{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1078},{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1078},{"endOffset":1194,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1191}]}
