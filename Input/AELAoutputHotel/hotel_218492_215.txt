{"text":"A bit of false advertising..... Stayed at the Grand Oasis from Jan 17-24th. The Chameleon Suites were recommended to us by a travel agent with Holiday Market on line agency. Right up until the day of arrival we were unsure exactly what we'd be getting into as there were conflicting reports as to whether the building\/rooms would be ready for occupancy. It's unfortunate that the agent didn't seem to be fully informed as to the status...I'm going to start with the not so good and end with the good...So.....the internet pics showed a floating rock climbing apparatus in the ocean-not there-it showed a large private pool alongside the ocean-not there-showed a nice hot tub in the spa area-did not say you had to pay $5.00 for 15 minutes to use. Showed a lazy susan style pool exclusive to Chameleon Suites-not filled. Booked in a group of 12  asked to be booked in the same building-assured this wouldn't be a problem-it was-we ended up in 3 different buildings-and not all in the Chameleon Suites. Friends in building 11 had no hot water a couple of times. Friends in building 6-had 2 beds pushed together vs a King size bed and the hallway smelled like raw sewage-they asked to be moved and it took a couple of days to get this changed. Our room in building 10 was nice-fridge wasn't very cold. We tipped our maid daily with money, candy etc. Didn't notice any extras -but we fully intended to tip regardless :)Chameleon Suites advantages advertised: Private Check in  out-unsure what this exactly meant as we received no special treatment here.Free internet-had to pay $5.00 for 20 minutes-and it wasn't up and running very often.Beach towels in room-never happened in our room-and it was only for the 1st day-the rest of the time you had to go and get yourself.Poolside drink service-never happened.$10.00 per room\/day for casino-did get this, but could only be used at black jack or roulette tables. Could only use 1 voucher per day and Casino staff were very rude and accused a couple of people of trying to use more than 1\/day when we didn't. Casino staff did not speak english.Restaurant reservations-we were able to book this-outside of the scheduled booking times for other guests.We enjoyed the entertainment. Most of the Recreation staff were fun and polite-we liked Yeti, Kathi, Coco Loco and the M.C.Kathi-braids hair at a good price and is located on the beach by the water sports building. Just barter with her as she will start off at a ridiculous price.DON'T book the dune buggy excursion with the fellas by the pool. They told us it was a 20 minute drive from the hotel-it was 1 hour 1 way. We were supposed to visit dunes and caves and swim in a natural spring. First of all-we were 1\/2 hour delayed as one buggy had no brakes-one buggy's wheel fell off after driving approx. 20 feet. They didn't have enough buggy's for us to begin with. Once we got to the beach, 3 buggy's stalled and it took us at least 45 minutes to get up and running again. So we finally just told them to take us back and send the bus-we didn't even finish the excursion. We managed to get a bit of money back-but it wasn't worth the time it took.Even though it seems as though it wasn't that great-our group made the best of it and actually had a good time. We enjoyed the Karaoke nightly and had a great time by the pool each day. If you're travelling in a group-it's best to get someone to save your seats early in the morning as lounges get taken up quickly.The food was fine and the Italian restaurant was good.
