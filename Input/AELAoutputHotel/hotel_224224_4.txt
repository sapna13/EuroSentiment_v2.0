{"text":"delightful Had a wonderful stay here recently and completely fell in love with the atmosphere and location. I usually stay at the Four Seasons, and was worried I would be dissapointed in the room size and bathroom at the Ritz, but it couldn't have been better. While the ceilings are lower, and the rooms don't have that spectacular architectural feel of the FS, it is a wonderful alternative and offers a much more residential, cozy and warmer atmosphere. Just know that the rooms are quite small, but beautifully detailed. Low ceilings, and a huge armoire holding an outdated television overpowered my room a bit. (I was in a Park View Room. I also viewed a Deluxe Park View Suite, which had a plasma sitting on a console table in the living room, but walking into the suite and seeing the side of the TV is not the right solution) My room was exquisitely detailed with upholstered silk walls and thick mouldings, a truly lovely grey marble bath, and everything immaculately clean. A sublimely comfortable club chair, with a lamp and side table right where you need it make this the kind of hotel room you want to curl up and really live in. The park views are spectacular and you feel like you're staying in an elegant townhouse. The staff definitely works to achieve this friendly atmosphere, and they are clearly trying to be warmer and less rehearsed than Ritz employees have been in the past. Even though, I don't think it's necessary to shake hands with the doorman, who took off his white glove and extended his hand before I made it to the door from the car. Call me a germaphobe, but I think he could have made me feel just as welcome with a smile. Also, each employee gives you his or her name. It takes a little getting used to, and at first could strike some as fishing for tips, but it does enhance the warm almost family atmosphere. An odd detail was the housekeeping cart that was parked in the hallway each night. The first night I thought it was a mistake. But all 3 nights of my stay, there it was, parked within view of my door! Its a shame, because the hallways in the Ritz are probably the most attractive of any hotel in the city. Room service was fast and very good, but I did notice that unlike the FS, there was no felt padding underneath the table cloth, a minor detail, but this hotel is all about the details. Two pointers when booking a room: 1) Absolutely get park view. It is worth it, and you will not have the same experience if you don't. 2) The club is not a must, and the concept is different than other ritz hotels but there are some positives, more on that below.The club lounge itself is on the second floor next to the spa with a door you access with your room key. (you simply pay to add club access to any room)  For breakfast in the club, you have to take the elevator down practically to the lobby, so you feel like you need to get dressed up, in which case I'm going out to a restaraunt for a real breakfast. If you don't want to spend the extra money you could have a very nice experience here, and never miss it. Although I will say once inside, it is far more professional and elegant than other Ritz Club lounges. (servers in the lounge are most attentive, and constantly offer to replenish your drinks and snacks, whereas other Ritz lounges have become much more self serve). A very nice touch was the phone call from the club concierge the night before my departure, asking if I needed him to arrange an airport transfer or to print boarding passes. Again, its all in the details. Overall, a wonderful experience. I will definitely be back.
