{"text":"Loved it!!!! My family and I (me, hubby, 5 kids) arrived in Bali on March 17th from Perth. First impressions of hotel was stunning. The porter\/bellboy was jovial and entertained us with his brilliant humour. The kids rooms (2 x ocean view rooms) were ready and they settled in however they tried to put hubby and I in similiar room when I had paid for a suite facing the ocean. We waited over an hour for things to be sorted with no apology. It was not a good start. In the end we made our own way to the room.have to say the suite was perfect, I cannot fault it in anyway except to say I wish the balcony was bigger but that was no real problem.After the initial disappointment at check in, we settled in nicely to the room and loved every minute of our stay. The staff at reception we all found to be not very friendly but everyone else was great. We made friends with the pool bar staff and staff at the spa and also the melasti restaurant.My son had his 14th birthday there and they really made it special. All the staff at the restaurant sang to him. The pool bar is great. Pool fabulous. Great food especially the buffet brekkie. Spa treatments were to die for and I had a massage or treatment everyday!!! The kids loved the beach and did many water sports and it was completely safe for them. There are a few shops in the area opposite the hotel but just a 5 min drive is the main Nusa Dua markets and we found it the best place to shop as it was quiet unlike Kuta. The kids got better bargains there than in Kuta so we stuck with these markets and saved the trauma of busy Kuta!!!I personally like the hotel. Some say it is dated but I never really found that. the rooms were very clean.We all enjoyed it so much that we are going back again for Christmas!! ","annotations":[]}
