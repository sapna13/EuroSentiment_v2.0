{"text":"Great place for the right price This can be a great place to stay depending on what you pay. We booked this on Priceline (bidding) for $115 per night. For that price it was a steal. We booked it for before and after a cruise. It is actually a very nice hotel in a great location and has an excellent pool and beach. The hotel has a large open air lobby which is nice but not as classy as the Wyndham El San Juan but nice enough. The hotel has been built in phases over the years. We were in the original building which I prefer since all of the rooms have great water views. Some of the later buildings have sections that look out on other buildings and parking garage, etc. The rooms are a decent size with nice bathrooms and very nice beds and bedding. The furniture is a little dated. The hotel has an excellent location on a peninsula into the water on the outskirts of Old San Juan. You are only about a 10 minute ride from the cruise ships and Old San Juan. If you are looking for a lot of nightlife and shopping outside your door this is not the place for you. The nicest part of the hotel is the beach and pool area. The beach is on its own cove, not much in the way of waves, but otherwise very nice. It has a great pool area and a nice area with hammocks and palm trees for shade. We are members of the Hilton Honors and were put on the club floor. The club floors have the use of a very nice lounge with free snacks drinks, newspapers and computer. For $115 per night this was a great deal. We were originally booked at the Marriott for the stay on the return from the cruise, but at $350 a night for the Marriott and $155 for the Hilton it was a no brainer. If you are going to pay $350 a night I would consider the El San Juan or the Marriott, but with the discount rates on the Hilton it is well worth it. My only complaint was that it does not have a casino, so you need to get a cab to go to a casino or to go to other restaurants. We ate at the Morton's on a great web promotion, 2 excellent meals for $99, but the other hotel restaurants looked very overpriced. They do have a Starbucks in the lobby.
