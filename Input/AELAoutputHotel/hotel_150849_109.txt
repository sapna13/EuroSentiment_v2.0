{"text":"Pleasant Stay Stayed here with a male friend during March of 2007, as he won the holiday and I had never stayed in an All Inclusive resort before. I found it a real eye-opener. The food was varied, pleasant enough for those who don't mind trying new things, but for those who don't there is a fairly broad selection of plain favourites. I was also very surprised that they had Heinz tomato ketchup available!!The rooms were great, although the balconies were on top of each other, so the sun was only on them for a few hours a day, which was fine because the pool area was better for sunbathing. I am a sun worshiper, so I found that there was rather too much shade for my liking and if I didn't get the spot I wanted, I found myself having to continually drag my lounger further to avoid it! Not a problem though, I'm not really one to complain. Having said that, the towels were as hard as sheets of sandpaper and seemed to attract water and stay sopping wet!! :o( I would recommend bringing your own.The beds, as someone else has mentioned, were hard also, but I didn't mind and they say that they're two singles pushed together, but in the UK, singles are a damn sight smaller, so I wasn't complaining... plenty of room to roll over... and away from someone - haha!The drinks were all bottom shelf and I gathered that even when you asked for better quality brands (Smirnoff etc), it was still the lower brands. The beer was nice though, although the fridges in the rooms needed frequent refreshing and most of the time you had to grab someone to do it., which wasn't too much of a problem.Trips: Well, there were a few of the normal variety that you would expect from a Carribean holiday, but we didn't go on them due to the price. I was perfectly happy to stay in the hotel and I have to say that as far as the local area is concerned, don't even go there! I was very shocked at how poor it looks and dangerous. Stay in the hotel complex. It's miles from anywhere though, so that's not really a problem.The beach is beautiful! Good for a nice long walk, very relaxing and serene!
