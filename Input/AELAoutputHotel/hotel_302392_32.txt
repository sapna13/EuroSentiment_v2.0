{"text":"Perfect place for Honeymooners We stayed at the Oberoi for two weeks in October, as our Honeymoon, and enjoyed every minute of it. It really is a fantastic Hotel, who did everything they could to make it perfect for us.The hotel staff were friendly, and most helpful, but never over the top, they simply couldn't do enough for you, if you wanted anything from fresh milk, water, drinks, food all you do is call reception and there would be someone at the door within minutes with whatever you requested! The location was perfect to go into town using the free transport, but far enough away from the hustle and bustle of seminyak, the beaches were amazing, food excellent with some of the finest restaurants you could hope for. We ate at loads of places upon recommendation from the hotel and guests and ate like kings every night - most places gave us free drinks, or a cake dues to being newlyweds, the hotel left gifts in our room every night for the 1st 6 nights such as a cake, teddy, rose petals, and they even gave us a free meal at the restaurant in the hotel. our air con packed in twice - so on the last night they moved us to one of the best lanai's in the hotel!!... that really was a nice touch - fantastic room!... the gym was well equiped, and the massage there was out of this world. I cant recommend this hotel highly enough. we ate at the hotel a lot for lunch, and drank a LOT!.. but the bill at the end was surprisingly small for the drinks and food!... only shame was in the 2nd week a few families arrived with children, who then make loads of noise in and around the pool which was a shame, it was obviously aimed at newlyweds so would have been nice if the kids were there causing havoc!a tour up to the volcano is highly recommended!
