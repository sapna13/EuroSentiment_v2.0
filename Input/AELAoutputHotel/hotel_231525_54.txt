{"text":"Awesome Little Hotel in the center of everything First of all thanks to all the people that takes their time to write these reviews. It was very helpfull to read what other people has to say about the places they stay. Everything everrybody says about this hotel is true. I was very happy to haved read these reviews here and found out that I made the right choice. The hotel is like a Boutique Hotel, Rooms are spacious, very high cellings, nice closets, good air conditiong units and they are clean. The staff is very friendly and willing to help you with anything. The rooms have balconies so you can go out and watch the crowd pass by. I didnt see any other hotels in the area. The area is mostly pedestrian. If you travel by car you will need a special permit to go thru that street and there is no parking spot there. So you will have to leave your car about 200 meters from the hotel. By 11:00 pm the crowd is gone so you will have no problems with the noise. Women beware of the blower. If you have long hair or like to blow dry your hair, take your own blower. The blowers are 60's type, a case with a long rubber tube and no much heat or air. The rooms have Wi-Fi high speed internet and free use of a computer in the lobby. They provide bottled water on the lobby and also fresh fruits for free. They will receive you with a glass of Cava, a very apreciated gift after ours of long travelling. Breakfast looked great but I didnt had any. There is a Croisanterie in front of the hotel that have all kind of freshly baked pastries and the coffee is the best. When I go back to Barcelona I will stay at the Raco del Pi for shure and hope you do to. I can highly recomend it!
