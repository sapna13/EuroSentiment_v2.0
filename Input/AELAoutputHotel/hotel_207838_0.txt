{"text":"Refreshingly modern, spacious, bright, and sufficiently away from the crowds The Pullman Paris Bercy is a modern, smart, and sophisticated offering in this historic but newly-reconstructed part of Paris. Formerly a sea of small wine warehouses (some of which have been converted into stylish restaurants, shops, and other boutiques facing a pedestrian mall), the hotel, just like the area it is in, is modern, bright, and convenient. Though somewhat of a distance from the charming center of Paris, Metro Line 14 whisks passengers there at in only minutes at high speeds in very modern cars. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not sure I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend this hotel for someone√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ first visit to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªomantic Paris, but for the business traveler or savvy repeat visitor to Paris, this is a refreshingly modern (an reasonably priced alternative) to the somewhat worn or overpriced hotels which are found closer to the city center. The lobby is spacious and colorful, the staff are exceedingly friendly and professional, and everything in the room and elsewhere in the hotel was in great working order. Though the room was equipped with large windows, the sound insulation is excellent, and it was a very restful hotel experience. The distance from town can be a bit of a nuisance, but traveling to even the farthest destinations on the Metro (you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l nearly always have to change at least once) doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem too long. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe become a bit bored with √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢he same old Paris,√à√\u2020\u2022?and I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ afford the nearly thousand dollar a night five stars. This hotel offers a wonderful combination of style, graciousness, modernity, and convenience. You won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ walk out to the sounds of accordions or greeted with artists in berets, but if you stay at the Pullman Paris Bercy, you will be surrounded with tasteful appointments, an efficient facility, and an eager-to-please and extremely professional staff.
