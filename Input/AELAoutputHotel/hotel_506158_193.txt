{"text":"Wonderful Hotel in Barcelona My wife and I were in Spain this July for a two week visit, starting and ending in Barcelona, with stops at Valencia, Denia and Granada in between. The Hotel we had first booked in Barcelona, the Hotel Jazz, also a part of the Nunez\/Navarro chain, informed us they were full (due to a cancelled airline flight) when we arrived late on a Monday evening. At first our hearts sank, but they then informed us that they were transferring our reservation, at the same rates, to another hotel in the NN chain in Barcelona, the H1898. What seemed at first might be a disaster turned out to be great good luck: the H1898 hotel is a beautiful property, staffed by professional and considerate hoteliers in the old sense. The building itself is an historic site that has been superbly renovated with furnishings and decor and fitments of high quality. It is warm, welcoming, comfortable everywhere: the rooms, the lobby, the restaurant, the bars.The location couldn't be better: on the Rambla, at the edge of El Raval, and close to everything we wanted to see: the Bari Gotic with the old Cathedral, the Museu Picasso, and its side streets; the El Raval itself with MACBA and CCCB; the Paseo de Graciawith the Fundacio Antoni Tapies and La Perdrera; Parc Montjuic with the Fundacio Joan Miro; and the Sagrada Familia a short subway ride (3 stops) away.The hotel staff were terrific: most had English skills superior to our Spanish skills, and communication was pleasant and easy.At the front desk, at the door, in the bars and the restaurant, all the staff were polite, extremely considerate, and willling to go out of their way to help. Even when busy they were patient and understanding.The H1898 boasts some extras you might not find at other hotels: first, a rooftop terrasse with a pool and a bar, a perfect place to have a late afternoon swim and an evening cava plus a terrific view of the Barcelona skyline and rooftops, down to the Old Port and the harbour; second, a pool\/sauna\/spa complex in a large stone grotto downstairs: magical and relaxing.We liked H1898 so much after our first two nights there at the start of our trip that we cancelled our reservations at the hotel we had booked for our last week in Barcelona and booked into H1898, and had five wonderful days in a charming, lively,dynamic city made better by having H1898 as our base.
