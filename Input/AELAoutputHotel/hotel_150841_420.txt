{"text":"just decent As a 13 year-old going to punta-cana with 4 of my best friends families, i had very high expectations of this trip. a year ago the same 23-person gang went to Punta Cana club and resort, which was great other than the lack of all-inclusive and the fact that the food gave everyone stomach problems. we LOVED last year soo much that we decided to go back to punta cana, to what was supposedly an even better resort. When we first got to the resort, we realized that the place was HUGE. this got annoying because there were no golfcarts for people and you had to walk everywhere. If you read that there are three iberostar resorts in punta cana, it really is one big resort divided into three sections (bavaro,puntacana,dominicana)The accomodations are decent, but if you can, upgrade to a renovated room because the bathrooms are 100% nicer, cleaner, and better.The food is also just ok, but at least it didnt make us sick to our stomach. The japanese restaurant was the best, and the steak-house was also very good, but the buffet was not that great.The night-life is what really killed it for me and my buds. There is soemthing for little little kids, and something for 16 and over(which i will get to later), but if you were stuck in the 10-15 year old range like we were, you really had to improvise. Our parents had a blast every night, thoughThe system at Bavaro is red and orange wristbands, orange for 16+ and red for anything under. The orange wristbands were pretty much only if you wanted to get into the nightclub(which is an airplane styled club that is actually really fun) [and yes i got in], but are obtainable for the younger teens. I got an orange by slipping a 5 to the guy at the counter (hah) but it worked for me and my friends.The beach is great, and the water (ocean) activities are awesome, only the banana boat (look it up if you dont know what it is) is 10 dollars a time, and to do any of the activites, you have to fill out a huge liability form. the snorkeling is also awesome and you dont have to go out very far to see marlins, blue fish, rockfish etc. we also did see some stingrays but they are easily avoidable.OTHER THINGS TO KNOW*alcohol and tobacco are easily obtainable for kids\/teens, wether its down the beach at the sort of flea-market or at the resorts bar where they dont really check for age*the puntacana resort has better stage entertainment so take the five minute walk to their stage*there is so much free stuff at this resort, but dont think that money isnt really needed, since youll probably spend a huge amountoverall this was an okay trip, and we wont be going back, but had a great time. It didnt come close to the fun we had at Punta Cana Club and Resort, but nevertheless it was fun.
