{"text":"Nice hotel, great location Just returned from a week-long New York\/Chicago trip -- I love the Chicago Sofitel, so we thought we'd try the Sofitel in New York. And we weren't disappointed! Same amazingly comfy bed, nice flat-screen TV, and a lovely and very clean bathroom. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The standard rooms are pretty small, but since we were only in the room to sleep, it wasn't a big issue. My only complaint would be the one small window in the room, which barely let in any light -- this was probably because we had a room in the back of the building, with a less-than-desirable view of the alleyway between other buildings. But again, since we were only in the room to sleep, it wasn't a major problem. Valet service is slow, but it does say to call for your car 30 minutes ahead of time on the claim ticket -- and I would definitely recommend calling the full 30 minutes ahead of time, especially if you know you'll be in a hurry (like if you're heading back to the airport). We had to rent a car for a day to drive into New Jersey, but the first few days in the city we didn't need a car at all -- the hotel is in such a great location that walking just about anywhere is the best way to go. Plenty of shops, restaurants, etc. within a few blocks -- Central Park is pretty close, and Grand Central Station is just down the street. We took the subway to Yankee Stadium for a game, which was about a hundred times easier than trying to drive there. And the hotel is a couple blocks away from the craziness of Times Square, so it's in a much quieter location. We really enjoyed the hotel -- I would definitely recommend it!
