{"text":"expected it to be nicer I had to come to Seattle for business and a couple of people had recommended this hotel. I had higher expectations. When I checked in, the front desk woman seemed confused and inexperienced. I asked for any upgrades and she quoted me only one at an extra $260 per night. I laughed. I was on the second floor and I was stunned by the horrible musty smell in the hallways. My room also smelled smoky and musty. Really foul. I went and purchased some incense for my stay. I called down and requested a room change and was told nothing was available. My room had already been pre-paid as I had booked it on-line as a flight-hotel-car package. The room was noisy and cold. Sparsely decorated and furnished which was surprising since they tout themselves as an art hotel. The curtains wouldn't stay closed; I had to use paperclips to hold them together to dark out the room. The hallways are noisy and you hear everyone coming and going.The bath was like a Holiday Inn, the only saving grace the Aveda products. I coudn't get the wireless internet system to work and had to have a cable brought up, which took about 10 minutes. The concierge was extremely helpful and friendly and seemed very knowledgeable. The bed was average for what I am accustomed. I booked a massage in the spa which was pricey, but quite good. There seems to be a period of two hours in the morning between breakfast and lunch 10am to 11:30am when you cannot be served a meal!! ","annotations":[]}
