{"text":"A stressless fun vacationing place. Vancouver Islanders CR We vacationed here from Jan31\/07-Feb14\/07. During our vacation we never really had a complaint about anything. We had absolutely beautiful weather for our whole trip. The rooms are clean and spacious, the food was plentiful, having lots to choose from, and of course the drinks...they are always good. I found that the staff were very professional at all times, providing good service without expecting tips which had really bothered me at other resorts we had been at. They worked very hard and seemed to be always working. On my birthday, they brought me a cake and sang Happy Birthday. Sure there is a communication barrier but you can still converse. We hung out at the Diamond Club pool bar around 3-6pm and seemed to hook up with a lot of Canadians. The beach is magnificent and you can walk for miles. If you want a chair on the beach, go to the left and their are usually some there. To buy your rum and souvenirs, go to the supermarket 2 hours away by walking to your right side. I was a little disappointed with their gym. It was very small for the size of the resort but...who goes on vacation to workout? The walk back and forth is good exercise. The food never made us sick. We tried the Japanese, Mexican, French, Brazillian, BBQ and the Italian for lunch. Great lunches there especially the peppercorn steak. The French was very classy and made the biggest impression on us. Remember that they do serve some of these foods during the buffets as well. Entertainment was above average and they weren't pushy but they were fun. They do prepare food on the beach and you have to try it. I just wanted to say we are from Vancouver Island in Canada and met up with coworkers in the second week of our vacation. We are all in the recreation field and this was truly relaxing for my spouse and I. All the people we met from Ontario, Calgary AB, and Winnipeg, if you are ever our way email us and we will show you around. You were all so nice. Dennis and Linda, Roxy and Frank, and Leanne and Jim, whenever you decide to come to Campbell River you have a place to stay. You made our vacation the best ever with laughs, more laughs and good times. Words of Advice: I could have been in a 3 star resort with all of these people and still would have had the best vacation ever. It is what you also put into it. Any comments or questions email me lg3rdcs@hotmail.com. Have fun!!!! I would go back to the Bahia in a minute.
