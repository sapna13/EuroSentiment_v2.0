{"text":"First Class All the Way!!! My husband and I vacationed in Punta Cana @ Iberstar Bavaro from December 8-15. We needed to get away from our jobs, stress, etc.1) Resort: In one word...fabulous! The grounds are beautifully landscaped. The entire resort is kept immaculately clean. The Lobby is very impressive yet welcoming. The entire staff does a tremendous job! This resort is one of three Iberostar resorts on the property. Bavaro guests can use all facilities of the Punta Cana and the Dominicana.2) Suites: The suites are nicely appointed, clean and spacious. There is what I think is satellite t.v., hair dryers, and a fully stocked mini refrigerator. The suites are air conditioned and there is a ceiling fan above the bed. The bath is marble and very nice. 3) Food: Excellent and abundant!!! A magnificant buffet is served for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The Bavaro also has several specialty restaurants. The specialty restaurants are simply some of the best dining in the Carribean. Guests of the Bavaro are able to dine at the other 2 Iberostar resorts. 4) Excursions: We did not do any excursions. The resort was too good to leave.5) Apple Vacations - Out of BWI; you fly USA 3000 charter flight. This was a very good and comfortable experience with in-flight movie, small meal, beverage service and helpful crew. The Apple Rep. onsite @ Bavaro does try to push the excursions, but nonetheless was very helpful and friendly. 6) Hotel Staff: EXCELLENT! The dominican people are very warm and friendly, always saying Hola. The entertainment team at this hotel included singers, show performers, and Star Friends and worked tirelessly.7) Pool: Nice and large. Kept very clean. Guests of Bavaro can also use the sister resorts' pools. Always a lot of things going on.8) Beach: The beach was gorgeous and very wide. White sand and Turquoise waters. Sand was very soft and powdery. A LOT of Palapas for shade on the beach. The ocean is clean, and the beach raked almost daily. There was a fair amount of topless women. Having traveled to the Carribean in the past, we were used to this. My husband urged me to try it for years. At 49 years old, I thought I was too old and resisted. But I finally did it and it felt great!!! I had never felt more stimulated and comfortable in my whole life. I would say about 60-70% of women of all shapes, sizes, and ages went topless when I was there . Don't be afraid to try it. You will never see any of them again anyway. And my husband loved it!!I could go on and on. Overall, FIRST CLASS ALL THE WAY!!!
