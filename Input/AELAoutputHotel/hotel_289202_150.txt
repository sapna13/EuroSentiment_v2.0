{"text":"Venice's Best Kept Secret! The Antiche Figure delivers what it promises and more! The plain exterior of this hotel belies what is really inside. We stayed here for 3 nights following a 14-day cruise. We were amongst several other cruising families checking-in on Sunday morning. In spite of the hustle and bustle, we were still warmly greeted and served by cheerful Alessandro and Francesca. Throughout our stay, they were both anxious to assist us and tend to our needs and questions. We had booked a deluxe room and declined an upgrade to a beautiful suite next door, mainly because we wanted the convenience of being close to the breakfast dining area inside the hotel. We had room 112, which faces the Grand Canal. The vaparettos started running about at about 6:30 am but their noise did not really disturb us from sleeping (but, our windows were closed). The hotel does have a modern elevator\/lift and the breakfast at 5 euros per person is one of the best deals in Venice. There is a small bar area adjacent to the lobby where we had coffee\/tea on two occasions. Internet is complimentary in the lobby and it was very fast.We thought that the hotel's location was fine, given it's proximity to the vaporetto stop (across the canal), an easy 5 minute walk across the Scalzi Bridge. There are a number of restaraunts within easy walking distance. Also, we took a free shuttle bus from the cruise terminal to the Piazzale Roma. Plan on about a 10 minute hike from there to the hotel with luggage. We wished that the two bridges between the hotel and the Ple Roma had ramps on them! To get to the airport, use the B2 bus for 6 Euro per person-the ticket office is across the street from the Piazzale at the bus terminal. It was about a 30 minute ride on the bus to the airport. Venice is a wonderful city and our stay at the Antiche Figure was definitely one of the highlights. ","annotations":[]}
