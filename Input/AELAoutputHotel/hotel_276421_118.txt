{"text":"Just great! Hi , We went my husband, my 2 girls 18 and 17 and i on the 30 th of December to the 13th of january. 2007 for 2 great weeks.. It was just superrrrrrr. First of all, i was like you, i read the commentaries, and i was not too anxious to go because there was a lot on negativity about this hotel. But, it was all the opposite. We really enjoyed our stay.We were at the ifa village. room 3114 garden view, superb. a lot of palmtrees Maybe the bath needed to be repeint, but it didn 't matter because we were not there very often.The food was great, We ate at the two buffets and to 3 three restaurants and the food was very good. We didn't get sick.A lot of French ,Germain and Canadians like us.. A lot of family. My two girls really enjoyed and will go back some day.The beach, oufffffffff so beautiful. I think it is the best one of all the hotels around and it's near everything. No problem with chairs and towels.The personnal was great. specially the bar tenders who were always smiling and laughing. We did two excursions, Jeep Country Adventure, very very nice, we learned a lot about the country and Saona Island, oufffffff very beautiful.We were with Sunwing airline and nothing went wrong.We were on time.I would recommend this hotel to anyone. If you really want a tipic Dominican not a Colonial one and where everyone talks to everybody. Don't hesitate to choose this hotel. A very good quality price. I would certainly go back ..............
