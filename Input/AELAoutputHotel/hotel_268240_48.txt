{"text":"Great Stay at Club Quarters I spent three nights over a weekend at the Club Quarters San Francisco and had a great experience. The room was clean, comfortable, and very nicely furnished. The property is a bit different from other hotels. The hotel isn't set up for every feature to be a profit center and there are good deal more self-service options than you would find at a comparable property. The room was not the most generously sized, and might have been an issue if I were on a business trip where I was doing a great deal of work in my room. For my purposes, however, (a place to sleep and relax) it worked very well. There was a bit of a noise issue as others have mentioned, but nothing that interrupted my sleep at all. Also, the bathroom only has a stall shower, not a bathtub, so if that's an issue this may not be the place for you.The room had a good desk with plenty of available light, outlets available at the work station, and two phones in the room, one of which was cordless. Each room has its own direct-dial phone number, which is a nice feature.Vending and the ice machine are located on the lower level along with the fitness center (treadmill, stationary bike, and a rack of dumbells) and complimentary guest laundry facility. The ground floor features three computers with high speed internet access, a complimentary guest print me printing station, a nice guest lounge and the check-in desk. Each floor has a water dispenser with empty bottles for complimentary chilled water. Most of the stuff one would expect to pay for at this level of property (internet, laundry, printing, etc.) is provided at no charge, but the trade-off is the self-service nature of much of the facility, including self-service check-in and check-out. That being said, any time I had a question the folks at the front desk were great and very helpful! The location is accessible to many of the tourist areas on foot or via a short cab ride. It's also within blocks of a BART station for service to SFO or OAK airports. If you're on an expense account and looking for all of the 4-star bells and whistles this might not be the best option, but if you're looking for good quality accommodations, great service, and if you're a bit flexible, this is a great place to stay! I plan to stay here again when I return to the City.
