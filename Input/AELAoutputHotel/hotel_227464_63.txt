{"text":"A Great Little Hotel I have been meaning to write this review for awhile and am just now getting around to it. I stayed at the Best Western Regina for two nights prior to a transatlantic cruise. It was my second choice and I have never been so pleased.  The hotel sits on a street not far from Las Ramblas in an old building that has been redecorated in modern European style. My room, while not large was attractively decorated and had french doors leading to a Juliet balcony overlooking the street. As far as I was concerned this was worth the cost of admission. The bed was comfortable and in a alcove and out of the way. There were great Bath amenities and the Bathroom was good sized and well appointed. I still don't get the glass half door thing on the tub, but there you go. There is a great bar although one night it was full of unpleasant americans (and I am an American) and a decent restaurant in the sister hotel next door. I had breakfast that came with the meal and the breakfast was excellent and the room attractive The location is great near the main plaza, Las Ramblas and El Corte Angles (great department store) is nearby. There is a tourist bus stop across the way. I found it conveniant to walk to many things. A few caveats (which would not keep me from going back) Several times early in the AM someone would rattle the room door And the staff while friendly and efficient was unable to cash a travellers cheque or convert currency which I found odd. That said this hotel was a find and cost about 140Euros which I felt was a deal ","annotations":[]}
