{"text":"Dec 07 stay in PR i stayed in the San Juan Maarriott resort in Dec 07. I have to say that the hotel itself is great, the staff is very helpful and nice and the property is well kept. On the flipside being our first time in puerto rico ( me  my girlfriend NYC yuppies in mid 20s) there are a couple of things that are were new to me. Anyways, to summarize:The Good:* nice property, friendly staff* located prettly close to old San Juan (12 USD cab ride)The So - So:* the beach is not so nice. very small, has a couple of moldy in construction buildings around* the hotel is located in the Condado area of San Juan which is basically a residential area for rich old people there (hence no bars, etc, etc)What we did not like:* there are basically no restaurants \/ bars \/ terraces in the area that one can go to and have a well priced meal and hang out with a good crowd* the hotel has 3 restaurants - 2 are good but quite expensive. the third is bad (how can you mess up a burger and still charge 14 bucks for it???)* there is no miami type beach area (beach is very small with some residential buildings next to it)* if you are in your 20s or 30s and wanna have fun this is not a place for you (no bars - the hotel has one but it's only a 50 and above crowd there....)* it is very pricey there....if you think you are in the cheap part of the carribean....think again...hope this helps for any future takers. as a general comment on puerto rico that has nothing to do with marriott me  my girfriend were quite surprised that everybody seemed to have an attitude there - what i mean by that is the you need to be thankful that i do this for you although this is my job attitude (again the Marriott staff was very nice and no complaints there) but this is quite different from the other experiences we had in Mexico or Dominican Republic for example.
