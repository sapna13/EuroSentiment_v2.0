{"text":"Nice Hotel I've stayed at this hotel, or the Victoria on and off over the past 10 years. Since the renovations were finished its been a lot better but also more expensive. Doing business in the Netherlands is more often than not done by train and the Palace is just a two minute hop from the station for those early morning trains. The rooms are a decent size and are clean.Beware the mini bar: If you take something out of the shelf you're automatically charged whether you put it back or not!Wireless broadband is good throughout the hotel but at 24 euros for 24 hours, is pretty expensive. To be fair that rip off is repeated in hotels everywhere. For business, the hotel is decent mainly because the location is convenient and the rooms hold no surprises. The price is creeping up however.One interesting tip: Around the corner is a really interesting dutch bar:The place is called Cafe Int Aepjen....Guidebooks describe the place like this: One of the oldest bars in Amsterdam, housed in the only remaining 15th-century home, heavily decorated with old toys and advertising materials. The name means 'In the Monkey', which refers to the time this was a sailors lodging house. When someone couldn't pay his bill he supposedly brought back a monkey on the next trip. What the above doesn't mention is that there is a dutch saying which translates roughly to mean you've been at the monkey's denoting bad luck. The monkeys left as payment had fleas...so tenants at the house were always scratching....Also this was a place that press gangs looking for sailors would turn up and shanghai drunken revellers who would wake up the next day on a ship heading to the Dutch East Indies......Its worth a look. Its the first bar on the left if you exit the hotel from the front and hang a left at the corner. Less than 10 meters away! Warning:The old guy behind the bar can be a bit grumpy. I watched his reaction when asked by a middle aged American woman if she could have a cafe latte.......
