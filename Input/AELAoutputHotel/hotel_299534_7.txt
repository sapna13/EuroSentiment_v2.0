{"text":"Good value Hong Kong Base Stayed for 6 nights late October - after reading other reviews went for the Jen room ... The prices seemed to fluctuate all over the place on a few websites but eventually got it for about $160 AUD a night ..The other reviews are pretty accurate ....... Room - yes the Jen rooms with a view are modern , nice , pretty small but by Hong Kong standards pretty good .. hard beds like most of ChinaCheck In - we had no problems - did hear other guests having issues but nothing out of the ordinary for HKPackage - Jen Rooms come with newer room - views dependant - we did the harbour view - breakfast - western and served in the 28th floor skylounge , WIFI (I heard it was expensive to buy seperately) , Drinks at Night (6-8 happy hour \/ open bar) Location - stayed there knowing it is not close to MTR - but for the price you can taxi it for about $30HK to a MTR or co-ordinate with the free shuttle bus which was quick and always on time to drop you off at 3 local stations .. We walked a bit and did the tram but it is slow around peak times .. Welcomme mart down the road was handy for essentials shooping (Beer) and food . Right next door to a great bakery and local food hall - go check it out its amazing what is on offer (sometimes not for the squemish ) Very close to HK Macau Terminal - a good place to base from if you are going there (We flew Viva Macau from Sydney so it was a good place to come to \/ leave from)Pool - nice after a hard days shopping - a spa would have been nicer but hey its a small hotel Laundry - the hotel as per usaul was fairly expensive ... try using the local laundrys around the hotel (one across the road and one towards Kennedy and around the corner .. ) you can get 8lb of laundry done SAME DAY or pickup next morning for HK$24 ... how nice was it to get home with no laundry to be done - all nicely washed and pressed ..28th Floor lounge - only available with Jen Rooms and it was great 6-8 Happy\/Open bar ,,, we got our money worth - quiet with a nice view of the lower harbour and macau ferries . Nice ambience and well worth the extra $$Food - we did not have dinner there - too many other places out and about - one night we got a roast duck from one of the stores across the road for $58HK and scoffed it with a few beers while looking at the harbour)Staff - contrary to other reviews we had no problems ... having been to HK three times now you learn to lower your expectations and expect some hiccups - if you want the Peninsula - pay the $$ and stay there but I reckon you get the same room mixups :)Overall it was a great place to stay for an extended trip - I wouldn't venture there for one night from the airport but it was a good base ...One quick Hong Kong Tip - in Temple st markets at the intersection there is a great restaraunt that has live seafood out front - it is in the middle of temple St .. you won't miss it .. we ate there 3 times and the food was the best we had eaten - it was cheap , real HK market food and plenty of locals were there too - we got great service friendly welcome back - we had razor clams , clams and mantis shrimp - all just wonderful and good to perfection within a few minutes - it does get crowded but for a reason the food is the best ..Happy to answer any queries about HK or Macau from an Aussie persepctive - drop me a line anytime [--] ","annotations":[{"endOffset":334,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":330},{"endOffset":1804,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1800},{"endOffset":2017,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2013},{"endOffset":2068,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2064},{"endOffset":2500,"mention":"Peninsula","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Peninsula_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":2491},{"endOffset":2500,"mention":"Peninsula","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Peninsula_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":2491}]}
