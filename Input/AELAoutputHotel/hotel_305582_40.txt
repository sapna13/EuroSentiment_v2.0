{"text":"Faded star needs a face lift My partner and I stayed here in February 07 and were generally satfisfied with the experience but not blown away. We were entirely decadent and went for the Suite Axel. A larger top floor room with two balconies looking out to the main street with excellent city views. Living room with modern decor, milky white wood floors, funky orange retro swivel chairs, chaise lounge and complementary computer with internet, flat screen tv. Pocket doors separate a minimalist bedroom with very comfortable king bed, lush linens. Open concept bathroom with separate spa tub and shower, locker room feeling with custom shelving along an entire wall with excellent storage and areas to hang things. Despite all of this, there was really a lack of (dare I say) drama you would expect with a signature room and particularly a gay-identified hotel. Where's the attention to detail?? The furniture was a worn, wall paper coming off at places, chipped paint on moulding, grout stains in bathroom and stained painted walls. This faded factor was also seen in the lobby with chipped floor tile, worn fabric on furniture, cigarette burns on furniture and generally lacking an ultra hip feeling. On the postive end, excellent location in gayxample with easy and safe walking distance to many hip restaurants and gay bars\/clubs, major destinations. Easy 20 Euro cab ride from the airport. Staff were professional, pleasant and multilingual. The lounge\/restaurant offered excellent martinis with clubby background music and a good breakfast buffet. Very well received drag show Shimai Show at the hotel. Guests were mostly gay varied ages and nationalities. At 279 Euros\/night, would expect more luxurious accomodations. There is heavy competiton in this city for luxury boutique hotels. She needs a face lift to bring back the faded star. Would stay again only for the gay-affirming environment.
