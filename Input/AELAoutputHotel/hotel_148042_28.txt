{"text":"Loved this hotel! Outstanding service! Just got back from a one week stay at this wonderful hotel---two adults and two children, 10 and 16. We booked this trip last minute online, sight unseen. We were thrilled by one of the prettiest hotels on the island with its own white sand beach, well-maintained grounds and a friendly, service -oriented staff team! We were nervous about August weather --- it was warm and lovely. Some clouds at some point each day, but overall typical tropical weather despite the foreboding online weather forecasts predicting rain everyday... did not materialize.We were nervous about this hotel being 5 minutes from the airport---not an issue at all. Never enters your mind once at the hotel. Never heard a plane in the hotel. We could see some take-offs to the right when on the beach. Actually it was convenient for arrival and departure to be so close.We were nervous because there is some renovation at the hotel right now---again, a non-issue. It is secluded and shrouded, presenting no interference whatsoever. The staff of this hotel are outstanding! They are warm and accommodating. The concierge desk (especially Jessica) went out of their way to help us plan excursions (East Wind snorkeling to Icacos, night-time bio-bay kayaking, rainforest tour) as well as dinners in old San Juan (do not miss Baru!). It was like having a best friend on site to take care of you! Also compliments to the Ritz-Kids staff where my 10 year old spent some time (better for her than the rainforest outing)---she loved it!It is very expensive on site, so be prepared. We found a Starbucks down the street at the El San Juan Hotel and brought it back---better than $20\/head for breakfast buffet! One dinner at BLT STeak is worth it, followed by a short walk down the street to PIu Bello for an amazing array of tropical ice creams and more!Don't miss this hotel! ~~ Satisfied San Francisco travelers ","annotations":[{"endOffset":274,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":269},{"endOffset":1732,"mention":"BLT","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BLT"],"startOffset":1729},{"endOffset":1732,"mention":"BLT","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/BLT"],"startOffset":1729}]}
