{"text":"location, location, location only the beginning, beginning, beginning General Manager Wes Tyler recently referred to the Chancellor as a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºimple hotel in a great location.√à√\u2020\u2022?Me thinks Wes is too modest. Certainly the Chancellor enjoys an unbeatable √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Æive Star√à√\u2020\u2022?location on Union Square and the property itself is more of a three star hotel, longer on historic charm (the wide moldings, original bathtubs, wrought iron banisters) than luxury.But simple? There is nothing simple about assembling a staff who take such obvious pride in their work as evidenced by keeping the place spotless and extending themselves beyond the call of duty to provide helpful suggestions about nightlife, restaurants, and transportation. There is nothing simple about the extra touches that make a stay here enjoyable√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√úresh coffee and cookies 24\/7, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°our star√à√\u2020\u2022?sized towels, pillows and linens in a three star hotel, free wifi in the rooms, and in-room umbrellas in case of rain, or the option of a free newspaper In the morning from a menu including the SF Chronicle, USA Today, the Wall Street Journal or the NY Times. There is nothing simple about the manager asking guests their preferences and selecting a room suited to individual tastes. Or about the bowl of hard candy, the welcome bottle of local wine, or the rubber ducky in the bath. These touches require a certain obsession with being the best hotel possible, within the limits of the hotels architecture and age. This commitment to excellence, perhaps commonplace when the Chancellor was built, has become a rarity in our time. The hotel is old but is by no means rundown. The paint our room was fresh and the carpet was new. Furniture has been updated.But it is not the Marriott or Ritz Carlton.As Wes frequently writes...do not stay here if you are looking for a luxury hotel. Rooms here are adequately sized but not spacious. Our room featured a queen bed, writing desk, small end table flank. The walk-in closet was huge. Since we were able to place all of our bags in the closet, we had more useable space in the room itself. Bathrooms are charming but not very large. There is no air conditioning. Do stay here if you are looking for lots of value for not much money...an immaculate room....and welcoming staff....and lots of little touches..... The Chancellor is rated by TA readers as one of the best value hotels around. Given the prices for other hotels in the heart of SF, we wholeheartedly agree. We spent more for dinner for two than for our room! Wes, thanks to you and your staff for helping to make our trip special and for a reminder of the real difference a commitment to excellence can make.
