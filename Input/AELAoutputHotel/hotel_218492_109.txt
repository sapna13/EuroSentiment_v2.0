{"text":"Awesome Getaway! We just returned from our wonderful vacation in the Dominican Republic at the Grand Oasis. We couldn't have asked for a nicer resort to stay at! The staff was very friendly and welcoming. At first we were concerned as it appears everyone speaks in Spanish, which we do not, but after some inquisitive looks we gave them they started speaking to us in English. We booked our trip on CheapCaribbean.com - which I highly recommend. They had great prices, reviews, and took extra care of us the moment we landed at the airport. They told us things to look out for and what to do. The food at Grand Oasis is decent, not excellent, but not terrible. The main restaurant, Windows, has a great buffet that changes every lunch and dinner so you got a good variety. The other restaurants you have to make reservations for or they won't let you in to eat. So be sure to make reservations for all of the restaurants the day you arrive. The fish place was okay, the Italian restuarant was good, and the American Grill was excellent - if you like Tex Mex food.The Grand Oasis had constant entertainment. There was a sheet listed as to the daily activities and they kept you busy all day if you wanted to. With water aerobics (trust me it was a ton of fun) to salsa dancing lessons by the pool side to beach volleyball, you were sure to never be bored. The nightly entertainment was pretty neat as well - a different show everynight. Just be sure to bring bug spray or you will get bit up.Also, bring plenty of sun screen as the sun is extremely hot and the sunscreen in the gift shops will cost you upwards to $25. We sadly had to pay that price. Overall, I highly recommend the Grand Oasis as a great place to stay while in Punta Cana. I wish I was still there!!! ","annotations":[]}
