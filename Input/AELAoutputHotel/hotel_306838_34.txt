{"text":"Only if you really really have to..... We arrived at The Aston from Ubud to be waved through the security barriers without being stopped or checked. We were then at liberty to drag our suitcases up a steep slope to an indiferent staff at reception. Once checked in, we were invited to enjoy a sweet sticky fruit cocktail and refresh ourselves with a cooling flannel, very worn, thin and some shade of grey! Our suite was an odd collection of furniture haphazardly arranged in a dirty room. It looked as if this room had been out of use for some time. Breakfast was served in an overcrowded dining room which smelt less than inviting, and the quality of food did not seem to be particularly good. The beach was also dirty and access to the sea was difficult. Our second day was spent sight-seeing on a fantastic trip to visit the temples. On returning to the hotel in the evening, a large cockroach type of insect was happily making it's way around the bathroom. This was reported to the reception staff who apparently informed house-keeping to deal with it. We went out for dinner and decided that due to the difficulties encountered and the lack of care from the staff we would check out and stay elsewhere. The reception staff seemed at bit surprised at our decision. We had paid for a three night stay and no refund was offered, but we were charged for a twenty minute internet usage. Horrid, horrid, horrid!! ","annotations":[]}
