{"text":"Wonderful Hotel and a great location The Hotel is great, a perfect location centrally located for all areas and attractions. I can see why the other reviews were so complementary, this is the 4th Kimpton Hotel we have stayed in and it was just as good as the others have been.The Hotel is well managed and the staff represent this well. I asked to see the top floor room Cloud 9 which they were happy to do. The staff member who took me up there was extremely helpful and informative and very keen to tell me what a great Hotel this was to work for. This atmosphere comes across.We asked for a high room and were pleased to be on the 17th floor with a great view State House, it was a very quiet room.We had breakfast once, I can highly recommend the pancakes we ate out other times. We tried The Paramount in Charles street, Down the hill (Beacon Street) and on the right. get there early and enjoy the atmosphere, it is not a place for lingering but worth going to. Charles Street has some wonderful older shops to browse in once you have had breakfast. There are a lot of coffee shops around the Hotel but not so many breakfast places, if you want more than bagels and muffins. Not many diners, there is one down the hill at South Street though.Restaurants we enjoyed and were recommended to us by a Bostonian friend were Mooo just around the corner in beacon Street from the Hotel, not cheap but good quality and atmosphere. The hotel bar on the 2nd floor was great, plus the bar food.The Beantown Pub next door is a great place to watch sport and have a beer and bar food and a game of pool. Plus not far to get back to the Hotel!The Daily Catch is a small restaurant that you would pass by without a thought in Hanover Street North End. I was told to go there and did so for a late lunch...wonderful. A handed down family run restaurant with seafood that melts in your mouth. In the evening people queue aroudn the block so my recommendation would be a late lunch after whale watching if you take the 10.30 boat. You have to pay in cash though so beware!Whale watching was fantastic if you want to get out of the City for a few hours. The Boston Harbour Cruise catamaran was fast, clean and has marine biologists on board giving great information and collecting data.. Well worth the trip as was a day trip to Salem if you have time...A CIty trolly tour is a must when you first arrive to get an idea of what is where and some history. I would recomment the Red Sox one as it covers a larger area, it depends how much time you have. You can get on and off the trolly all day, you do not have to stay on for a whole tour.We will definitely stay there again when we are next in Boston ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1081,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1075},{"endOffset":1167,"mention":"bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":1161},{"endOffset":1179,"mention":"muffins","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Muffin"],"startOffset":1172},{"endOffset":2151,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":2145},{"endOffset":2151,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":2145},{"endOffset":2151,"mention":"Boston","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Boston_cream_pie"],"startOffset":2145}]}
