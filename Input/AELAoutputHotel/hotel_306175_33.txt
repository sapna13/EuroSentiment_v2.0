{"text":"Nice room, Spotty service, good food Stayed 8 nights in October 07 at the Hyatt. My room was a grand deluxe twin which had separate living room and bedroom, a large bathroom and a large and very convenient walk in wardrobe. Check in was smooth but it took 40 minutes for my bag to arrive at my room. Room was not equipped with a guest directory but did have high speed (wired) internet. Overall the room was nice and well equipped. The TV failed twice during my stay but was quickly repaired both times. The only major problem with the room was no hot water. At all - for the first 4 days. I complained several times about this but it didn't get fixed by the hotel... it seems that it was only resolved when the rooms above and below me were occupied (I could hear people in them after day 4) and their water usage plus mine must have drawn enough that we eventually got hot water. The other alternative was to leave the shower running for 30+ minutes before getting in... and sometimes that didn't work either.The health club was too hot. Temp in it was kept at 25C-26C and despite discussing this with the staff (who also admitted that they had never worked at any other health club that was this hot) and despite their efforts to resolve, nothing changed through the week. The equipment was relatively new lifefitness elliptical, treadmill and bicycles as well as a full complement of free weights, dumbells and circuit training machines. Most of the cardio equipment was equipped with personal TV's and about 75% of those worked. Food at the Straits Kitchen was excellent. Service there was also very good. The spotty service comment comes from the following - newspaper delivery was sporadic... several days none was provided. Bottled water was only provided to the room occasionally, and turndown service was also provide only about 3 or 4 nights out of 8. One can get better value for money and better service at other hotels in Singapore.
