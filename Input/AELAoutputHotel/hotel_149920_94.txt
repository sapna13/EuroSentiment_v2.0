{"text":"pretty resort\/great location Just returned from San Juan this weekend and had a very pleasant stay at the Marriott. My husband and I traveled with our 2 sons, 8 and 11. We arrived last Sunday, and we were pleasantly surprised by being able to check in early...I thought we'd be wandering around the hotel until around 4 pm, but we were in our room by 12 noon! That was great, as we changed and hit the beach. Yes, the water is ROUGH, but so much fun...my kids had so much fun riding in the waves that my husband and I joined in! It was a blast...I guess it could be dangerous for smaller children. The pool wasThe lobby was nice and there was a lot of activity there every night. It was not crowded when we were there, but I bet it gets very tight, as the tables are cramped together. I went to the casino for just about an hour, it was fine, but small.  We rented a car from Charlie's across the street for 3 days. It was great to be able to go back to Luquillo beach and even drove to Fajardo to Seven Seas beach. Both are gorgeous.! The restaurants in walking distance were all good. We were limited because of our kids, but we enjoyed Miro ( Spanish restaurant right across the street)..also, Piu Bella for breakfast and gelato was great. We liked Cafe de Angel, really good PR food, good prices.. Also, I would recommend Ummo, the argentinian grill down to the left. Had a great dinner there and it's a very stylish place. We went on a snorkeling trip with East Island Cats, recommended by the hotel and had a great trip. We took a van with a group of others to Fajardo to reach the catamaran. On the way there, our van got a flat...(really flat) we had to stop at a gas station...but they sent another van that was already at the marina to pick us up..they got there in 5 minutes, so it wasn't too bad. My kids thought it was quite the adventure. I was worried, but it worked out fine and I would recommend this trip. lots of fun!! I would recommend the Marriott, as a convenient location for walking to restaurants and having the Walgreens down the street. I think I would stay in Fajardo if I returned . it seems all the trips and the beaches are closer there than San Juan.
