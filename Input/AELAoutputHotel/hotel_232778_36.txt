{"text":"Worst Hotel Ever...... I Checked into Hotel thinking that it was really nice considering it was only 2 stars....well was i mistaken.....I Left the room for about 1 hour only to return and find my knapsack was gone....my knapsack carried a laptop, clothing, expensive makeup and sunglassed, cell phone chargers, memory cards for my camera....I felt very violated...This hotel has a policy to leave your ghetto old fashioned key at the front desk when ever your leave your hotel room....well the staff then takes your key and robs your room...this experience totally ruined my vacation and I would never ever go back to Barcelona or this hotel again......I already heard about all the purse snatchings but i never in a million years would think that someone would actually go in my room and rob me and to make matters worse it was an employee of the hotel...They were no help at all and they sat there and smirked the whole time I was crying and upset and trying to get to the bottom of what happened. They called the police and told me the police would not come...then i called the police on my own and they said the hotel staff told them not to come to me..but they made it there about 5 minutes after my phone call...(the police station is a block away from hotel)..If you want to keep your belongings and your rights do not stay at this hotel trust me....You will make a mistake of your life to trust these arogant people...The employees of the hotel were very rude...no help at all when it came to anything...PLUS they have a on site security guard that basically walked away when he heard my bag was gone...and was never seen again that day....what is the point of having security....They twisted the story to the police man....Then i asked them to check the cameras to see who walked out with my bag and the employees of the hotel said they need a permit to check the cameras and the only one who has the permit is the Owner...which the Owner does not live in Barcelona....How convienient is that??
