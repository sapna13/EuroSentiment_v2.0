{"text":"Could Have Been Better My husband and two children (ages 5 10) stayed at this resort in early August. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The resort is very beautiful, but that's it. For that scale of hotel, I really was expecting a lot more. Compared to other hotels of that scale in the Caribbean (Bahamas, Virgin Islands) the resort could have been better.Positives - We loved the Coqui water park. The slides were lots of fun and the infiniti pool was gorgeous. The beach was OK (too many rocks). We were able to use the waverunners without a problem (lot of the summer traffic was gone by August). Horseback riding was available. Wanted to do the rainforest, but didn't have time. Other tourists I spoke with during the trip said they enjoyed the rainforest.Negatives - The resort is isolated. It's hard to get off the property unless you rent a car or are going on an excursion. The hotel is pricey for what you get. Food was expensive for the casual restaurants. $90 for breakfast for two kids and two adults - how much do eggs, milk, bacon and waffles really cost? Carpet was dirty in our hotel room. The housekeeping was subpar. I could tell no one was really cleaning - ring around the tub for days. The toilet area had a constant urine smell I noticed on the first day (never went away). Nightlife, activities and good music were lacking. It's not that difficult to throw a simple pool party every now and then considering the resort has nice pools. The resort should get with it. I would not come back considering I have other places in the Caribbean and Mexico to vacation.
