{"text":"Awesome Beach, Nice Resort, Subpar Food Three of us stayed at IFA Villas Bavaro May 8-15, 2008. We were in our early twenties and booked the trip through a travel agent several months in advance. The resort overall was very well-maintained, most buildings looked new, pools were nice, and a few construction projects were ongoing.Our room was located near the main lobby and main pool area, so the pool and buffet was a short walk from the room. I would suggest asking to stay in this area of the resort, as the villas area is pretty far from the actual beach and the shuttle service to the beach would have to be used. I think if our room had been located elsewhere, we may have left with an unfavorable impression of the resort. The beach was a short walk through the resort, along tiled pathways. The beach was awesome, however, my only complaint would be that the resort is located in a central area that involves a number of water sport activities... so alot of boats are hovering a few yards away from the beach and a small roped off buoyed area is designated as the swimming area for guests. The room was very well kept and clean. However, there is little privacy with the bathroom and shower. The toilet is located behind a thin, almost see-through glass door as soon as you enter the room. The shower has one wall that is made of square bubble glass blocks that are somewhat see-through, if only silhouette. This isn't a huge deal, just a heads up. The only drawback with the room is that the air conditioning is operated by using the room keycard. Only one key is provided per room. When you remove the key and leave the room, the electricity and air conditioning to the room stops. It took several hours for our room to recool after it had been closed most of the day.The biggest complaint of our stay would be the food at the buffet. The food is hardly seasoned, very bland, and has little taste one might expect of certain dishes. We found eating at the pizza bar (which also serves chicken tenders and fries) to be our safeguard. The reservation-based restaurants are nice and serve better food..however..the mexican themed restaurant is basically a glorified buffet. There is a market located near the beach where prices are very negotiable. If they ask 35 dollars for something, chances are..if you stick around long enough and give a counter offer you can leave with the goods for five or ten dollars. However, I would recommend only buying cigars or jewelery, and buy the small souvenirs and paintings at the airport because the prices are the same or less at the airport on your way out.We would go back to this resort for the price we paid. Security was great at the resort. If a basic dominican vacation is what you are looking for, and have a strong stomach that can handle the food... this resort may be for you. **One disclaimer: Americans should know ahead of time that there is an obvious anti-american slant among hotel employees and vendors at the market. Be prepared at the nightly shows for chinese people to be made fun of, and jabs made at americans...of course only in spanish. When we asked a vendor about not liking americans, the issue seemed to be the war in Iraq.
