{"text":"good for the money We stayed on the Luna side of the Luna  Simone from June 23rd through the 26th. Great property for the price. My wife reacted on how clean the place was, despite the small rooms. But hey that's what renting hotel rooms in a big city like London will get you.Property is a 5-10 minute walk to Victoria Station, a large interchange for bus\/train\/underground transfer. Plus, on the way to\/from the station, there's a supermarket if you want to bring food back.Back to the hotel, our room was #15 - all the way on the tippity top floor of the hotel. Just be forewarned that you have quite a few flights of stairs to climb and no elevator. The room had its own bathroom with a shower, a small tv, coffee pot, and a window. the thing that made this room for us was that we were able to climb out the window onto the fire escape and see the London Eye off in the distance.The staff was friendly and able to help us with pretty much anything. A good thing to note is that if you are planning to take any tour buses around the city, this hotel can book them for you and put it on your bill, saving the hassle of converting more cash. They can also arrange taxis to the airport and what-not, but they'll be sure to tell you (as they did for us) that hailing a cab in the street will often be cheaper.Breakfast was good everyday, and there's a little closet with a computer hooked to the web that is open for use. All in all, a good little hotel for the price in London. If given the chance, we'd return (but maybe we'd get some help with our bags to the top floor).
