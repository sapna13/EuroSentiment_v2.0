{"text":"Fantastic Hotel, great service!!!! We booked this hotel after reading reviews on trip advisor and had high hopes and expectations. We were not disappointed!!!!!!!! We received such a warm welcome from everyone as soon as we walked through the door it made us forget the 11 hour flight we had just been on. The staff on reception were friendly and helpful, the discounts for the bar, restaurant and Macy's were a very nice touch, we were also given a travel pass that previous guests had bought but had left with 3 days still left on it, this was a pleasant surprise and saved us some money and helped us find our way around San Francisco. Our room was clean and modern and there was nothing wrong with the colour and carpets as a previous reviewer has stated!!!! Yes the rooms weren't huge but that wasn't a surprise and our room was more than sufficient and who goes away and spends most of their time in their room??????? We couldn't fault the food at breakfast and it was always nice to be greated with a smile and a happy hello. The location was spot on, right in the heart of Union Square and close to transport links to the rest of the city. All of this helped make a great holiday but there was one thing that changed this and made it a fantastic holiday and it was Susan on the Tour Desk!!! We booked trips, the shuttle to the airport and a car through Susan, she was friendly and helpful and I don't think there was a day that we didn't ask her at least one question and she never let us down with the answer, she was there 12 hours a day and she was there all 8 days we were, does she ever have a day off??????Overall the Chancellor Hotel is a great hotel in a great location and would recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!!!!!
