{"text":"Great hotel outside the bustle of the city New York was the last stop of our three city tour. After opting for cheaper accommodations in Boston and Washington, we (two couples, no children) were happy to spend a little bit more money in New York for a comfortable hotel. The Affinia Dumont hotel was lovely and we were very happy with our choice. Our rooms were massive - bigger than some studio flats I've lived in and nicer than some 5 star hotels I've stayed in - with kitchen (oven, microwave, coffee maker, crockery, cuttlery, glasses), bathroom and comfortable chairs to lounge on. The room service food and drink comes from the restaurant\/bar adjacent to the hotel and was reasonably priced.The hotel takes an interest in health and comfort and so offers free lemonade and fresh fruit in reception, and a selection of different pillows are available. There is a spa in the hotel, but with only three nights in New York and so much to do and see, we didn't have time to use it.Although there is no breakfast provided at the hotel, there is a lovely diner round the corner from it on 33rd and Lexington (Murray Hill Diner I think). For those of you who can't eat a big fried breakfast in the morning, try the cinammon toast.Location is usually the most important factor when I select a hotel, but this time I opted for the quality vs cost instead, so the hotel was a little more out of the centre of the city than I'd usually go for. However the area surrounding the hotel was nice and it felt safe to walk around without the hustle and bustle of Times Square and the likes. It is only a few blocks from the Chrysler Building, and a few more blocks again from Grand Central Station and the Empire State Building. Although further than that, you might want to consider a taxi or the underground.Our room was 12 floors up and we could hear still hear the street traffic, although as we were very busy during the days, it didn't keep us awake for long. The other couple on the 17th floor couldn't hear anything.Travel hint - there is only one boat tour company allowed to land on Liberty and Ellis islands and tickets sell out so look to buy in advance before you go to avoid disappointment and print out the internet voucher they send you. You can buy tickets for just transport to the islands, or you can add a monument tour (the base that the Statue of Liberty stands on) and\/or an audio tour. If you opt for both tours, I recommend catching the first boat out in the morning and head straight for the monument tour when you land otherwise you'll spend a long time in queues. The audio tour for Ellis island is handy as it directs you around the building and saves you having to read the masses of information dotted around the place.
