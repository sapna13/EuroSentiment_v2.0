{"text":"Pretty Good My first time in Amsterdam I stayed at this property so I don't have much to reference as far as other hotels in Amsterdam go. In terms of price when compared to other places I looked at, it was a pretty good deal. I felt that the location was pretty good as me and my friends were able to walk to just about everything we wanted to do. The staff are some of the nicest people I've ever dealt with at a hotel, I can't say enough about how welcome they made us feel. On a side note, I left my expensive iPod and Bose headphones in my room and I didn't realize it until after I left the city. I called them and they put the items to the side for me. I was supposed to arrange for a pick-up service to get the items mailed back to me but trying to get all of that arranged was beyond my capabilities at the time so unfortunately those items got left there. I kinda wish they would have just let me send them the money to ship the stuff back to me but alas... I hope they enjoy them!The room I was in was on the top floor and although extremely small (which I hear is the standard in Amsterdam) I thought it was clean and provided everything a twenty-something guy like me would need. The free wireless Internet was a nice bonus. I can't say much about the noise although I had a room that faced the street since I never got to bed until the early morning. Oh, the water pressure in the shower was good and the water was nice and hot. The towels provided are laughingly small but I guess I'm a spoiled American.The breakfast was pretty good. Actually, the best croissants I have *ever* had were there. Go figure, I couldn't find a better one in Paris.The stairs are freaking steep. I mean like almost straight up steep. Me and my friend who got there together laughed our [--] off as soon as we opened the front door to the place because the stairs were so incredible. The front desk guy came down and shlepped our heavy luggage up all of those stairs, totally nice guy, couldn't believe he did it.To sum it up, I'll probably look to go back to this place for my next visit to Amsterdam. The good combination of price, convenience, friendly staff, and decent accommodations is the catch here.BTW, too bad I can't add video to this review. I have excellent footage of the property, rooms and the experience with the stairs!
