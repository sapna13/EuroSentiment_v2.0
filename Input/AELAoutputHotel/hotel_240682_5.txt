{"text":"Good Phoenix Hotel We arrived on Wed October 10th for 3 nights. The Wingate Innis now called the Fairfied Inn. Suites (Marriott), Check In wasfast and efficient and we were assigned room 205. The room was very clean and it included two queen beds  appropriatefurniture. A new twist was the bed spread which was abouttwo and a half feet wide (Indian Design) and it was draped overthe sheets. AC was cold to my wife's liking. Free breakfastincluded cereal, quaker oats, juice, bagels, English muffins,waffles,  fruit. Pool was also excellent for relaxation and it hasa small fitness exercise room. Two coin operated washer anddryers (one dollar a load) are located on the third floor. Thissmall hotel is located near the Heard Museum and thePhoenix Theater (complex). We visited the Heard Museum and it is excellent and a true Gem. I took my wife to the Phoenix Theater to see Crazy For You which is a live broadway musical in an intimate showroom (about 500 seats). The show wasvery good entertainment. This hotel is located on North Central Ave and construction was going on to build a light mass transit system. However, it did not interfere with our movement aroundnor did it cause any problem.There was only one problem withparking and it was on Thursday night after the musical showas we arrived to our hotel after 11:00 pm. We could not find a parking space on the property, so I parked in a metered stall adjacent to the hotel and right across IHOP. Since we last ate at about 4:00 PM we decided to eat at IHOP. After dinner I spoke to the manager of IHOP and he indicated that my car was perfectly safe as he himself parks there. In the morning I drove my carback on the property and there were many empty spaces.
