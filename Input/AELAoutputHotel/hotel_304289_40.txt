{"text":"Above average Stayed a week at Hilton Tokyo located in west Shinjuku, Dec 18-26. Rate was decent for a Hilton and used Tripadvisor to advise me when a cheaper rate showed up so that I could rebook the stay.Typical Hilton; everything as expected. Extremely polite service (to be expected), very clean hotel; excellent beds and pillows which is typical of most Hiltons I have stayed in. Probably could use some updating since the hotel, in some parts, looked tired. The price included the buffet breakfast which is excellent - a variety of hot and cold\/continental foods, Japanese breakfast items, fresh fruits, espresso bar, juices, etc. Truly a delight.The hotel was about a 10 minute walk to the Shinjuku subway station (busiest in Tokyo) or one could take a Hilton shuttle bus to the station (free) - trips are very very frequent so you never have to wait long and run till about 10pm every day. The hotel also has direct access to the Toei line which we used to get to Tsukiji Market at 5am. Do not miss the market visit. If you like sushi\/sashimi, then you now will love it. Overall then, the location was good; outside of the hustle and bustle of Shinjuku station and amongst office towers, yet close enough to walk to the main station. Also linked via underground route which can get confusing. Pretty much all the shopping you need to do is around the Shinjuku station although easy enough to take a subway ride to Ginza, Akihabara, Harajuku, Roppongi, etc to see the local sights. Just don't get on the subway at rush hour - they are packed.Did not use the facilities (gym etc). In-room internet is extra but the free internet service was adequate. Concierge was very helpful in locating shops, restaurants and printing maps for you from the local Yahoo\/Google sites. Busy hotel and popular with families.Would stay again. ","annotations":[]}
