{"text":"Perfect for us Never having been to San Francisco, we relied heavily on such reviews as this for guidance. We were very pleased with our choice of the Chancellor. When booking, I inquired about any special rates they were offering, and they generously extended a special winter rate, even though it was due to expire before our arrival. The rooms were very clean and the beds extremely comfortable. The breakfast at the hotel restaurant was exquisite! The location was perfect for getting around easily, and the bell hops were extremely helpful and also very pleasant to talk to and get advice. Our local newspaper had recently listed the Chancellor as a best kept secret in SF and they were right! Even though we were in the front, there was little or no street noise. We checked out on May 13, apparently before the heat wave, so I can't comment on the lack of AC, however, our windows did open a crack, if necessary. The TV was average, no big screen, however, we came here to site see, not watch TV!! I would highly recommend this hotel as extremely comfortable, very clean, chic decor, excellent service, great food, good location. The bar was not large, however, in the evening we always found other travelers from around the globe to visit and share stories with.The little restaurant nextdoor was also excellent, Sears. Right across the street is the Drake, where we walked over and had a drink in the Starlight room overlooking the city and had dinner at the great Italian restaurant in the lobby of the Drake. All in all, a very comfortable and chic boutique hotel.Joe and LisaBirmingham, Michigan ","annotations":[]}
