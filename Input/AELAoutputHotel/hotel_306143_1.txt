{"text":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible During our business stay, we moved to 3 different rooms before finally finding another hotel in Singapore. Our story seems to have been quite common for guests at this hotel. The first room was the size of a tiny box, I think they put everyone there first, just to see who will actually stay . The ceiling in the bathroom fell thru one night when it rained, and the floor was covered with water and some black stuff like mold or something, and the third room smelled so bad that we just gave it up! Some say that patients from the hospital down the street stay there too, and some said the smell was ether, who knows. The management there could care less, their solution to any problem that you had was to simply move you to another empty room. That is if they ever bothered to answer the phone. Normally, you would just have to go to the front desk. One morning, I returned from breakfast to find my door left open by maybe housekeeping, the manager stood there looking at me, trying to understand why that would be upseting to a guest. I actually saw a staff member walking down the hall with a bundle of inscense, probabally trying to hide the smell there. When they saw me, they began to run down the hall, pretty sceary. Then there was the housekeeper that insisted that he remembered me from the time before when I was sick..... And last but not least, dont count on the internet working alot there either.
