{"text":"Definitely a 3.5-4Star Just got back yesterday from a week at the resort. I would have to say it's definitely not a 4.5 star but more of a 3.5-4 Star. The buffet always had a great spread. The other restaurants were not bad. The Steak house I thought was best and yes, it's brazilian style. 6 different kinds of meat with salad bar and side dishes. I had what was called ravioli at the Italian and it was terrible. The cannelloni is good though. Oriental was ok but they were out of items that are listed on the menu so your choices are limited. If you go out late at night, remember the pizza parlor upstairs is open till I beleive 7am for those late night munchies.This time of year, it rains. Be prepared to get poured on every now and then. The rooms have umbreallas in them.The pools are kept clean. Get there early for a seat. The Royal club is currently being renovated. The rooms were kept clean for the most part. One word of warning though, do not leave open food around the room. If you throw something out with food on it (plate etc.) throw it out in the garbage outside. If not, prepare to have ants everywhere within a few hours.The beach is very nice. Not too many vendors hassling you with there special prices!!! Outside of the resort up the street to the entrance of the hotel there is a market as someone else mentioned. Be prepared to be hassled, yes! If your looking for deals on souveneirs (rum, etc.) the best place to buy is the supermarket. The mall (Plaza Bavaro) has inflated prices. The supermarket is located just outside of the resort. Keep walking straight and it's 2 doors down from the Farmacia just after the small bar on the corner.I also agree if you know Spanish you will definitely get better treatment. I too am surprised at how cheap people can be. I only saw one other couple tip the whole time I was there. When people complain about the service, you get what you pay for. If you were working there, would you cater to people that tip first or people that don't??There is a great casino just outside the property as well. It's a $5 cab ride. Gets quite busy at night with tourists. Check it out but bring American dollars, not pesos there.
