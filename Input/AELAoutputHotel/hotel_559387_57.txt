{"text":"Great hotel but sleepless in Barcelona This modern hotel is close to the new Convention Centre and opposite a large shopping and cinema complex. There is a lot of building work in progress so this is definitely an area that is on the up. As has been said before the hotel is only a short stroll from the Metro and the journey to the Ramblas district is only a few stops and this is certainly the easiest way to get around the area.We found that the restaurants outside the shopping centre were disappointing and quite expensive but we did find an excellent place called Man Go which is just a block away from the hotel near the rear of the shopping centre. There is a great selection of meals and tapas at reasonable prices and a good selections of wines. The spinach with honey and raisins was superb and the paella was great value and extremely tasty.As frequent guests at Hiltons we were upgraded to an Executive room on the 23rd floor and we checked in at the Executive Lounge. The room was not particularly big but had everything we needed for a weekend stay. We were provided with complimentary water and some pastries as well as other usual amenities.The Lounge is of a decent size and has a balcony if you want to enjoy the sunshine but the lounge can get very crowded at peak times. At times the staff were rushed off their feet but they were all very friendly and helpful. On our first night the lounge was full of people who had just finished a cruise and it was so crowded that we only stayed for one drink. There is a good selection of food and drinks in the evening although there can be a crush around the food at times. The breakfast selection is good but the hot selection is pretty poor. Biggest complaint is that there is only coffee machine and there can be a long queue at times. A second machine would certainly reduce the waiting time which was sometimes ten minutes.The rooftop pool is a great feature of the hotel and there is plenty of seating as well as a poolside restaurant and bar. The pool was a little chilly but certainly invigorating!On our second night we returned to our room to find a note advising us that a Dance Festival would be in progress from 6PM until 6AM that evening. Despite being on the top floor we had a completely sleepless night and we heard many people complaining about the noise the following morning.On returning home we had already received an email from Guest Relations thanking us for our stay. I replied that the hotel was very good but our relaxing weekend had been ruined by the sleepless Saturday night. I really didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect any response but a couple of days later I received a mail from the GM apologising for our inconvenience and offering us a complimentary weekend so that they could look after us properly! Excellent customer service in these days when customers are largely ignored, so we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be going back in January to give it another try.
