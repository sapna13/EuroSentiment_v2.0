{"text":"wonderful spacious condo Aloha! We just returned from a family destination wedding. My family reserved a 2 bedroom 2 bath unit on the 28th floor with an awesome ocean view in front and Diamond Head view to the side. The location was wonderful...it wasn't the crazy busy shopping area but we were only a couple of blocks east from it. Finding the hotel in our rental car was a little confusing but thank goodness I read the reviews here. The hotel says it's located on Kalakaua Avenue but the car entrance is actually around the corner on the Lili~ street side. You will be greeted by the friendly valet guys (Aloha Eddy!). The lobby is currently undergoing construction so you will check in on the 4th floor. Since 10 of us went, we decided that a condo would be the best choice for us...6 of us stayed here (maximum per hotel policy) and the rest stayed at a less expensive hotel across the street. Whenever we cooked, our other family members hopped on over for the meals and we saved lots of money that way. There is a Food Pantry market a few blocks aways on Kuhio Street which was reasonably priced. Also, there were many ABC (convenience) stores which we loved...they sell ready-made sandwiches, cut-up fruit, souvenirs galore, cosmetics, wines\/liquor, beach accessories etc. Back to the rooms...like the other reviews, it was very spacious...our little ones loved playing hide and seek...there was plenty of closet space and kitchen cabinet space (almost too much space for just 6 visitors). The kitchen and bathrooms did need some updating but they were functional. The hallway bathroom was a bit crampy and dim...but the master bath had a window with a wonderful view of Diamond Head. There was a tv in each room which was nice for the kids, adults and seniors in our party. The balcony was so spacious...don't feed the birds out there...they'll try and come into your room...luckily we shooed one out before it caused chaos inside. I didn't bother with the pool since I read the reviews here but my husband did visit it on the 4th floor and agreed that it was small...but he loved sitting in the jacuzzi. Tourist attractions that we did:Diamond Head (loved it but difficult hike because it gets too hot...cool off with yummy shaved ice at the base)Alamona(?) Falls (loved it...slippery and muddy at times and many mosquitoes...my 3 and 5yr old did it)Polynesian Cultural Center (loved it but Ali Luau package dinner food was blah..also, the show stadium is small so I think any seat is fine...no need to upgrade your seat which they may try to sell you when you first walk in the center)Hanumau Bay (must see breathtaking views... but I thought the beach across from our hotel was actually better (not as pebbly...is that a word?)...food is pretty expensive but their $10 sandwiches and burgers were actually delicious)Aquarium (you can see everything in 30 minutes...I'd skip it and go to Sealife Park...save your $9 per adult)Sealife Park (much better...good for your kids...it's about $25 per adult and about $18 for 5yrs and up)International Market Place (so so...you just see the same souvenir stands over and over...but check it out while you take your stroll down busy Kalakaua Avenue.Also, the destination wedding place at Aquaveil Frais Marina in Kapolei was wonderful...it's a small cozy setting...perfect for party up to 50 people. The ceremony was timed with the sunset in the background. They wedding coordinators did a wonderful job with the reception...pleasantly surprised. Overall, we had an excellent time at Waikiki.
