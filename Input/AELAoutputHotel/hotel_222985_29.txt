{"text":"Worst Hotel EVER!!!! I wouldn't let my dog stay here! The restaurant was closed, due to employee problems for one day. When it did open, the food was burned, has flies and there was no waiters to be found ANYWHERE. After having juice and coffee only, i received no bill and had no waiter, finally went outside to get my car and some lady came running after me and said that I needed to pay. I went back in and had to pay for the entire buffet. $8.95 HORRIBLE!!No internet service for 3 days, I was directed to a 800#, who apologized due to the inability to get through to someone in the hotel who could reset routers for us. And this is no surpise since it was almost impossible for me to talk to any staff in the hotel.Upon requesting to speak to the manager, I was directed to voice mail. Which was promplty ignored and never followed through on.WAIT! IT GETS WORSE!!!!!!!!The bed was 2 box springs, not a box  MATTRESS, (when I complained the security service arrived thinking I had found drugs inside the bed.) - Speaking of beds one floor had loud music, and banging on the walls,at which point I thought it might actually be a pay by the hour hotel. AND THEN, there was the matter of the valet parking, This is a $19 fee to receive parking and valet service. This part was okay, when ther was actually someone around to go get my car. If you are deparate enough to book this hotel, after reading my review, make sure you allow yourself one hour to retrieve your car from valet. Additionally, I got stuck in the elevtor for about 5 minutes one time. Which was no big deal. I was on the fourth floor and figured I would just take the stairs. In the bottom stairwell, There was discarded patio furniture (A LOT OF IT) and I am pretty sure that this is a fire hazard. Overall this hotel was terribly managed, understaffed, the employees were probably underpaid and overworked, communication was minimal at best. I actually felt sorry for the employees who do work here. As for mysle, I will never stay here again.
