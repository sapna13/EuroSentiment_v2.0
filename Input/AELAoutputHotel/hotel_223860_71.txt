{"text":"Wonderful facility and overall experience! We have just returned from a week at the JW Desert Ridge Spa and Resort. The hotel is magnificent! The on-premises lazy river was on par with anything you'd find at a commercial water park (except much better - just a short walk from your hotel room).The service was really good. The only reason I hesitated in a 5-star rating is that we had a few housekeeping issues (conditioner vs. hand lotion). Unfortunately, the cleaning crew put a bottle of hand lotion in the shower and my wife used a glob of it on her hair! We had a few calls with management but they followed up and we resolved the issue amicably. Then, the next day, we had a few more, minor issues with towels, etc.. Again, we spoke with management and resolved the issue. - I'm not usually a nitpicker or complainer, but these little things, when added up, can be quite annoying. Anyway, that's the only reason I held off on the 5-stars. Otherwise, the staff was extremely friendly, pleasant and helpful. I used the Vacation Planner services, ahead of my stay, for booking a Grand Canyon tour with DeTours.Com. Which, by the way, was an awesome experience! Highly recommended! A bit more pricey (for a family of 4) than renting a car and going about it yourself, but, believe me, it's a bit of a haul, and you won't come anywhere close to the entertainment and learning value of going with an experienced guide. In our case, that was Bernie. He was great. We were also convinced to take the Maverick helicopter tour over\/inside the canyon. That was an additional $232 per head and not an expense I had planned - but, again, highly recommended! - Anyway, the free vacation planning service offered by the resort was great! Use it!I also used the matching services of the Tennis Center, to find either other guests or local\/community residents for a game. They found me a great partner from the community. Unfortunately, for me, I had to stop playing after the first set. The Pheonix sun was simply too much to be reckoned with (and this was at 8am)! Though I was keeping hydrated, I felt I was simply overheating. Didn't want to risk having to leave the resort in an ambulance ;-) I think evening play would have been a better choice (or at least doubles, where you don't have to work as hard).As you may have read in other posts, the food was kind of pricey. But, the phrase you get what you pay for does apply. The $12 Cobb salad could easily serve 3-4 people. The $10 Kokopelli Colada was extremely tasty and plentiful. I had breakfast at the Blue Sage restaurant on my first day and took advantage of the $21 buffet. Everything was absolutely delicious! Other days, we simply bought bagels or breakfast pasteries at either Starbucks (on premises) or the little counter outside Blue Sage. That wasn't so bad (pricey). I did not have dinner at any of the hotel restaurants, but, my friend (who was attending a trade show there) did have dinner at Roy's with a client. He absolutely LOVED his dinner there and highly recommends the restaurant.Finally, having read other readers' posts, I went ahead and booked a limo for our trip to\/from the airport. As opposed to using SuperShuttle at $20\/head ($80 in my case for a family of 4), I conducted an Internet search and chose First Class Executive Limo due to their (Barry's) quick and personal response. The experience was excellent! My kids were impressed with the driver holding up our name as we arrived at the airport (which, by the way, was about 90 minutes later than planned). The driver, Mary, was very friendly and patient. The car was a 2007 Town Car - spotlessly clean and absolutely beautiful! Barry kept all my charges on the credit card, including gratuity, and I didn't have to deal with having correct change, etc. It certainly was a first class experience at an almost 20% savings in cost!What can I say. This was, absolutely, the best facility in which I've stayed\/vacationed. I don't normally like to vacation in the same spots (variety is the spice of life) but, believe you me, if I come back to the Phoenix\/Scottsdale\/Sedona area, I would absolutely return to the JW Desert Ridge! If anyone has any questions feel free to write me. Happy trails!
