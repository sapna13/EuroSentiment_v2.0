{"text":"Jazz a favourite We stayed at the Jazz for 5 nights at the end of May, largely based on the reviews on this site.I found most hotels in Barcelona expensive (and unavailable) when I was booking in April, so don't regret the 160 euros excl VAT which we paid. We couldn't get a booking through the hotel website (it showed unavailable) but managed to get a room through Venere.com. The first welcome surprise was that the Airport Bus stops in Plaza Universitat. Very convenient - you simply cross the square to Calle Pelai, walk a few metres, and you're at the hotel.The check in staff were amongst the top three hotels for friendliness and helpfulness in our entire 5 week trip in Spain. They were also very helpful when we wanted to organise a day trip to Montserrat.The Hotel Jazz is a brilliant location. The Metro stop at Universitat makes getting around the city very easy (buying a 10 trip ticket was perfect for 5 days), its a short walk to Las Ramblas or across to Passeig de Gracia. Across the road on Pelai is a great little cafe for breakfast - Viena - and there are lots of bars and restaurants around. The room was large, clean, in a contemporary design - just like the website. We were on the 6th floor and had no problems with noise.There is free internet access in the bar - two PCs there - which was very welcome to holiday makers who had determinedly left their laptops at home, but by this time were going through email withdrawal!Although it was still quite cool in Barcelona, the pool area was busy whenever we checked it out. Kids loved it, and the roof is a nice place to relax after a hard day sightseeing or walking the city.I have no hesitation in recommending the Jazz.
