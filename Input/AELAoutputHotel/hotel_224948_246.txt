{"text":"Service at a whole new level. Absolutely amazing!! We just came back from California(San Francisco\/Wine Country) last night. We stayed at the Omni hotel at the Financial District while in San Francisco and oh my goodness, what great service its staff provides. All I can say is WOW, no other hotel will ever be able to match the quality of service we received at this hotel. From the bellmen to the room attendant, the staff is just amazing. First of all, the hotel is in a great location and it very nice inside as well. Very clean, tastefully decorated, and comfortable (even the sofa bed where my friend slept). The staff goes out of your way to make sure your stay is top-notch. We asked for a humidifier and it was there within minutes. My husband forgot his shaving-cream, he got two complimentary shaving cream packets. My son's crib was in the room when we arrived, and it even included baby lotion and soap for him. But what we were really blown away was with the cookies and milk that were sent to our room every night. Even the maid would leave notes wishing us a great stay. We ate at the hotel restaurant one night, again, excellent. Great service and great food.Honestly, I cannot say enough great things about this hotel. I was concerned that we had already been too spoil and our hotel in Sonoma would not meet our new standards, I was right. The Omni took service to a new level. Also the location was perfect, very close the Union Square and China Town. ","annotations":[]}
