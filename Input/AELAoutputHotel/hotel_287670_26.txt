{"text":"Perfect! An awesome find! Our friends stayed here in 2005 and recommended the hotel to us for our trip - we couldn't have been happier. The rooms were clean and full of nice touches (I loved the bath slippers!) and the hotel provided free water (with or without gas) in the upstairs hall as well as free internet at two computers. It was so nice to be able to quickly research sites around the city or keep in touch with home. We didn't try the hotel restaurant but every night there were lines out the door of folks waiting to be seated. Also, the location is great - close to the Musee Picasso and steps away from the metro. Las Ramblas is within walking distance as is the Cathedral and Placa Reial....and, the only reason I'm not giving this a 5-rating is because some of the rooms are right on the street and it can get a bit noisy at night - it bothered my husband but didn't affect me at all. If that worries you then just ask for a room in the back!Other best bets in Barcelona: We ate at the tapas restaurant a couple of doors down for lunch, Taller de Tapas (tallerdetapas.com\/), which was great! The tapas were reasonably priced and all were delicious. The highlight for dinner was Les Quinze Nits (lesquinzenits.com\/) within walking distance at Placa Reial. Get there at 8 or before to wait in line, and don't be stressed if you get there and the line is really long. The restaurant opens at 8:30 so everyone is seated in order and the restaurant is much bigger than it appears so pretty much every one was seated without a problem. The meals are so reasonably priced it is almost unbelieveable - between the terrace seating and delicious food this might be the best deal in the city.
