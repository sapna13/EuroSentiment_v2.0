{"text":"Another excellent visit to the Conrad This is one of many visits here over the years. The Conrad continues to excel as a business hotel. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know how I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° rank it as a leisure hotel (but only because of cost and distance to an MRT station), but I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ a happy camper to be here again.I was on Club Floor this visit, so I was whisked away from the front desk to check in on 31. While signing papers, another employee came by (it was 9:00p) and said √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬®ou look like you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe had a long day, would you like a glass of Taittinger?√à√\u2020\u2022?Since Mrs. Gardiner would disapprove, I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ propose marriage, but I certainly accepted the champagne.I was (either because of my Hilton status, or because I need to have my company renegotiate our rates) put into a 01\/Centennial suite. Very, very nice end of building suite with full sitting room: desk, couch, comfy chair, MONSTER Sony flatscreen TV. Loads of windows looking over Suntec Conv Centre and Fountain of Wealth (excellent feng shui!). Bed, as always, exceptionally sleepable. Molton Browne toiletries, which beats heck out of Hyatt√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ generics, and on par with Raffles Amrita brand. Room and bathroom sparkled. Please, though, get desk chairs with wheels!Dinner in lobby level generic restaurant. They have an excellent breakfast buffet. I was late for dinner, but had an terrific (as always ) satay set.I asked for pressing of two trousers and two shirts, and they were quickly picked up and agreed for an 8am return. I was hugely embarrassed when housekeeping called 20 minutes later to confirm that (gasp!) one of the cuffs on one of my slacks seemed a bit frayed (note attention to detail: very crisp!). Everything was returned, punctually, without further editorial comment, at 8am the next morning, in time for me to head to the day√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ business. (The frayed cuff was dutifully pressed as well.)Conrad impressed me when my meeting schedule started running long. I had meetings both in the CBD and at Suntec. As things unwound, one of my company√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ assistants called the Conrad to extend my checkout (repeatedly!), and each time she called, they happily agreed√à√\u2020\u2022?all the way to a 3:30p check-out without extra charge! NICE! (I assume they had the availability√à√\u2020\u2022?Then, after a final dash from the office to the Conrad, and a rapidfire packing of suitcase, etc., when I was sitting at the check-out desk on 31, slightly sweaty, the same young lady from the prior evening walked over with a champagne glass and the Taittinger bottle√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢r. Gardiner, will you have a splash before you head to the airport?√à√\u2020\u2022?Yes, I will√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Another excellent stay at one of the top business hotels in Singapore.
