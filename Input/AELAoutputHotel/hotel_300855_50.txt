{"text":"Far too noisy We stayed at The Marina Mandarin for two nights on the way back home from Australia. We were definitely disappointed. The staff on Reception were indifferent, apart from one lady who I dealt with later and who was charming. I explained that our onward flight was to be late in the evening - and was not initially invited to have a later check-out time and make use of the pool facilities (although the pleasant lady I spoke to later informed me that we were welcome to use these facilities). Our room was clean, the bathroom was fine, but at night the room was very noisy - we were in the front of the hotel and the traffic noise from the road 10 storeys below was horrendous, and this was all night - no double glazing at all. Other people complained about the noise from the Atrium - we could hardly hear it for the traffic noise. The bed was extremely hard and the pillows were like sleeping on bricks! Had we been staying longer I would have asked for a different room. Housekeeping and the Concierge were unobtainable on the phone. The Executive Suite was easily accessible, and open 24 hours, but the computers were down when I was there and remained so for the two days we were there - however, I was able to use one of the staff's computer.Breakfast was very good, but the ambience in the Aqua Marina restaurant was nothing to write home about. The pool area was a welcome haven, and the staff there were extremely friendly and helpful - that was the best bit of the hotel in my opinion.The hotel was potentially lovely, what a shame there were so many problems.
