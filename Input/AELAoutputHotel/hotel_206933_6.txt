{"text":"A great place to stay. We booked a 4 night stay in Barcelona at a last minute bargain price. We weren't too sure what the hotel would be like, as is often the case with last minute deals! However we were very happy with what we got!Our first impression as we arrived was of a hotel that was smart clean, and possibly under other circumstances out of our price range (although I can't remember figures now, I am sure the normal rates aren't too bad). As you can imagine we were pleased with our bargain. The rooms were immaculate - our only complaint being that the previous guest had used the mini bar and the half full bottle of gin that they had used was sitting in the fridge when we arrived. Other than that, no complaints whatsoever.We only ate breakfast at the hotel on the first morning, after that it was out and about grabbing food on the go! It was lovely though and perhaps had we not been so keen to take in all the sites we may have had breakfast there more often.There is no pool at the Derby, but you can use the pool across the road at the Grand Derby. It is a very small pool though, and overlooked by apartments on all sides. We only used is once, but this was not really an issue for us as we didn't go to Barcelona to lounge by a pool! All in all a really nice place to stay, the only off putting thing were the random sculptures in the foyer!
