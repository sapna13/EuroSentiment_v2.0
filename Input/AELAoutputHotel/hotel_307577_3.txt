{"text":"Nearly perfect............... Had a wondeful 12 day stay at the Puri Santrian in Oct 08. The hotel has a lovely peaceful atmosphere - the gardens are gorgeous and very well kept.On arrival we were told we were to be upgraded to a bungalow - the rooms are the only thing that lets this hotel down - they are very dark and are in much need of updating - the bathrooms especially.Besides this everything else was perfect - the breakfast has lots of choice and is very nice.There are 2 large pools and plenty of loungers plus lots around the beach - you may have to get up to early to get one though if the hotel is full as we found on our last few days - annoyingly they are reserved and sometimes never used.There is a Spa in the hotel - between 9am and 1pm there is an offer of buy one get one free - the Spa is gorgeous so take advantage of this offer.Some nice places to eat around the hotel - the best being Donalds (there is one on the beach and one on the road) - Trophy Bar is good for drinks - also the Indian next door to Kambali is really good.We went to the Safari Park which was a great day out - we hired a driver from the hotel and he waited for us at the park. It's great value as you get 2 rides around the park - there is a funfair and also a waterpark - you also get to have a photo with a either a lion cub, tiger cub or orangutang.I would highly recomment this hotel and Bali - it's a lovely place.
