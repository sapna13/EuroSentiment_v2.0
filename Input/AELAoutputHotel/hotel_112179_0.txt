{"text":"Nice Hotel, Not Quite Ritz Carlton Standards The RC in PHX is a very nice hotel. The appearance is quite nice (looks like any other high rise hotel) from the outside. The lobby was decorated for Christmas beautifully. My arrival and check in was very good. Front desk was polite and addressed me as Mr... Upon arriving in the room, I found it to be somewhat below typical RC standards. The room was a smaller room (king bed) with a Mountain View (read as view of shopping mall accross the street and driveway into the hotel). The room was very clean, but the bathroom was VERY small, as compared to other RCs. All of the appropriate amenities were there, except shampoo. I had to call to the front desk to get shampoo after I was all ready in the shower and couldn't locate any. They had given be 2 bottles of shower gel, but NO SHAMPOO. I thought that this was really not up to their standards and should have been checked prior to my arrival. During my 4 night stay, we were having lunch one day in a meeting room and asked for some additional Tuna sandwiches. The meeting room attendant left and came back to tell us that there was no more Tuna! These were grilled Tuna steak sandwiches, how could a Ritz Carlton (that has a sushi bar in the main restaurant) run out of Tuna. I proceeded to go downstairs to the restaurant after our meeting and saw pleant of Tuna at the sushi bar. I was quite disappointed by the hotel to tell me that they ran out of Tuna, just because they didn't want to be bothered with making another sandwich. The balance of the stay was good. The club bar is quite nice and the staff is very attentive. There are also excellent restaurants within walking distance (Mortons, Houstons, Capital Grille). While staying there, we did see several celebrities as guests. We saw Charles Barkley in the bar, Marley (of Marley and Me) was a guest (yes the dog), and AC\/DC was staying there as they had a concert during our stay. All in all, this is a very nice hotel. The rooms and bathrooms are small (and in my opinion not quite up to normal RC standards). The service is generally good, but not quite up to the typical RC standard of anything for the guest.  The beds are great (very comfortable) and the meeting rooms were appointed very nicely. I must say that I would stay here again and without much work the hotel could be truly excellent, not just good. I'm just not sure that is what they appear to be after here.
