{"text":"Great hotel, but not for families with small babies. We stayed at Ritz from Jul 01 to Jul 07 of 2008. The purpose of our trip was a destination wedding of a family member. There were 8 kids in our party, one of them belonging to us. Here's a quick summary and some suggestions:1) We stayed at the club level and that saved us LOTS of money. The food at the hotel restaurants is extremely expensive. So are the drinks. A mojito at the lobby bar will cost you $16.00. Food and drinks are free at the club lounge and you can take drinks with you in a plastic cup...so lots of money was saved just by reserving the club level room.2) The food at the lounge was not amazing although they did offer lobster and lamb chops, as well as giant shrimp. The deserts were out of this world. 3) My two-year-old daughter still takes her milk before bed and in the morning. There was absolutely no problem getting her warm and cold milk. Since they do not offer a great kid friendly menue, my daughter had milk more often than at home. Having access to free milk 24\/7 came in handy:)4)There are not too many activities for small children at the hotel. Other than the pool, there is nothing to do with a baby. Since there is no baby pool available, take floaties and other inflatable toys. Towels are always available and we've had no problem finding chairs at the pool (no matter time of day) and at the beach. The cabanas at the beach cost $50.00\/day. However, if you ask one of the beach-employees, you can get a free cabana for your child if you indicate that it's not for you and tip him a few bucks. They will put your stroller in the cabana instead of the beach chairs and you'll have more privacy than under umbrella (which are available upon request).5) Do NOT go on the rain forest tour-for $55.00 you will spend four hours on a bus that will make 3 or 4 20-minute stops. Not worth the time or money. 6) Since the hotel is under construction (they are adding new balconies), make sure to ask for a room away from the noise or else you'll hear very annoying sounds from 9am to 5pm monday through thursday.7) Babysitting services are available for $18.00\/hour for the first child, $3.00 additional for each extra child. If you decide to go with the service, ask for Mariza. She was amazing at taking care and putting to bed two little kids. My daughter had the hardest time adjusting to the hotel and new environment, bed time was a nightmaire.8) Cribs are available upon request. I would suggest getting a crib once you're in your room. This way, the cribs are free instead of paying $30.00\/night.9)The junior suits and the standard rooms are not that different (except for the price). While the junior suit is much larger than the standard room, it still has the same design in mind. Thus, if you have a child, there is nothing to do after the baby is sleeping but read in your bed. Some parents were able to watch TVs in the room at bed time, but because each room has a big flat screen, the light from the tv made it seem like it was daytime and some babies kept waking up. 10) Our main complaints were: no kid-friendly meals, construction noise level, and limited amount of activities for babies\/small children. The rooms are nothing special. If anything, storage space is lacking. 11) You cannot hear airplanes from the room, no matter how much you try. The only time we heard noise from the airports was when we were outside at night. That basically sums up our vacation. This is not the best hotel in the area and is definately not the worst. I would probably NOT return there with my daughter, but would definately return with my husband for a romantic get-away. **Also, several airport tips:1)non-us citizens--only driver's license is necessary. So no need for green cards, visas, passports. 2)parents--we were able to take along milk and water in baby-bottles. Absolutely no problem to bring along snacks for the plane ride.
