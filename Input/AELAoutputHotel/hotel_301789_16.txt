{"text":"A Good Westin Experience Having stayed at the Westin in Yebisu this past May during my first time in Tokyo, I was expecting the typeical goomy hotel room, limited on space and comfort. How wrong I was. Although in the traditional style rather than modern, the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was more than sufficient and the room enormous. With great views towards the gardens and a relatively commanding view of the city, it was all topped off with the great Heavenly bed and very large bathroom.One nice thought here was the toiletry bags with every possible thing in that you could need (apart from hair products and deodorant), so no need to worry about restrictions on carrying liquids on your flight if you are coming to the Westin here. You can also take these home.Arrival was superb and I was upgraded to an executive deal including free internet and free breakfast. Gym facilities were good and the bar in the reception area had a lot of charm compared with most other hotel lobby bars. Room service was great √à√\u2020\u2022?order a beer and they will wheel in an actual bar with beer pump and serve you right there and then. Marvellous!The location of the Westin will not be ideal for everyone but is around 7 minute walk to Yebisu station and is right next to a shopping complex with all the stores you would need for last minute shopping, drugstore items or snacks and food.Not outstanding, but 4 stars for overall high quality and non-fussy delivery of the core Westin product.
