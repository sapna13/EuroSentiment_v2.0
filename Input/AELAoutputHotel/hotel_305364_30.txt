{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised Booked the City Garden while searching the web for a reasonable hotel for our budget. Was pleasantly surprised with City Garden. Check-in was good. Since our arrival coincided with the Trade Fair, we were upgraded to a room in one of their premiere floors. There was the smell of smoke in the corridors though fortunately, this wasn't the case in the room itself. The room had a very modernist feel. The furnitures and decors were obviously newly refurbished. Needless to say, the room and bathroom were both very clean and came with the standard amenities. We also had complimentary internet access in the room which was an added bonus. The hotel also came equipped with a small gym which I used during my stay there. It came with the basic equipments you'd expect to find (i.e. weights, treadmill, bicycle, etc). Location-wise, the hotel is situated near the Fortress Hill station. It may be a bit far-off for those accustomed to staying in Causeway Bay, Tsim Sha Tsui or Central but Fortress Hill is by no means a suburb. It is a busy place, filled with its own array of shops and restaurants. The prices of the goods\/eats here are actually cheaper than in the central districts.The hotel is also accessible to the airport as there is a bus stop situated just a block away. The bus goes all the way to the airport for just HKD40 - 50 if I am not mistaken.Overall, I was very satisfied with the hotel and would consider staying there again. However, I would recommend those booking this hotel to choose a room in their premier floors. I've heard (though I haven't seen) that their standard rooms are a bit old. ","annotations":[]}
