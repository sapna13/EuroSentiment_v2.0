{"text":"Great Location Just came back from a 4 night stay. It was our first time to New York City and we quite enjoyed ourselves.A little bewildering on why this hotel got such high reviews. The location was great and all the staff were supurb but the actual rooms were tiny and not posh like some of the other reviews had stated. It didn't help that we were only on the fourth floor with a view of a brick wall and close enough to the street that we could hear the traffic and horns going all night. Our room was no better than an average Best Western but smaller. Now from what I gather, this is New York so I shouldn't be picky, but for $300+ a night I expected a little more. Again I must tell you that the staff was great and very helpful.As far as location, I don't think you can beat it. Its close enough to the Time Square  Theartre district that you can easily walk the 10 or 12 blocks. Its even closer to the 5th Ave shopping area and just down the street from the Rockefeller Plaza. The subway access is just around the corner so getting anywhere in Manhattan is a breeze. Lots of early morning bagel joints within the area as well as lots of nice restaurants for dinner. You can't go wrong with this location. I just wish the hotel rooms were a little larger.A few tourist pointers. Get a good subway map from the hotel. Get a transit card from the subway entrance and load up $20 each on a card and use it.Skip the Empire State Building, we went at 10 PM and they say its only a 30 minute line up, but thats 30 minutes just to get to where you pay then you line up at the first elevator and then again for the second elevator. All in all, a 90 minute up and down for a 5 minute awe inspiring view with you and 1000 of you closest friends. Do the top of the Rock for the same price and no line ups. Take the subway to the Staten Island Ferry and go on (its free) and get a up close a personal view of the Statue of Liberty...both ways. Its about an hour round trip and everyone gets on the ferry as there are 3 or 4 of them going every 15 - 20 minutes.Buy your Broadway show tickets and the South Street Marina area where they have half off ticket prices but don't expect the block buster shows to be available.All in all, a nice stay, we just expected something with a little more WOW power.
