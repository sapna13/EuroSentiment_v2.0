{"text":"Nice place for airplane noise and slow service I would first like to say that I've stayed in over a dozen Ritz Carltons worldwide as a result of my frequent business travel. I've also stayed at several other fine hotels including the Four Seasons, St. Regis, etc. If you are used to staying in these type of hotels then please read this review VERY carefully.1) The hotel is located smack under the main airport. This means 2 things - noisy airplanes taking off over the beach while you relax and dumping jet fumes all over you it also means that city view rooms are runway view. Even the double pane glass does not drown out the noise completely. 2) While the staff is incredibly friendly, they also act as if they are on vacation. Don't expect to be asked for a drink more than once per hour at the beach and dont expect any sort of real service at the lobby lounge bar. The table next to use had to go flag a waitress after waiting 20 minutes. She said she would be right there. 10 minutes later she still was not there and the couple go up and left. The best service is at the beach side grill, but don't expect too much.3) While you expect to pay a premium for food and ammenities at the Ritz Carlton, this Ritz has taken it to another level. $18 for a Ritz Burger which tasted like a frozen beef patty. $7 for 2 pieces of sushi at the sushi bar. While the sushi was fresh they cut very small pieces that barely covered the rice...COME ON, for $3.50 per piece you could cut some fish!!4) The concierge is not knowlegeable. We asked to book a trip to a neighboring island. It took about 45 minutes for the lady to find out that there were no travel tours because it was off season. We also asked which restaurant would have a sunday brunch. The concierge pointed us to the Ritz Carribean Grill which of course did not have a brunch when we got there.5) We returned to our room the second night and our entire floor including the room smelled like a bathroom. Very gross. Also, the room next to ours had a party going on at midnight which was very loud and the smell of marijuana poured through the door between our room and theirs. When we brought our issues to the attention of the staff they changed our room from a pool\/beach view to a runway\/city view. I asked if this was their normal way of doing business - to downgrade their disatissfied customers. I was simply told that they were sold out, which I did not believe judging by the number of hotel room lights that were on at night.6) The casino is very stingy. Our friend was playing $25 chips on blackjack for almost 2 hours and she never got offered a drink once. When I tried to flag down a waitress she pretended not to see. 7) One day there was a parade outside the Ritz (a city organized event). About 2\/3 of the hotel staff decided they were going to go watch.....I'm not sure who was on vacation, the guests or the staff?Conclusions - if you are used to staying at 5 star hotels then stay away from the Ritz. If you are not but want a true 5 star hotel experience then also stay away from the Ritz. All the marble and friendly staff in the world cannot make up for their disorganized and poorly run hotelMy recommendations - If you want to be near the airport, we looked at the Hotel San Juan, this hotel was much nicer and much more classy. The pool was very impressive and the beach does not face the runway.If you want to stay somewhere nice for vacation in puerto rico, and don't care about the airport being near you - stick with the Westin ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":246,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":234},{"endOffset":1161,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":1154},{"endOffset":2555,"mention":"chips","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":2550}]}
