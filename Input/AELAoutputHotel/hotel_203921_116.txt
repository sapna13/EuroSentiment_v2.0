{"text":"Fabulous Boutique Hotel Stayed in the Hotel David for two nights while on our 3 month around the world odyssey. We weren't disappointed. Decided to stay here after reading TripAdvisor reviews and as time had proved again and again - we were pleased and delighted with our choice - all thanks to the reviews on TripAdvisor. We would describe the hotel as a small 'boutique' hotel with extremely friendly and helpful staff and wonderfully clean bedrooms and bathrooms (and amazingly spacious for european standards). Our room (I can't remember the actual number but it was on the ground floor) had an amazing four poster bed which was ever so comfortable and luscious! The breakfasts were lovely but we can't comment on the 'happy hour' as we were never around at that time to take advantage of it. The walk into the centre of Florence and to the Ponte Vecchio was a nice 20 minute stroll away from the hotel and was always an enjoyable experience, especially so at night when you see all of the lights reflecting off the river. The very helpful and friendly staff were always on hand to assist whenever needed (be that for restaurant recommendations or how to get to such and such). Highly recommend staying at this hotel if you are ever in Florence and highly recommend the use of TripAdvisor when deciding on where to stay wherever in the world you may be. It was indeed the best 'tool' we used when we did our 3 month trip (and the reviews and recommendations were always spot on - I know we wouldn't have had as great a trip as we did if it wasn't for being able to choose such great accommodation).Liz and Ian, Melbourne, Australia.
