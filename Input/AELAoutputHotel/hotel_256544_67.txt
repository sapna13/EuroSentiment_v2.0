{"text":"A great hotel but loosing its shine I generally clock up around 60 hotel nights a year in Sydney and have also provided reviews of the Westin and Shangri La, so now its Four Seasons turn. The FS brand usually markets itself on absolute quality, immaculate service and unforgettable experiences. FS Sydney however excels in some aspects but is definitely hamstrung by the quality of its rooms.Rooms - the rooms are the weakest link to the hotel. They are definitely on the small side, okay they're TINY. The bathroom is also small and is only sectioned off by a sliding door. Not much privacy if you're rooming with someone else. The views are good, but much better from the Shangri La. Decor wise, its definitely time for a re-furb. With the like of Hilton, Westin and Sheraton being newer hotels (or recently re-furbed), FS will continue to struggle. The hotel is due for an 'interior refurb' in 2007 but whether this means new rooms I'm not too sure. Cost of in room use of broadband is definitely on the high side. Service - this is the one area that FS excels at, however after staying at this property over 4 years the level of attentiveness is beginning to loose its shine. Services provided by porters and doormen can be hit and miss. Reception is very good, always welcoming and very efficient. Room service is generally very good. Housekeeping is excellent. Food - I've only ever ordered room service and its been good. Prices however are definitely on the high side, but expected. Not a huge fan of the restaurant ambiance so I've never eaten there. Being so close to the Rocks, much better to talk a walk and eat there instead.Spa\/Health Club. Health Club facilities are good, spa treatments are done in very relaxing surroundings but once again, prices reflect accordingly.Overall, staying at the FS, the service shines through and makes my stays there generally very pleasant and memorable. Travelling alone, I don't mind the small rooms but I can see how it can be a problem when 2 or more are travelling. Is the FS Sydney same as other FS's around the world, probably not. Can you get a room with a better view, definitely yes, but does any other hotel offer the same level of service, probably not. This hotel still remains one of my favourite hotels in Sydney. If there were the option to give 4.5 stars I would, but this case its only a 4.
