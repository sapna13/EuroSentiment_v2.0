{"text":"Lovers Paradise We stayed 1st to 8th October 2007 and had a wonderful time. WEATHER: Mixed, sunny early and late hours but rain (sometimes very heavy) during daytimes. It was cloudy but still very hot and we still got sunburned! The clouds suited us as we are fair skinned so this was a godsend. There is little shelter on the beach or around the pool areas.HOTEL: On arrival we were faced with building\/refurbishment work on the village side of the complex.However, this did not in any way spoil our stay there, there was no machinary noise and the area was fenced off.The room was clean and spacious with two double beds and a large balcony. We stopped in the Ocean village part of the complex which nearest the beach, this was a big plus. The only downside was the shower which needs upgrading.Throuhout the grounds of the hotel there are motorised buggies that ferry you around the complex. The swimming pools are clean and relaxing. One has a bar serving cocktails etc all day. One pool was closed due to the refurbishment. However, when this is complete it will be fantastic.FOOD: Was always good with plenty of choice for young and old.You must try the 3 a la carte restaurants which offer a special service especially suitable for couples (not kids).STAFF: They were very friendly, courtious and attentive. Never an empty glass or dirty plate in sight and couldnt do enough for you.TIPS: Hotel policy at this all inclusive hotel is not to tip but the service was so good that we did sneak them a tip.BEACH: White sandy beach with clear blue sea with safe swimming zones and water sports.OVERALL: We had a great time and would suggest this is a holiday for couples who want a relaxing beach holiday.
