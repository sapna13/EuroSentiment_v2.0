{"text":"Horrible experience in every facet This was both one of the worst and most bizarre hotels I have ever stayed at. The grounds look beautiful on the outside, complete with dozens of renaissance-style statues. But that is where the pleasantness ends. The inside of the hotel is rundown, dirty and lacking in security. Service was terrible. I would not recommend this hotel to my enemy.My wife and I thought we were getting a steal for about $115 a night for a room with a whirlpool. Wow, were we wrong! The room had numerous stains on the ceiling. It smelled very musty and reeked of cleaning chemicals. We opened the window to air it out, which helped, but the bathroom never lost its rank odor. (We prebooked three nights -- big mistake!) Each additional night we stayed there, the more stains I noticed in the room. There was gum stuck on the bed's headboard along with various carvings from prior guests. Basically, the room looked as if it hadn't been maintained at all for at least a year.But the condition of the room was just the beginning of our problems. The hotel is in a very bad part of town and nowhere near any attractions. I found it bizarre that this supposedly high-end hotel was located in such a poor area with no other hotels anywhere nearby. Worst of all, though, is the utter lack of security. We heard loud fights in rooms nearby. One night about 5 or 6 young men who appeared to be gang members sat down in the middle of the hallway near our room and stayed there for several hours, with no appearance by management. Late at night it was the norm to encounter shady characters wandering the hotel hallways. We started propping a chair in front of our door at night. To add to the nightmare, the lock on the room door was faulty and did not always lock when it closed, so when leaving we had to fiddle with it until it locked.Amazingly, even the poor security was not the worst part of our experience! The worst part was the utter lack of cleaning service. No one performed any cleaning whatsoever during our three-day stay. Our second night we had to call the front desk three times just to get some clean towels and sheets. The third night we decided not to even bother. The absolute worst of all was the dingy fitted bedsheet we were forced to use during our stay. It was so worn out that it constantly pulled off the mattress so that I woke up 5 or 6 times every night to the pleasant sensation of bare mattress under my skin (and God only knows what nastiness was on that mattress, given the dinginess of the rest of the room). We ended up using some pins we had brought with us to pin the sheet to the mattress, but even that did not work very well. I have never stayed at a hotel that did not even have a sheet that fit the mattress.Lastly, there was no Internet access in the rooms. To gain access, you had to take your computer down to the lobby, navigating the unsafe hallways with a $2,000 computer in hand.The only positive to our stay was that the whirlpool worked adequately, but we hardly used it because of the revolting condition of the rest of the room. Even the continental breakfast was subpar and poorly stocked. We didn't use the pool, but it looked dirty. We felt fortunate that our car wasn't broken into during our stay.Don't be fooled by pictures of the outside of this hotel. Perhaps in its prime this was a nice place to spend a weekend, but in the present day it is dingy and neglected. Do whatever it takes to stay far, far away from this hotel!
