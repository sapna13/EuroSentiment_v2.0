{"text":"Loved It!!!!! We just got back on July 30th. We had the best time. The kids meet a bunch of other kids and spent most of the week with them. The service is incredible. These people can't do enough for you. The beach was beautiful. We never had a hard time finding a spot under the huts. The water was awesome. We were able to snorkle right off the beach. The best part about the beach was the breeze. You never felt heat. It is so relaxing. I have to say, there were alot of topless sunbathers, but after awhile you really didn't notice or care. The food was pretty good. There is something for everyone. We went to the steak house and the Japanease restaurants. They were very good. The only problem I had was the only place that had A\/C was the a la carte restaurants and in July it's pretty hot. I would suggest that you eat along the edges of the dining hall or by the pool. At least there is alway a breeze. Let's talk about the shows. The one's that the Star player put on were a little cheesy and sexual, but they were ok. The dominican night show and the broadway shows were the best. Very professional done. Our room was very nice but did have the musty smell. I put dryer sheets in all our cloths so that they didn't smell. I think the problem was being resolved, because they were renovating our room right after we left. We had room 2348 and it had the most awesome view. The pool was great but is in desperate need of a new paint job. I hope that's going to be done soon because the rest of the place including the ground is beautiful. ","annotations":[]}
