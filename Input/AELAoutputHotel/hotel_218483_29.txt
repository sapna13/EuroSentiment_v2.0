{"text":"Great for first time I decided now to write this review because I really saw how helpfull they are...We've been to Carabela from 11\/06\/2004- 11\/14\/2004 on an all inclusive plan. The resort was rated 4.5 starz and I think it almost deserve that. They were extending their construction(probably they are done by now). We found a lot of helpfull tips on [----]You have to tip the guy at the front office(reception)-$10 to give you the 'best room ocean view' - we did and we were happy with the roomThe food is ok, you should go to the a la carte restaurants-0 especially El Almirante -very good food and serviceBring a lot of $1 bills - for cleaning lady, for the bar (always tip the same guy - I use to give $1 when I arrived and $1 when I left-usually with something to go...)It's a very nice and quiet place, good for fammilies- they don't have a kids club-just a playground- but sometimes we would let our kids there with one of the security guys- there is a lot of them - that's why the beach is ok, nobody from outside can come on resort grounds--that was the bestWe went shopping around for souvenirs- you have to bargain a lot. We bought a big caracol (the big shell) and some paintings and statues(small) for less than 1\/4 of what they asked. Don't show them big bills- go shopping with $1 and $5 billslearn some spanish- they are friendly when you talk to them --almost nobody understands englishHave fun nomater what!
