{"text":"Excellent Hotel The Charlesmark Hotel is an excellent, small hotel. It only has 33 rooms and it's in a great location in Boston. I do live in the greater Boston area but some friends come up annually for a convention. We found this hotel 3 years ago and it was a great find. Rates are less than the larger hotels in Boston. If you are looking for a pool, health club, though, this is not the place for you. The Charlesmark doesn't have either of these amenities but they do have agreements with a health club in the area for use if you are so inclined. There is free internet in the common area as well as continental breakfast each morning. The breakfast has tea, coffee, hot chocolate, fruit, muffins, bagels, juice. The lower level (basement) has a microwave and ice machine. During the day, the bar isn't open and it becomes a place to sit and read the paper or watch TV. The large common area also has comfortable seating and at night this area doubles as a club. It is up a few stairs and one night there was a private party up there. The steps made it easy for the management to close it off for the private event. Each room has toiletries, iron\/ironing board, hair dryer, CD\/DVD player. Our room for 3 had a double bed and a twin sleep sofa with wall shelves and an armoire with plenty of storage.The only thing the rooms lack is a refrigerator. Bottles of water are placed in the room but it would be nice if they were cold. A small cube fridge in each room would make it perfect. We will definitely stay here again.
