{"text":"Decent hotel with a few bad experiences My husband and I stayed here from October 8th-14th, in a canal room, which I requested ahead of time when I booked through their website. Our room was fairly large and the view of the canal out of the front windows was fantastic. The lobby was beautiful, breakfast was pretty good, and there were lots of nice spots to hang out and have tea or coffee in. The location was terrific, pretty central to things that we wanted to do and only a few blocks away from a train. The staff was perfectly fine, they helped us when we needed help and were always polite.The room did have a few bad points however, and I was fairly disappointed after reading all of the excellent reviews on Trip Advisor. While the room did look fairly nice, the bed was horrible and had both me and my husband tossing and turning. He actually lost a fair amount of sleep one night because he was just so uncomfortable. We got a bit used to it after a couple of nights and to be fair we are a bit pampered by our mattress at home, but this was just awful. I've slept on fold out sofa beds that were more comfortable.Then there was the bathroom. I have stayed in many hotels with teeny bathrooms, that wasn't the problem. The problem was the mildew, stained towels, and bad ventilation. I can honestly say this was the worst hotel bathroom I have ever been in. Just very unpleasant overall. One thing that we did not have a problem with was the squeaky floorboards. The noise from other rooms and floors seemed fairly minimal to me, but we live in a flat that is on the second floor of a three floor hundred year old building with wood flooring on each level, so both floor noise and hearing other people is probably less likely to get to me then other people. Overall a very pretty hotel, and we had a decent stay there, but the bed and bathroom will keep us from returning.
