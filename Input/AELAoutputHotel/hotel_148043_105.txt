{"text":"Old World style, boutique hotel details We stayed at the El Convento for 2 nights and really admired the charm and architecture of the building. The hotel is in an old convent and retains much of its Spanish style architecture. Our room was clean with details that made you feel like you weren't in your typical, everyday room. From the art on the wall (black and white photographs), to the alarm clock\/CD player (Bose), and the brand new flat screen TVs the hotel went that extra step to justify the expensive price. The hotel also hosted a daily wine  cheese bar from 6-7 for all hotel guests free of charge. There was also a full bar based on the honor system for those who wanted more than just wine to drink. It was so nice to finish a day of traveling around Old San Juan with a glass of wine, watching the sun set on the terrace. Speaking of the terrace, the pool is very tiny and is more like a dipping pool. We didn't mind because when we're in cities, we get out and explore. That said, it was still very nice to cool off after a hot day exploring the city. Other than that, the staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Our rooms were always cleaned and the location was fantastic. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go. The only reason I didn't get ive it 5 stars is because it is expensive. I don't stay in a lot of hotels in this price range so I can't compare it with other hotels at this price, but I think that accomodations in Puerto Rico tend to be pretty expensive in general. I did move on to the Westin Rio Mar after staying here and while the grounds of that hotel were nice, I still think it was lacking some of the charming extras that I received at El Convento.
