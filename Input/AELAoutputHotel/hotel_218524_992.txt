{"text":"Paradise at the Excellence We stayed here for our honeymoon from the 9th thru the 16th of July and had a wonderful trip. I also had read the reviews on this site for months beforehand and hoped we made a good choice.We enjoyed everything from the beginning to the end. The service we received was superior. We were not pressured into upgrading our room or the Excellence Club, in fact our room was in building 12 on the main floor and I wasn't too sure about it at first. It turned out to be perfect, it was secluded in the garden and we had wild turkey and peacocks stroll by. The room was always clean and we didn't have any issues at all.We enjoyed the beach daily and would also relax at the pool and the pool bar in the late afternoon. The food was excellent and plentiful. We also enjoyed the shows in the evening and especially enjoyed listening to Domingo playing the sax in the evenings, the night on the beach was unbelievable. We also bought one of his CD's and hope to listen to it and enjoy some wonderful memories.The staff was always happy and ready to serve. We enjoyed Marlin as hostess each time we ate. The people at the bar, Benjamin, Carlos M., Altagracia, Reyna, Rosa, so many to mention..... Yokasta at the grill. The staff that are constantly entertaining everyone and keeping the fun outdoor activities going. Lastly, I want to mention the wonderful people that we met there, Matt  Karen, WV, Jim  Cindy, OR, Tony  Lynn, CT, Paul  Jen, NY, Larry  Barb, FL., Scott  Kendra, GA. There were so many more people that we also spoke with and saw around the resort. We are already planning to come back for our 1 year anniversary!!If you choose to go to the Excellence you will not be disappointed.Scott  MichelleGeorgia ","annotations":[{"endOffset":375,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":371},{"endOffset":375,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":371}]}
