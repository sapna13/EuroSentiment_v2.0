{"text":"Great Place! Just got back from Puerto Rico and the hotel. We had a very pleasant stay at the hotel. The grounds are fabulous. The view from the top level of the hotel looking east out onto the Caribbean Sea is breath taking. On a clear day you can actually see St. Thomas along with the other Puerto Rican Virgin Islands of Viegus, Culebra, and the hotels own Palomino Island. From the western side of the resort you can enjoy the view of the beautiful golf course, and the majestic El Yunque Mountain and the other Caribbean National Rain forest mountain ranges. At first we were disappointed. We were to stay in a partial ocean view room, but we were upgraded to an ocean view room in the Marina section, because of a convention that took all of the double queen beds. The room was clean and neat. The Bellhop Juan was very pleasant and informative. We are from Orlando and have stayed at several Disney resorts. In cleanliness and upkeep of the rooms and hallways and certain minor repairs needed El Conquistador does not compete with Disney. When it comes to layout of the resort and the cliff side setting it beats Disney hands down. Please be sure that you rent a car, unless of course you are loaded. The restaurants are all expensive, but we knew that ahead of time. The four of us had breakfast in Las Brisas Restaurant one morning. Bill including tip was $90.00. We basically ate outside of the hotel. Plenty of Creole and American fast food restaurants. Palomino Island was awesome, beautiful waters and beaches. We plan to stay there again. ","annotations":[]}
