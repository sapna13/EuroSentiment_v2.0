{"text":"Way overpriced, not worth it at all! The grounds and property at the El Conquistador were very impressive. I heard it was formerly some type of university. The absence of a beach concerned me, but the shuttle to the private island worked well, and we really enjoyed our time out there. In many ways I felt like the prices were a rip off. The hotel campus is quite large and remote, and so you have very limited choices when leaving the campus. Since they know you are largely a captive audience, they really stick it too you. Every meal is 5 times what it should be. I bought a hamburger and fries one day for my 4 year old and spent 32 dollars. Its price gouging at its worst. It would be one thing if the food or service was something out of the ordinary, but he food and service is actually sub par. There was a Star Bucks in the middle of the lobby, and the prices there seemed cheap! The rooms are not well insulated for sound, as it was not originally built as a hotel. We had noisy partying drinking neighbors for two nights, so we got no sleep for that time. They kept giving you the heavy sale on bottled water at 8 dollars a glass. I just felt like it was a constant attempt to extract money from us. It really ruined our vacation. The cream of the rip off was the shuttle service from the airport. Most hotels are so glad to have you , they give you free shuttle service to and from the hotel. We were charged 832 dollars for our group of 14 on the day we check out. Nice surprise. It would be one thing if they warned you or mentioned it anywhere, but no, they left he surprise for the last day. The bus that brought us there had a terrible mildew smell inside, and the video system broke down that was to give us orientation to the island, then the transmission went out, and we had to go 1 mile per hour for the last 1\/4 mile. It almost did not make it up the hill to the lobby to unload us. The staff at the hotel was very mediocre. I would never come to this place again, even if it were free. It is a beautiful place with so much potential, but they are so greedy to rip you off, it just ruins the whole vacation.
