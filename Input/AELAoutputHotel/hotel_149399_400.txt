{"text":"Loved it!! Fabulous Vacation!! Loved this resort! My Husband and I just returned yesterday :-) Our 7 night stay from 5\/28- 6\/4 was FABULOUS!!! We did book Royal Servicewhich does seem to be the best option! Depending upon your likes and dislikes of room atmosphere, I would suggest booking Royal Service Master Suite or larger. The Jr Suites appear to be the same type of room as non Royal Service Guests. We booked a Jr Suite (Villa 42) but ended up upgrading for $20 pp\/day to the Master Suite (Villa 50) on the other side of the Royal Service Pool and Gabi Restaurant.After switching to the Master Suite, we were very comfortable and the mini bar was fully stocked (better than the mini fridge we had inthe Jr Suite which was not very cold and not fully stocked) Also the safe in the Jr Suite was not working when we arrived, however, maintenance was there within 15 minutes to fix it. The Master Suite safe worked from the moment we arrived and was in better condition. In my opinon, I would strongly suggest Royal Service Master Suites !!The first two nights as well as our last night we ate the Gabi which was wonderful!! Juan and Bolivar are two of the Servers and they arereally great guys! They made sure we were well taken care of at all times and very friendly and fun to talk to :-) We then tried the Japanese, Chinese, Italian and Mediterranean restaurants. Out of the ones we tried, we ranked the Gabi first, then the Japanese,Mediterranean, Chinese and Italian last. The food overall was excellent!!!! The Royal Servive Pool Snack bar was great too! The Chicken was the BEST!!!The Resort is very large, however, you had a choice to walk or take the carts and\/or train to your destination. We never had any problems with the transportation around this complex. It is a beatiful resort and everyone was very pleasant and very helpful if needed.Our Butler Francisco was great also. He was always asking if we needed a ride or help with anything and even offered to do some of our shopping for us to get us the better prices on the items we wanted :-) The Pools are large and never seemed crowded. The Beach was absolutely amazing!! White sand and the clearest blue water :-) I do not swim myself but did enjoy wading up to my neck in the water, it was so clear and cool that it was the most relaxing feeling I could imagine! The seaweed that others complained about....yes there is seaweed (it is the ocean :-) however, not so much so that it causes a problem :-) The Grounds and the Beaches are very well groomed and maintained!Staying at this resort is what you make of it, it can be very relaxing and very romantic or as active as you like with the numerous excursions offered. We had a WONDERFUL vacation and will go back as soon as we can!!!
