{"text":"Favourite I stayed as a single female traveller from oz in April 2008. It was easily my favourite hotel of my European tour, which included some 5 star hotels. I think some reviewers have missed the point, - of course a 5 star hotel is going to be more plush and include a sense of luxury. However, what really makes this place special is the unique and special atmosphere that is created by the exceptional hospitality from the family that own and run the hotel. Fabrizio and Tommaso are truly wonderful hosts, who exhibit extra special hospitality. I arrived particularly hot and bothered after dragging my luggage (I packed way too much) from the train station and was not in a good mood at all. However, this was instantly remedied with Tommaso's warm and genuine welcome.I was shown my room which was clean, bright and well appointed. The laptop in the room with free internet access was a surprise bonus. Whilst some people have mentioned some noise I found that the hotel was quiet and relaxing. The breakfasts were above average with fresh, tasty choices of breads, cold meats, pastries, fruit, cereals and even chocolate cake!The complementary happy hour held in the lobby of the hotel was a great way to relax after a day of sightseeing and as a single traveller it was most appreciated in order to have conversations with fellow travellers from different parts of the world. Tommaso and Fabrizio provided me with all the information I needed to make sure my time in Florence was special and memorable. The restaurant recommendations were fantastic. I was very dissapointed to be leaving after 3 nights. However, after falling ill in Rome and having to delay my flight back home to Australia for a week as a result, I rushed back to Davanzati to recouperate. By the end of my second stay I truly did feel like part of the family and was genuinely touched by the way I was treated by Fabrizio, Tomasso and the rest of the family. It was an experience I will never forget and can't wait to return one day soon.
