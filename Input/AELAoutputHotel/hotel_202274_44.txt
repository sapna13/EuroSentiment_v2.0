{"text":"Pass if you can Ok, I knew it was going to be expensive. I was thinking it would be ok for one night. I had an early flight and I liked the convenience of the Airport. Unfortunately there are too many other bad things to say about the service, the prices and the value. On the upside, the room and the bath were both very large with nice soaps and body wash, et cetera. There was a great TV and movies in several languages plus internet and of course great airport access. So I was initially pleased with the amenities. Unfortunately, the room had a very bad (stale) smell and the windows would not open. By the way no one else among the staff could smell what I was smelling and they could only offer another room for an even higher price. The concierge was not able to recommend a single cafe or shopping area that would be open on a Sunday afternoon in Frankfurt. The dining room was elegant, but the food was only ok. The salad bar was stale and the service was extremely slow. The staff seemed to be more interested in talking among themselves than serving guests. Overall, the meal was way over priced. So I returned to my smelly room. Room service was ok and my night time snack was good. The walls were so thin I could hear every person that walked near my room. After a bad night's sleep on a king bed, I checked-out and went to the airport where I found over priced food of equal quality for half the cost of the Sheraton. Even if you do have lots of money to throw away and even if it is just for one night, my advice is to take an extra few minutes and find another choice. I think we can expect more from a Sheraton and at these prices I feel certain you will get a lot more elsewhere.
