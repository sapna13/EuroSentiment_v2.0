{"text":"What service, what comfort, what great pricing! We just returned from 8 days at the Emporio Reforma Hotel. Our junior suite was spotless, extremely comfortable (thanks in no small measure to a fantastic king-sized bed) and ready for us when we arrive tired from the airport and Mexico City's famous traffic.  The tiniest detail, that of some cold, over-cooked pasta in their restaurant, was addressed immediately by first the Executive Chef Sr. Pable Hildebrando and later by Ing. H√ã√\u2022√ñctor A. Villa Saenz, General Director of the Mexico City location. We were sent baskets and plates of fresh fruit as a gesture of their sincerity.Special thanks should go to bell-captains Carlos (day) and Arturo (night), who provided service beyond the call of duty. I am somewhat handicapped and my every whim was met. They were my legs whenever I wanted to buy last minute tequila as gifts (there is a very good liquor store a block and a half from the back entrance to the store) and large bottles of water late at night.We had booked three suites for a family wedding and reunion and all were more than satisfactory. My brother-in-law, who does a great deal of business travel each year, commented that this hotel provided all the comfort and services one would find in first-class establishments (for a fraction of the price) around the United States and Europe.Would we return? It's our fifth trip to this property and are looking forward to a return visit next March, 2008.Kudos to all the management and staff of the Emporio Hotel Reforma! √à√∂√úGracias amigos!
