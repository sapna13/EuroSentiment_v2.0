{"text":"Two weeks too long!!!! I have just returned from a two week stay in the Sirenis Suites with my husband, 18 month old daughter and mum and feel quite misled by what this hotel seems to advertise itself as and what it actually is.I, as have many others have stayed in many hotels all over the world and have never felt as let down by the quality of accommodation as i did here.This was the first holiday we have taken our daughter on and so wanted to be quite specific with what we chose - The mini market it has sells only chocolate, crisps, post cards, soap, one size of nappies (we made friends with a lady that had to buy some off another holiday maker as the nappies did not fit her son), no milk (essential for a toddler) the milk in the restaurant was very odd in colour and constantly refused by our daughter, basically this is not a mini market, it just sells odd and ends.The food is good but the evening meal starts at 1900, just when most babies want to be in bed, and due to all the sauces everything was in our toddler didn't want to eat any of it (she is not a fussy eater) - we spoke to English and Canadians couples with children the same age as ours who were experiencing exactly the same problems. So every evening there were grumpy, crying children in the restaurant. The alternative would be to go to the snack bar but this just served chips and burgers swimming in fat.The bedroom in the suite was ok, the living space was small and unwelcoming, the bathroom had light fittings hanging out, visible hair in the plugs and stains along the shower rail, the room had a musty smell probably due to the mould on the settee.The staff in the hotel were nice and excellent with the children but the kids clubs although not attended by our daughter were all spanish or french speaking.The thomas cook rep we had was TERRIBLE, uninformative, unhelpful and totally useless. quote if you need the medical centre i will tell you what to do as and when .....what if as and when is 3am and she is tucked up in bed?????The airport at punta cana is a joke, we were charged for 4 kgs excess baggage although we had no hand luggage, were roughly handled through security (my daughter being lifted out of my arms without my consent) and were very relieved when we were eventually on the plane home.On the positive side, the grounds were amazingly kept and a credit to the place, the beach was nice and the sun shone!!This resort should be 3 star - recommended for children over 5 years. Don't go here with any expectations and you could enjoy it.
