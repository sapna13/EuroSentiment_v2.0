{"text":"Location.. Staff... Service.. Very good I was very happy with the Hilton Berlin. I was there for a quick weekend, one night over Easter. I was upgrade to a Jr. Suite and to the Executive lounge. The room, clean and nice. Not the most modern, but still nice. The room was clean, and had fresh flowers. The bathroom was on the small size but ok. The Ex Lounge, was not that large but did not run in to any problems getting a place to sit. There was free drinks and snacks all day. Free internet on their computer. The Location, this hotel is right above the city center U- Bahn station. Also less then 15 min walk to Check point Charley, and other sights. The Staff, was very helpful.. They made every effort to make my stay very nice.. Check in, I got the the hotel early, and the room was not ready yet., I was given access to the Ex Lounge and had Breakfast (this is before I even got a room) The also held my bags.. Easter, because I was at the Hilton over the Easter holiday the hotel was booked out. I was happy to see that the Easter Bunny made it to my room. I had some Easter candy outside my room. There was 2 bunnies and some egg candy.. It was also nice high end candy. This was a nice touch. Breakfast, was included and I had it in the main restaurant, they also set up a temp. place to eat in one of the event halls, because of the sold out night and it was Easter Sunday. There was a very large spread.. a made to order station.. Some of the items were cold, and the service was not the best. You can tell they called in the backup staff. I think if it was not free (included) I would not have been so happy. Over all, very nice hotel, you can find some deals at this Hotel. The location is the best, and it was a clean, quite and nice hotel..
