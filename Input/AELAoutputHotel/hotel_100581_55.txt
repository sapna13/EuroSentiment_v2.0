{"text":"Worried for nothing When I got home I discovered I had received mail from the University Inn I thought it was just a follow up receipt but I was pleasantly surprised(ok, shocked) that it was a letter from the General Manager thanking me for completing their comment card. I just quickly filled it out and remember leaving it in the room and honestly forgot about it. I pointed out a minor problem in our room on the comment card and I was informed in the letter they had immediately fixed the problem. Other hotels should take notice!!This is my experience-When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff. No attitude what so ever. I witnessed an anxious\/grumpy customer waiting for a cab but the staff remained cool under pressure. I had planned to stay for 3 days but the hotel was booked for a conference. The room was not ready upon arrival so the hotel informed us we could store our bags and we ate lunch at the adjacent restaurant featuring organic food.By the time we finished lunch our room was ready. A big plus for me is that it's a nonsmoking hotel. Our room was on the third floor next to the small elevator\/lift. Very quiet didn't hear any motor. Our room was very clean and had a balcony overlooking the parking lot. The bathroom was clean and modern. No mold no mildew or funny smells. Comfortable bed. I would definitely stay in the same room.The hotel has recently been redecorated and the lobby is very nice.They were installing new carpeting and printed notices for us. We had a minor inconvenience of opening the door to our room for a few minutes when the carpet was being installed on our floor but there was a staff member accompanying the workers the entire time. Even the cleaning staff was friendly and greeted me. One staff member was even concerned that we were leaving early due to the carpet installation we assured them it was only due to no room availibility. We missed the afternoon snacks so we ended up going to the Trader Joe's market 5-10 minutes away by foot located just up the street which is a nice alternative if you can't get to a restaurant. Next morning, I enjoyed the breakfast and made my own waffles. They have breads, boiled eggs, cereal, fruit, milk and juice. It can get a little busy, I took my food up to the room. Coffee and tea is available in the lobby all day even though there are coffee makers in the rooms.Another pleasant surprise for me is a laundry room on the property. It's down the hall from the lobby. There was even detergent for me to use. I was happy to spend the 2.00 for the washer and dryer. There's an ice machine in there too.The next day we checked out and they stored our luggage for us and we caught the shuttle to go down town and you do have to book early although we didn't, we were able to catch the 11:00 am shuttle and it picked us up promptly from our drop off point to shuttle us back to the hotel. As it was stated in the follow up letter the hotel really strives to provide a Home away from Home. I look forward to staying there again.
