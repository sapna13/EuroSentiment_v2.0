{"text":"Great Place...Comfortable Stay I stayed at the Magnolia for 5 nights in August along with three other co-workers for a conference.As soon as you walk into the Magnolia, you're impressed. It has a small boutique type hotel feel, althought it is large with approximately 20 floors. It has a art-deco style decor.The staff was very friendly and accomodating. There is a shuttle service for guests that will drive you within a 3 mile radius of the hotel. It's best to book ahead, as sometimes the service was not available. They could use an extra shuttle. The staff also recommended several restaurants which was very helpful....just ask the front desk staff, they have sample menus.The rooms are cozy with high ceilings and the bed is wonderful with nice sheets. I could at times hear my neighbour flush the toilet, but other than that the hotel was very quiet. The room was very clean.There is a happy hour as previously mentioned, but we found there was a lack of variety when it came to the drinks that were included in the happy hour. There is also milk and cookies at night, which is a nice touch.The location of this hotel is in their business district however there is a homeless shelter nearby and there are alot of street people around the hotel. The security system for the hotel was card only access to avoid non-guests from entering. We did not feel comfortable walking in this area at night, so we often used the shuttle service.Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would stay here again in the future.
