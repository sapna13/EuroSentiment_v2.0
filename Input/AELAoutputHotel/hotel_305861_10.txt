{"text":"Good basic hotel in an excellent location We booked this hotel through Agoda.com and got a non-smoking, Harbour View Room at the 16th floor. We chose this hotel for the location, relatively good reviews and the free shuttle service to and from the HKCEC (we attended a convention) -- the next best thing to a hotel beside the HKCEC.The overall design of the hotel is simple and dated but generally well-maintained.Check-in: No problem here. We were initially informed that there was no room available until after three hours upon our arrival, but somehow we got one after five minutes or so.Room: As the other reviewers before me mentioned, the rooms offer only a partial view of the harbour and more of the tennis courts below. It was not really a big deal for me personally, as I expected it. Anyway, more importantly, the room was immaculately clean. No weird smells or icky carpets. It was a nice, basic room with in-room safe, complimentary coffee\/tea facilities, mini bar and the usual toiletries\/amenities. No bathtub, though, and the wardrobe was a bit small. Still for the price that we paid during the peak season, it was good value for money. I liked that they took the initiative of putting an adapter and an internet cable in one of the drawers. By the way, free broadband internet access in the rooms. WiFi in the 1st and 2nd floors.Location: It's not the most posh place in town but there's a 7-eleven and Wellkome nearby, a few small restaurants, bakeries, a bar, some book shops and it's a 2-minute walk to the Tin Hau MTR Station. The MTR is basically THE mode of transportation that you will need in HK. If you fancy walking around, the hotel is very near Victoria Park, Tin Hau Temple and the library. I love the location! Peaceful, but not isolated. I do think there's also a McDonald's nearby (but why when you're in HK), but haven't had the chance to check it out.Tip: When taking the taxi, make sure to specify Metropark Hotel Causeway Bay (as there is another in Wan Chai), near Tin Hau MTR Station. Better yet, keep your hotel keycard handy and just show it to the driver.Service: Efficient and friendly staff. Our cleaning lady was very friendly and cheerful, always greets us with a smile. I've no complaints. I appreciated the fact that they let me use the computer\/internet near the lobby even after the Business Center closed at 7pm.Food: Didn't try the food at the hotel as the prices are pretty steep. Guests DO get 30% discount off the regular rate (for intercontinental dinner buffet), but as I said before, this is HK. We just buy some pastries and bread at the nearby bakeries\/mini groceries or eat at Cafe de Coral. :) Cheap, good food.Overall: 4 out of 5. No gripes, really. It a good hotel -- great location, simple, clean rooms and good service. Although the prices of the food on the menu are pretty high, there are a lot of cheaper alternatives nearby. It probably just lacks that little extra oomph -- that wow factor -- that would push my rating up a notch.
