{"text":"Casa Camper, Casa by name: home by nature We had been in Barcelona for about a week in an apartment in the El Borne. We had a late flight home and had to be out our apartment by 11 am (the flight was at 9pm) and decided to move to the Casa Camper after seeing it on our way to MACBA.As other reviewers have pointed out (and in some cases seem to have missed the point of) the USP of Casa Camper is its unique room layouts, whereby everyone has what is essentially a suite, a bedroom and separate sitting area. The design takes advantage of this layout whereby the sitting area faces the (noisy) street, and is seperated by a corridor from the bedroom which is well insulated at the rear of the building. Compared to El Borne our night there was serene in its quietness.The functionality of the rooms has been criticised by some of the reviewers but to my mind the hotel bedrooms were well designed and equipped. The beds are huge, the sheets crisp the pillows soft. One of the best I've been in. The toiletries were top notch too. Aircon icy and two tvs one in each room.Staff were super friendly and gave us a late check out till 4 in the afternoon so our last day in Barcelona was releaxed and we had a chance to shower before we caught the plane home. All in all an oasis in the frenticism that is Barcelona.I highly recommend for couples, maybe not for families who may find it a bit sterile. ","annotations":[]}
