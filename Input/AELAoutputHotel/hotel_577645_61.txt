{"text":"In agreement with the other reviewers: an excellent choice We chose this place based on the reviews on this website and on the whole we were not disappointed. We stayed for three nights at 270 Euros a night for a mini-apartment (for a family with teenage daughters). Some of the rooms had views overlooking the front of the hotel or the canal that runs alongside it, but, alas, ours did not. Pluses: (1) Very clean and welcoming, (2) very knowledgeable staff: Donatella , Franca and Guido were able to help us with finding grocery stores and restaurants. Franca was good enough to try and get us tickets to the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠oge√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Palace Secrets Tour√à√\u2020\u2022?but they were fully booked. Consummate hospitality professionals, all three of them. (3) Located 2 minutes from St Mark√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Square, and right close by all the high end shops. (4) They allowed us to check in at 12 noon, but we called them the night before telling them when we would be arriving and they said our room would be ready (what other hotel lets you check in so early?). (5) √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢onour-system√à√\u2020\u2022?library in the lobby, where they have several books about Venice that you can help yourself to, so long as you return it when you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e done.Minuses: (1) our room had no view, I suppose this is luck of the draw depending on what room they give you and what kind of room you book. (2) They add a 50 Euro extra charge to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥pen the kitchen√à√\u2020\u2022? i.e. unlock the cupboard where all the pots, pans, cutlery, etc. The charge, they say, is for the clean up of the kitchen after you leave. At this rate, you would think they could provide a little washing up soap, dishwasher soap, and maybe a little salt\/pepper shaker. But all in all, if you are staying two or more days, having a kitchen is handy for a few meals, and the 50 euros pays for itself on the VERY HIGH cost of meals in Venice (1 lunch for family of 4). (On subject of food preparation, check out the Rialto market (walk back to Rialto bridge, cross over, and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ off to the right, dozens of stalls selling fresh fish every morning, + great fruit and veg, etc.).
