{"text":"First class, with a few glitches Review for Pan Pacific Hotel, Singapore By almost any standard, this is a first rate hotel. It sits in the fast-paced Market Square area of the city and is close to several great shopping mall complexes and the waterfront. It is not in the more crowded and hustling √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëowntown√à√\u2020\u2022?area where many other hotels like Marriott, Hyatt, Four Seasons, Hilton and Goodwood are located. The nearest subway station is a good walk from the underground lobby of the hotel. The four night stay was booked through Bookings.com and prepaid. I had a room on the 30th floor that had no great view, looking out on the fa√ã√©?ade of the Conrad Hotel next door...not the best view and certainly, as it turned out, not the quietest. Before criticizing, I must point out that Singapore, its hotels and its airline in particular, currently seem to be the most hospitable in the world. From the time I boarded SIA flight 0001 in San Francisco, the courtesy, customer service and facilities exceeded anything I have seen elsewhere in many years. I would compare the hospitality and interest in guests√à√\u2020\u2022?and visitors√à√\u2020\u2022?comfort and welfare in Singapore to that of Bermuda in that those people in tourism related businesses seem to understand that service is the key to tourist good will and return business. I must also point out that I picked a very busy and special event week for my visit, even though I did not know this until I got there. It was thus an unhappy turn of events when, on my last night there, the party noise from outside the hotel was such that sleeping in my room was impossible. The volume of what some might call √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øusic√à√\u2020\u2022?and drumming that would overwhelm the most intense Koto Japanese Drum performance was unending, even for me with less than perfect hearing.  The racket started at around 9PM and went on until after two in the morning. Several calls to the front desk yielded apologies but also the response that there was nothing they could do about it. Unable to sleep, I got dressed and went to lobby and the front desk where a serious, but affable night manager told me there was little they could do because the music was not coming from the hotel but from somewhere nearby.  It was, according to him, a party for the drivers of the Formula One competition that was being held in the city that weekend. If in fact the Gran Prix Race car drivers were partying after 2AM on the day they were to take qualifying rounds on the city√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ newly build racecourse, it seemed unlikely that they would be doing much driving that day.  In any case, the manager told me that even the police could not stop it and moved me to another room for the rest of the night. But my sleep cycle was ruined and I left for Hong Kong the next morning, hardly refreshed and having paid over $900 for the noisy room.  Singapore has some of the strongest laws and law enforcement in the world. Penalties for even small infractions are strict and harsh, so it seemed odd that in this climate the city could not deal with such a disturbance. While it can be argued that this was an abnormal situation, I found it unacceptable at any price and the hotel had nearly tripled its usual rates for this event week. I think that when they do this, they owe a great deal more to the paying guest in terms of meeting normal expectations and common needs, such as a quiet night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sleep. My trip had nothing to do with the F1, but everything in the city that week was calibrated towards it, so heaven help the poor soul who, like me, just happened to be there then.  The hotel offered no compensation, only apologies. Not enough for the ruined four day visit and certainly not enough to have me recommend the hotel again.
