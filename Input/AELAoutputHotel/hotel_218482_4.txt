{"text":"great value, relaxing vacation We stayed at the Catalonia the week of Dec. 6-13, 2008. My husband and I traveled with our 8 month old child and parents. We had an excellent time! The resort was well kept, service was great, and food was above average. A great value! We went to the four restaurants. Make your reservations for these restaurants when you arrive. The food was fine\/great at all of them. We enjoyed the Japanese and Italian restaurants best (Mexican, did have great food too, Steak house was our least favorite). The buffets were fine- there is lots of variety at the Gran Caribe- if you can't find something you enjoy- you must be a picky eater. The pool\/beach was very clean and we could always find a seat (however, do get your seats early). The pizza at the pool was very good. We spent everyday of our stay at the beach \/ pool and just relaxed. The rooms were fine. There was a slight problem w\/ getting really hot water but nothing to complain about (you are in the DR). The shower is small, so if you are really overweight you won't like it. It was nice to have a balcony w\/ the room because we spent a couple hours a day with a child napping. I would suggest bringing some 1 dollar bills- the entire staff truly work very hard, long hours and are genuine in having their guests enjoy themselves. Overall- we had a great experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing vacation. It was a great value for the money spent.FYI- traveling w\/ a small child- we did bring all of his food, diapers, etc. and of course used only bottled water.
