{"text":"Great blend of classic and modern My overall impression of the hotel is no doubt influenced a great deal by the room I had during my stay there. I booked what was essentially a standard room for a recent business trip to Berlin but, upon check-in, was upgraded (thanks to Starwood Preferred Guest status) to a 1-bedroom suite, which was one of their themed suites (themed suites are individually appointed and decorated according to who they are named after, such as Bach or Goethe or other historical and artistic notables). The suite was large, wonderfully appointed, had a great deal of character and charm, and was ideally situated (fourth floor, right at the front of the building with a large balcony). Tons of closet space, wood paneling in certain areas, a huge bathroom (with dual sinks, walk-in shower, seperate bathtub, lots of counterspace, and a separate toilet area also with its own sink and a bidet), work desk, sitting area, yet more and more closet space, flatscreen TVs, minibar, and so on. Like the hotel itself, I found the room a great blend of charming and modern. They didn't sacrifice character for their recent renovations, clearly.Service throughout my stay was also very nice. Everyone spoke excellent English - likely better than my own, really - and requests were handled quickly, competently, and with a smile. The location of the hotel couldn't be better, either. It's just a block off of Unter den Linden, and just a short walk to the Brandenburg Gate, Museum Island, the Tiergarten, the Holocaust memorial, and other sites. There's plenty of shopping and dining nearby, as well as plenty of public transport options right outside the door.Dining in the hotel was quite good, and their breakfast was fantastic. Restaurant on the ground level was very nice also, and the lobby\/foyer area at the base of the grand staircase was a nice place to hang out and relax, as well as meet up, with afternoon tea and snacks as well as a full bar.Given the experience we had here and the overall feel and service at the hotel, I found it to be quite well priced, as well. Would highly recommend the Westin Grand Berlin!
