{"text":"We need more hotels like this I stayed at Hyatt Summerfield Suites several times over the past few months. One of the better choices in Miami. The rooms are very comfortable, with plenty of space. The staff are friendly. Getting to the hotel from the airport couldn't be easier (for that matter, the hotel is just a few blocks from the Dolphin Expressway, so it's easy to hop on the expressway and head east to Miami Beach or north to Ft Lauderdale). The grounds are much more attractive than what one might ordinarily expect for a hotel of this class. This hotel seems to be popular with airline flight crews.Having said the above, I would rate the Hampton Inn across the street as a slightly better option, assuming you can find equivalent rooms for the same price at both places. The breakfast buffet has much better choices at Hampton Inn. I never had any internet wireless access problems at Hampton Inn, but often found the signal dropping while at Hyatt. Security was better at Hampton Inn; you have to use your room key to activate the gates to the parking garage and to take the elevator up to the guest rooms at Hampton Inn, whereas at Hyatt Summerfield you just park your car in an open lot surrounding the hotel and there is no room-key control of the elevator. (Even so, I have felt very safe during my stays at Hyatt Summerfield.) And some of the cardio equipment in the fitness room at Hyatt Summerfield needs to be repaired.While staying at Hyatt Summerfield, I did occasionally hear airplanes, not surprising with the airport being relatively close by. The noise was really not very loud and did not bother me much, but if you are very sensitive to this kind of distraction, you might want to look for a hotel further from the airport, or at least ask for a room toward the other side of the building.
