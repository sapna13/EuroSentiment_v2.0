{"text":"Love this resort My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bavaro princess for 5 nights in March for our Spring Break. This was our second stay at this resort. We were in building 45, which was a nice middle location, right near the restaurants Chopin and Sakura, and right near a tram stop. We were sad to hear about the fire at the beach bar\/buffet. We spent every day at the beach buffet, overlooking the beautiful water. We really do not have anything bad to say about the resort. I am a picky eater, and I always found something to enjoy. I especially love the fresh fruit smoothies at the breakfast buffet. We did not get sick (last visit or this one). The reason most people get sick\/diarrhea is because the overdo it on Coco Locos and Banana Mamas. The grounds are immaculate, the rooms spacious, and the people friendly. The only critique is that there is not a lot of nightlife there, but the staff works hard. The best is when they have audience participation shows, those are the funniest, and the Lion King show wasn't bad. Plus, after a few drinks, not much can be very entertaining! We booked through Apple Vacations, and they were a very good tour company. I would definetly recommend this resort! The biggest piece of advice: Be open minded! This is a different country!!! Respect them and they respect you! The thing I hated most about this vacation is the complainers!!! Enjoy your visit!!!
