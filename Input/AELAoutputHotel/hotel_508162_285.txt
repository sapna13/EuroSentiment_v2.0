{"text":"4 stars out of 5 in my book The Dreams Resort is a nice place to stay. Location isn't the greatest but an hour trip is quite the adventure. Its a shame to see how people live and how people like us take things for granted where we live. Just brace yourself for the driving quite the trip. I am a country boy and I was scared at times with the drive. The hotel itself is nice. We were on our honeymoon and had the honeymoon suite bulding six. It was nice. It had no view. Just trees and such. But that is nice if you want to be alone. The rooms are nice. I didn't have any problems with the bed or shower or anything. One problem was that there was water leaking from the ceiling. I think this is a common problem. Had to call the front desk TWICE before they sent someone. The second time I called concerige and they had someone there within 1\/2 an hour. They fixed the problem. I wouldn't spend the extra money if I would go again to get the honeymoon sweet. It gives you a jacuzzi and the special bar on the first floor to use. But just stay in the normal rooms your not missing much. Food was fine. People complain about it on here all the time but it is not that bad. People in the USA are too used to having meals that are one big meal and you can't eat it all. They expect you to get a 4 course meal. If you eat it all you will be plenty full. Room Service is what makes this hotel. 1\/2 an hour wait and it is there. Menu is a little limited. No food problems. Drinks are good. Ask for extra rum they go a little skimpy on the boos unless you ask. Beer was good like the Presidente. Casino is quite the thing very small. Played Blackjack 4 nights total. After week was over I took about 50 dollars home. They hate to lose. Don't expect them to be like American Casinos. They will try to get you drunk so you don't pay attention. WATCH YOUR money they will try to take it if your not paying attention. This happen several times with many players. Be careful. Pit bosses look mean. But the heck with them and have fun. They shows are neat but we didn't watch many of them. Snorkeling was fun. Beach is nice. Stay to the left side(Less Rock and Coral) Pool is awesome I bet it is 3 1\/2-4 football fields long. If you don't like kids don't come here. There are usually a few but most are out of the way in the Explorers Club. I didn't mind them. GO AND HAVE FUN. DONT LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS. Would go back!
