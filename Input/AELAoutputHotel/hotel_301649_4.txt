{"text":"Legian Club is a bliss We stayed at the Legian Club for a week at the beginning of a Bali trip. It is located behind the Legian Hotel (and next door to the Samaya), just a 30sec. walk over the street. Like in most GHM properties, many things are free of charge (laundry, mini-bar). But the Legian Club also had a restaurant-lounge, where all drinks were free (we drunk out the red house wine, it was finished the last day...) and they serve free canapees, bakery ect, very pleasant. Personal butler was very special, ours (Radit√ã?¬©) was one of the best we ever had. Also our 4-years daughter, which is usually very shy, loved him from the 2nd day. Only negative was the not-changing menu in the Club restaurant, where we ended eating each day because of the free wine. Spoken to the manager, he promised too change this. Beach is great, a little away from the crowds, big waves and fantastic sunsets; beach service was also great. Spa is fantastic, over the expectations. All in all the Legian Club is highly recommended to those who want a lot of privacy (each villa is absolute secluded) and pampering (butler, pool, lobby). The main hotel - half the price of the club (and looks a bit like the Lemuria\/Seychelles) - is a good choice for those who love the ocean views from the room and don√à?√¨t mind not to live in separate villas. All in all the Legian it is a grat choice, but dont forget to move to other places in the real Bali (e.g. Matahari Beach\/Permutaran, Chedi Club\/Ubud or Amankila. For beginning or ending of a Bali trip we would absolutely come back.
