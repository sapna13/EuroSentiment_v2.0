{"text":"Very tacky, lousy for business travelers. This former Holiday Inn hotel leaves a lot to be desired. It seems that Holiday Inn sold the property to new owners and they have since done nothing to improve the function, quality, amenities, or value. It has been tastelessly decorated and otherwise left in disrepair. The website and general first impressions with all of the faux-marble statues and fountains, flags, trophies, big screen TV in the lobby, etc. made the place very tacky and tasteless-looking. The process of checking in on a Monday afternoon required 25 minutes to process my reservation. There was no line and the staff were not very apologetic, but rather were quite rude in telling me to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µust wait a two seconds, dog.√à√\u2020\u2022?My reservation was actually lost, and the procedure of looking it up involved two employees thumbing through all kinds of paper folders- absolutely no computerized system! I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe checked into hostels in Eastern Europe faster than this. Finally, the staff found the reservation and gave me a key card which did not work at all in the door. So, another 15 minutes to get it re-magnetized.The room was freezing cold and musty-smelling. The door to the patio was jammed due to so much dirt and grit on the track. The King bed consisted of two beds pushed together. The bathroom water pressure was weak and the electrical outlet for the desk was not working, so charging my laptop had to be done elsewhere. Breakfast was hardly so, as it consisted of watery coffee and donuts purchased from a grocery store to be consumed with a plastic fork (??). My suggestion would be to find a Denny√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ or something for a proper breakfast. There were many advertisements for dinner buffets posted around the property, but upon going to the 9th floor restaurant, we found it to be completely closed and dark with nobody to be found. This happened both nights. At least the bar was open for a couple of hours and beer prices were great ($1.50 for a pint of Amber Bock). But, no bar food to complement it. Not even chips. Popcorn machine out of order as well. Basically, this would be okay for convenience to sporting events at the stadium or horse track√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√±hat is, if all you need is a roof and bed to crash into. For vacations or business trips, forget it and get a room at a comparatively-priced Comfort Inn or something instead.
