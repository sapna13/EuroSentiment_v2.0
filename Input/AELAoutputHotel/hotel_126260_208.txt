{"text":"Topnotch, wonderful service, room and location My wife and I stayed at the Palace for a weekend of both business and leisure. I was attending a meeting while my wife spent time enjoying NY. I came by car and the Doorman waved me into the garage driveway, as we were parking at the hotel, where a bellhop and parking valet met us immediately. This was very convenient as we were able to get out of the car and have our luggage swiftly unloaded while we were inside and away from the traffic on the street. While the weather was excellent for our visit, this could be a particular virtue if your visit is during poor weather. Access the main entrance on 50th street R off of Madison Ave. You will pay for the convenience as the parking rate is $50 a night, without in and out privileges, which I suspect is typical for the top NYC hotels. The car valets were very quick and efficient and the front desk and bell staff were cordial, professional, and welcoming. Our room was very clean, well decorated, and comfortable. We were not in a tower room but we overlooked the street. From the 24th floor there was no noise at all and the room was very well insulated. The only ultra-modern touch was a large wall-mounted flat-screen TV. A fresh bucket of ice was in the room. Elevator service was very good which is a plus in such a tall hotel. As part of my meeting I attended a buffet breakfast, lunch, and dinner in the Villard Mansion part of the property and the food service, quality and presentation were excellent. This is clearly a fine, service-oriented hotel and I would stay here again.
