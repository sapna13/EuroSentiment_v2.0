{"text":"Great Stay Stayed here with a friend for 3 nights. Central to most of main Madrid sights, with a metro stop at each end of the street, but then any hotel in old Madrid is central to most of main sights, either on foot or metro.If coming from the airport via the Metro, would suggest changing at Mar de Cristal and then taking line 4 to Alonzo Martinez and then line 5 to Callao, rather than the route described on hotel website. Callao is at the end of the street where hotel is situated, 2 minute walk, whereas directions on website are from Gran Via and took us a while to find (OK once you have your bearings and know where you are going, but Callao is easier for first time travvelers and avoids Nuevos Ministerios changeover which is notorious for pickpockets).We had an interior twin room, which was clean but not overly big. Good sized bathroom,. Free minibar with 2 bottles of beer, 2 bottles of mineral water, 2 bottles of fruit juice and about 5 small bottles of soft drinks (these were replenished each day). Shutters on windows and interior room meant we had no noise at night, which was good.Didn't eat in hotel, breakfast wasn't included in rate and at 16.50 euros was expensive. A short stroll to the Gran Via got breakfast for 2 for around 8 euros total.Staff were friendly, reception staff spoke good English. They let us use computer in back office to check in on-line for our return flights and print out our boarding passes.Madrid is a lovely city and we had a great stay. Compared to other hotels we have used I would say this isn't quite a 4 star but close, certainly a very good 3 star plus and would use it again if in Madrid. ","annotations":[]}
