{"text":"Good all-around hotel We were hoping to stay in a 5-star hotel in Paris but none were available at the time we were visiting. After reading positive reviews of Bassano on TripAdvisor, we booked a room there. The hotel is rated as 4 star and I think that is probably a fair evaluation. While the property is small, the Superior Room we received as fairly large and well appointed. The mattress was too low to the ground and was ready to be replaced. It was very hard and not too comfortable. The bathroom was marble and large as well with excellent L'Ocittane amenities.The hotel's staff is a real high point. They were very pleasant and helpful with directions or any other assistance we required. Everyone speaks good English and is easy to deal with. They even modified our reservation from a package deal to a Superior Room only (no included Internet and breakfast). I had read that the breakfast at the hotel was not as good as can be had at the Boulangerie right next door. That info was spot on. We saved 30 Euro a night by not eating breakfast at the hotel. The hotel has free wireless Internet in the lobby, so we did not need the 8 Euro per day wi-fi in the room.Notwithstanding the discomfort delivered by the rock-hard bed, the hotel was clean, quiet and a good value. If we were looking for a 4 star hotel in Paris, we would certainly stay there again. The property is also in a good location, only minutes from Eiffel Tower, Champs Elysees and Arc d' Triomphe.
