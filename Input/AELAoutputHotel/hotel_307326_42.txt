{"text":"Nice hotel in a good location I have stayed at this hotel many times over the last couple of years, and I keep coming back. It's not a *great* hotel, but I'd say it's above average (just), so would give this a 3 1\/2 if there were such an option. There is a large, relatively modern lobby, with the staff in the reception being understately welcoming in a typically Japanese manner. They don't seem to have any particular upgrading or welcoming system for returning guest. I've been there more than 10 times, but only once did they say 'welcome back'. It would be nice if they might have recognised the fact we've been there so many times.I'd say this hotel is more suitable for business travel than for holiday makers, as they only have a limited capacity for what to suggest in terms of entertainment and tourist attractions, but they will go out of their way to help you the best they can with any enquiries. When I asked about climbing Mt Fuji (out of season), one of the receptionists spent almost an hour trying to help me. For the record, I wouldn't recommend anyone without a car doing a night climb of Fuji out of season.The rooms have the basic facilities, are of adequate sizing, and the beds are comfortable enough though I wouldn't make a song and dance about any of it. Sometimes you get a great view of either of the nearby parks and\/or the city lights and skyscrapers. Most of the rooms are also quite quiet, which is nice when you're tired. You have to pay extra for an internet cable, but I bought one on the first stay and always bring it back on subsequent stays.There is a very small gym, with mainly cardiovascular equipment, that tends to be quiet most of the time, which is nice for a private basic gym session. There are many restaurants in and near the hotel, although personally I don't rate the actual hotel restaurants that highly, but prefer the restaurants on the ground and the first floors, and others nearby. I would primarily recommend this hotel to business travellers, as it's not really suited to holiday makers, and they wouldn't really fit in there. If you are mixing business with one part holiday, this is the ideal hotel though, with its proximity to a very well-connected station and its understated and classy service. I think that as a holiday maker, you'd feel rather uncatered for, but if this doesn't bother you, then it might be suitable for you too.I do really like this hotel and the area because I've been there so many times, and I know them pretty well now. When I first visited Tokyo, I stayed in 5 different hotels (my lovely husband booked us in to 5 different hotels so I would get to experience different parts of town), and Century Southern Tower was marginally my favourite overall in terms of location and the hotel itself.
