{"text":"I would not stay here again. Stayed here 4 days in August 2008 in an ocean front room on the 17th floor. The location was right across the street from Waikiki beach and I even fed the fish right there on the beach. Be sure to bring breadcrumbs to feed the fish. Actually, most of the major hotels on Waikiki are on the same stretch of beach. Location is really not an issue on Waikiki beach itself. Upon arriving by chartered bus\/group bus, as other reviewers have noted, you will be dropped off in the back of the hotel. There were no hotel personnel to help with luggage when we arrived. We did not have too much luggage and this was not an issue for us.The Waikiki Marriott itself was average at best. Our room had a good view but the sink was cracked and the bathroom was old. There were spots on the carpet and a visible patch on the wall. I did mention the obvious issues to a manager the morning after arrival but did not request a room change since we were rarely in the room and had unpacked. Naturally, staying ocean front is always expensive and we did pay a premium for the view. The view itself was very good but the room left a lot to be desired. Everything in the room pointed to cost savings. There were no robes, crusty coffee maker, sparse towels and few hangers created the impression that anything not bolted down was cut out to save expenses. One would expect more in a room that cost US$300 - US$350 per night. Apart from the room, the personnel were excellent and the on-site sushi restaurant was quite good. However, I would not stay at the Waikiki Marriott again in lieu of the vast number of other hotels within a block of each other, for the price. Regardless, based on every beach-based hotel I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in over the last 20 years (Miami, Clearwater, Sydney, Maui, Cancun), the Waikiki Marriott had some of the worst rooms for the price. Since I have not stayed at other hotels in the area, I cannot recommend an alternative. There is a valid reason though as to why this hotel is not in the top 10 hotels for Waikiki on TripAdvisor. Wish I had listened to the other reviews and stayed elsewhere.
