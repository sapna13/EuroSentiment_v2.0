{"text":"5 Star Service For Families Too Spent 10 nights here in October in a City view suite. The hotel made our family very welcome and both children (3  9) were left a small gift in the room on arrival.Our suite was immaculate and huge at 75 sq meters. A harbour view would have been even better - maybe next time!Paying extra for the club facilities is worthwhile and the hotel organised a baby sitter for us (at a very reasonable S$20\/hour) so we could take advantage of the cocktails and canapes in the early evening.Complaints? Well, maybe I'm being a little picky but breakfast at The Melt restaurant - whilst excellent - could feel a little rushed given the number of people. On two occasions, I was presented with the bill to sign just as I sat down to eat - not what you need first thing!We had room service a couple of times and the food and service were excellent. You can walk to Marina Square in 3 minutes where there is a supermarket for those essentials (cheap wine!). In addition to a huge range of shops there too, check out the food court on the top floor. We sat outside with superb curries for us, pizza and ice cream for the children, two tiger beers and a superb view of Boat Quay and the city skyline.Singapore is a viable destination for young families. We did Sentosa, East Coast Park, the Night Safari and Chinatown. Both children really enjoyed the holiday and the staff at the pool where excellent too.Would we return? Absolutely, especially if we are upgraded to a harbour view suite next time!
