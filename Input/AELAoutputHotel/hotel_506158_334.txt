{"text":"great hotel, nicely decorated, service and atmosphere needs approvement We stayed in July in this hotel at the Ramblas instead of going to Arts (sea side 5 star) again, because of reviews on tripadvisor. The 1898 at the Ramblas is nicely decorated an still brandnew. We had a fantastic room with a lounge terras, and this really gives THE touch to our 4 days trip. I priorly arranged some flowers and the reception assited me very kindly.The reception is actually also the concierge service. This brings me to one important point for all of you who are spoiled by 5 star services. They really do not offer this. It is really a 4 star and sometimes even a 3 star. The reception staff is 6 stars, really, but the rest is...mmm. Roomservice do not want to bring any food or drinks to the roofterras. The bar on the roofterras is not opened until 1700!!! although there inroom brochure says it is opened from 1200 to 0100. So no service at all at the roof and the splonge pool is only 1.20 deep and very small. In the evening for drinks; no music, no barsnacks, no nuts, no glory, no atmosphere. To bad, cause it has potential! The bathroom is small and has no seperate shower. It's good, not excellent. They do not speak english at the health\/beauty club and it is short of staff, so no pedicures for us. This is a great hotel when you book the room with the outside lounge erea. Decoration is hip, the atmosphere is not. So it is recommended, but do not expect 5 star service, they do not make the extra mile. High potential though!
