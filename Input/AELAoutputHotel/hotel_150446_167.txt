{"text":"Wonderful experience at the InterContinental!! What a classy resort! I think their biggest attribute\/selling point is their employees, so I will begin on that topic.The staff here is wonderful, from the concierge to housekeeping, they always had a smile on their face and really wanted to make you feel welcome at their resort! I cant say enough about the service here, it was TOP NOTCH!! We barely had to lift a finger here, they did it all for us!! We ended up at this resort because we originally booked at the Marriott and left after a hellish firt night there. Because of our last minute change, we couldnt get into our room for a couple of hours, but they offered us a hospitality room to get situated in and change for the beach. When our room was ready, they brought our luggage up for us and even stored my husband's golf bags for us in their storage area (not at our request) so we wouldnt be inconvenienced with having them in the room with us! Our room was nicely appointed and comfortable. Bathroom was a bit on the smaller side, but it never was an issue for us. Over all we were quite comfortable in our room. The grounds here are beautiful, we LOVED the pool (it was huge)and we were even more enthralled with the beautiful BEACH!! Spots at the pool were definitely a hot commodity; I got up at 7 am one morning to jog on the beach and guests were already saving spots!! They have awesome cabana like set ups at the pool, but only about 5 of them and they were almost always taken, especially over the weekend. The pool has a great swim up bar with flat screen tvs and bartenders that are ready to serve you!! The beach is equally beautiful - the only downfall here is that you have to pay 10 bucks to rent an umbrella. But, its worth it. The sand is so soft and the water is so warm. There is also a beach bar\/restaurant that serves great food and drinks...try the salads here, they are WONDERFUL!! Also, try to get Katherine as your server...she is prompt, friendly, and always smiling! We loved her!! We had breakfast in the restaurant thats on the lower level (cant remember the name) but it was delicious. They also have a cheaper, more continental like spread in the main lobby that came in extra handy with tons of fresh fruit and bagels - yum! Overall we especially enjoyed our stay here and would return again in a heartbeat!
