{"text":"Great stay at Icaria - would come again! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Icaria for 5 nights in the middle of September and were really pleased with our choice. We chose it for the excellent location to the beach and the port, the pool, modern rooms and good reviews and wern't dissapointed. The hotel was very modern and clean with a pool and jacuzzi (although not warm), small gym (ample but not for muscle enthusiasts) and a lovely outdoor seating area with big, comfy sofas.There was building work taking place next door but it was very quiet and minimal and finished early in the day. You can get a taxi from the hotel which should cost about 23 euros, but our driver decided to add about 7 euros on so costing us 30!! After deciding to walk in and from town the first day (big mistake-it was too hot) we quickly discovered the excellent public transport, and got the bus and train returning to the airport on our departure.I definitely recommend you use the metro and bus. They are very regular, relible and clean. You pay exactly the same for both. 1.25 euros for a single journey anywhere and the number 14 goes from right outside the hotel to Las Ramblas and beyond. If you use a metro get a T10 ticket for 6.40 euros (about √ä√£¬¢4), which allows you 10 journeys anywhere around Barcelona (and if your a couple and only want 5 trips each, you can share the ticket. This can also be used for train back to airport.The room at the hotel was large with a big modern bathroom and a hot powerful shower and hairdryer, comfy double, air conditioning, fridge\/mini bar, flat screen tv and free safe. plus a free ice machine on every floor. We stayed on a room onthe 5th floor and got one of the few massive roof terraces\/balconies to ourselves!!!For our 5 day stay breakfast was only an extra √ä√£¬¢12 on top (we booked with greatlatedeals.com) and was well worth it!! We had about 4 courses every morning!! Massive variety of food and always loads. Breakfast runs from 7-11.Location, great for the beach (although we didn't really go cos it got a bit cool towards the end of the week) and the olympic port, five mins walk where there's a sandy beach. We found eating at the Olympic Port quite nice, but be prepared to be hounded by the staff to come in as you walk passed them. A bit annoying. The hotel room had a very comprehensive tourist guide book so you can find all the restaurants you like. The hotel also has free internet in the lobby. Room has kettle and cups but no tea or coffe. might want to take your own of grab some from the breakfast cart. no cork screw either and mini bar expensive, so buy your own wine.There is a supermarket 3 mins walk away, two blocks right and one left from hotel.There is a tourist bus which passes near to the hotel but we did not use it. Brilliant sight seeing up and around Las Rambles. Nice Cathedrals, but for most you need to have your shoulders covered (as I was turned away from one). worth going to.WATCH YOUR BAGS!!!!! a friend living there got her bag snatched from her twice in the 1st few weeks and we encountered a couple of boys planning to snatch my bag one night, but as long as you are aware and keep it closely wrapped around you you should be ok.If your going with a football nut, you can take a tour of the Nou Camp for about √ä√£¬¢8 I think. My boyfriend loved it!!!!Such a pretty city. bring your comfy shoes and be prepared to have a wonder abuot. and take a map with you or you'll be wondering a lot. Tonnes of shops everywhere, ranging from the usual tackey to Gucci and Armarni (up the Passaig de Gracia). Oh and there is a Zara on every street corner!!!! brilliant!!Definitely good 4* hotel, with everything you could need!!
