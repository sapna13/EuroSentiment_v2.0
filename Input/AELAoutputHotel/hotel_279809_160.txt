{"text":"Dutch review We stayed here with two children 2 and 4 years old. The hotel is 45 minutes from the airport. Our first impression of the family room was that it is spacious but unfortunately it was opposite to the entertainment stage, not ideal with young kids. We were offered another room at a more silent building and also a superior family room at beach side for 250 US dollar more (normally it costed 50 $ per person per night extra). We took the latter, which made our holiday really fantastic; superb view at the palm beach. The room was a little bit bigger even, but as all rooms couldn't be closed from outside so going out with babymonitor wasn't safe. The rooms are clean, the airconditioning worked well but was a little bit moisty on the floor. We had fantastic beds and didn't have any problems with our pillows. The beach, swimming pool and garden are beautiful and tropical. Though one time a hotelguest had vomited near the swimmingpool suitable for children and it took us 3 employees to have a look at it before it was cleaned.The entertainmentteam was present during the day as well but not in a annoying way. Unlike other people stated we weren't bothered by the boys from Cayena at all, unless you think it is bothering when they ask were you are from and leave it with that question if they notice you are not interested. Somehow they manage to keep the place bugfree, since we saw hardly any insects although there was enough marmelade and honey at the buffets to be interesting. The food was very good and various (I really wonder what people want expect if they say it is not), though we recommend that you eat in themes since otherwise youd do have the feeling that is every day the same with soup, spaghetti, pizza, rice, potatoes, french fries, meat, fish and vegetables. The climate is great, we had only 4 hours of rainshowers and furthermore 25 degrees Celcius at night and 29-30 C during the day.Do: We went on the free catamarantrip with our kids (30 minutes) and it was great.We would certainly go back there.
