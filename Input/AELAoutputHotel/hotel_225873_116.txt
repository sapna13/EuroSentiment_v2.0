{"text":"Overall Good We came away with a good experience at this hotel although it did not start well. We arrived at 5:30 pm for our 1 night stay and were sent to our queen-bed room -- only to find that it had not yet been cleaned from the previous guests. Towels on the floor, window wide open, generally a mess. We went back down to get a different room, and the guy at the front desk was not very helpful, friendly, or apologetic (his first offer was for us to wait while he ran and cleaned the room for us, even though we had told him we needed to shower and get on our way for an appointment). Finally we got a different, smaller room with a better view, and we were told we could discuss a discount the next morning with a manager. The room we booked should have cost $139, and they put us in a $119 room. We were told the lowest they could go on discount was $99. The next morning the manager offered a discount down to $99, and when we checked out, there was an envelope with $40 in cash waiting for us, since we had prepaid for the room through hotels.com. This was great for our good will!The hotel itself was very nice, and the lounge and bar were fun. Everything was clean and the stereo system and speakers in the room and bathroom were great. We will definitely go back and stay again -- the location and price can't be beat. It's a funky hotel with nice atmosphere. We will bring our own pillows next time, though -- the ones they provided were pretty limp.
