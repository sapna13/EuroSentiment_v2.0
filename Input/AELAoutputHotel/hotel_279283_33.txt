{"text":"Low profile, luxurious boutique We stayed at JK Place for 3 nights during our Italy honeymoon a few months ago in late August. We loved it and considered it our favorite hotel on the trip. The hotel has a low-profile entrance that is easy to miss, but gives an exclusive feel to the place. The interior is wonderfully modern and sophisticated, attractively decorated with votives, potpourri, vases and romantic lighting throughout the hotel. I think an earlier review said this hotel has a boutique feel with hotel amenities--which I think is spot on. Julien and Francesca are very professional and friendly concierges, and provided excellent, personal service during our stay. Julien in particular provided great directions and restaurant recommendations (he always guaranteed no tourists!). We stayed in a Superior. We had gotten a good rate, having booked several months in advance, under 300 Euros. While our room was the smallest bedroom size of all the other Italian hotels we stayed in during our 2 week honeymoon, we found the luxurious, high-end furnishings at JK Place more than made up for it. There wasn't much walking room but we felt it was very intimate and posh at the same time. Of all the Italian hotels we stayed in during our trip, this one had the most comfortable bed we slept in, the softest sheets, pillows, and towels. The bathroom and walk in closet were a nice size. I enjoyed breakfast and the table\/atrium we sat in, but only wished that they offered hot food. I think if they offered boiled eggs at least it would be perfect. The snacks on the banquet table throughout the day were a nice touch, and sometimes featured hot food. Great location, walking distance from the train. I recommend this hotel highly at the right price. We will stay there the next time we visit Florence, but I will try to get a suite.
