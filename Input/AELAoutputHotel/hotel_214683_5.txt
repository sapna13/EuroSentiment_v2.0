{"text":"Flophouse ala Marriott First let me say that the staff in the restaurant waiting tables and making my food were great. If you can find a way to wrangle breakfast: do so. It goes to 11 AM so you can make it brunch and skip lunch. The nice ladies pouring my coffee saw I was by myself and chatted me up just enough. I liked that, and they are credit to the staff. Tips were included in my breakfast voucher but I still left a couple a bucks most days. They were so nice I guiltted myself into it.Second the lady cleaning my room (16th floor back tower) was so nice! She was always cheery and chatting my up a bit in the halls. These are the people who should be running the place. Management got bonus money: spend it there.The pool areas were nice. I liked relaxing there, and the older pool guy gave me a friendly welcome and chat one day. Good towel service. (However, younger guy noticeably snobby and above it all. Hey you are a pool boy here's a clue: put a smile on.) Even the noisy kids didn't bug me. It was kinda fun hearing Christmas Carols on the ukulele with Hawaiian words on the loudspeakers. Fun and relaxing good choice and atmosphere.Now for the bad news.This must be an old building with poor construction standards, and in my opinion, Marriott needs to sell this building and look for something else down here in Waikiki. You can noise from above, and both sides. This includes but is not limited to banging doors and furniture sliding. The automatic door closers are adjusted to a slam level. No kidding the plastic fake wood headboard in my room banged my head, with a gut wrenching BANG when the door next door closed. But all the noisy doors on the hall were clearly audible. And there must have been an elephant in the room above me dragging furniture around on the balcony. Now I had the bonus (add sarcasm) of being in the room next to the elevators, providing me with a 24 by 7 inescapable on and off whirring vibration every time the elevator moved. Imagine that morning noon and night for a 7 day stay. Now combine that with an unsympathetic staff who won't change your room. Which brings me to my next point.The front desk staff is surly and incompetent, although the woman checking me in did smile and try to accommodate me. To Wendel one of the managers: nice try by moving me 36 hours before the end of a one week stay, but it was just not worth it. And a special shout out to Kaori who was not only rude, but treated a Marriott Preferred member and a millionaire, MBA and double Masters like a complete idiot and a bum. Honestly, if someone from corporate saw a video of how she treated me, she would be fired without question. Someone in a management position should simply pose as a customer and get in line with her.Watch your bill! I chained 3 reservations together. They tried to get me to pay upgrade fees, upgrading two of the lower rates to the higher grade room. Due to all the problems they upgraded my ocean view room to one where I could actually see the ocean! How big of them! Then without telling me they tried to sneak on the 20 dollar a night charge they told me I did not have to pay. If I had not noted it I would have paid and I am sure many do. Then they treated me like they were doing me some big [--] favor to take it off.Let's talk parking. When I pay 27 dollars a night for an entire weel to park the door should open when I put my key in. And if it doesn't, someone should call to bring me new keys when I get back. Twice I had to wait in line to solve the problem of my key not working. If the front desk had not worn me down I would have fought with them to have one night removed from my bill. At that price I should not have to wait at the desk for surly treatment twice.That's enough. Again. My the pool, my housekeeper, the waitresses, and the gentleman cooking me a perfect western omelet in the morning were the only saving graces of this one week stay. The quality of the building resulting in almost unbearable noise is something in my opinion which is insurmountable. If you are expecting Marriott quality with this stay you are going to be sorely disappointed.
