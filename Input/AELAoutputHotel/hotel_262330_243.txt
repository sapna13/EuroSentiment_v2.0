{"text":"Well Worth It!! I went for a week-end in the city. I stayed on the 47 th floor with a spectacular view of the city both day and night the veiw is breath taking. I suggest a jr. suite its not that much $ for what you get. and you can have up to 5 people in the room with out paying extra per person. The front desk staff was amazing ,funny and gave honest advice.The minibar system is this hotel s weak point Dont take the key .The gift shop has an ATM that only despense $100 at a time so just walk to the corner and use that atm if you need MORE cash . here is a great tip parking is around $48-$58 a night at the hotel but if you are there for the week -end you can park on the street FREE. and week days there is a parking garage around the corner for under $15 a day if you get it validated at sysms. Also there is a great pizza shop across the street if you want a bite or on a budget. the indoor pool is pretty small ,but very nice one thing that stuck out to me was that for a hotel in manhattan it was exteremly clean. i will and i am staying here again. also sign up to become a hilton honors member and get specials and deals on rooms even in nyc.you can bring your ipod and play your i tunes on the radio cool i loved it you will too.
