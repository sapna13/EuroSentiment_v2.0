{"text":"Very Average Madrid Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Plaza Mayor for 4 nights in September. I was really looking forward to our stay from all the positive reviews on this site. We had booked a superior room, paying 10 euro extra believing we would have a larger room. I had also e-mailed the hotel directly and asked for a room with a view in the hopes of getting a room like those pictured with lots of windows. The room we received was nothing like those described here. It was very small, on the first floor ( second floor to Americans), and had one window with a view of the brick wall across the street. The two twin beds were pushed up against the walls with about 2 feet of space between them. There was a modular nightstand in between the beds, so they could not be pushed together as is standard in most European hotels. We did not ask to change rooms as we were tired from travelling all day and had unpacked when it settled in on how small our quarters were. On the bright side, the bathroom was sufficient in size, and the shower had excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water. The room was cleaned daily, and was spotless. We took the buffet breakfast one morning and it was quite filling and tasty. The desk staff though seemed quite bored with their jobs, and were not really friendly. Also it should be noted that although the hotel uses electronic key cards, they are attached to a huge metal weight, so you must leave your key at the front desk when leaving the hotel. Overall, I can't say I would stay here again. There are plenty of alternative hotels and hostals in the neighborhood that offer the same size rooms for half the price. And for 10~20 Euro more a night you can have a nice hotel. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1708,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1704}]}
