{"text":"I did not want to go home! We spent 6 wonderful days and 5 restfull nights at the Punta Cana Princess. The resort is beautiful. The lobby is open air and clean! The tile floors are kept spotless. Any questions we had were answered by the wonderful people at the front desk or guest services. They offer free internet service ,there was never a long wait. The tram service they offer to get to the other hotels are safe and smooth. Remember do not leave the hotel property!The grounds are kept spotless also. Every morning while most guest are still sleeping the staff are hosing the sidewalks down and sweeping. The pool is kept clean and a nice temperature. The bar has stools in the water to relax on. The pool bar is a great place to meet other travelers, try a Banana Mama, or a Coco Loco. The rum is awesome. Our room was top floor facing the pool and ocean. The view from the balcony was heaven every morning. The color of the ocean is nothing I have ever seen before. (The Jersey shore will never be the same) The whole room has tiled floors so do use the fluffy slippers they give you or you will be ice skating across the room! The flowers by the sink everyday and the turn down service at night is so sweet. The maids were great ,what ever you needed they gave you. All you need to do is ask. The beach is kept clean and is never crowded the VIP beach beds were so relaxing. The food was interesting. We were so afraid at first to eat anything. We were cautious and stayed to the basics, rice, bread, steamed veggies, chicken, fruit, lots of fruit, Then as the days go on we found ourselves trying alot of different dishes. The Italian place was not our favorite there is something different with the cheese???? All the other places were nice. You need to just pick and choose and do not pig out! We drank bottle water the whole time, coke with ice and the mixed drinks. We did not get sick. We did love the deserts. The half of coconut with coconut pudding at the buffet place was great, as well the cakes and pies and cookies!We did snorkle and parasail ,we booked it through the private boats on the beach. (Look for Pedro) It was great and a low price. I have been recommending the resort to anyone who is looking for an affordable and relaxing place to run away to. We did like that it is adults only. After visiting the other resorts next door with kids, wow what a difference to come back to ours. QUIET and CLEAN. All we said on our last day to all the great people we met was We do not want to go home!!! This is Paradise!
