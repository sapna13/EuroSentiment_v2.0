{"text":"Not great but very friendly On our way back from our Route 66 Road Trip from Texas to California we decided to stop by in Phoenix and take in a D-backs game. I want to first start off by saying (with the utmost respect) that Phoenix is friggin hot. When we got there it was around 110 degrees and my breath was taken away when i stepped out of the vehicle. The outside of the Clarendon is not a great sight but once I got on the inside I was really impressed with the whole ikea looking style. The pool area looked inviting and the rooms were decorated very nicely. The problem occurred when we went to our room, the AC did not work very well at all. The staff downstairs was very helpful and they told us they would give us a new room. The new room wasn't any better but once again the staff was very helpful and allowed us to switch rooms again. They also said that we would be comped for anything we wanted to eat out of the snacks\/drinks in the rooms. Once again the third room was still hot and the air didn't work again. I think we were a bit more agitated during the whole incident because we were hot and the baseball game started in about an hour. We finally decided we would just leave and look for another hotel nearby. The staff was still courteous and refunded our money right away. Even though the we didn't stay I would still say that the staff at the Clarendon is very friendly and will help you in anyway they can. Also another downside was the construction and the non-working elevator. I found it hilarious though that in our last room we tried there was a huge painting of the scene from National Lampoons Vacation where Chevy Chase is standing ontop of their car in the middle of the desert. That basically summed up our whole evening in Phoenix. ","annotations":[]}
