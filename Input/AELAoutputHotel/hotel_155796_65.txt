{"text":"Not a good expierence We stayed at 4 different hotels on our visit to Puerto Rico and were sadly disappointed with the Fajardo Inn. There were no elevators in the resort and we had to lug baggage for 4 people up to the second floor. When we got to our room, there was a foul odor which filled the room for our 1 night stay. The ceilings in the room were acoustical tile ceilings which never allowed the room to cool down enough to remove the odor or the dampness which filled the room. The shower was dirty and there was no counter room in the bathroom to set any of our toiletries.The Hotel offered no ammenities at all. No inn room coffee makers, no coffee in the lobby in the AM etc.. the ice maker was broke, the business center that had access to internet was also out of working order. Which by the way is not free. It cost $ 5.35 to use the computer for 1\/2 hr - when it is in service. The restaurant charged 9.00 for scrambled eggs, hardly a bargin for such a lowly rated resort. The room furnishings were okay, however they had a large resort vanity, but when we opened it there was a small 19 TV inside it. We all thought this was quite odd looking. But at least they had a TV. The bedding, although damp, appeared clean. The comforter on one of the beds had what appeared to be a large burn hole in it, but they still used it.On a positive note, the pools were beautiful. However you had to climb a number of steep hills when you walked the grounds. I would not recommend the resort to older clients. We love the Island and will return next year, but will not be back to the Fajardo Inn.
