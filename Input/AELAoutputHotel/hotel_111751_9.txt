{"text":"Cannot say enough good things about this hotel! This was my second stay at this fabulous property. I'd arrived on an overseas flight from he** the morning I checked in. Despite the fact that check-in is 3pm, they promptly accommodated my arrival at 11:30 am, and were gracious enough to give me the specific room I had requested that I'd enjoyed the year before.The people who work there are unobtrusive but extremely accommodating. I called to schedule a spa appointment, and was given an in-room appointment for the following morning. I called to inquire about using a microwave, and was asked did I want room service to heat my item up for me or should they bring a microwave to the room--no charge. They promptly brought a tub mat and foam pillow to the room when requested. The airline broke a piece of my luggage and the concierge recommended a wonderful luggage store (I ended up buying 2 pieces!!). Truly, no request is too great.The Restaurant is wonderful. . .I had a fabulous steak dinner the night before Ieft. Service and setting are both superb.The gardens and ponds are legendary, as they should be. I was stopped on my walk one morning as I watched a hummingbird go from one flower to another. And I spent much time enjoying breakfast each morning on my patio with its own little fountain...what a life.But my absolute favorite part of this property is the swimming pool. There is no other pool like it. . .so beautiful and serene, incredibly relaxing--it's a wonderful place to while away an hour, have lunch, or actually swim! They maintain the water at a steady 82 degrees. . . Ahhhhh. . .I believe myself to be a hotel junkie--I love to try different hotels every time I travel to a city. . .but from now on in LA, there's no reason to hotel shop anymore. I will gladly consider the Hotel Bel Air my home away from home as often as I can. ","annotations":[]}
