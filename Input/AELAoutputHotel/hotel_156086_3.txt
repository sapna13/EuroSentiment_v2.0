{"text":"Unique creative hotel, not your cookie cutter business hotel From the wave-generating fountain in the front of the hotel, to the bold color scheme and creative architectural lay out, I imagine that you'll either love it or hate it. I loved it.If you are into single hallway, predictable spaces and the same old bar scene, this is not for you.The owners have accentuated the quirkiness of the hotels features to make it a memorable stay. In the main lobby, there is a blue bar off to the right, down the steps is the spacious check-in area. Yes, it take a few minutes to get your bearings, and yes, chances are good you'll get turned around a little, but I find this fun. In fact, two of us stumbled into a bar on the 3rd floor that we had no idea existed. At midnight, the place was hopping with locals and guests alike, the bartenders were engaging and we had a really nice time soaking in the atmosphere. I doubt the same could be said for a Marriott or Hilton.The room itself was large (3rd floor). I was initially followed to my room by a hooker who quickly went away after a brief description of what she could do for (to) me. The encounter was not threatening and in fact, I saw her trolling later in the Blue Bar near the lobby.The bathroom was fantastic, all stone tile with a large shower and sink area. Plenty of amenities as well. The bed was comfortable There was a solid work area with Wifi and the TV worked just fine. There was one lightbulb out but I just don't get excited about things like that. I'm sure if I asked, someone would have changed it. If I had to complain, I'd say the hotel was austere and slightly dark in some areas. Nevertheless, I think it's a neat place to stay and plan on bringing my family there in the event we visit MC in the future.
