{"text":"Not the best night's sleep We stayed at the Holiday Inn Beacon Hill on 2324 August. We stay at Holiday Inns fairly often as we as Priority Club members and use our points for free rooms.We were very glad on this occasion that we didn't pay for the room as the price wouldn't have been justified.We were upgraded to an Executive Room, and although clean, it was in need of refurbishment. The bathroom was average, but when we went to use the toiletries we found that they were either empty or half empty and had not been replaced by housekeeping.The a\/c was so noisy we had to turn it off in the middle of the night, and because the windows wouldn't open, it was quite an uncomfortable night. Also, at 4 am each morning the hotel must start up the elevators because there was a loud noise of a motor starting and you heard the bell of the elevator every couple of seconds as if it were stopping at each floor. On the plus side, the hotel is fairly well placed in Boston. We got a taxi from the airport and it cost $25. We walked to downtown and the harbour to go on a whale watching cruise, and it only took about 15 minutes to get there (at a slow walking pace). There was also free wifi in the room and although we didn't make use of it a swimming pool and gym.If I had to pay for a room in this hotel, I would look elsewhere for the price, but as we got it free it's hard to be too harsh about it.
