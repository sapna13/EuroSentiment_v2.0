{"text":"Very nice... We recently returned from a very nice 3 nights stay at the Four Seasons Hotel San Francisco. I must admit that I was a little anxious about it due to several of it's recent negative reviews but decided to give it a try anyway. We were pleasantly surprised by the friendly yet professional staff members who made our stay delightful. Front desk staff is well trained and capable of handling important details. Kathy of in-room dinning is sweet with her bright personality. Concierge David was very helpful and patient as we couldn't decide between seafood, steak, Chinese food, or just something yummy, on another evening he made a last minute reservation for us at Ozumo which was delicious. The Chinese parking attendants were always making sure that we had directions and plenty of bottled water for our daily trips. I would say that all staff were very service oriented and each individual tried to do what he or she can to improve our experience there. The rooms themselves were nice. The furnishings appear to be in fairly new condition, bed was very comfortable with a good selection of pillows. Bathroom was nicely appointed. We had both a superior king and a regular king room. The superior king room was not cramped with a lay-away twin size bed. Breakfast was delicious, quality was very good as to be expected at a hotel of this level. A very ingenious touch was the delicious chocolates and tea service on the house the evening of our last day. It made you feel that they really value you as their guest. In a time when the services and values of many Ritz Carltons and Four Seasons properties are starting to fail many people's expectations, it is encouraging to know that here is one which continues to be strive to set the standards and is managed well. I don't remember ever seeing a coffee maker or tea maker in a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons Hotel with the exception of Ritz or Four Seasons Resorts - this is not something that would be expected. I would definitely stay here again.
