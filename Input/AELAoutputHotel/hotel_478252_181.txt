{"text":"Great hotel.. ideal for gorup travel I traveled with a group of approximatley 35 people from Toronto through Sunwing Vacations from April 26-May 3 2008 for a wedding.We arrived at the airport and found our bus. Check in was done on the bus to speed things up. First order of business once we got there, purchase the safe! It's very easy to use, and unlike many resorts doesn't require a physical key but rather a combination you pick.The resort itself is beautiful. The grounds are in immaculate condition. The lobby is spotless, as are the restaurants. The rooms are great. We had one queen size plus one full size couch, that didn't pull out but still by all accounts, was very comfortable. Maid service was excellent. One day I requested mucho cerveza por favor, which I didn't get- a quick call to room service rectified that. The pools were spectacular. 3 swim up bars in total. One for regular guests, one for diamond and club hacienda principe guests, plus one  party pool located right at the beach. All three seemed to be very clean and fun places to be. This is VERY important. If you are getting a slushie drink ( daiquiri, margarita or the like) not all bar tenders automatically put rum in them at the pool and beach bars. Some do, some don't. Just ask for a daiquiri with rum and you're golden. John, my favourite bar tender for the week would actually just give the bottle for you to mix your own and then reply  I love you my friend.The beach was very good, but not great. It's very weedy. I'd rather take weeds than rocks and what not, but it's still very weedy. The sand is gorgeous,clean, and white.The restaurants were very good as well. I ate at a mix of the A'La Cartes and the buffet. I ate at the Mexico restaurant and while I didn't find it as good as the Bahia Prinicpe San Jaun's Mexican restraint, it was still quite good.The french restaurant was very good as well. I had the steak. It was a good cut of meat and cooked to my liking.The buffet was also good. Good selection, 2 cooking stations, a full pasta bar with a variety of sauce. The omelette's although I only saw breakfast twice as I'm not really a morning fan were incredible.My only issue was the bacon seemed to be a bit of a rarity. There is definitely something for everyone, even the pickiest eaters.The beach snackbar was where I ate many meals. Good food, good selection, great location. The pizza is great and can only be found at the snack bar and lunch, although is available on the buffet at dinner.At 11pm, Puelbo Principe ( Principe Town) is where all the of the festivities relocate too. The karaokee bar was a ton of fun and the disco is good, but the music is the same night in, night out. At the karaokee bar the musical seleciton isn't the best and one night we were there they gave us a book that many, many songs that weren't in the computer.The burger point is where the 24 hour all inclusive comes into play. I had a cheese burger, ham sandwhich, and hot dog at various points throughout the week, they were all quite good.To those people who complain about being on the Bavaro side as opposed to the Punta Cana side- grow up. They are the same. A mirror image of one and other.I was there for a wedding which seemed to go off without a hitch from my vantage point. The wedding planners there seem to take care of most things.Also, to the people who complain about the distance from the lobby to the beach- it's an 8 minute lesiurly stroll. Exercise would do a lot of people good down there. I was in the furtherest vila from the beach, #39 and found it an enjoyable walk. For those who are not well enough to walk, there is regular tram service right up until 3am.All in all, I highly recomend this resort to others. It's good for a wedding, get away with friends, a week away for a couple and it seemed like a great place for families.I'll be back to the Gran Bahia Principe eventually, but I plan on trying the Riu ( located next door, first) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":932,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":928},{"endOffset":932,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":928},{"endOffset":1156,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":1152},{"endOffset":1156,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":1152},{"endOffset":2036,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":2031},{"endOffset":2393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2388},{"endOffset":2393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2388},{"endOffset":2393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2388},{"endOffset":2393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2388},{"endOffset":2393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2388},{"endOffset":2393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2388},{"endOffset":2393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2388},{"endOffset":2393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2388},{"endOffset":2861,"mention":"burger","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2855},{"endOffset":2861,"mention":"burger","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2855},{"endOffset":2941,"mention":"burger","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2935},{"endOffset":2969,"mention":"hot dog","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_dog"],"startOffset":2962}]}
