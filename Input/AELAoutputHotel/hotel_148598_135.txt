{"text":"Rio Mar was GREAT!! We booked our room on Priceline and we could not have been happier!! We loved the Wyndham and would definitely go back. I am very glad that I read the reviews before I went...by following some advice of others, it made our stay a great one. If you want a GREAT stay remember these suggestions: 1) Rent a car either at the airport (or online through Priceline\/Hotwire). We rented a full size for $19 per day unlimited mileage through Priceline and got a car from the budget rental at the airport. Do NOT wait to rent one from the hotel as it is ridiculously expensive. You will be so glad you have a car to go to restaraunts, stores, rainforest, other trips, etc... 2) Call ahead\/email the hotel and request an oceanview on the 6th or 7th floor...then confirm this when you check in. We did this and received a GREAT room with a BEAUTIFUL view. If you get a room on the 6th or 7th floor, you will be above the palm trees and have a direct view of the ocean...very nice. 3) Pick up a few groceries on the way (drinks, snacks,etc.)...the food\/drinks are $$$ and the rooms have a small refrigerator (really more like a large cooler) and plenty of cabinet space next to it. 4) Eat outside of the resort...there are 2 restaraunts up the hill with beautiful views (Ritchies and ?). Food just okay...atmoshpere is great. There are bakeries and small restaurants off Rt. 3, La Parilla (kiosk at Laquillo Beach) is really yummy. If you do these things, you will be very happy with your stay.Staff: Very friendly and very professional.Kids Club: Other reviews said it was more like a day care...I disagree. Although there were many kids at the resort while we were there, no one used the kids club except us. Our 3 year old surprisingly wanted to stay...and wanted to return the next day even though she was the only one there. When we picked her up, we saw why. While she was there for only 3 hours she had her hair braided with beautiful beads (she really looked cute), she made a butterfly with beads, she swam in the pool and played on the slide, she went to the beach, played on the play ground and they took a picture of her and she made a cute frame out of it with shells. She loved it. It is pricey, but worth it. They have 1\/2 day with lunch, full day with lunch, and night sitting...we only did 1\/2 day which was either 9-12 or 1-4.Beach: Great!! At first glance, I will admit that I was a little disappointed that the sand was brown and not white...but it is soft, with clear and calm water, many shells, and great for taking long walks.Pool: Great!! Water slide, plenty of chairs, large, and there are hammocks around and very comfortable cabana-type tents with cushioned lounges and fans above for cover. The grounds surrounding the pool are beautiful and lush. There is also a childern's playground. Rooms: Great!! Beautiful views, nice and clean rooms, wonderful large bath with great shower, comfortable beds, large flat screen tvs with many movie options, mini frig, balconies overlooking beautiful views of ocean or El Yunque rainforest.Food: $$ and not very great. My son ordered room service and it was priced typically for a nice hotel...but food not so great. The pastries, sandwiches, and ice cream were good at the coffee\/dessert shop next to the casino.We loved it! Go and see for yourself!!
