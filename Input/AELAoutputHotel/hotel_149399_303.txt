{"text":"Very disappointing - just too big! We stayed at MCT during tropical storm Noel - it rained solidly which is not a good start. This resort is huge. None of the beach\/pool bars near the rooms stay open after 7pm so to get food and drink you must travel up to the reception area which tis 13 minutes walking or you can get the train if it is not full. Bothare pretty miserable when it is pouring with rain. Forget getting dressed up if you are going to be soaked when you arrive. To play golf you have to leave your room an hour before your tee time as it takes 15 minutes to get to reception (possibly longer if the train is not nearby) and then there is a resort bus which only runs once an hour to the golf course. The first time we waited an hour but it still didn't come and then the next day when we tried again, on arrival at the golf club we were told we needed to have brought vouchers from the hotel - do not pass go do not collect 200... Nowhere was this explained to us even when we were booking tee times and 2 of the 3 groups on the bus had likewise made the same mistake, the other having made it the previous day.... The activities were pretty much nonexistent even before the rain as it was low season and they didn't even publish a sheet of daily activites and the club room was mostly closed. The golf course also closed due to flooding so there was not a lot going on, we were glad to get out and go to Sunscape the beach which was more our scene.
