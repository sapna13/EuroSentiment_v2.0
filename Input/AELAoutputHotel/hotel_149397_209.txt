{"text":"Amazing time at the Bavaro My boyfriend and I just got back from Punta Cana about a week ago....and we truly enjoyed our stay at the Bavaro Princess Resort  Spa. We were a little scared after having read some of the reviews here...but we were just amazed once we arrived. It was everything we hoped for and even more. It was our first time visiting the country, so we didn't really know what to expect. Thank God I studied Spanish for 6 years....that helped out A LOT (even though most employees there do speak some English). We booked through Apple Vacations and were very satisfied with their service from the very beginning. Arriving at the airport was a total culture shock (you have to see it for yourself), but you do have people there yelling Apple Apple to direct you to your bus which takes you to your resort. The whole process at the airport is kinda fast, but just go along with what everyone else is doing and you will be fine. In the bus, we had one of the Apple representatives gives us some do's and donts. He mentioned not to drink running water, how to say beer in Spanish (cervesa) and to try their local drink called Mamajuana (not Marijuana). :)Once we arrived at the resort, we had to wait about 30 minutes (which equals 60 Dominican Minutes---you'll hear about this) for our room to get ready. Once we got there, we were really pleased. The room was clean and spacious and that's all we asked for. Food: Do make dinner reservations to Sakura (chinese), Tanuki (japanese) and Gaucho (steak house). We really enjoyed all the food, especially the japanese!!!! Hispanola (the buffet restaurant at the lobby) was great. Yeah it took some time for our stomachs to get used to the food....but you really have a variety of things to choose from. The Gaucho is also open as a buffet for breakfast and lunch I believe and it is located at the beach. Pool: Thought it was great....lots of activities going on around there. A little too crowded at times but what can you do. Hint---if you get up a little earlier you can actually get a nice little hut or even one of the beds on the beach. But beware some people (crazy ones) get up at 5am to put their towels and reserve their spots on the pool\/beach. Entertainment: Loved all the night shows....after the shows they usually have a little party around the lobby area where people dance bachata, merengue and salsa. The entertainers just grab you randomly...so be ready to dance (don't worry they will teach ya...super nice guys and girls). Excursions: If you are looking to do any excursions I would def. recommend the Outback Safari. I believe it is about $80 per person...but it is worth every penny. It is an all day excursion (9-4) where you go and explore the country side and actually see how people live and work on a daily bases. You get to see how people make coffee, coconut oil, sugar, chocolate and most importantly MAMAJUANA. I truly learned a lot on this little Safari Trip. The tour guides are amazing. We had a guy named Danny and we called him Danny Boy. He was very knowledgable and fun. At the end of the excursion you get to boogie board at the most beautiful island called PARADISE ISLAND. You really have to see this for yourself....I could not believe my eyes!!! The water so blue....so clear!!!Overall this was a vacation we will never forget. We miss it so much....and in fact are planning on staying at the Bavaro in the future!!! For those who book with Apple....get to know Carlos and Luis (Apple Respresentatives) real well....they are very helpful especially if you are looking to book an excursion. Oh yeah one last thing....we did find a huge bug in our bathroom the night before we were leaving....however, you have to remember it's ALL INCLUSIVE BABY!!! hahahahYou are on a tropical island and you have to realize that!!! And don't forget to ignore the Royal guys who try to get you to buy time share and property...they are everywhere!!!YO AMO PUNTA CANA!!!
