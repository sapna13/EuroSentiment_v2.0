{"text":"A little worn  This is probably a good value for Barcelona. The room is large, with a large closet, drawers in the closet, safe, and large cupboards above the closet. There is a kitchen area in the room, with a sink, stove, cupboards above it all,  mini refrigerator, all enclosed with an armoire-type door. You would think that one wouldn't need the frig, but it was actually nice to have. I walked up and down the street looking for some sort of grocery or convenience store one night  finally found it to the left of the metro station. Thus, I got milk, salomi, cheese, juice, etc.  it was nice to put in the frig. The room had a full size bed, which was nice for a change in Europe, where most beds are twin size. The end table seemed built into the wall, like it was a part of the head board or something. There was a fold down table that was handy, and two chairs. Large windows opened up to the street and I found it to be quiet. There was a bidet in the bathroom  I rather tight squeeze, but a nice big tub, with a handheld shower. In the kitchen, there were dishes, utensils, a coffee pot, too. The room was very clean. It had a TV with several channels. The usual English CNN. It had and adjustable heater\/AC. It did seem a little worn and shabby, though  did not look like the website picture. There were a couple of cigarette burns on the bedspread. I think they were renovating some of the rooms. On the plus side, the staff were very nice  seemed to try really hard to accommodate their guests. In that regard, it was a proper hotel. There was a computer with internet access in the lobby, and even a printer, for guests to use. The staff seemd to try hard to be welcoming  answer questions, or give one a map to draw on and point things out. I took the Aeroporto Bus #1 from the airport to arrive there, for 4.05 Euro, to Plaza Catalunya. Then I took the metro 3 stops, I believe, to Fontanna. Exit and practically go straight down a street, several minute walk, and you will see 3 flags, and that is the hotel. I'm glad their website said to see the flags, because I got off, asked 2 metro attendants,  they said go to another metro stop. I disregarded their advise  walked down the street anyway, seeng the flags,  there was the hotel. I did not have a problem with getting to the hotel. The metro was a little stressful for me. I guess because I'm not used to taking a metro. There were homeless people there, sleeping, asking for change, or people singing or playing the guitar for money. It seemed like you had to go down, down, down into the metro  walk quite a ways. I had to ask somebody the first time I went  another time I went in the wrong direction  on the wrong metro line. After that I got it. You can buy 10 metro trips for something like 7 euro, or 1.30 euro per ticket. The metro machine was pretty easy to use. After I figured out that you could take a left from the hotel  a right down the main street, I thought that was better than the metro. I caught my hop-on, hop-off bus that way, and avoided the rather hot, busy metro, until I flew out. Plaza Catalunya is a happening place. People all the time. It's about a 20 minute walk from the hotel. As I'm sure it's already been posted, be careful about pickpocketers. I didn't have a problem, but there is so many people, crowed everywhere, especially in the metro tunnel, and Plaza C. that it seems easy to be pickpocketed. A mother  son traveler that I met on my tour to Montserrett said their hotel clerk told them to be careful as she had been robbed twice  she lived there! I'm sure, though, like everywhere, be careful, and take precautions. Oh yeah, there is nice shops, some tapas bars, and a couple of nice restaurants right around the corner from this hotel. (Again, take a left from the hotel, then a right in front of the metro station.)Overall, this is proper hotel, in a good location, easy to get to by the metro  the aeroporto bus, or walking, which is more enjoyable than the metro to get to things. It is in a nice area, too. Probably a solid value for Barcelona.
