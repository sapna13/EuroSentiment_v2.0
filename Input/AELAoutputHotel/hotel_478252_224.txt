{"text":"Generally Great - Some issues Stayed with wife (we are in 50's) and 2 daughters (20 and 16) at end of March 2008 in Principe side (Bavaro side is a mirror image). We have travelled Caribbean and Mexico every year for last 25 yrs or so, generally at all-inclusives. This is not 5 star in US sense, but pretty close for a Caribbean. It was pretty crowded, tho only an issue at peak beach time (in which case pools were less so) and at prime mealtime - don't get in way of a hungry tourist! Airport busy - attached by luggage guys (there are more than tourists - they try to rip the luggage out of your hand) but for a few bucks they get you to the right transport, so probably worth it. Stand in line to pay $10\/pp tourist card (in lieu of visa) charge - only cash.Plusses are: beautiful property (very well manicured); rooms large and clean (tho the usual Caribbean handiwork in tile, etc); room frig stocked daily (more stuff added if ask and tip); easy navigation on property (tho large, timely transport plentiful); huge buffet (decent for Crib, tho can get boring after a week - and any meat besides chicken is tough); good bar service; generally pleasant staff (as long as no complications of even the smallest kind - that throws them - and customer service in a US sense is inconceivable to tem; no animosity, they just don't get it).Negatives: reservation system for non-buffet is awful (no phone calls, place is emplty, won't let you in anyway without reservation); reservation for water sports (same poor practice - in person only, then stuff sits there while you watch when those reserving don't show); tennis courts poor shape and very far from rooms; nightly entertainment packed early so no room to go (some may be too risque for kids - typical european taste in dance...I have seen strippers with more clothes); people mark chairs at pool by 7 am, so none left by 9 am (against the rules, but no enforcement) tho the beach was a little better supplied with chairs; no elevators in 3 story buildings; vendors at mall in front of hotel severely harass shoppers; local and european men guests harassed my young daughters (they are beautiful, and somewhat used to stares in the US also, but would not go to beach or shop without me to help them fend off catcalls and followers; I did feel that all staff had the hand out for tips (I am not complaining, as they are poor, but its a fact).Other things noted on this site and true - there is a little topless on beach, but not much; the non-serving staff (cleaning ladies, maintenance, grounds) do not speak english tho servers at desk, bar and dining do fine; bar tenders will pay more attention if you tip a dollar every couple of drinks (take a roll of 50 $1.00); maids stock better with a few dollars tip a day; take an extra credit card as the room A\/C and all electrical power only works if you put your room key (or the credit type card you substitute in its place) in a slot by the room door; negotiate for trinket purchases (at least a third off asking price) at mall and beach vendors (not at the lobby stores - can get the same stuff at half price outside); bring lots of sunscreen (its very burning, tho not hot due to breeze).Other things seen on this site that were not true for our visit: not much cigarette smoking; food plentiful and decent; no crime (felt very safe - tho did lock valuables up in the $32\/week safe); lower number villas are farther from beach, not closer; no difference in regular room and Diamond; the fun staff do try to get activity going (bingo, aerobics, ping pong tournament, etc) despite the fact that many tourists (like me) have no interest - if you want to do something, you can; no bugs or mosquitos.Flight home (United) - mobbed by luggage guys again, but they helped get us to correct airline (very poor airport layout - could stand in wrong line for hours!); security slow and caribbean inefficient (they forgot to charge the $20 departure tax tho - yeah!); allow 2 hours at peak time.I will not go back, as there are other places in the world (I have only gone to one place 2x - Aruba!). Despite some wrinkles with checkin and a couple of small, stupid and frustrating service problems, its worth the trip for the price.
