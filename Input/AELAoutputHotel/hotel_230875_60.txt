{"text":"Nice Hotel, good location I would recommend this hotel, the location is excellent, within easy walking distance of most major attractions. The room was nice, spacious and modern and the service excellent. Our airport shuttle bus, booked via the hotel, failed to show on our last day but once we'd mentioned it to the front office staff a private taxi arrived within minutes and took us directly to the airport. Breakfast was OK although I have to say that despite a sign offering to cook omlettes, there never seem to be anyone around to do it. I also expected freshly cooked pancakes rather than help yourself mini ones which looked as though they'd been hanging around for a while.There is a nice relaxing bar on the ground floor which is a good place for a nightcap. All that apart, here are some recommendations in the area:-Kapitein Zeppos in a little alley off Grimburgwal-great international food. Spanish tapas, Belgium mussels, lamb tagine and terrific fish mousse. The place itself has a lovely old fashioned feel. The waiter service was impeccable and the food faultless.Museum Amstelkring, 40 Oudezijds Voorburgwal. There's a hidden church here in the loft conversion. Fascinating place.Dutch Resistance Museum on Plantage Kerklaan (near the zoo). A gem of a museum which deserves more than the 150 or so customers I was told they receive in an average day. The Brouwhuis, 6-8 Klovenierburgwal-excellent white and blonde beers brewed on the premises. The food looked OK as well although we didn't get round to trying it.Hope this helps.
