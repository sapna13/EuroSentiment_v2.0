{"text":"Watch out for the Incidential Fees $100 per Day! No Warning I went on a family vacation, the hotel was nice, employees were nice, housekeeping came everyday, beach was beautiful, pool was pretty. Casino was small but when you can get a waitress they will gvie you free drinks and a hot sandwich! I had a city room over looking the main entrance. Comfortable beds, large towels, shampoo, conditioner, body lotion, shower cap, shoe shine cloth, soap. Iron, hair dryer, fridgem coffee machine. In room safe, cable TV.Only thing missing was a microwave.However, you are not told when you book the room that they will charge a hold on your credit card $100.00 incidential fee for each day that you stay. I had 2 rooms so that was $800.00! they put on hold. I tried to argue with them stating that they were tying up $$ that I was planing on using during my stay. I told them that I had booked it directly from Intercontential and there was no mention of this fee only the 22% tax and resort fee on top of your room fee. They went on to explain that that's what all the hotels do and there was nothing that they could do because when they put through you credit card it automatically adds the $100 a day. Needless to say my credit card was short a couple of hundred so it was not approved and I had to give them another credit card or cash for the difference or they could not give me the room! As I was checking out 4 young ladies were checking in and to their dismay they were being told about the $100\/day inc. fee, they too had to scrabble for the extra cash or else they could not get the room. I will be calling the hotel's main office to put in a formal complaint regarding this practice. It should be disclosed so that customers know that they will need extra money to be floating in a hold until your trip is over.We had 2 blackouts while we were there, one that was pre- scheduled by the power company between 10 am -2pm. And another one unanounced at about 8 am and lasted an hour. I was disappointed with the area in general. I am of Puerto Rican descent and it pains me to see such an unkept area. The streets needed repairs, there were abandon buildings in the area, your local homeless people, only one authentic puerto rician restaurant in the area. No Puerto Rican bakeries, or Pastellio \/Alcapuria places in the area. With all the five star hotels in the areas you would think that they would invest in the surrounding community so that more people would come back not only for their hotel but for the culture itself. Tip: When you get to the aiport look for the tourism kisko, they wear orange shirts and they will make you a ticket for a cab to take you to the hotel they give you a fair price from the airport. However you have to watch some of the cab drivers, some just charge you $1 per checked luggage and some will charge you for every piece of luggage or carry on baggage. Same about of bags, I paid $4.00 extra coming and $8.00 going. Overall, the hotel was nice, staff was nice, the beach was awesome- clear water, some waves (watch small children-waves are sometime rough), it was warm, no fish just some sand dollars, no shells in the water most days. Go early to get a free beach chair, once they are gone they rent chairs for $4.00 a day, but they take them back at 6 pm. , so be prepared to sit on the sand if you want to stay pas 6 pm. Pool has plenty of chairs and cabanas, water fall is cute, goes up to 6 '6. Several sections to hang out in. Use lots of sunscreen, sun doesn't feel that hot but you will get burned fast!Go to Mi Casita for Puerto Rican food, range $8.00-$24 for dinner. Go to Walgreens for water, soda, snacks, coffee, slurppies. Pueblo supermarket is behind Embassy Suite hotel about a 8 minute walk. Fast food, Church's Chicken is pretty good, there's a Pizza Hut that is good and clean. Burger King, Wendy's, KFC is also there. The mini mart across the street is not well stock but for an emergency they'll do. This is still mi Isla Bonita, they just need to spruce it up a bit. with the help of the surrounding hotels.
