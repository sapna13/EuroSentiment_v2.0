{"text":"Average, not great Lovely foyer  location hides an average hotel.On the whole, this place wasn't really that bad. However, a combination of a lot of little things put us off going back. Have a read of my pluses\/minuses and see what you think.Good things about the hotel1. Location is awesome: Close to MRT (subway), major shops, food, taxi2. The free broadband was excellent. Fast, low latency. I was using the supplied Ethernet cable which I would recommend over wireless.3. The taxi guy out the front was good.4. 'What can I do for you' service was OK, fairly prompt when requesting ice.5. The king size bed was super comfy (pillows were not heaven for me or my wife).6. Was upgraded to the Deluxe Corner room which is slightly larger than Deluxe (thank you for that).Bad things about the hotel1. Fair is fair, the free minibar is actually free, no catches when it comes to paying.However, there is still a catch!A normal minibar depending where you stay would contain:2 to 8 snacks4 to 10 mini spirit bottles2 to 4 juices2 to 6 beers (usually 2-3 different types)This absolutely free minibar contains: 0 Snacks0 mini spirit bottles2 juices2 small cans of Tiger beerAltogether that is about 8 SGD worth of drinks. It is NOT false advertising, but definitely deceptive.2. To top off the free mini-bar being a dud, it wasn't even stocked consistently. I drank my juice the first two days and was then hooked on having a nice morning juice, the next 7 days after that it was never restocked. Poor.3. The lighting in the room we stayed in (Deluxe Corner) was poor, they need reading lights so you can set the mood for reading\/tv\/etc. You turn on the overhead bed lights are you blinded by giant Halogen floodlights.4. Let's face it, even though you don't go on holiday to watch TV, sometimes you end up watching it while you wait for a place to open or while relaxing in the room.Free to air offerings were fine. Pay movies were non-existent even though we wanted to watch something.5. Hotel has those giant 'king sized' pillows. I asked for foam instead, they took two goes for them to bring something that was actually foam. Still huge, however sufficient to let me and my wife to get some sleep. Could have been a better experience.6. Shower, we didn't enjoy, needle spray, needs a shower curtain or door, water went all over the floor.7. An ice machine would be nice so I don't have to call up when I run out, proper drinking glasses rather than toothbrush holder glasses also.8. The maid forgot to give us a spare toilet roll on more than one occasion (we did run out and had to phone them).9. Room service isn't just expensive like most hotels, it is insanely expensive. Especially for Singapore where you can get a nice meal from a hawker centre for $3.
