{"text":"Vacationers Beware We stayed at this hotel in October, our room was dirty. We hit a heat wave, asked the hotel to fix the a\/c and they never responded. One morning at 1:30am we found a strange man in our room. The hotel never explained how this happened, we asked for a manager and for the entire stay (6nights) never ever spoke to a manager. The hotel never apologized for this. There is no way to secure your hotel room from inside. After this we put chair and luggage against the door at night. The hotel staff was not helpful at all. We asked to arrange for a car to the airport the morning of our departure at 3:30am, and said we want to put the charge on our hotel bill. When we checked with the front desk the next morning, they confirmed everything had been arranged. The night before we left, we stopped at the front desk to settle our bill, and found out they had not secured a car for us, and that we would need to take a taxi in the morning. At this point, we no longer had sufficient amount of euros, the banks had closed and it was too far to walk (and somewhat unsafe) to go down to the tourist section and find a change place that was open. We had no choice but to exchange dollars at the hotel at a terrible exchange rate in order to pay the taxi to the airport. Housekeeping replaced items each day in the bathroom, but every day we needed to call and ask for one thing or another that they did not replace. Sufficient clean towels for two, aways an issue. Over all, poor service, and it appeared they could care less about vacationing guests. Business men most likeley did fine, as they would be preoccupied, and are there for one or two nights then gone.
