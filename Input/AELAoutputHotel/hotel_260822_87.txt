{"text":"Fabulously friendly My sister and I stayed at Il Perseo for 5 nights from the 9th of January. I had fortunately read the reviews on Tripadvisor so knew that the entrance to gain access to the hotel was not very well signed or attractive but that once you got to the thrid floor all would be well. My sister's reaction to the entrance was classic as I forgot to tell her but she was reassured when we go to the front desk!!!!! Il Pereo is fantastically located, exit the building, turn right and you can see the Duomo, and to reach it takes less than a couple of minutes, absolutely fantastic. The hotel itself is informal, nicely minimalistically decorated, very clean and while the bathroom was small it's not like you spend a large amount of time in one. If you are in Florence and want to spend lots of time in a bathroom then stop wasting your time and just go home. The beds were comfortable but the pillows a bit hard but that is just a personal thing. Breakfast was simple but good and the happy hour a nice way to end the day, before heading out for dinner later. We could buy large bottles of water at a very cheap price and fill the smaller ones we used during the day and you could get a good coffee and tea any time. The staff especially Lara were fantastic. They were helpful, with tips about restaurants, how to get to where you wanted to go, what to see or assisting with booking side trips. I would recommend this hotel. It is not luxurious nor is it a bland, everything is exactly the same as you find with chain hotels. It is good value, personal and friendly with a location you cannot really beat. Try it, I am sure you will like it.
