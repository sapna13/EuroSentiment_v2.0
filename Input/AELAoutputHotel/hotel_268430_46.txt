{"text":"Nice place for a quick getaway I booked this hotel through my vacation club (Royal Holiday). I went for a quick 4 night getaway. I left the kids and my husband at home and went with my girlfriend just to relax. It was perfect for out purposes. It was close to the airport and on a beautiful beach.The room was a little on the small side, but nicely decorated. It would have felt a little cramped with more than 2 people, but it was fine for the two of us. We had a room with 2 queen beds. I guess a king room would leave more area to walk around or sit. Our view was a mixed bag. We had a partial view of the ocean, which was hindered by a view a roof with, what I think were air conditioner compressors. The noise from the airplanes was definetly audible, but we were not bothered by them. However, on Saturday night, I could hear a band playing in my room (320) until 3:00 am.. I know there was a party in the hotel that night, so that may have been unusual.The public areas of the hotel were very nice. It was open and airy looking. The pool area was beautiful. There were plenty of lounge chairs. The beach was beautiful too, but when we were there it was so windy, we couldn't sit there, because the sand was blowing all over the place. The workers by the pool and beach were very helpful and friendly. In general, all of the employees were.We ate at Salsa Restaurant in the hotel one night and it was delicioius. I still can't stop thinking about their Plantain Soup! We tried Metropol nearby and didn't think it lived up to its wonderful reviews. Lupi's Mexican Grill was very good, also in walking distance. Other than that, there is not much near the hotel. All in All, the hotel was perfect for what we wanted. I would not stay here more than a few days, because there isn't much to do. But all we wanted to do is relax and this was the perfect place to do it.
