{"text":"Fantastic I just returned from Thanksgiving in Paris and stayed at the Hotel Littre in the Montparnasse district. I booked my vacation with FranceVacations.net as I have done many times in the past. Usually I stay in 3 star hotels but I was talked into trying this hotel at a very interesting rate, so I accepted. My package also included the buffet breakfast which was well appreciated, it was good to start the day with some protein. It will be hard for me now to go back to 3 star properties having experienced the luxury of a 4 star. The staff were marvellous and the hotel was everyting I expected in a four star hotel, good size rooms and spotlessly clean. Being new to this area, I was pleasantly surprised by the enormous choice of restaurants nearby. La Couple, The Select and The Dome, all famous turn of the (last) century restaurants were within 5 minutes walk and not horribly expensive especially if you do the fixe prix lunch (3 courses 30 euros). Yes, the Montparnasse tower, the one and only skyscraper in Paris (and the tallest building in Europe) is nearby and ugly, but when given lemons one should make lemonade. If you enter the lobby and take the elevator to the 56th floor there is a restaurant open all day called Le Ciel de Paris and it is wonderful. You are in fact looking down on the Eiffel Tower and the Seine as it curves around Paris. I had a 6 euro pot of tea (inc. tax and tip) and they brought me a little plate of cookies and chocolates and I sat there happily for an hour looking over Paris with no one hassling me or rushing me. It sure beat waiting in line at the Eiffel Tower and the view was much nicer as I could SEE the tower from where I was. The hotel is in a great shopping area and the Bon Marche department store is another 10 minute walk as is the Latin Quarter. I found this area much more authentic and less touristy than the Latin Quarter and the prices in the restaurants reflect it. This is my new, favorite hotel and neighborhood, thanks to France Vacations, they always steer me in the right direction.
