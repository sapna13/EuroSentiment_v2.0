{"text":"Great Location; Wait until construction is over. My husband and I stayed at the Condado Plaza for 3 nights pre cruise. The location couldn't have been better. It was close to Everything!! We were Very hesitant to stay here due to some of the reviews we read and with all of the remodeling taking place. I called three times before our arrival to make sure the stories were all the same; construction only took place between 9am √à√\u2020\u2022?6pm, and there was an empty floor left between the occupied floors and the construction floors. When we checked in, the staff was pleasant; the man who checked us in was young and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a lot of information on the sites around us, but was able to refer us to the concierge desk. We had a long day of travel and decided to call it a night and meet up with the concierge the next day. We headed across the bridge to our room. We were met with construction. It was ok though; everything was blocked off as it should be and looked relatively safe. We got to our room, it was what we expected, a room in major need of renovation, but it was clean and seemed well put together. That night, we were awoken several times to things dropping outside the hotel. At 2am I went out on our balcony only to find construction workers dropping heavy items down to the first floor to load in dumpsters. The noise continued for most of the night. So much for only doing construction between 9am and 6pm! We spoke with a lady at the front desk the next morning who told us to check in around 6pm and she would move us to the newly renovated tower; for the same government rate! We were thrilled and surprised. A lot of the reviews state how rude and not helpful the staff are; we were pleasantly surprised! The newly renovated room was outstanding. They really have done a nice remodel to the new rooms.Areas of concern:The concierge desk needs major help. We wanted to book the biolumiscent bay trip and nobody could tell us how\/when to do it. We were told that there probably weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ enough people going so we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go. We asked if this was confirmed, and the guy just kept telling us, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ plan on going. We went over to the Hilton Cribe (across the bridge) to have a drink and ran into their travel desk\/concierge. I guess that is why they are at the Hilton, over the top nice and they were able to book our tour for us. We found the folks at the concierge desk at the Condo Plaza seemed more interested in each others plans for the night than actually helping the hotel guests. Restaurants:Please, if you do not have a certain restaurant within your hotel, Take Down the Sign!!! The only restaurants within the hotel are an Italian restaurant and Tony Roma√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ although everything around the hotel shows they have four restaurants!! The restaurants leave something to be desired. We tried them both, and I think we would have rather starved. There are other great options right across the bridge or in the Condo area outside the hotel and to the left. Overall, once all the renovation was complete, we may consider coming back if the rate was reasonable.
