{"text":"Loved the staff and great location if you want to step away from the tourists I had a great stay at the Langham Place in Mog Kuk for three nights. I wanted to step away from the touristy side of Hong Kong and see a lively, local area but stay in a nice hotel. If that is what you are looking for than this hotel is THE place to be, especially with its access to the mall, great restaurants and just steps from the subway. The hotel is modern and upscale, and the staff is friendly and helpful.The hotel handled my early check-in and late departure easily. The folks in the lobby were always nice and chatty and the concierge answered all of my questions flawlessly and quickly. I was by myself, and a bit lonely because of it, but one staff woman really made me feel at home and who i nearly wanted to hug by the end of my stay! There is also a really fabulous in-room data service that gives you wonderful access to weather and other information.I really enjoyed the dim sum at Ming Court and there was a lovely lounge singer, generous drinks, and good food at the Portal. I didn't have time to check out too many facilities but the pool, gym and spa facilities were wonderful from what I can tell.The hotel offered a short tour of a few of the local markets which I enjoyed and which led to explore more of them! Here you are very near to a number of great markets for trinkets and to see the local culture! The mall attached to the hotel was decent, and the hotel is very convenient because you are just a few steps from the subway which is so efficient in Hong Kong .
