{"text":"Will definitely return We had an excellent trip to the Victoria Plaza in May. Having previously stayed in the GResham Memphis down by the Museums (which was absolutely fine) we decided to try somewhere nearer the station this time - and we couldn't have picked anywhere closer. The proximity to the station meant that we had a very quick and hassle free journey from the airport. The hotel's public areas are lovely and the staff extremely helpful which is extremely welcoming after the hustle and bustle of the street outside. Our room (134)looked lovely and had the biggest, comfiest bed ever but it was very very warm and dark - felt a bit like we were down by the boiler room! We probably should have asked for a move , but didn't really want any hassle . We just kept the air conditioning on all night !The pool is tiny but was very welcome after a hard day pounding the streets and the bar was lovely for a couple of drinks when you get back at nightWe didn't have breakfast at the hotel , but there are plenty of places nearby which are fine. We did have a lovely breakfast at a Grand Cafe at the station (on the platform next to Burger King ) apparently it used to be the first class passenger waiting room. Well worth the walk across the road! If you stay at the Victoria you should also take advantage of being so near the station - take a trip out of town. We went to Haarlem and had a really lovely day wandering round the town.We'll definately consider staying here next time we pop over to Amsterdam.
