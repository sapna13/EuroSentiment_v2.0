{"text":"Generally good (but not in a Junior Suite) I've stayed at the Park a number of times and it has improved greatly over the years and is certainly one of my favourite mid-budget hotels in the city.Its location near the Leidseplein makes it a great location for the museums and pubs, jazz bars and restaurants (so you can walk back to the hotel at night) and close to the tram network for quick and cheap journeys to the rest of the city.The hotel is generally good, everything works well and it is clean and well maintained.BUT... due to having to make a late booking I ordered a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022√òunior Suite√à√\u2020\u2022?which was disappointing. The room was large but due to having one tiny window in the corner it was dark and the layout made it look half built. The bathroom was a good size but VERY dark (making shaving a very difficult matter). There were three small chairs where there should have been a settee, a good bed but in a really strange place, a lack of sockets meaning you have to put the kettle on a little bed-side shelf, a TV which you have to turn around without knocking over and an overall lack of space. In fact they have somehow managed to take a decent size room and made it feel very cramped.The problem is that when the hotel was being renovated they expanded into other buildings. This room was not designed, it just happened to be the best they could do with the available space and they made a very bad job of it. Rather than classing it as a double (which would have been fine) they tried to do some clever marketing and make out this was a superior room. I feel a little ripped-off. ","annotations":[]}
