{"text":"Excellent location! Great beach We stayed at OW from Sunday, April 29 to Wednesday, May 2 after a week long cruise on the Pride of Aloha with Norweigan cruise lines. My husband and I were on our honeymoon. It was our first time to Hawaii. From what I read on the message boards, I think the worst room was given to us, #900. It was not only on the side with the fans from the Cheesecake Factory building, but it was also right beside the service elevator and regular elevators, so we would hear them go up and down all the time. I wanted to switch rooms but my husband said we'd make do because he didn't want to move all of our things again. It was a really nice size room. We did have a partial view of the ocean and a nice balcony (just had to ignore the fans a few floors below and across the way). We got some great night time shots there of the streets and buildings below, so that was good. One problem we did encounter was the awful squeak of the service elevator hallway door. It drove me nuts and I wore my earplugs the first night. I wrote on their comment card the next day what they could do to make my stay better was to oil the squeaky door hinges. The next day it was done! No more squeaking so I was mighty impressed by that. I was also impressed with the free long distance to the U.S. and Canada (yes we're from Canada and it was absolutely free from Hawaii no hidden charges) and the internet was free, although slow at times. We brought our own laptop. We also got postcards in our package from the front desk and they said they would mail them anywhere in the world. So I took advantage of that too and mailed my grandmother back home (good for people who are not on the internet). Yes the walls are thin, but I haven't been to many busy hotels where I haven't heard noise from people next door. Having a fridge was great too. We bought bottles of wine from the store downstairs and fit nicely.The main pluses of this hotel are the view, it's proximity to the wonderful beach and also Diamond head (So pretty at sunset). We hiked from the hotel to the summit on our last day. It was a long walk all uphill. Took about 2 hours to get to the crater. We took the bus back which runs every half hour or so from the base (We'd had enough exercise). You can also take the city bus from Kuhio St one block over and pay $2 to go to the Dole Plantation or the north shore. It's a long ride 1 1\/2 to 2 hours, but it saves so much money. You can get a bus map from the ABC store. You can snorkel just around the backyard of the hotel and see many different fish. One guy I talked to even saw giant sea turtles there the day before. We went to the International marketplace across the street many times. Great place for souvenirs. ABC Stores have the best prices for Mauna Loa macadamia nuts. All in all it is a great place to go. Keep in mind that Waikiki is a busy city. Not a relaxing, peaceful place for vacation.We recommend it, but request a room away from the fans if noise bothers you.
