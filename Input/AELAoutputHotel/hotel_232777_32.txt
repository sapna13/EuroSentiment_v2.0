{"text":"ideal hotel Stayed at hotel for 5 nights and really don't have any complaints at all.Flew to Girona with Ryanair direct bus service to Barcelona bus station is right outside exit door of arrival hall (ticket window just to right of door 21 Euro return). Journey takes about 1hr15mins in fairly light traffic, taxi from bus station to hotel 7Euros (11 Euros for the return journey).Our room was adequate size (noticed room next door was very small) good bathroom with hairdryer, kettle and cups provided but you have to buy tea,coffee and milk from the hotel bar(either take your own or there is a small supermarket right next to the hotel).Breakfasts couldn't be faulted, well worth going BB as I think they cost 17Euro each to buy.Ate in hotel restaurant first night, meal ok but when the waitress asked if I wanted chips or vegetables I went for the health option veg expecting potatoes but only got carrots and courgettes so ask for both !! cost for two courses and a couple of drinks 38 euros for two. Sheet' s changed twice and fresh towels daily and room very clean.Barcelona Bus Turistic city tour buses highly recommended but get very busy,cheaper if you book on line before you go 2 consecutive days 23.40 euros adult ,just take your email voucher to tourist information at Pl. Catalunya (large square 5 minutes walk from the hotel where tour buses and the Barcelona Airport bus leave from), to get your tickets and book of money off vouchers.Metro station 'Universitat' just around corner from hotel, very easy to use,modern clean and trains run every few minutes. Lines are numbered and colour coded,ticket machines touch screen just touch Union Jack flag for English translation 1.30 Euro flat rate for single journey but two day passes available.We also went to Montserrat about 1hr 30min by train from Barcelona,a large monastery and church perched on a mountain top.Tickets cost 20.90 euros adult and included Metro to rail station,train fare and cable car up the mountain worth doing if you have time but there isn't a lot to see when you get there. Cafes are expensive so you might want to take drinks and packed lunch.Buses on return to Girona airport very busy I would allow at least a couple of hours travelling time prior to check in to be safe.Girona is a modern airport with two duty free shops (one small another larger one further into the departure lounge) with a good selection of booze and cigarettes.
