{"text":"Great resort! We had a wonderful two week vacation at Riu Palace Macao.This was our second time at this resort and we enjoyed iteven more than the first time! The kids (7 years old) had a great time and are already asking when we are going to go back. - Beach. Never crowded and it has both sunny and shaded areas. The shade is provided by the beautiful palm trees. There is alway a breeze from the ocean, so it never feels too hot. It is a perfect place to relax with a good book or have a nap.The waiter is always roaming around, so drinks are easy to get.There is a hut nearby where you can get massages, which both me and my wife took advantage of and enjoyed greatly.- Staff and service. The staff is simply outstanding. Everyone here seem to enjoy their work and it shows. They are always smiling and try to make you feel special. - Rooms. We did not have any problems with AC or moist bedding that some people have complained about. The AC worked fine and the room was very clean. We asked for extra bedding sheets for the kids and they brought them right away, though the next day the maid took them away, and when we called to ask for them again, they brought a whole bed instead - talk about the language barrier! We also asked for extra water (you have to use bottled water to drink and brush teeth) many times and it was always provided.- Entertainment. There is mini disco that the kids really enjoyed.Johny does an excellent job with Bingo, always drawing plenty of laughs from the audience. We saw a couple of shows (International and Michael Jackson) and liked them. - Food. We ate mostly at the buffet. There were plenty of choices and I especially enjoyed the seafood - calamari, grouper, salmon, shrimp, were really good. The sparkling wine is really good and can become addictive. I was having about 5 glasses per day toward the end of the second week. I did not like the red or white wines. The beer was good. The deserts were excellent, make sure to try the stewed bananas: put a couple on top of some ice cream (you'll thank me later) Also, don't forget the fruits, the choices are mostly limited to whatever grows locally, but they taste much better then what we get here in Canada. - We ate lunch at the Caribe Grill beach bar, couple times. The view and breeze from the ocean makes this place really awesome. Also, they offer burgers and hot dogs for lunch for those who need their fix of junk food.- Drinks. I found most mixed drinks to be pretty bad. If you enjoy a great Marguerita or a Pina Colada, sadly you are not gonna get it here. Most drinks are made in kind of a big slushy machine, as opposed to a mixer. The bartender just adds liquor to it and here you go. That said, my wife and kids enjoyed virgin pina coladas very much.Overall the vacation was excellent and we are definitely going to come back in the furture!
