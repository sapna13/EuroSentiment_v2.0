{"text":"Dissapointed in hotel, ammenities  I recognize that a 4 star hotel in Europe is often not a 4 star hotel in the US, sometimes not even close, as is the case with the Michelangelo, where most of the money was apparently spent on the lobby are bar area. For starters, despite Hotwire listing it as being centrally located, it is roughly a mile from the start of the touristy area, so despite another (obviously very fast walking) reviewer claiming it was 10 minutes to things, I found it to be irritating, as there are very few shops or restaurants anywhere around the hotel.Secondly the hotel made a lot of claims in their literature which simply weren't true. satillite TV means about 12 channels, the only one of which was in English being CNN. They offerred a pay movie system similar to many hotels, with about 5 movies in English, but during our 6 day stay, trying to purchase at all times of day and night (when we were tired or bored or longing to hear something other than CNN), at least on 20 different occasions, the system always said system unavailable. When we inquired with the generally aloof staff, they said their system was like a VCR and when others are watching movies it is unavailable. Well they must have 1 VCR and 1 copy of each movie, as we certainly tried our damnest to watch one.The airconditioner was quite loud, so much so I usually turned it off at night as it would wake me up. Also the carpet they have, both on the floors and as a type of wainscotting on the walls was badly faded in part, and had numerous places where it was stained in a splatter sort of pattern. The tiny shower (I know, fairly typicaly in Italy especially) was made worse by it having a shower curtain rather than a glass door, which didn't stay put when showering and tended to pull inward and stick all over your body. We also ordered room service one night, which was not inexpensive, and it arrived fairly timely (about 25 minutes) but cold.Now, it's not all bad. The free breakfast was good, the beds and pillows very comfortable, and the rooms generally clean. I also know I nitpicked a lot too, but for the money, there are better hotels to be had. If you are a local, or an Italian business person visiting on business, and have a car (they have a garage and there's a pay lot across the street too) then this might well be the place for you. For tourists, familes, etc. I would not recommend this place at all, as you will waste a lot of time walking and will find the ammenities frustrating.
