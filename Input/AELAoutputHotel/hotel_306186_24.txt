{"text":"Not great I have just finished a three night stint (on business) at this hotel and I have to say that it is a place with some problems. After reading some of the reports here noise problems on the lower floors, I specifically asked for something high up when the booking was made. On arrival, check-in was pretty quick and I was duly allocated a room on the 15th floor. The room itself was OK. It was on the larger size with a big bed and a microscopic bathroom. The bathroom, however, seemed to be the cause of my problems. The noise that the plumbing makes (all though the night) is horrendous. My own shower water gargled away for ages after the shower had finished, but worse still the drainage pipes from the upper floors must run directly past my room and made a constant racket all night long.The lobby of the hotel smells overpoweringly of lemon. I found the aroma quite off putting each time that I passed through.Breakfast on the second floor (you get little blue vouchers for each day of your stay) was adequate but only just. The food laid out was quite basic. The made-to-order omelettes were good but I found that I had to wait a long time for them to be cooked. I was staying on my own at the hotel and had to share tables at breakfast each day (the eating area is not that large). This was OK for me but might out others off.The hotel itself is located right at the end of Orchard Road. Returning late at night was always a bit of an adventure. A number of 'street ladies' seems to work in the area and I was accosted for business on several occasions. This was generally non-threatening but could be off putting, especially for families.Overall, it was an OK stay, but nothing more. The bed was comfy, but the room was expensive and I expected better.
