{"text":"Don't stay here! We were on a 3 week trip to visit family in Australia. On the last night of the trip we flew in from Hobart and arrived in Sydney to spend the last night of our trip near the airport for our flight out the next day. I called the hotel to arrange for the shuttle bus. I told them where we were (Terminal 2) and the guy said OK and that the shuttle bus would be by at 11:20. No other instructions were provided.11:20 came and no shuttle bus. I called the hotel again and was told (by a different person) that we had to go to the shuttle bus stop. I was informed that the last shuttle was at 11:20 but it hadn't left the airport yet. I asked where the shuttle bus stop was. Got a really vague √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√òhere's a U you need to go stand by√à√\u2020\u2022?before being put permanently on hold. Some nice passerby finally showed us where the shuttle bus stop was but it soon became apparent that we had missed the last shuttle. I tried repeatedly to call the hotel again and they wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ answer. We finally decided to take a taxi and there was a huge line for them. While in line I called the hotel again (I was very upset by this time) when the girl finally answered I asked her if someone would at least be there at the desk to check us in if and when we got there. I also told her I was NOT IMPRESSED with the service I had gotten so far. When we finally got there and got checked in we received no apology for the 'miscommunication' . The room had paper thin walls √à√\u2020\u2022?we could hear the people next door showering like they were in our own bathroom. You could hear the people above walking around and the people in the hallway were loud and clear too. Easily the worst place we stayed the entire trip.
