{"text":"WONDERFUL Vacation! Great Time Golfing! I'm a little late with my review as we traveled to the Barcelo Palace in April. My husband and I are late 30's early 40's and were looking for a beach\/golf getaway. We got exactly what we were looking for.What we liked- Easy check-in; no wait; hospitality cocktail upon arrival- Service and PeopleLoved our maid; she had 4 chiildren and enjoyed the school supplies we left for her kids The staff was extremely nice. Keep in mind they work very long hours and don't make a lot of money. - FoodWent to the Seafood restaurant twice for all-u-can-eat Lobster Went to the Mexican buffet twice -- loved the fresh made tacos and guacamole We discovered the restaurant at the Beach and ate lunch their almost every day. Pick your own fish or meat and grilled to perfection while you wait.(We started skipping breakfast and went to the Grill for lunch)I'm not big on Buffet's but their's was good. Fresh smoothies and omeletes in the morning and fresh pasta at night.- GolfWe added golf to our package for a little more. I played 3 days and my husband played 4 days. We met a couple from Canada the first night and played golf with them a couple of times - that added to the fun. We brought our clubs; We called the club house each morning and they picked us up at our bldg with a golf cart; It's no Jack Nicklaus course, but its beautiful and we had a lot of fun. I believe we just payed for the cart rentals each day.- ToursOnly did the Segways; I highly recommend it if you've never done it.The beach is absolutely beautiful. Palm trees and white sand -- if you are in the mood for quiet, go to the Palace beach. If you are in a party mood and feel like dancing or playing volleyball, walk a litle ways down the beach to the Beach Resort.-Needs improvementOur room did have a very musty smell and I had wished I brought air freshener. The room was spacious, but definitely dated. The rooms are much larger than the rooms at the other Barcelo resorts in PC. We paid $24US for Internet for the week; We also paid a little extra for more TV channelsI would recommend this resort.
