{"text":"Ecellent Currency  accommodationBooked the Ocean Bavaro Spa  beach resort as a 50th birthday present for my wife. Having little knowledge of the Dominican Rep I was alittle concerned as to the standard of service, as everything I read indicated that there was a big difference between the star ratiung as compared with the UK. I was advised by the travel agent to take a combination of US dollars  Dominican Curreny paso, wrong. My advice is just to take the US dollars, as everything is priced  quoted in dollars. We arrived late on Thursday the 17th after an uneventful flight. I booked only a standard room through First Choice (they only have rooms on the ground floor of this resort). As it was my wife birthday I decided to get an upgrade  luckily they had the honeymoon suit available for an additional $420 (√ä√£¬¢210) which I payed (you should haggle !) . I was not disappointed. The room was excellent, overlooking the beach on the second floor with a jacuzzi.FoodThey have several resturaunts for you to choose from, Japanese, Brazillian, Spanish, Mexican, Italian. I found the spanish to be the best of them, ensure you book an early seating (18:00) although all resturants except the Brazilian I found to be of a good standard.Snack BarThe snack bar, is the main eating area  has a wide selection to suit most palets. When you first visit the snack bar, make friends with your waiter  try  find out if they will be on duty for the rest of your stay, if so give them a good tip (couple of dollars)  keep on going back to that area of the snack bar, you will always get excellent service as soon as you arrive.Cafe BarYou must visit the cafe bar which serves an excellent range of coffee,  is very cool in the evening, try the Mocha its excellentThe BeachEnsuring you get shade on the beach will require you to get up early circa 07:00  do as everyone else does  put your towels on the sun lounger of your choice, there are not very many canopies to take shade so if you have young children  want to stay on the beach all day this is a must. If you like to get involved with the beach activities sit close to the DJ stand  they will pull you into every activity they do, from the Samba, beach games, beach darts  a whole host of other activities.Things to Check Before You BookWeather, check you are not booking in the hurricane seasonDon't book an expensive room, try  upgrade on you arrival, please note you may not be successful, but it is cheaper to upgrade on site.Beware of the guys trying to sell you holidays, its not as good as it sounds.ExcurtionsI went on the outback safari  was surprised at the level of knowledge  passion the guides have for the country. Its an excellent trip  well worth the money. Deep sea fishing at $109 circa √ä√£¬¢55 was good although there is no gurantee of catching as anglers will know, but it is exciting ^ if you get a take, it is amazing.I was told that a visit to Saona island was well worth the mony although there was little or no shade on the beach, so be aware.SummaryI would recommend the Ocean Bavaro Spa  Beach resort anyone looking for a relaxing holiday, with no stress, good beach  with I think is an excellent choice of food. The evening entertainment is Ok with the entertainment team working very hard to make you stay enjoyable, its a place I will be re-visiting !
