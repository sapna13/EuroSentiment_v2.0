{"text":"I read reviews like this but didn't listen you better!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't waste your time and hard earned money in this dump.The food stunk the drinks were so horrible that my friend and I went to the local grocery store to buy Grey Goose and Stoly's just so we could feel like we were drinking real alcohol and not alcohol flavored juice. I asked for premiuim brand liquor and nobody had it and don't believe that if you go there and think if you tip good your gonna get it because you will not . I went for about $700.00 in tips in one week just because i felt sorry for those poor fools and didn't get any top shelf .I got good service but I believe only because I gave a tip to everybody and their mother. The food was horrible.The activities were even worse they never tell you when there going to do something,especially for the kids. My wife even told one of the people who was in charge of activities and they did nothing. this place is not very kid friendly.Then they have these nights when they allow these vendors to come in and sell all kinds of junk. To me it was one big BEG-FEST it was very annoying.I'm from New York I know about pan-handling that's fine when your in the ghetto but not when you pay thousands of dollars to stay in a resort .They should not allow those fools in the resort. Luckily I speak spanish, but if you don't your gonna have trouble getting your point across the people that spoke spanish got better service. So if you don't pay attention to this review you deserve what you get. ","annotations":[]}
