{"text":"The best swimming pool in town! This was my first time in Bali and I booked this hotel through agoda.com; it said that the hotel was on the beach, close to all the action  had very helpful staff; all of the above was true. I was greeted on arrival with a welcome drink and the porter took our bags to the room. The room which was on the ground floor was ample in size with a fair patio area; even though its view was a wall, it could have done with a washing line of some sort just to dry out the towels at the end of the day. The bathroom was really nice with a powerful shower and all the mod-cons.The best bit about this hotel was the swimming pool and the best thing about Bali is the sunset so when you put these two together you really were in paradise - the pool is on the 4th floor of the hotel and is an infinity pool so it looks like its pouring into the sea and goes on forever. When I was there the pool area was always clean, fully staffed and quiet e.g. no pumping music and no screaming children. The food had a lot to be desiered however there are many bars and restaurants just outside the hotel where beer is as cheap as 50p a bottle!I paid 11pounds a night for this hotel, for me it was an absolute bargain and a pleaasure to stay in this hotel.
