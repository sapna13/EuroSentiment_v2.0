{"text":"Good hotel but disappointed about exorbitant food prices I am a Hilton Diamond VIP and travel extensively for business and leisure. Stayed here 6 nights with family between Xmas and New Years. This was my third stay at this hotel in the past 20 months. Good property, although I agree with reviewer SingaporeGuy10 on his assessment about overcrowding of exec lounge on 37th floor. We ended up getting a spot everyday for both breakfast and evening cocktails but it certainly packed to the limits. The staff at the exec lounge tried their best but sometimes found it hard to cope - this is a problem at many Hilton properties, in my opinion. I found the overcrowding problem actually worse at the Conrad in HKG. The food in the Tokyo Hilton's lounge is OK, but not as good as other properties - the best I can recall was Hitlon Bangkok and Conrad Singapore. Service at Tokyo Hilton was good, especially concierge and housekeeping. However, we found the food  bev. prices at their restaurants to be not only very high but TERRIBLE value for money. At their Teppan Grill, for new year's eve, we were charged $1250 for 3 people. We knew this going in but expected a gourmet experience (supposedly a Japanese 5-course dinner). What came out was VERY average food. It's very disappointing and does not serve Hilton well. On another occasion, at their atrium cafe, we were charge the equivalent of US$11 per cup of coffee - Yes, US$11. And no refills. 2 cups of coffee and one slice of dessert ~ US$45.
