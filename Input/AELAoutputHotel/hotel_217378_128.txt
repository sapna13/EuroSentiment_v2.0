{"text":"Would Not Return Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights to attend a conference that was taking place in the hotel. At the first night's reception, the main topic was how terrible the hotel was. From speaking with others, some of the rooms had been redone and some have not. Mine certainly wasn't: There were large stains on the carpet and the drapes, as they were obviously orginial to the hotel, peeling paint and missing tiles in the bathroom. I was thankful that I brought my flip flops as I felt very uncomfortable walking on any part of the floor. I also did not have a desk - when I called the front desk they had only one room with a desk left available, and it was close to the construction. They accommadated me by bringing an extension cord to my room. The first night one of the broilers broke so there was no hot water and very little running water in the shower. I understand these things happen, but that tells you that this hotel has not been maintained. The hotel in response to the complaints gave 2 free drink coupons to those of us affected. At the same time as our conference, there was a group of about 200 teenagers booked in the hotel, meaning they were at full capacity. There were not enough elevators to accommodate all the guests, and we had to wait in long lines to use the elevators to get to our rooms. You could not take the stairs as the doors onto the floors were locked. All these problems would have been somewhat okay if the room rate was less than $175 (and I put that rather high as it is on the beach) but for the conference room rate of $225, and a regular room rate of $385 - it was ridiculous. I spent $375 for the Four Seasons in Maui - and this is more expensive? I've only stayed in one hotel that was worse as far as the interior of the room, and that was back when I was 19 and going on spring break... For the outragous price - I would advise going elsewhere or wait until they have completely remodeled the hotel, which seems to be going very slowly.Food was adequate - your typicaly hotel fare. Service was professional, and bar on the beach was nice, but closed at 5:00.
