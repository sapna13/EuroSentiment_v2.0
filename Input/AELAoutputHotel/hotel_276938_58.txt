{"text":"Fantastic price, location, and great room! My girlfriend and I stayed here for two nights and absolutely loved it. This was the second hotel of our 4-night stay in Paris ... we decided to try one Left-bank and one Right-bank hotel, but now I wish we spent the whole time at Relais du Marias.We spent quite a bit of time reading reviews on TripAdvisor, and all of the good things said about this hotel we found to be true.Checking in, the man at the front desk was extremely friendly. I do speak a little bit of french (it has been 5 or 6 years though) and when in Paris, I always make an attempt to converse in French, but most parisians will immediately respond in English as soon as they hear my terrible accent. This guy was very nice, and spoke in slow clear french that I could understand (he did speak English, too).The room was small, as has been noted in other reviews, but it's Paris and that is to be expected. It was plenty big enough for us and our stuff. Our room had a lot of light from a large window that opens, and a little desk and decent sized closet. The bathroom was also very bright and clean, it had a good bathtub\/shower and was appointed with clean towels and little soaps.Possibly the best feature ... free high-speed WiFi internet on every floor. Worked great. Bring a european power adapter for your laptop or you can buy one at a place like FNAC.Our rate included breakfast, and I would definitely recommend it. The breakfast room was decorated very modern, with tables and chairs from IKEA. Breakfast was typical french and buffet style ... coffee, croissants, cereal, hard-boiled eggs, yougurt, and orange juice.Location is absolutely perfect for walking or taking the Velib bikes around. The Marais is a beautiful neighborhood with lots of cute stores, restaurants, and cafes.For the price, this place was fantastic. I'll definitely come back on my next Paris trip.
