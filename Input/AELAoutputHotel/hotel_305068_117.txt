{"text":"One of the best hotels in the world Low rating for that hotel is a joke. I guess it's overpriced for many,so they give it 2 stars. What a shame!We spent one night on Christmas' Eve here and then 4 nightsfor New Years' Eve. Let me say this again - this is one of the besthotels in the world. Period. We've traveled all over the world andstayed in many great hotels.What makes this one special?1) Location. We stayed in room 1716 which is a suite on the topfloor with a view to die for. It's angled the way you face both frontsides of the hotel so you face both faces of the most amazingcityscape in the world. But even if you don't stay in one of the roomslike that, you can enjoy the view every morning when you takeyour breakfast downstairs, or every evening when you have yourdrink in a lounge.2) Quality. Bulgari toiletries and Hennessy XO in the mini bar.Amazing bed. Plasma TV. Unbelievable jacuzzi and shower.What should i add?3) Service. On Christmas' Eve the streets around the hotel wereclosed for celebrations - thousands of people outside.We landed and the hotel sent a Rolls Royce to pick us up.They couldn't reach the hotel so we had to walk ~20 minutes.They sent 6 people (!) to help us - 3 porters, a lady to show us the way,security people. Is this a bad service? Plus a very personal attention from the manager Elaine,who I exchanged e-mail with before we came. Suchan amazing person.4) Food. Some of the best restaurants are here. Nobu - a new sushirestaurant, Spoon - French. But the best by far is Yan Toh Heen- chosen often as the best Chinese restaurant in the world.We had our New Years' Eve dinner here - an amazing 18 coursedinner with a variety of tastes to die for. Amazing service.Jade silverware and plates. Amazing food.Plus a great breakfast every morning.This hotel deserves 10 stars.Andrew ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1564,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1557}]}
