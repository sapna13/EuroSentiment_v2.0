{"text":"Good for a couple of nights in Florence Overall this was a good base for a few nights - only a 10 Euro taxi ride from the train station - you could easily walk in 10 minutes if you only had light luggage - and also about a 10 minute walk from the Duomo (cathedral) which is a lovely area with plenty of shops and (touristy) restaurants. (Get the hotel to recommend local restaurants - we liked Il Messere very much with its charming courtyard and the food is far superior to that in the touristy rip-off areas).It's a considerably longer walk to Ponte Vecchio - probably a good 20 minutes from the hotel but only ten minutes or so further than the Duomo so I didn't have a problem with that at all - I preferred being close to the Duomo.We found the staff helpful and friendly and the breakfast good enough to set us up for a few hours sightseeing.I would say that the standard room (we were given standard by mistake on our first night) was too small for a couple with 2 large cases - really not enough room\/floor space to open both cases at the same time, but the deluxe was fine with a comfy sofa as well as reasonably sized bed  bathroom.We were on the first floor so our view was of tiled roofs immediately opposite but I gather you can have nice views from the 3rd floor.In summary this hotel is fine for a few nights, not luxurious and not 4 star by world standards but a good reasonably inexpensive (for Italy) tourist base.
