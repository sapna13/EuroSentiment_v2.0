{"text":"Nice little hotel Just back from a week in Paris, where we stayed at the Hotel Agora. We were, overall, quite pleased with the hotel. All of the staff at the reception were friendly and helpful, and spoke perfect English. Our room, on the fourth floor, was definitely not large, but was sufficient for what we needed (a place to sleep after long days of sightseeing!). Everything seemed clean, the beds were comfortable enough, and there was some storage space for clothes. The bathrooms had been recently renovated, which was nice, and were a good size, although it was a little bit of a challenge to avoid getting water from the shower on the bathroom floor! Unlike a previous review, my difficulty with the shower was that the temperature was hotter than I like, so they may have modified that.The location is excellent - about two blocks from a metro station, and 5 minutes from the back of Notre Dame. Also in the immediate area are several cafes, and stores selling cheese, wine, baked goods, meat, etc. We took advantage of this several times, having a picnic dinner one night, and buying baked goods several evenings to eat for breakfast the next morning. We never had the hotel-provided breakfast, which at 11 euros didn't seem like enough of a deal to try with so many other, cheaper, options. For dinner, we found a couple of little streets within 5 minutes walk of the hotel, which had very good restaurants at decent rates.We had just a couple of minor negatives. One was the church across the road - we had read on TA that the bells ring early, but thought that since we were there in winter, and would have the windows closed, they wouldn't be a problem. Don't think this - the bells go off (with a nice little melody) at 7:40 AM 6 days a week. They will then go off on the hour and half-hour. Just be aware of this; it is definitely not the worst thing in the world, but if you are hoping to sleep late in the morning, they will make it more difficult. Also, the rooms are not perfectly soundproofed - one night, we had a group of teenagers in the hotel, and we could definitely notice the noise through the walls.Overall, this is a nice little hotel. It's nothing fancy, so if you are looking for an exceptional experience don't choose it, but if you are hoping for somewhere relatively inexpensive in a good location, this is a good option.
