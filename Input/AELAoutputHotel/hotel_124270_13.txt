{"text":"Not horrible, but not great I wouldn't want to stay here again --- it's a little run down - the 2 non-smoking rooms both had an unpleasant odor. Rooms were clean, great water pressure and VERY hot water. Toilet seat made for a midget. Rooms have refrigerator and microwave. Breakfast was OK (they should be ashamed of the foul-tasting Folger's coffee they are serving in SEATTLE)! TINY area to eat in, and there's a sign telling you NOT to eat breakfast in your room.Had 2 rooms because there was no wireless Internet signal in the first one. Even in the 2nd, (closer to the lobby), the signal was weak, but usable.There's a sign at reception indicating you cannot use the free airport shuttle unless you sign up in advance. Then, they won't shuttle at all between the hours of 5-7am. And, outside those hours, the shuttle will run ONCE an HOUR! Lucky on this stay I have a rental car. I was going to stay again and use the shuttle, but have changed plans and will stay elsewhere.The back of the property is right up against I-5 and the traffic noise is 24x7 (although it didn't bother me). The front of the property is across from a YellowFreight trucking terminal so you've got the truck noise. And, the hotel is just a couple miles from Boeing Field and right on the approach to the runway - at about the point the aircraft have to gun the engines to stay airborne before landing --- and there are some LOUD military spy jets landing at Boeing field.This is a budget hotel and some of the guests didn't look like they could afford to be staying here.
