{"text":"What a lovely place As many others (I suspect), me and my girlfriend came across Castle Inn through the many great reviews on tripadvisor, and we were not disappointed.We stayed there for a total of seven days, and during that time we stayed in two seperate rooms. Both of them were in excellent condition, and, importantly, squeaky clean. You get free wireless internet (which, except for a minor glitches, worked flawlessly and fast compared to other (major) hotel networks I've tried), and you get many, many TV channels - if that means anything to you.The staff is as friendly as they get, and the location is marvellous. Lots of restaurants nearby (including the ones in Italian district), and a very relaxed, cosy atmosphere characterizes the neigborhood. It's a quite hilly area, so expect to use either bus or cable car, which both pass by in close approximity to the motel.If you want to do some major shopping (around Union Square, for example), you will probably want to use public transport. You could walk on a warm day, but don't overestimate your physical fitness when you're going back again ...Also, Castle Inn is very good value for money. We payed about $100 a night, and considering the large rooms, the service and the extras like wireless internet and TV selection, we can't complain.If you expect to get a proper breakfast, though, you should probably visit any of the nearby cafes or even Walgreens (for some decent sandwiches). The one in Castle Inn is a bit on the sugary side, but the coffee is great! :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1450,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1440},{"endOffset":1518,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1512},{"endOffset":1518,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1512},{"endOffset":1518,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1512}]}
