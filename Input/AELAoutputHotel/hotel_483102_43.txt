{"text":"Brilliant hotel, great value, excellent location Background -I stayed here with my husband for 2 nights for a 30th birthday trip with 2 friends. We booked with ebookers.co.uk for 2 double rooms. We had a great stay here, nothing to complain about and loved the hotel - we will definitely stay here again the next time we go to Barcelona.Points to note:The price for this 4 star hotel was cheaper than staying at the 3 star H10 Cataluyna Plaza and is literally 1 minute walk away - you can see the Cataluyna Plaza from the hotel.We stayed in rooms 105 and 108 which were a good size and on the first floor at the back of the hotel. They were clean and well furnished. We also had french doors which led to a terrace with a separate area for our room (bistro table and chairs) and also loungers for all four rooms leading out to the terrace. You could hear\/feel the rumble from the metro but it was very faint and didn't wake us up.There was a free safe in the room with a key code lock - very convenient. We had cava on arrival, there is free internet in the lobby and snacks near the bar. The drinks in the bar are reasonable prices too. The staff on reception spoke good english were very helpful - even getting us an iron and ironing board straight away when we needed one. We were able to leave our bags after checking out in a locked room.Tips:If flying to BCN, get the A1 Aerobus for 3.90 euros - takes you straight to Cataluyna PlazaTry the Milano Cocktail bar, a few doors down from the hotel - great cocktails made properly in a great settingFor an absolutely amazing Thai meal, try Matsuri in the Gothic Quarter (Barri Gotic) - very reasonable prices and out of this world food.
