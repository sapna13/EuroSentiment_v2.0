{"text":"Pretty Good This is everything I learned from tripadivsor and my own experiences. This was my first all inclusive so I don't have too much to compare it to. But I read this site religiously for 2 monthes before departure and I had apprehensions about going. My boyfriend and I stayed at the GBP June 10-17. We are both in our early 20's and didn't find any disrespect regarding our age etc. Arrival: Easy, ignore the guys trying to take your luggage, find your travel agency (Sunquest, Signature etc) and they'll tell you what bus to go on. The resort is huge, yes. Stop complaining though, it's about a 15 minute walk end to end, give me a break! With the way North Americans eat, we all need the walk! And you can eat alot there, depends on how picky you are. We are picky so we thought the food wasn't the greatest. We definitely survived on rice, pasta and fries for the week. Breakfast was by far the best meal served in the buffets, I say to stuff yourselves in the morning. Lobby drinks are the best. Pool was pretty gross, wipe yourself with a towel after exiting the pool, nice green algae. Beach is nice, a little seaweed but fun. If you want to try the paddle boat etc. there is a 1-2 days wait, so book it when you get there. We had no trouble with line ups for reservations, or front desk trouble. Never had to wait longer then 5 minutes so I guess it has to do with timing. Couldn't get into the Japenese restaurant though. (Heard it was awesome). Went to Garden Grill and Italian restaurant. Both were okay, not as classy as we thought it would be. The bf got sick off the Italian lasagna, paid for it the next few days. Careful. Trams run constantly shuttling you up and down the middle of the resort. It mirrors eachother, Bavaro and Punta Cana. Get a map (one is handed to you on the bus) and wander around the first day. Maid service was excellent, she was a sweetheart. Left her about 13 bucks throughout the week and lots of presents from the dollar store. She left us wine, rum, t-shirts, and fresh flowers. Even a bubble bath with balloons in it one day. And we were just standard suite with yellow wrist bands! Went down to get my hair braided, done for about 70 dollars (US). I have a lot of hair and it was full head of braids. Took her 2.5 hours and she was going fast (she was really nice). It held up well throughout the week but taking them out was a huge pain. I wouldn't get them again based on that alone. Overall I say to just enjoy yourself, I mean, if you go with a bad attitude, you'll have a bad experience. The people are so nice and courteous, be nice back :) We went for the beach and the sun, and we got a great vacation. Mind you, we decided we could go to the beach up north and it would be a heck of alot cheaper. I say try to it, just don't go with expectations of a high class 5 star resort that you would find in Canada, because it's not. But they try pretty darn hard to be.
