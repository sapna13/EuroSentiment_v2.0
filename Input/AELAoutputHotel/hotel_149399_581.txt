{"text":"Awesome vacation My husband and I went to Melia Caribe from September 9 thru September 16, 2006. We had a wonderful time. The property was beautiful and the people were great. Only a few of them speak really good english so brush up on your spanish. I recommend the Royal Service without a doubt. If you are not in RS, everything is far away (except the beach) and you have to wait for a train to get anywhere. RS is not close to the beach but is close to everything else. When you want to go to the beach, you can easily get a ride. We were in the RS master suite and it was HUGE! It was really a 1 bedroom apartment. We saw the junior suite and it was nice too, just not as roomy. RS has a seperate restaurant just for us. It is buffet, but pretty good. This is good for breakfast and lunch but I would eat at the other restaurants for dinner. The food was very good. We ate at a different restaurant every night except the French which we went to twice. The RS also has a seperate loung area where you can watch a big tv, use the internet for free and get snacks and top shelf liquor for happy hour. RS also has its own pool with a snack bar with hamburgers, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches and pretty good nachos. Some of the excursions were pretty good. The marinarium tour was real fun. The snorkling was just ok. It is just not the greatest we have ever done. The coral is not as cared for as it is in other places. My only real compliant was the coffee. YUK! it is so strong we had to drink it 1\/3 coffee and 2\/3 milk. Also, the resort is less than 20 minutes from the airport and it is not a bad ride. The roads are pretty good. Outside of the resort, the towns are dirty and not much to see. Over all, the trip was fantastic!
