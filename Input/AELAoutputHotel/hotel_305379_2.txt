{"text":"Punishing claustrophobia We were told by brochures etc and in photos that this was a great hotel..the first thing is we booked a non smoking double and got a smoking twin..ok so we stayed the first night as they did not understand much english at the front desk. Second day we were given a non smoking room double..it was smaller than my bathroom and we could not move in the room without one person sitting the bed..the television was so high up and close to the head of the bed as the room was small could not see it without tilting head back. Toilet did not work and bathroom was old and grotty.No open window just air con that worked so well you were like a raisin by the morning..the claustrophobic had to stand by the open door of the room all night it was very very small room. Flight got held over so had to stay two more nights..same room order, but it cost us more and we actually got a much bigger room..so don't complain or you will be put in the punishment corner rooms..on the very last day we got a english speaking paper delivered under the door. Staff here either don;t speak english or are very limited...they don; understand that the toilet does not work (flush)I thought it was just me, a huge Aussie (size 8) until two other ladies without prompting or comment from me, both Asian and very small commented how tiny the rooms were and that they had looked bigger in the brochure..also the lack of fresh air..would consider paying for a better hotel..these small rooms cost us 1200 HK dollars each..and we really felt unwanted.
