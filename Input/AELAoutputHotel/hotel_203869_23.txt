{"text":"I Now Know Why She Doesn't Smile We were just married in Ravello Italy on September 28, 2007 - We stayed 7 days in Positano and then planed to spend 5 nights in Florence and 4 nights in Venice for our honeymoon. Our travel agent booked a honeymoon suite at the Mona Lisa hotel. We were told it was a great location. As we pulled up we noticed that the location was less than desirable but the hotel looked like it was pretty decent from the outside. It was late and we wanted to shower, change and have dinner. As we checked in we confirmed that we had booked a honeymoon suite. We opened the door to our room and the first thing we both noticed was this nasty musty stench that just poured out of the room. I thought that maybe if I opened the window I could air the room out. As I opened the window I noticed bars going across the whole window like a jail cell and that I was looking at a brick wall. If I could get my arm threw the bars on the window I would be able to reach out and touch the wall. I soon realized that this was no honeymoon suite or any type of suite at all. My husband notice a ball on the dresser and three little packages next to it. It was a incense ball that plugged into the wall and we were able to choose our favorite flavor. Needless to say they were all putrid on top of the musty stench. The room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even big enough to fit our two bags and us. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe traveled Europe many times and I know not to expect American size rooms but this room was the smallest room I have ever come across. As it started getting dark I wanted to get some type of light in the room to cheer us up - but to my surprise the lights were already on. The room was so dark you couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see your hand in front of your face. (Some may think this is romantic but I think it was just down right spooky.) It really takes a lot to get me going √à√\u2020\u2022?I am the type of person who can just go with the flow and make the most out of any situation. But at this point I sat down and cried. My husband went back down stairs to see if there was something they could do. The only option was to pay more money to stay in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeluxe honeymoon suite√à√\u2020\u2022?We then tried to call our travel agent but our phone would not work. When we asked for assistance we were told it would be fixed the next day. I felt like there was no way out we were trapped. There was no way I was staying in a room where I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even make a phone call if something went wrong. So we asked to change rooms at whatever price it would be. But that couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be arranged until the next day as well. So we asked to leave. We were told to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ØO√à√\u2020\u2022?no apologies √à√\u2020\u2022?no assistance of any kind √à√\u2020\u2022?not even a congratulations when we walked threw the door. The staff were the rudest most arrogant people I have ever met in all of my travels. We checked into another hotel about five minutes away The Grand Hotel and it was wonderful. One last note on this Mona Lisa hotel they have charged us for one night stay when we only stayed for a total of 10 minutes. We have submitted receipts of the Hotel we actually stayed at that evening along with a receipt from our Taxi to prove we did not stay any nights at this miserable hotel but we are still fighting with them. This is the worst hotel I have ever had the opportunity to visit.
