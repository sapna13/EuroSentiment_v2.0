{"text":"Looked great, but was not great We booked last minute and didn't read reviews until after we booked. Just so you know, I am not a picky person. I have only traveled a few times so i don't have much to compare to. My boyfriend and I were just looking to get away from winter, get some sun and relax. Our sunscreen was confiscated by the airport so we were left without sunscreen the first day. We asked our tour operator, signature Vacations, if they could help us out, and they said they could get us some. The resort charges $40US for a small bottle of sunscreen!! The Signature rep didn't show up many times she said she would. It rained everyday 3 times per day! Gail force winds! Back to the hotel... The room was ok, kind of dumpy. The phone didnt work and we were worried the tv might blow up. Porn is on all the time so a warning to u if you are taking the kiddies! Service was the worst. I was ignored at the bar a few times because i didn't speak spanish.the buffet food is good, but the same thing all the time pretty much. The pizzeria was blah. The steak house food is amazing but again, the service was real bad. The second time we went there, I ordered the exact same meal as my boyfriend and he got a plate full of food and I just got a small steak and a ball of rice. When I complained to the waitress, she said she would take care of it. Then she never came back. Really??!! Learn spanish because we barely met anyone who spoke english here (goes for the staff too). On the last night the airconditioner in our room broke and poured half an inch of water onto the floor. No one came to fix it until the next morning, when we were trying to pack, shower and check out by 12. We bought a phone card that was supposed to work on the payphone BUT they don't work on any phone but the room phones. The front desk refused to let us use a phone with the card. They told us to use the hotel room phone but we had already checked out. Didn't matter anyway because our room phone didn't work! They just said No. Lots of people were complaining and yelling in the lobby at the front desk when we were leaving. We won't go back here ever. Oh and not to mention the coconut on the resort that fell out of the tree and hit me on my foot when were walking. i ended up at the hospital to get xrays. No apologies from the hotel for not upkeeping the trees. The upside was the doctor is super nice and speaks perfect english and spanish. She was a great help. But most people don't go on vacation to see the doctor... p.s. the POOLS ARE FREEZING!!
