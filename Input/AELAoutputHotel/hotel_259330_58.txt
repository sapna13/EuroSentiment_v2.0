{"text":"Great vacation I had my doubts when booking this hotel as in 2005 I allready had a very negative experience of this hotel brand which was the hotel Palma Real in Juan Dolio, however the Grand Paradise The Club exeeded our expectations. Starting with the checkin it was smooth and efficient. The lady agent that checked us in was very professional and courteous also Jonathan was very cordial in assisting us in every request that we had. Our two bedroom suite was nice it had a jacussi and a plasma tv and we had a partially pool\/garden view. We were given a complimentary bottle of champagne and fruits upon our arrival which was a nice touch. The grounds of the hotel are beautifull and very well kept. There were a few things that could have been better, seeing that this is a very nice hotel. First of all the service level in most of the restaurant was not great. given the impression that they were understaffed.Exception given ofcourse to a few of the staff that were wonderfull. To name a few; restaurant manager Francsico who is from Puerto Plata and who helped us through a crisis when my son got sick with the stomach flue, and there was a girl I believe by the name of Keyla who was friendly and went out of her way to accomodate us. The buffet for breakfast and lunch were great overall. The crowd mix were mostly europeans. We also dined at one of the a la carte restuarant which was the one by the name of el Tipico, which specialises in Dominican food. Service was not so good in the sense the server mixed up our orders and took some time to prepare again, however the food was ok.Our server assistant (can't remember his name) was very cordial and provided us with a lot of laughs.The beach was nice, however to get there you had to take a chu chu train, which my kids loved and it is only a five minute ride from the The Club which is the new section where we were staying, to walk it takes about more or less 15 minutes which is nice early in the morning. The only negative part of the beach and pool at the Grand Paradise (which is the first section) had to many topless woman sunbathing around the pool and on the beach, eventhough there are sighs all over stating that this is not permitted. The beach was very nice and clean.The night shows at the theater were execellent and is done by the same staff that work on the beach and pool during the day. The staff at the Kiko kids club were very entertaining and we need to mention the attendant by the name of China, who my four kids really fell in love with. The bars only have very bad tasting liquor and will not be your kind especially if you are used to drinking good stuff, the only good thing here was the Presidente draft beer. The bar staff were execellent especially the bartenders by the names of Rigoberto and Daniel who worked most of the time at the main pool bar from The Club Our housekeeper Mirna was also very efficient having our room cleaned and tidy every day.All in all a very nice stay and we would like to go back there again on a next visit ","annotations":[{"endOffset":209,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":205},{"endOffset":637,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":633},{"endOffset":789,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":785},{"endOffset":2405,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2401},{"endOffset":2405,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2401},{"endOffset":2405,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2401},{"endOffset":2405,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2401},{"endOffset":2862,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2858},{"endOffset":2862,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2858},{"endOffset":2862,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2858},{"endOffset":2862,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2858},{"endOffset":2862,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2858},{"endOffset":2974,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2970}]}
