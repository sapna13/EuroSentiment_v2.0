{"text":"Dissappointed! We have just returned after spending 3 nights at this hotel and we were very disappointed!As a result of reading some reviews, I took the trouble to email the hotel to explain that our visit was for a special occassion (our wedding anniversary) and please could we have one of the larger rooms at the front,overlooking the street.They completely ignored my letter and we were given a very small room at the back,with a view of a brick wall! I did go back to reception and they offered me the same room on another floor but with no windows!!(Although we had a window,the curtains were too narrow and there was a big gap down the middle so we were unable to make it dark...at least no one was able to see in due to being overlooked by the brick wall!)Our room was so small that we were unable to move around the bed at the same time ,so had to take it in turns to lie on the bed to enable the other to get ready.The bathroom was ok though except the shower sprayed the floor ,and all our stuff ,until we got used to it!On arrival we were offered the breakfast deal i.e.if you paid up front for all days you could have the first day half price.It was 16 Euros each! Expensive,but we decided that if we ate loads we wouldnt need to bother with lunch.This is what we did ,and it worked well.They also wanted us to pay in cash (for some reason their credit card machine was missing!) we refused as we didnt want to tie up E82 of our cash and guess what...the machine had reappeared the next morning!Very weird!As it is a buffet you can obviously pick and choose but if you are not fussy it was fine.There was : fruit juices,cereals,fresh fruit (lovely selection),cheeses,hams,smoked salmon,rolls,bread,yoghurts,croissants and a good selection of other pastries.Hot food was the same every day: scrambled egg,bacon,fried egg and sausage (the german kind).it was never very hot but was quite tasty.The free drinks and pastries in the foyer that others have mentioned are actually whats left from breakfast and usually ended up being croissants.There was never any hot water left to make tea so we managed with a cup of stewed coffee from an urn.But hey it was free!I have to say that everywhere was very clean and the staff were friendly enough.The position of this hotel is good for walking to lots of places although we felt very uneasy on the Ramblas and tried to avoid it as much as possible.To and from the airport we used the Aerobus which was great and really easy.4.05 Euros each,each way (tried to buy a return ticket but didnt seem possible).It drops you in Pl Catalunya and from there its about 10 min walk.A few other things I should mention: there is no lounge or bar in this hotel and they do not serve any other food apart from the breakfasts.There was free internet access in the foyer and also some newspapers available.Take earplugs as we were woken up at 3am every morning by people clattering down the hard floors and talking loudly!
