{"text":"Fun for the Kids and Adults We stayed at The Arts in two different rooms, so I have quite the review to give. We traveled to Spain with our two children and the first week we spent in a small town in Costa Brava and then moved the whole crew to the Arts for 5 nights. I can't say enough wonderful things about this hotel.We started out in the apartments which we had them move us to upon arrival. While amazingly spacious (two huge bedrooms with two large baths and amazing views) we felt that they were a little expensive for nothing in return. We actually felt a little left out up there. We then downgraded to our normal club level suite and LOVED it. The kids (3 and 2) were catered to in the club level (lots of PBJ's, fruit, etc). The free breakfast was amazing in both the club and the downstairs dining. We had them both sleep in the portable cribs and they received the most amazing bed set up and were given little gifts each night. They loved them. Not to mention every staff member there would get down on their level and laugh with them, etc.For the adults you can't beat the dining! We had a sitter come each night and went to eat at local restaurants and at the hotel and enjoyed each experience. The gym, pool and surrounding areas were great and in both rooms we had amazing views. We really enjoyed our stay here and will return when we go back.
