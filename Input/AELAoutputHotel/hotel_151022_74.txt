{"text":"average resort My boyfriend and I stayed at the Natura Feb 18-25th. We got a very good deal on our trip and felt we got what we paid for. The resort was average. The room was average (although very clean). The beach was great, especially if you walk to the left of the resort. I didn't notice a seaweed problem at all (as was mentioned in many other reviews). The birds were not a problem and added to the atmosphere. Many of the staff did not speak English. Service was awful at the buffets, we tried tipping a lot the first few days but it didn't seem to make a difference. The food was ok, very bland. It's best to go eat right when they open as lots of the meats and cheeses sit around and become very unappetizing. The al a cartes were good. The steakhouse was excellent. Be warned at the Italian place that they put tuna on their house green salad! The entertainment was good some nights, awful others. No nightlife, the latest bar closes at 1. We enjoyed our trip and would return to the Dominican, although probably not this resort....nothing was really wrong with it, it's just nice to have better service when your on vacation. I would NOT recommend this resort to anyone who is not travelling as a family or couple. There were very few singles there (one bachelor party) and they had to leave the resort for nightlife. They didn't seem to be enjoying themselves much. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":853,"mention":"green salad","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":842}]}
