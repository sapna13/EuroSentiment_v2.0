{"text":"return visit 2007 Last year we visited the iberostar dominicana on advice from freinds whove stayed in a number of hotels all over the dom rep over the years. the iberostar was recomended as being our first visit to the dom rep i had concerns after the horror stories you hear ref hygene etc.............advice last year was pay a tad more to stay at an iberostar and youll not go wrong as buffet doesnt repeat itself and all round theyre one of the best. Well last year was without doubt the best holiday ive ever had and worth every penny..........hotel was clean.........staff excelled acroos the board.........entertainment was exceptional........buffett always different and offered superb variety of QUALITY food........restraunts superb.....accomidation superb.............hotels stretch beach was in my opinion after many long walks the best for a good few miles. Upon our 2007 return it was just as we remembered and again i cannot fault the accomidation............the staff.........the facilites etc however we did find on this occassion that the buffett did repeat itself which whilst a tad dissapointing it didnt make much difference as i still ate different dishes each night but being really fussy id say there wasnt the superb prawn dishes on offer as per our previous visit although as stated im really splitting hairs here. Booked our restraunt visits and as per last year was confused as to why theyre always empty but suspect this may be down to allowing for early sittings to over-run. My one issue was with other guests and theyre hygene in so much as there are tongs for picking up food yet its common to see guests using hands to cut bread from loafs without using the cloths provided and hands to grab sliced bread and rolls etc sometimes even putting rolls back etc. Along with seeing guests leaving toilets without washing hands its no wonder you hear of bug outbreaks of which i was originally concerned. If my six year old son can understand why cant some adults ?Another gripe is also guest related and im afraid aimed towards the american guests whom on both holidays ive found inconsiderate to other guests by smoking , drinking and even eating burgers whilst in the swimming pool............again there are signs in all languages stating pool rules and most adhear to these. Other than that all guests are civil , freindly and from a wide host of nations which again makes the stay a pleasurable one.....................especially when playing beach football or taking part in other activities. My six year old son again this year loved the kids club full of swiss , german , french children and again this year we battled to get him out of it to enjoy some time with us! the girls who do the kids club enjoy what they do and dont just  go through the motions of doing a job We plan to return in 2008 this time taking freinds and theyre two young girls as its a hotel and holiday i think youll be hard to beat.My one concern is that the people and staff are so happy and freindly and go out of their way to make it a holiday to remember and i hope that the actions and behaviour of some guests wont increase and ruin it as the brits have done in much of the med.book it up and enjoy is my advice and the odd dollar tip to the waitress' is appreciated.
