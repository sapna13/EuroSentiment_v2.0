{"text":"Hotel Just Okay I was told to stay at the Sheraton Four Points in Humacao because of the beauty of the area - that's about the extent of the beauty - the area of Palmas del Mar. If you LIVE in a condo on property it can be nice with the golf course, lakes and member only beach areas most guests can view. If you stay at the Sheraton Four Points - Beware!!! The hotel was horrible and not the quality I think Starwood wants on their roster of hotels. We booked a 1 bdrm suite for a whole week - paid A LOT of money - and the room was dark, damp and downright dirty. I had my baby and would now let him get on the carpet it was so bad. The toilet ran very loud all night - 6 calls and fix-it attempts later we just gave up and lost sleep all night. There were stains on the curtains no one cared to wipe away, the carpet had stains, the windows would not lock - and we were on the 1st floor. Attempts to fix these issues failed too. We asked for another room the 2nd day of our stay and it was worse than the first. I was told that's the way their rooms look. What a disappointment and I feel waste of money that could have been spent at another hotel that truly cared about their guests. Oh - the parking is far, the staff in front slightly rude at times and very lax with guests requests. I heard No from hotel staff more times than my 15 month old says No. ","annotations":[]}
