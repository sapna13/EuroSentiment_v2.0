{"text":"Had a good experience We stayed at the resort from January 10th-17th and I have to say that generally our experience was a good one. We've stayed at a 5 star hotel in the past and you do notice the difference but we went with friends who had never been before and they thought the resort was great.Our rooms were ok, the only complaint I had with ours was that we didn't have very good light in our room so it was a little dark. The room was cleaned everyday and we never were short towels or anything. We also tipped our maid everyday so maybe that made a difference. The other couple had a problem with their lock on their door that took some time to get fixed but again you have to remember you are on Dominican time and nothing is a rush, so put aside your sense of urgency and relax and have a drink and enjoy the sun.The pool was very clean and there was always some entertainment going on. There is no one walking around serving drinks so you do have to get up and get it yourself. The Beach is absolutely beautiful and we spent most of our time there, again no service on the beach but it just gives you a reason to go for a walk.The food at the resort was very good, my husband is an extremely picky eater and if you don't eat there it's your own problem. I do agree the the lady booking the restaurants is not the happiest person in the world so don't expect much in this area. We went to the new area and I agree that once this is completed it will be very nice but it's a work in progress in a third world country so again grab a drink and enjoy the sun. We thought the buffet in this area was very nice and we would go there in the morning for breakfast. The walk really isn't that bad and there is a shuttle. We stayed in the main part of the resort and still made the journey.I suggest you learn a few words of spanish before going it makes things a little simpler but sit back enjoy the sun and relax.....you're on vacation.
