{"text":"Clean, modern hotel in a great location We stayed at the Century Southern Tower as part of our honeymoon.One of the main reasons we chose the hotel is its location. From Narita airport, you can catch a train directly to Shinjuku, and you can actually see the hotel on your left as you come into the station (the building with the Microsoft sign). From the station, it's a few minutes flat walk to the hotel along the new 'Southern Terrace'. We had fairly heavy luggage and it wasn't difficult to get to the hotel.Reception was easy, and everyone we interacted with in the hotel spoke fluent English. The rooms are small, but were clean, had nice beds and good views of the surrounding area. As another reviewer said, the map describing what you can see out the window was a nice touch.We didn't eat in the hotel, because it looked very fancy and expensive. The rooms have a fridge and you are encouraged to buy your own food for breakfast. There is a small convenience store in the hotel, but we'd recommend visiting the basement level of the Takashimaya shopping centre, which is just across the railway. Just cross the concourse where you'll see everyone queueing up for Krispy Kreme donuts. At Takashimaya, you can buy breakfast groceries such as fruit and cereal, as well as prepared food for lunch and dinner (such as bento boxes, dumplings, cakes and sushi). There are also restaurants on the top levels.The hotel was a great base to explore the Shinjuku area, and to catch trains to other parts of Tokyo. Nearby are countless department stores, as well as interesting shops such as Tokyu Hands, Pachinko parlours and restaurants. If you're into shopping, this is the place to stay.I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a great base from which to explore Tokyo and doesn't plan on spending a lot of time in their room and the hotel itself.
