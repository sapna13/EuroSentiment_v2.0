{"text":"Peace and Tranquility We absolutely loved our stay at the Grand Palladium. I read a number of negative reveiws prior to leaving so I was really not expecting much. I would have to say the negative reviews are more a result of the reviewer than the resort. The entire time we were there we were treated like an honored guest with the exception of the casino. Most of the staff does speak spanish, but they understand many english phrases. It is a matter of finding the correct word. An important word to remember is toilet for the bathroom. I did not notice whether or not drinks were watered down, if they were it didn't affect the taste. We stayed in the Royal Suites and would definately go back. This is a quieter section of the resort which was preferred by us. We still had the option to head for the hustle and bustle if we chose to. We tried a number of restaurants and the food was good. I wouldn't consider it 4 Stars, but definately very appealing and tastey. We ate most of our meals at the Royal Gourmet as there was never a wait and we really enjoyed the staff there.We gave small gifts to several staff members that left an impression on us. I made gift bags with shampoo, body spray, gum, hair accessories and money. I think I enjoyed their appreciation more then they enjoyed the gift. Tipping in the restaurants was quite challenging. We had an average of four five people a meal waiting on us. We learned from our host on the Bavarro Runner that if you leave a tip on the table it has to be split with the boss, if you give a tip to the boss he keeps all of it. The best advise for tipping is to give it directly to the person you would like to have it. I didn't notice tipping made any difference in the service we received, but it definately made a difference to the staff.We did two excursions during our stay: the Carribean Festival and the Bavaro Runner. I strongly recommend the Barvara Runner to anyone visiting the Dominican. You tour the real Dominican. We had a superb host and we were able to see the country through his eyes. If you decide to take this excursion you will meet many people. Bring candy, coloring books, school supplies, clothes, etc for the children. They are so appreciative of the smallest gift. If you are going to take this trip, do it early in your vacation because you will appreciate the resort even more after the excursion. During the Carribean Festival we swam with sharks and stingrays and went snorkling. The sharks and stingrays are enclosed in the swimming area. It was fun, but the entertainment on the boat was definately the highlight of the trip.
