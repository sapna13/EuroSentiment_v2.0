{"text":"The Absolute Worst Experience of my life My husband and I are major travelers. I have been to numerous thrid world countries and have never stayed in so terrrible of a hotel. There is 1 girl who spoke minimal English. The hotel had the audacity to up the price by over $200.00 American dollars and they actually got away with it. I will only feel compensated if I can make enough travelers realize what a mistake it is to stay there and have the hotel go out of business. The location is good, only if you want to walk any where, no taxi drivers know where the hotel is and it is a little bit of a distance to walk if you are getting to the subway. Also, the hotel itself is located in what looks like the slums. If it is raining outside then the bell hop will not flag a taxi down for you, you have to stand in the rain while they watch. The bathroom is crowded and in pitiful condition. There is nothing that seperates the shower from the toilet, and the toilet clogs daily. The breakfast was a sick joke, literally each time we ate there, we got sick. There is no such thing as room service due to the fact that they don't speak English and even though they have a set menu, almost every thing that I tried to order, they did not have. The bed was the absolute worst! Take a towel outside and lay it down on concrete, then lay on top of your towel, there you go. That is about how comfortable the bed is. There is only one small closet and no drawers, so if you are planning a semi long trip, you will be living in your suitcase. The hotel laundry service sent one of my shirts back unwashed and the front desk couldn't understand me so they charged me anyway. ","annotations":[]}
