{"text":"Really nice stay this time I've stayed here before and had a less pleasurable experience due to the noise of the main building. The hotel is divided up into separate areas of buildings, each with it's own little pool and amenities.This time, I requested a quiet room and was accommodated. We were put in the Canyon View suites which are located well above the main hotel. This area has it's own pool, jacuzzi, pizza deli and the gym. We were against the rock mountain and on the top floor, which made it a quiet, enjoyable experience. We watched the sunset over the desert from our balcony. We did venture down to the main pool and water slide so my son could play, however, even he preferred the restful solitude of the pool in our area. The little pizza deli is right off the pool and has drinks, pizza, ice cream and sandwiches. It stays open pretty late too.The on-site restaurants seem nice but expensive. We drove down the hill (North) on 7th and dined at other restaurants in the area. There is a Starbucks just a half a mile North of the hotel, down the hill, on the West side of 7th, for coffee junkies like me. Lots of fast food on N. 7th as well as a few little cafes and chain restaurants. If you go South on 7th the neighborhood is a little rough.If you have any difficulties walking, the hillside suites are not the place for you. Rooms are literally in the side of a mountain and while there is a shuttle, it's still a walk to wherever you want to go.Our room was well appointed, the beds were comfortable and the linens and toiletries very nice. Resort gounds are very pretty and staff is friendly and accommodating. I had a government rate which was very good. We will stay here again.
