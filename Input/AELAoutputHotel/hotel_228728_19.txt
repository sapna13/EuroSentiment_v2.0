{"text":"Good Business Hotel... Average for Vacationers After much research I booked this hotel for a multi-night stay several weeks ago. It's a beautiful hotel in many respects but as with most Paris hotels the rooms are small and the prices are stratospheric... in our case even in an upgraded prestige room we felt a little claustrophobic at over $600 US a night.What's great... recently renovated, fast internet access, clean rooms, comfortable bed, stylish interiors, nice bathrooms... had both tub and shower in our prestige room, great english speaking staff, and location (in some respects... more on that in the next section.)What's not so great... hotel ambiance is a bit on the quiet side which is great if you're traveling on business and are just looking for a place to crash but not a good if you're looking to have a drink in the lobby bar and soak up the atmosphere of Paris. The rooms are small... very small. The prices in June were pretty crazy for what you received. The location IS within walking distance of the Louvre, the D'Orsay (a bit longer) and the subway, but the biggest downside of all is that hotel itself is on a bit of a back street with service entrances for other hotels facing Tuileries Gardens and Rue de Rivoli generally occupying one side of the street. For the price I pictured walking out of the hotel onto a tree lined street with cafes, just know that's not what you'll find. Last thing is that we found the area to be devoid of good restaurants (could have missed them obviously)... it's pretty much tourist fare in sidewalk cafes.For the price, ambiance (pretty generic to any hotel in the world) and location I would not stay here again on a pleasure trip... it just doesn't feel enough like Paris. On business I would think about it.
