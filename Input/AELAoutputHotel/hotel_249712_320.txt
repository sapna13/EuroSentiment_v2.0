{"text":"Great central location, new and modern I stayed here for a friend's bachelorette party. The Good...When I checked in, the guy at the front desk asked me if I was afraid of heights. I'm not. I got a room way up on the 40sometingth. It was great, and I thought it was a cute way to ask.The bar is really nice, although the views onto 8th are well, not the best. But all in all, I thought it was a really nice hotel bar.The showers have two heads. This is cool.The beds are awesome. I'm an American, living in Europe. So I get stuck with futon mattresses all the time. These mattrresses (the Heavenly Bed) are super soft. Also liked that the bedding was all white. Location was perfect...lots of subway options in the area.Had dinner at Hell's Kitchen on 9th one night on the concierge's recommendation and it was great. It's upscale Mexican\/Latino. The gym is really nice. A number of treadmills, ellipticals, and bikes. You are a 10 minute walk to HH bagel. :)Security...when you come in late at night, security at street level asks to see your room key. I liked this touch.The lobby...I really liked the lobby on the American 2nd floor\/European 1st floor. Lots of wood, nice furniture. A good place to wait for people.The Not so Good...The downside to the Heavenly Bed for me is that after two nights, I had a bit of a back ache. And I never get that. I thought paying $10 a day a tthe gym was a bit well, I wish they didn't charge. The percentage of guests who actually use the gym is small. They should make their money elsewhere.The business center is small--three PCs--so I had to wait for the Internet a couple of times. I wish there had been free wireless or some other system. I ended up buying a block of time that I didn't use entirely, so they got to keep my extra money.Sometimes, the wait for a taxi was excessive. The night of the actual bachelorette party--we ended up taking the livery cars to the restaurant because we were in danger of missing our reservation. This cost us a bit of cashola. All in all, I was pleased with the Westin. This has to be a high-traffic, high turnover property. It's absolutely enormous...something like 800 rooms. It never felt like that though. Which is a good thing.
