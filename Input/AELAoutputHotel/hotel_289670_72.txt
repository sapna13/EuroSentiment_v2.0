{"text":"Geat Hotel if you get it on a deal price We got a good deal on this hotel through laterooms.com. We payed √ä√£¬¢530.00 and stayed for 5 nights. We paid the extra amount for the room on the higher floor, which was well worth it for the brilliant night views of the city. It was a great hotel in a handy location. It is not in the centre of Barcelona but is right beside both the underground and the train station. The rooms were a lovely size with a nice big bathroom, clean and fully equiped. The staff were lovely and very helpful. There is internet access on the basement floor, free for the first half hour! You could have wi fi access for 24 hours for about √à√\u2020√ü?0. This is very handy if, like us , you travel with the lap top. The restaurant on the top floor is worth checking out. Its a bit pricey, but worth splashing out on for one night for the fab. views over the city. The food was good and some nice wines. There is a free bottle of cava with the voucher they give you on check in, but you have to be seated before a certain time. I didn't eat in the hotel for anything else. Breakfast for us was in the cafe which is in the supermarket under the hotel, again very handy. This is a great hotel in a handy location. I highly recommend both the hotel and Barcelona which is an amazing city with so much to see and do. We are planning to return with our toddler son soon and will be checking out the Gran Hotel Torre Catalunya for our next good deal.
