{"text":"Amazing clean - fun resort We booked with Tripcentral.ca and it was a signature vacation package. This was our first time travelling with our 2 klids. 3 year old girl and 18 month old girl. Let me tell you we had the best experience I could imagine. Starting off with the flight Sunquest leaving from Toronto terminal 3. Everything was amazing and they even served us a meal on the flight. When we arrived to Punta Cana the bus ride was bumpy but nothing to worry about. We finally get to the resort and it was everything we expected and more. The only downfalls were that we requested a joining room and we did not get that. We stayed in villa 8 room number 8105 and it was great. If you could stay in Villa 9 that would be the perfect location. You would be in the middle of the the beach and all restaurants. We had minor porblems with our room. The shower started leaking abit and we were on the main floor which was abit noisy in the morning and late night with people going back to there rooms. The playmakers were great and many kids activites going on. They really had a great time with the popcorn in the kids playhouse and the disco for the kids everynight.The beach is beautiful and waves everyday. They come by in the morning to clean the seaweed on the sand and it is really beautiful.Food--We did not like the mexican rest. and the main buffet was the best place for dinner b\/c of the variaty you have. The Italian was also really good. You need to go early to avoid a wait and you need to dress up for the sit down dinners.Mikes coffee house was the best place for lattes and expressos. That was our nightly stop and rememebr to request the cheesecake that they keep in the back unless you ask for it. Really good. Tip-We would tip the maid and she would treat us really good and leave a case of water and flowers as for the restaurants the waiters will treat you really good. The only problem is most of them don't know how to speak english so hard to communicate with them at times.Overall-Great beach, weather amazing, pool huge and the place very clean and well maintianed!! Would go back!!
