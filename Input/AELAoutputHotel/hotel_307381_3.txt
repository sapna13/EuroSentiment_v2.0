{"text":"Feel the Vibe! Took my family ( 2 adults, 2 kids aged 8 and 10) to Tokyo last week and wanted to get a BIG reaction to staying in Tokyo on the first night. Guess what? I got it. Arrived at night so conveniently on the Limo Bus from Narita to our doorstep which was perfect for the sleepy kids. Had a quad room which is sooooo hard to find in Tokyo and this was perfect. Their little mouths dropped as they look upon the city lights with amazement from our room on the 15th floor. We could see a rooftop soccer game in play, huge numbers of people crossing at the major intersection, and a vibrant city in action. The room was just fine for us and the reality of the place is somewhat better than the photos. The shots look a little clinical and cold, but believe me, we were very happy to be here. I had considered The Mandarin and the Ritz Carlton but this place just had everything that was important to my decision. Front desk - easy check in and helpful, excellent location, clean rooms with the perfect combination for us, great shopping and restaurants. Great access to subway and rest of Tokyo. Children loved riding up and down in windowed elevators looking at the sites of the area. From Shinjuku to Yoyogi, and all over. Couldn't have been happier and paid so little for the desired effect. Surely stay there again. Great introduction to Japan, subway culture, corporate culture and shopping culture. This is where our children learnt that walking single file in rush hour is a better option than walking four abreast. Kids also took photos of rush hour commuters. Great insight into the real Tokyo. Highly recommended. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":827,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":819}]}
