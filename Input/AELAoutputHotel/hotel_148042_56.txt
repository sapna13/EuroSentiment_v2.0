{"text":"Nothing Special So I was very excited about staying at the Ritz-Carlton San Juan. While it certainly was not a bad place, It was really no different than a Hilton or Marriott that I might say at in the states. (Made me wonder what the Hilton and Marriott are like here in San Juan) For $400 per night I had a room with a view of a condo parking lot and security fence...but couldn't really even see that since the dual-pane glass was stained with salt or some substance. The service was subpar for a hotel in this category, my first night I requested a wake-up call and after setting this up the woman asked, is there anything else that I can help you with? At which point I mentioned, why yes, in fact I have a sports jacket that needs cleaning...what should I do? and the woman said, oh, I don't know anything about that...call in the morning and they can help you. I know I probably sound like a snob but this is the RITZ CARLTON, I expect top-notch service, not the same that I'd get at the Hilton or Marriott. The room was also very much like staying at a Hilton...to be honest, I couldn't tell the difference. Now, let me say some good things...the pool was wonderful as were the grounds. Also, the beach was very nice...I never thought of Puerto Rico as having such a nice beach. Overall, not a bad experience but nothing that would make me want to spend this kind of money again. What I don't know is if things in Puerto Rico are not just very nice and if this really is the best place to stay? I haven't tried any of the other places.
