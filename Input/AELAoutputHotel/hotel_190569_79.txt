{"text":"Excellent facilities; a few service problems. I stayed at the Westin Palace as a part of a large business meeting. The hotel has an excellent location. The Thyssen and Prado museums are within five minute walks, Retiro (park) is another five minutes UP the hill behind the Prado, and Puerta del Sol and Plaza Mayor are about 10-15 minutes away UP another hill. So, all in all a great location, but be prepared to climb a bit. The only location drawback is that you are about a 7-10 minute walk from the nearest metro stations - Banco de Espana, Atocha, Sevilla or Sol. The hotel itself has excellent facilities. The rotunda lobby is ornate and beautiful. The hallways on the guest floors are wide and well lit. The breakfast area is well laid out with a wide selection. The rooms themselves are very nice. The bathrooms are probably the best part with twin sinks, and a separate room for the toilet and bidet. Towels are plush and unlike many European hotels, there are facial wash cloths. The room itself was spacious, but there was only one arm chair in the room. We would have preferred two chairs. Our room was room #649 which was south facing onto an alley with no particularly redeeming view. There were two problems we encountered. One was the mattress was badly in need of replacement. We could never get this scheduled, although the hotel did try. The other was air conditioning. Our air conditioner would come on, throw out cold air, get to the desired temperature, convert to fan only operation and never go back to throwing out cold air, no matter how warm it got in the room. We tried twice to get it fixed, but as we don't speak Spanish, we could not adequately communicate the problem. So, while we could hardly say we loved our experience in the room, we'll assume we were outliers (heard no complaints from others in our group). I am rating the hotel as excellent as the facilities themselves were superb and assuming that the problems we encountered were atypical. We did walk across Paseo del Prado to the Ritz and our view is that the public areas in the Palace exceed the Ritz.If you want to save a few euros on dining, if you exit the hotel, and go downhill to the Paseo del Prado, in the basement of the hotel building but only accessible from the street, there is a VIPS and a Starbucks. VIPS is a family oriented cafe \/ convenience store, but we found the food very satisfactory on our several occasions dining there. If you ask, they do have english language menus, but the Spanish language menus are well illustrated enough that with even the most rudimentary of Spanish, you should do OK. The only drawback is that you cannot order off the lunch menu until as I recall 1:00 pm (if not 1:30 pm). As for Starbucks, you know the drill. Certain maps show that there is a Planet Hollywood in the same building. If that was once true, it's closed now.
