{"text":"False Advertising at its Best!! Well, my wife and I just arrived home from, the LTI in Punta Cana. This was supposed to be our memorable honeymoon, I tell you what it was , but for all the wrong reasons. Don't get me wrong as long as you are not on the resort you will have a great time. Ok, the pros: The beach is nice,pool is ok, there are tons of kids in it all day(unsupervised) so if you like swimming in a toilet it's fantastic! I have to say that the wait staff is fantastic, if you want great service just smile, give a decent tip, and talk about the Redsox, they love the sox. Ok now the Cons:1-The food is the worst I have ever had, I travel often, and I am a cook myself, and I wouldn't feed it to my dog.2-Pillows and the beds are a joke. The Bed is older than dirt, and they have bed bugs, no lie, the rooms are plain and the a\/c left about 3 inches of water on the floor in a 4 foot area.3-All the pics that you see of the resort except for a few are of the cayena club, there vip section of the resort,(which you will only see when they try to sell you a time share).4- There are tons of kids in the resort,and like already mentioned , no one is watching them,and there is also no tops required at this resort , so you have kids and nude women of all ages all over the place.5-The maid service is something to be desired, they don't clean the room until 5 oclock, and even then they don't even change the linens fo a couple of days.I have way to much more to write but you get the point. I wouldn't recommend my worst enemy to this resort, it is definitly not a 4 star, it is more of a 1 and a half, maybe a small 2. If you stay here you will be greatly dissappointed.Thank you N.H U.S.A ","annotations":[{"endOffset":319,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":315},{"endOffset":777,"mention":"dirt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dirt_cake"],"startOffset":773},{"endOffset":777,"mention":"dirt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dirt_cake"],"startOffset":773},{"endOffset":983,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":979}]}
