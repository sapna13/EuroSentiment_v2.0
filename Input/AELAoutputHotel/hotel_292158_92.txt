{"text":"Awesome! Loved It! We were there from the 18th to 24th of May, everything was perfect from the beginning. We travelled with Westjet at one point we had no satellite tv and the flight attendants didn't lose a moment to entertain us, we played a challenge that the whole airplane participated w toilet paper! We had a good laugh!! Our taxi ride was about 30 minutes to the hotel. It cost us 30$US. Although a guy at the airport was trying to get us a deal for $50. It was a bonus that we spoke spanish and bargained with another more reasonable taxi.Once we arrived at the Palladium we were served drinks while we waited for our check in. It was quick and efficient. We arrived around 3pm so right on time for there set check in time. Without delay we went to our rooms! Right near the pool and beach we were happy! The Animation team was awesome there was always something to do, waterpolo, kayaking and our favourite the slide on the beach! Although you do pay for it, it relieves the stress! The beach was gorgeous. Although if you want a beach chair you may have to get up early (6-7am)and reserve it with a towel or a personal clothing item, even when we left them behind and returned our items were still there.Resort food had a good variety and tasty, although we had some friends get sick after eating from the Chinese restaurant. On the beach you are offered often tours but with a polite no gracias they didn't insist. Because it is a big resort they have a train system which may not always be there as it is scheduled if they say 20mins double it. If you don't have a problem getting to know the resort and walking then this won't be a problem but it will be a long walk at times. But you are on vacation so take it all in.Spa - i had a facial and it was great. Although tardy by 30 mins. from my appt. scheduled time. The Jacuzzi's were awesome although you do have to make appt. for the time you want to go at.Overall I must say I was extremely impressed and would definitely recommend this resort!!
