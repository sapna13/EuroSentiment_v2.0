{"text":"Not very Majestic! Our Punta Cana vacation began with a nice landing at a beautiful airport! The drive to the hotel was about 25 mins, but it was not a scenic drive at all.All of the roads were broken down, and some new roads were under construction but you can tell that construction was at a halt, so who knows when they finish building some decent roads.Once there, the entrance to the hotel was not spectacular but the lobby was nice! We were immediately greeted with a tropical drink that was delicious! Check in took too long! We were there for about 30 mins and there was only one person in front of us.The vacation began with the wrong room. I paid for the Colonial Jr. Suite, and we got was a standard Jr. Suite (which doesn't come with room service). I made this aware to one of the managers and they told me that they had overbooked the hoteland they had nothing else available. I was offered free internet and a 25 min. massage, which was nice, but it didn't make up for the room. Anyways, we decided to put this aside and enjoy the vacation, and we did!The beach location is great! Very nice beach chairs!The hotel has 7 restaurants but only 2 were great, the Japanese and Chinese! The other ones were ok - a bit tasteless, not enough seasoning, and their desserts tasted like they were sugar-free. I wouldn't eat from the restaurant by the beach!It was completely open (which was nice) but there were flies all over the food, and there was no way to control it... very disgusting!The room was nice, not spectacular, but nice. I have stayed in 5 star hotels before and the Majestic wasn't up to par, as far as the look of their buildings. Many had concrete cracks, and they didn't pay much detail to construction, like the bathrooms, you could see a bad tile job. In the shower we couldn't control the hot\/cold water... it was either too hot or cold. The free internet that we were offered was a pain! Each day they made me go to the lobby for a new username andpassword...which was very far from our room. After getting the internet info, it wouldn't work... so I would have to get on the phone with tech support each time.The entertainment was horrible. They had some guys do some corny games... Not professional entertainment at all... not even close to what you see at a cruise ship!The pool was very nice!It was our anniversary... I asked them to do something special in our room that they... they said that they will fill up the tub with bubbles and rose pedals, but that I would have to buy the pedals...In conclusion the hotel was nice, but I was expecting so much more.
