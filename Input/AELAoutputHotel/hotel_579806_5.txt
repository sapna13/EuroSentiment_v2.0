{"text":"Very Miserable Melasti I am very surprised to see that some reviewers have rated the Melasti as a nice hotel. It is without a doubt the worst hotel we have ever stayed in.We were struggling to find accomodation in the Seminyak area and settled on the Melasti as it had 2 available rooms. My wife and I stayed in one of the Delux suites. It was very large with a decent balcony. The furniture and fittings were very old and in desparate need of upgrading. The linen was dirty, the walls were filthy and there were a lot of spider webs. The bathroom was a disaster, the toilet seat was broken, old dirty towels, low water pressure and the ill fitting shower curtain resulted in a soaking floor. My mother's room was shocking (it was not the one we were shown when viewing the hotel). It was very noisy - near a bar and busy road. The room door was glass paneled and light streamed in from the corridor. Needless to say, she did not sleep well. The room itself was disgusting, filthy walls, no bathplug, no plug for the kettle, the shower did not work, the bathroom tap came off in my mom's hand and when she tried to call the front desk, she realised the phone was was broken as well. (memories of the British comedy Fawlty Towers?)The breakfast was ok, nothing special - nice view of the sea from the restaurant. The swimming pool areas were ok but are ready for an upgrade. The hotel had run out of internet cards so were not able to use the service. The gardens were nice.Overall a terrible experience and I suggest you steer clear of the Fawlty Towers Melasti. It doesn't even deserve one star.
