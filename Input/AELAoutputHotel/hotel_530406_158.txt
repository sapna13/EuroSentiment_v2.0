{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My husband and I are in our mid forties and went to Ocean Sand Resort with another couple and girlfriend on Jan. 30th to Feb. 6th.The resort is absolutely beautiful and is a perfect size. Not too big and not too small.They greeted us with open arms. The entire staff was always smiling and saying Hola (hello in Spanish).ROOMSWe were very fortunate to have such beautiful rooms. We were in the last complex next to the beach. We were in the Elite Club rooms. My husband and I had a corner room that had two balconies attached to our room. We would sit on our deck in the morning and have a cup of coffee and look at the beach and ocean. Our rooms were very spacious. Our bathroom had a jacuzzi tub and corner glass shower. Our room was great. I am a very fussy person when it comes to cleanliness and I was thoroughly pleased with the room. I felt very comfortable and was very happy about our choice of resorts.POOLVery clean and always found a chair in the morning to reserve.Bar service was also available to you while you suntanned by very friendly staff. There was a very special pool bartender that we totally admired. RAMONE was his name. He was absolutely fantastic. Please treat him with great respect. He deserves to be acknowledged. He gave us great service and is such a nice, wonderful man that works very hard. BEACHVery beautiful and lots of room to be in the sun or shade. Get up early to reserve a spot. Please don't reserve a spot if you don't use it. This is very disrespectful to the other guests. You can also walk for miles along the beach for some exercise. BUFFETLots of variety with different theme dinners in the evening. Desserts were very bland, meals started to taste the same. The Lobster dinner at the beach ($35.00 per person) was outstanding. We would highly recommend this to everyone. The lobsters were absolutely huge. If you get tired of the buffet, try the a la carte restaurants. CASINOTypical small casino. Read reviews before we went and they said they were a total rip off and I have to tell you that I had a totally different experience. I put $20.00 in a nickle machine and won $876.00. That was an uncomfortable experience. I don't think this happens too often because I had 3 staff members surround me with walkie talkies and talked Spanish amongst each other while they were verifing my winnings. It took about 20 minutes before they would pay me out. I went the next night and put in $20.00 and won another $70.00. I was very lucky to be ahead $906.00.ENTERTAINMENTWe did not make it to one evening show. We were in bed by 9:00 everynight because we were always up so early and on the beach all day. Very tiring to lay in the sun, cocktailing, swimming and eating all day long. (ha, ha,ha)THINGS I WOULD RECOMMENDDon't overpack. The airport charges you $12.00 US for every kilo that you are over. Since there is such high humidity, your clothes will weigh more. Take alot of $1.00 bills to tip. The cleaning ladies appreciate alot of toiletries like toothpaste, stuff from the dollar stores, candies, chips etc. If your are from Canada, they love Canadian souveniers. Take your own snacks like Pringle chips chocolate bars etc. Chips are $5.00 US and chocolate bars are $2.00- 3.00. Take your own water toys, air mattress, frisbees, water balls, sand toys if you are into building sandcastles. Take Bounce sheets to put in your suitcases and in your drawers. Things can start to smell mildewy because of the humidity and ocean air. The shopping is quite poor. There really is nothing to buy except those cheesy souveniers. Take lots of sunscreen. Remember you are closer to the equator and the sun is very intense. Trust me, I usually use an accelerator and never burn but I used a suncreen with a SPF 8.I would highly recommend this resort to everyone that I know.For our second week in Punta Cana, we stayed at Grand Palladium Punta Cana and were very dissappointed with many situations that arose with that resort.
