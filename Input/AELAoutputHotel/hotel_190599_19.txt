{"text":"Great Room, Mediocre Value! My partner  I stayed here for 3 nights on our recent month-long trip around Europe. We arrived at the hotel in the evening  were checked in without any hassles. We thought it was in a bit of a commercial-type area, without any local shops as such, but it was within seconds of the metro,  within easy distance of many attractions around Berlin.Our room was fairly large with huge double-glazed windows looking out onto the street. The air conditioning was provided at no extra change,  the beds (two singles pushed together to make a king) were very comfortable. There was a mini-bar, TV two desks, a wardrobe  a counter for your baggage. The bathroom was large-ish, with a wheelchair friendly shower. It was all quite nice, if a little anaemic. It seemed more like a business-orientated hotel, although the staff did their best to help us with directions  the like. The restaurant  bar were a bit pricey, but there was a cool 'outdoor bar' - an indoor area without a roof, so you could actually sit in the sun - see it to believe it. There was also an internet computer in the lobby but you can only access it by using your credit card details.We scored this room through a website that was offering cheap rooms at the time (I guess empty rooms don't make money) - while I thought we received exceptional value for money (we had a superior room too  it was still ridiculously cheap), when we saw the price that the room usually was, we just about died of shock - I cannot imagine paying that much for what it was, although I am sure that we would have stuck to budget rather than location if that had been the case.We enjoyed our stay there a lot, but it would have been nice if breakfast was included (you could buy it separately but it was also pricey). Recommended for those with a high budget unless you can get a deal!
