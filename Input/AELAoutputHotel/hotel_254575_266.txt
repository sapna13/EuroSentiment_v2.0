{"text":"Could not have been a better experience This was our third trip to London. We picked the Luna  Simone based on these Tripadvisor reviews. Might have been one of the best travel decisions we ever made. Everything good that you will read in the reviews is true. Do not let the rare criticism scare you away! We lucked out and got one of the front rooms with a small balcony. Don't be afraid to ask. Street noise was not a problem. Sure the breakfast menu says orange juice OR cereal, but if you ask, they'll bring you both. These are truly accommodating folks. Scramble the eggs, skip the beans, go vegetarian. I never saw them refuse a request. The room may be relatively small, but you are not going to London to sit around in a hotel room. It is very clean; so's the bath. There are extra baths in the hall which were remarkably convenient. Wireless internet is available on the lower floors and a public computer is available in a small room off the hall on the Simone side. The Pimlico tube is closer than Victoria, but the convenience of the #24 bus can't be beat, especially if you buy an unlimited travel card. You can literally catch the bus in front of the hotel to take you to the tube stop. A really good traditional pub, the Constitution (I believe) is right around the corner -- as is a better than average Thai restaurant. An ATM is just a block and a half away. Ask at the desk. They are very helpful, agreeable people. All the great things we saw and did in London, but what we most want to share with our friends is our discovery of the Luna  Simone.
