{"text":"Great time at the Princess We have just returned from the Punta Cana Princess having spent a wonderful week with 6 of our friends. We have been to this hotel on 3 previous occasions and again were not disappointed. There is nothing negative to say about the whole holiday from our point of view. If you are looking to go to a big resort, walk for miles to get to the beach, bar, restaurants or your room, line up at the buffet and bar and like the disco at night, then this is not the resort for you.The Princess has 270 rooms so everything you need is close at hand. The beach is beautiful and the pool is well maintained. All the lounge chairs are comfortable and plenty and there is lots of shade.The food is good and the bars stock premium liquor for Regency Club guests. The other Princess resorts have a la carte restaurants that are available to the PCP visitors but we have found that they are no better than the 3 at the PCP.What sets the PCP apart we believe are the incredibly good staff. They are the friendliest people that we have found in all our travels. Year after year they remember us and there doesn't seem to be much staff turnover.There have been many improvements since our last visit to the beach bar area and the lobby is now undergoing a renovation. The hotel is 5 years old and it appears that mangement is working to keep everything in good repair.This may not be the place for the very young who can get bored easily but for us retired people it's the perfect place to relax, enjoy the beach and the company of our friends.Ron  Judy Toronto ","annotations":[{"endOffset":743,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":736},{"endOffset":767,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":763}]}
