{"text":"An amazing find - the best of both worlds. LOCATION:This hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station, and about 15-20 minutes from the 'main' spots of the ponte rialto and the square. The walk is very nice, however, along some nice streets with plenty of shops to look at on the way.It is also in a more local area of Venice, so there are plenty of great value priced cafes in the area that are great for lunch. The gelato is also the cheapest in this area, which we found very important. HOTEL EXPERIENCE:We didn't think we had the right address when we first saw the hotel, as it is not much to look at from the outside. However, as soon as you step inside it is like walking into the lap of luxury. Everything is immaculately decorated with amazing tile, glass fixtures, etc. etc. It feels like you are in a 5 star hotel! There is always someone at the front desk too, which was great for such a small hotel. Our room was also decorated in a kind of antique Victorian style and the bathroom was simply amazing. Words have a hard time describing how nice it felt. The beds were hard, but every bed we stayed in across Europe was hard, so no surprise there. The breakfast was also included, and was made up of brioche (a fruit filled sticky croissant), croissants, buns, cereal, 3 different kinds of juice, and any kind of coffee you want (espresso, cafe au lait, latte, etc.). It was VERY tasty and a great way to start the day. They definitely pamper you the entire time. VALUE:Compared to the prices were were getting for other places that were much lower quality, this was probably the best bang for your buck in the entire city. If we go back we will DEFINITELY be staying here again.
