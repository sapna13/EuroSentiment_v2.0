{"text":"Very nice hotel in great neighborhood We stayed here for five nights this summer and had a great experience. The first night, our second story room did not have A\/C so they provided a fan, which served well. However, when they could not fix the A\/C on the following day they moved us into a (larger) room on the first floor. We preferred the higher floor, but A\/C was more important since it was in August. Only problem with this room is that it is directly behind the reception desk in the lobby and the person there has a chair that scrapes every time they move it -- we suggest to the hotel management that they get a chair with wheels or put the one they have on a rug or carpet -- a fairly easy fix to make the customers in that room happier!!The staff in the lobby were extremely helpful! All of them spoke English very well. Another reviewer has said that there was no place for any extra luggage, however we were able to have our extra luggage (which we did not need to access during our stay) kept in a closet in the lobby, so didn't have to worry about it taking up space in our room. Tips for any one planning on staying here: There IS ice in the lobby - just ask for it; the windows are very well insulated as far as keeping the noise out which we very much appreciated; several excellent cafes within two blocks; L'Open Tour bus stop only about one-and-a-half blocks away (you can almost use this as your local bus with a several-day pass, which is what we did); there is a bodega-type store a few doors down from the hotel entrance when you want some cheap eats\/drinks; we had breakfast brought to our room in the mornings, and it was MORE than adequate and brought at exactly the time we had requested.Another suggestion for the management: Install some type of partition at the shower head end of the tub, a glass wall would work well. Without anything currently there during our stay, water from our showers went all over the sink\/counter every time we bathed. This can be solved fairly easily and would make the bathrooms a lot more user-friendly.
