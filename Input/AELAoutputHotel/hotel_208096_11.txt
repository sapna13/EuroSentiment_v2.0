{"text":"Paris, pas de quoi and regardez! Just like Eloise....We lived in the 6eme a few years back, before children, and were looking for somewhere child friendly to stay - we couldn't have picked a better spot. Our small girls were delighted as the location, on the Quai des Grands Augustins, is just where Eloise stays when she goes to Paris. The rooms are super, with a mini kitchen, and much more modern and luxurious than we were expecting. The studios were spacious, not too different in size from the smaller one bedroom apartments. If you have older children, I would recommend the larger one beds, ask when you reserve.The staff were a further plus, nothing was too much trouble - unusual in Paris! Luckily for us, we hit a couple of days of hot weather, not so fortunately the air con wasn't working... The staff did what they could (including upgrading our room), but we had a rotten nights sleep. A real shame, because otherwise it was perfect.As for the area, just walk around, the best of Paris is on your doorstep. We bought a two day Batobus pass (36 euros for the four of us), but otherwise didn't use any public transport. The Jardins de Luxembourg are a must with small children, take a picnic from Gerard Mulot, fab boulangerie by the Marche de St Germain. If you are staying a few days, or hit poor weather, head to the Cite des Sciences et Industries. It's a very hands on museum, with loads to do for children age 4 - 16.If you are considering a break in Paris with children, do it! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Citadines St Germain, a hotel with the convenience of an apartment, in a great location. ","annotations":[]}
