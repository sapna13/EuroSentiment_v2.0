{"text":"It's Friggin Freezing, Mr. Bigglesworth No question the location is a jewel - literally next door to the theater where Rent is performed. We're talking 7th and West 41st here. On a pleasant day, you really can walk fro Penn Station. The hotel is 8 blocks due north. The staff is very pleasant, but when you enter you know this is a younger crowd who works here as the lounge is ungodly loud. I mean ungodly loud. I fled to my 3rd floor room. I had been warned the rooms were small, and they are: 10 x 10. My suitcase barely fit through. The room was in strong need of repainting as scuff marks and peeling pain were evident. The room was very cold and no matter what temperature I set the thermostat at, the room never got above 65 degrees. Space is tight, so the TV and DVD player are mounted high on the wall. There is a mini fridge in the room, although I don't understand why. This isn't the kind of a hotel you'd stay more than a night or two. There is no bathtub, only an open glass-wall shower, and the shower head is approximately 10' above floor level. So, you can't adjust it. There is a storage are for your clothes, it's compact but well organized and has a complimentary safe. There are no black-out drapes, only vinyl roll blinds and hanging curtains. The desk is glass, so if you bring any bluetooth mice or keyboards - better have something to put down underneath them or forget using them! There is no wifi access at the hotel; but the wired internet access is free, fast, and very reliable. The chair is a small, wooden desk chair and very uncomfortable. There's not a tremendous number of electrical outlets in the room, but there were enough for me to power two laptops and charge my cell phone and headset without tripping. I ordered room service one night which was very quick and the food was very, very hot. The continental breakfast service consists of rolls and bagels in the morning with assorted beverages.It's a good place for a night, and possibly better if you're by yourself. It's simply too small for more than one person to be comfortable. The staff is excellent and despite the noise level, the lounge does a very good room service.
