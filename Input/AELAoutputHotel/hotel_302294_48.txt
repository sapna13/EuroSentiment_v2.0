{"text":"Pan Pacific - great for business... My experince of this hotel is that while it is very nice, it is very much business orientated with prices to reflect someone else footing the bill. We were on our honeymoon and received a room upgrade to a panoramic view overlooking part of the city. The room had all the ammenities you would expect from a 5 star hotel, and some I'd never seen before - such as a sliding panel allowing you to connect a laptop\/USB etc to the large LCD TV - along with a comprehensive set of video\/audio leads to hook up your MP3 player to the in room speaker\/TV system - a nice touch, but again shows the empasis towards business users. Another nice gadget was the remote controlled blinds\/curtains. The 28th floor where our room was was reached by external capsule lifts. I don't suffer from vertigo but felt myself hanging on a few times!!. The hotel is part of a shopping\/hotel complex. I felt the shops were all more expensive than home (UK) and was very much geared to the Japanese shopper. This whole complex was expensive proably due to its trendy shops, boutiques and eating places - there are much cheaper places to eat and drink....I felt the food and drinks at the hotel were outrageously priced - especially for holiday makers - again, if a business is paying its not such a problem - a point I made on my customer satisfaction form. I was informed they were competitive with other hotels in the area - but as I later found not competitive with hotels in less trendy areas. As a result, the bars and restaurants were never full and only sparsley filled with busniess people on phones  laptops and as such didn't have a very socialble or relaxing atmosphere. By going to Boat or Clarke Quay - about 10 mins cheap taxi - there are plenty or bars  restaurants offering large discounts and freebies to get you into their establishment - all have a great atmosphere and are very reasonable considering the expensive drinks in Singapore. When I asked the concierge if there were any good places to eat - he didn't know or didn't want to tell - as he wasn't very helpful. Overall, nice hotel, but wouldn't rush back but ideal for business users. Facilities too expensive for holidays if you are on a budget.
