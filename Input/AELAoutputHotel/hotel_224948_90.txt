{"text":"A great hotel We had only two nights at the Omni in May. We were on our way home to NZ after 6 weeks travelling in Europe laden with luggage!What a pleasure it was to arrive at the Omni after negotiating the chaos of Los Angeles Airport! We arrived at 8.30 am and our room was not available but hotel reception couldn't have been more helpful in storing bags, offering bathrooms and recommending places for coffee or breakfast. The manager personally hurried up the availability of our room and had us safely ensconced by 10am.Our room was a standard king but so spacious by European hotel room standards. It was immaculately clean and well appointed. Our only negative comment would be that there was no kettle for boiling water for a cup of tea. There was a coffee maker available but to just boil water in that took forever! The bed was large and firm with comfortable pillows and crisp linen. Nice range of toiletries in the bathroom which were replaced twice daily if needed-a nice touch.Our room was facing into a central area so only view was of other buildings. The upside of this was that we got no road noise whatsoever-Lovely and quiet so would probably request same on return visit.Hotel is in financial area so if here on holiday as we were, not too many restaurants or cafes in the immediate vicinity. This was a bit of an issue especially as we were there on a Sunday night and a Monday which was a public holiday so virtually nothing around. North beach though is only a short taxi ride away.The strength of this hotel though was its outstanding staff. They were respectful, extremely helpful and willing to answer all queries and wishes in a friendly courteous way.Wold we stay here again?---A resounding yes.
