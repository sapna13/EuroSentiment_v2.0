{"text":"An amazing vacation This was our first experience going to Punta Cana after going 5 years in a row to Cuba. Each country has its own characteristics and we enjoyed both. The Occidental Grand where we stayed was amazing. The overall resort was really something to be seen. Although we had read a number of negative reviews about this resort, we thought that we would not let that discourage our vacation.The hotel was well kept and very clean. Everyday you saw a number of staff keeping the grounds in tip-top shape. Although we had requested 2 connecting rooms because we are a family of 5, we didn't get connecting rooms, but we got rooms side by side. The rooms each had a king size bed, a sitting area with balcony and a large full bathroom with a tub. We requested to be on the third floor which we got and the view was great (maybe just a few too many stairs).The pools (3) were always cleaned and kept free of any garbage. Of course, my children enjoyed the pool bar immensely which by the way us adults got to enjoy as well.We got to try some new drinks such as a Tiki Tiki, Banana Mamma and a Melissa.We had no problem finding something to eat at the Hotel Buffet Restaurant. Every night seemed to have a theme. We even got to enjoy the all Canadian\/American meal - hams, hots, nuggetts, and home made turkey. Overall you never went hungry when at the Buffet Restaurant.The a-la-carte Restaurants left something to be desired. The steak (brazilian ) restaurant left you with an empty stomach as you were served every piece of meat off of a sword and dare you ask for seconds!! Vegetables served at the table were barely enough for one person. To sum it up, we enjoyed a great stone baked pizza at the Pizzaria after the steak restaurant.The beach was amazing. The sand was as white as snow and the ocean was as blue as the sky. No rocks were around and no sea shells to be found. There were chairs available at all hours of the day, so it didn't matter what time you went down to the ocean. The ocean was a bit wavey but nothing that couldn't be tolerated.Overall we really enjoyed our vacation at The Occidental Grand Flamenco and would recommend to anyone to stay there . Its a great family oriented hotel and many things to do for all ages. We would recommend you take the Bavaro Runner excursion. We had a great time and know that you would too!
