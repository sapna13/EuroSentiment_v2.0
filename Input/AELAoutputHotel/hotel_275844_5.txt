{"text":"Friendly service. Great location. We stayed at this hotel, along with another couple, for 2 nights in July and had a very enjoyable stay. The location is excellent! We arrived in Florence via train and walked to the hotel - normally about a 15 minute walk. It took us a little longer as it was quite hot and humid out which slowed us down a bit. The hotel is located one floor up from the street and has an elevator√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√®t√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ small, holds about 3 people but this is typical for Europe and a bonus as not all hotels in Italy have one. We were warmly greeted by Rosanna at the reception desk and were quickly checked into our rooms. My husband and I had a huge room with a queen bed and single bed and lots of space besides. It was spotlessly clean and had a recently updated bathroom (shampoo\/soap supplied). The other couple had a much smaller room and their bathroom had a bidet in the shower but overall also very clean and similarly equipped. (Note that room size can vary greatly in older European hotels. Many were originally large residences that were converted to hotels with various units created out of whatever rooms they had to work with, not all of the same size). The rooms had safes, bar fridges and air conditioning which was much appreciated given the time of year. The only complaint was that the bath towels are too thin.Prior to our trip to Florence one of our traveling companions called Rosanna to make reservations to see some of the attractions. Rosanna was more than happy to make the arrangements and have them ready for our arrival. We highly recommend that you do this or you may wait hours in line to see the major attractions √à√\u2020\u2022?with a reservation you can skip the lineup! Generally the hotel is in a great location and within walking distance of the Duomo, Galleria Accademia, San Lorenzo leather market, train station, restaurants and shops. Breakfast was complimentary with the rooms and every day had a good selection of bread, pastries, cheeses, meats, boiled eggs, fruit, cereal, yogurt, tea and juices.The cheerful staff made us coffee to order, including lattes and cappuccinos (delicious!). Free internet was available in the hotel which we used several times. Overall the hotel was great. The location was excellent, the staff were very friendly, more than willing to help with reservations or give us directions or information, the rooms were comfortable. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° highly recommend it to anyone who visits Florence.
