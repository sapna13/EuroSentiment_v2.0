{"text":"Good hotel, centrally located I stayed at the Marriott Aug 19-24 for a travel agent convention. The hotel was nice and served it purpose. The toiletries were Bath and Body Works products so if you forget your shampoo and conditioner you are covered although don't forget your hair dryer theirs doesn't have a lot of power. Rooms were clean and the beds were VERY comfortable probably one of the most comfortable I have stayed in. The hotel itself is nice although the convention center is confusing...many of us likened it to a cruise ship. You always ended up in a different tower.The bar in the lobby is large and they serve very good drinks, although service can be slow at times when you really think it shouldn't be. I did have a waitress spill a glass of wine on me but the hotel was more than happy to pick up the dry cleaning bill and the waitress very embarrassed and apologetic.The Starbucks in the hotel is only open from 6:00am to 6:00pm and thats a rough adjustment for those of us who like to have an evening latte. Everyone in my group did not car for the food that the hotel served for conventions, it could have been much better.The convention staff was very attentive, courteous and gracious and gave out gentle reminders to people who would tip chairs forward to rest against the tables that it was not safe to do so because the legs stick out the back and clip people as they walk by.It is centrally located and about two blocks from Bourbon Street. All in all it is a good, clean location. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1461,"mention":"Bourbon","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bourbon_biscuit"],"startOffset":1454}]}
