{"text":"Practically perfect in every way! What everyone says is true. This place is a gem. The staff \/owners could write a book on how to do it right. They are gracious, helpful and friendly without being overly familiar or unprofessional. They know their city backwards and make fantastic recommendations for restaurants, etc.First of all, the location could only be better if it was situated on the roof of the Duomo! You are one block from the famous leather market and 3 blocks from the Duomo and only a short 10 minute stroll to the train station or bus station. Everything is within easy walking distance.We had a quad room that was almost 2 rooms in one. The main room had a king size bed and the ante room, separated by pillars housed two single beds. The kids loved being in their own room while still really in ours. Quite a unique set up. The room also included a flat screen TV (quite large, too) and a DVD player. Free internet and a laptop were available in the lobby.The bathroom was very large with a deep soaking tub, heated towel rack and powerful, hot shower. As noted by many of the other posters, the towels are different all right but they are very absorbent so no complaints.The hotel is deceptively large and extends back into very quiet courtyard. The shutters on the room make it pitch black, even in the daytime - perfect if you need a nap. Or open them right up for some fresh air. Breakfast, served in a large dining area, is plentiful with cakes, breads, yogurt, eggs, cheese, ham, freshly brewed cappuccino, espresso, etc. Basically whatever you might want. While I didn't have it, my kids swear that the hot chocolate was so good it tasted like a melted chocolate bar.All in all, it is very hard to find fault with this very comfortable hotel. My family is in complete agreement that this was our favourite of the 5 hotels we stayed at during our trip.
