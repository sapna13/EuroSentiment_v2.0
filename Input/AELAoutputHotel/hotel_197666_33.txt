{"text":"Lovely hotel We stayed 6 to 10 October 2008. The position of the hotel is not the most picturesque, being in a back street about 1\/2 mile from the Eiffel Tower but the hotel itself is superb. As other reviews I have read have said, the rooms, like in most city hotels, are not large but they are finished to the highest standard. It looks as though the hotel has been completely refitted not just a paint job. Everything from the tiles on the walls to the furniture and the linen looked brand new. Everything worked perfectly in the bathroom and the separate toilet, from the large rain shower to the twin washbasins, and the BO TV was fine, except that there were only two English channels - BBC Prime, showing endless repeats of 'The Family' etc., and CNN news. The bed was reasonably large and very comfortable, although the pillows presented the usual problem of one was too little, two were too much.The only criticism we have of the room is the size of the wardrobe\/closet for hanging your clothes. It is tiny - around a foot wide with only three hangers in it (take some of your own). There are also some shelves, a small fridge and a safe built in as well so we could only take a few shirts etc. out at a time to hang up.The area around the hotel had many restaurants and a supermarket and the Metro station (La Motte Picquet Grenelle) around the corner was on three different lines and was very convenient - we went everywhere on the Metro, very cheaply (the only thing that was cheap in Paris!).We thought EUR15 was expensive for breakfast before we got there but we looked around the local restaurants and whilst you could find cheaper options, they generally only included juice, a croissant and a pastry for about EUR9 or 10. The hotel buffet included (very good) fresh fruit, toast, fresh juice, yoghurt, cereals etc. as well as croissants and pastries, so was much better value.The people who staffed the hotel were always friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay here, even though we found everything in Paris very expensive.
