{"text":"You will be a prisoner at a nice place. It is $ 35.00 taxi from FW\/Dallas airport. I was there for four days for seminar. Hotel property is top notch. They come across as very elegant. Small things they do not do (fresh flowers) you would not notice if you have not stayed at Ritz or Westins. I considered my room smallish but well appointed. They have electrical outlet challenges. I rented microwave and had to put on floor and unplug lamp. Also coffee pot must be moved into bath. Staff is wonderful. Pool lovely and workout very nice. I found my bed a bit stiff and feather pillows too flat but these are very personal tastes. I was never made aware of any shuttle or I would have used it. Got three limo names from desk. I usually take one out for two hours in strange city to sight see. The min. was 4 at 85.00 per. I did not leave property as Dallas was 6 or so more miles away than airport and was not going to spend that much on taxi. Wish I had rental car!! There is only one restaurant and the food is great. The lunch buffet was 15 and well worth it. My room service was prompt and expensive as always. I could find no phone book but concierge had two pizza places that deliver. The gift shop is tiny but has most anything you might need. If you care they have starbucks. The bar is upscale and has tables el fresco over looking the pool which is nice spot at twilight. Weekend rates are a steal compared to simular properties in other cities. This would be a great place for romantic interlude. The bar has decent appetizers and will make stuff to go. Oh! I forgot one very pleasent moment. I was sunning myself and just about to go find a drink a lovely young man brout round a tray of plastic glasses filled with ice water with fresh lemons that really hit the spot!!
