{"text":"a perfect, yes perfect, small hotel A perfect, yes perfect hotel. O.k., can anything truly be perfect? But as close as one can get, this hotel, and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ staff, are.We spent a wonderful and all to typical rainy winter week (January √à√\u2020\u2022?7) in Amsterdam, and the room, room 7, was such a wonderful and welcoming place to look forward to, to sit in and watch the beautiful views, (yes, there really are seven bridges) and to relax and really feel Amsterdam. We were lucky enough to see some of the other rooms during our stay, as a matter of fact as we came and went, Gunter, who is justifiably proud of the establishment and its contents, would ask, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√âould you like to see such and such a room, it is open at the moment√à√\u2020\u2022? so we would. I can say that the website is very accurate in its representation of the rooms, both in size and decoration. All different, all lovely.Be aware that all small Amsterdam hotels have stairs, and few if any have elevators. These are old buildings, protected by law from changes such as elevators. It is truly part of the charm, and memory, of amsterdam to navigate the infamous stairs! And i mean navigate!We were treated to the wonderful breakfasts, tea in the afternoon, wonderful conversations with Gunter and staff, ideas of things to do and see, help finding restaurants, all of our needs met and more.One day, caught in a devastating downpour close to home, we rushed back to the hotel, soaking, no, dripping wet. Before i could get the key from my pocket, the door was flung open and there was Gunter, towels in hand, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√™ome in come in, let√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ get you dry√à√\u2020\u2022? says he! When i asked how he could have possibly been at the door with towels waiting, he said he had just happened to look out the window and saw us running in the rain, and grabbed a couple of towels.I can not guarantee this type of experience for you, but this is typical of the level of service we had from our arrival to our departure. Perfect. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1208,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1205}]}
