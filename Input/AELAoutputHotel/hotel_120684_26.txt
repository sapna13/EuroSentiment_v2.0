{"text":"Very Unrelaxing Stay at the Outrigger We stayed at the Outrigger Waikiki for the first part of our honeymoon. The hotel, itself, was nice with a lot of amenities, fantastic beach front, nice restaurants (very good breakfast buffet at Dukes), and very friendly valets. However, this was not the hotel experience I had expected when I booked. Upon checking in, we were told that the ocean front w\/ king bed room that we had booked was unavailable. We were forced to pony up another $120 per night to be upgraded to an ocean front suite. The room itself was very nice, and fairly large for Waikiki being a corner-room. However, we found that we not only overlooked the ocean, but were also overlooking the construction going on next door at the Royal Hawaiian. We were woken up at 6:30 AM for the next 4 days by the sound of heavy machinery and jack-hammers\/saws\/drills. Sitting out on the lanai was a near impossibility due to the sound. There also was some maintenance work being done within the Outrigger, itself. I literally jumped while in the shower when I heard what sounded like a drill coming through the bathroom wall. When I called the front desk at 9 AM to ask about the construction going on within the hotel, I was told that there wasn't any and that they had no idea what the noise could be. After double-checking with maintenance, I was finally told that there was, in fact, work being done on the room next to me. I had asked to speak to a manager to either get my room moved again to the other side of the hotel, or get a discount on the higher rate I was paying for this upgraded room. I was told that the manager wasn't available, but would call me later that day. By 7PM, I had yet to receive a call. I decided to call back, and finally spoke to the manager. He was not helpful at all. When I asked to move, he told me there were no other ocean front rooms available. When I asked for a discount, he basically laughed at me and said there was no way he could lower the rate on my room any further. After becoming somewhat irritated with him, I hung up and started looking for another hotel. After finding a room at the Moana Surfrider, my wife persuaded me to tough it out at the Outrigger for a couple more days rather than move all of our things next door. However, if i had it to do all over again, I would have moved to the Moana Surfrider and enjoyed a couple of peaceful days in Waikiki.
