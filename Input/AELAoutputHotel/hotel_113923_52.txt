{"text":"Fabulous Stay at the Kabuki! My husband and I just came back from a 5 night stay at the Kabuki. It was the most wonderful hotel we have ever stayed in. We have stayed in other nice hotels in San Francisco and other cities but this one was the best. The staff were ever so courteous and accommodating. At first we were given a smaller King bedroom on the 16th floor which was quite nice but was not what we had booked (we had booked the larger renovated King corner room that had a sitting area and 2 glass doors\/windows with balcony). When we brought this to their attention, they immediately moved us to the 15th floor corner King room and offered to move our belongings. I am not sure why there was a mix up but they took care of it promptly and graciously. Both rooms were clean and well taken care of and have a nice Japanese decor. The spaciousness and comfort of the sitting area with chaise lounge, chair and glass coffee table was a welcome treat after walking the streets of S.F. The deep japanese tub soothed our muscles and mind--no need for a hot tub spa! I especially loved opening the soji screens in the morning to look out over the city and mountains. It is also pretty at night with the city lights. Having a covered though narrow balcony to step out on to feel the fresh air was nice too even when it was raining. The housekeeping was exceptional.  Further staff accommodation\/kindness: One evening we inquired about where to buy a bottle of wine. When the front desk staff said it would be quite a walk and it was raining, they then produced a bottle for us, no charge! Only 3 minor areas would enhance the room: 1. Put a sliding door to close off the bathroom 2. Have a chest of drawers for clothing 3. Offer black and green tea with the in-room coffee set up. Check specials as prices can vary. Our cost was $125 but 2 weeks later I saw that it was $179. It would have been worth it for that room but also would have been beyond our budget.
