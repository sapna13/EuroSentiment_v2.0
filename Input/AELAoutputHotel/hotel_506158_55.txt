{"text":"Smart hotel, a little let down by precise and unemotional service We came to the 1898 for our 25th Wedding Anniversary and made the choice based on the position of the hotel and the roof pool and bar (and the generally positive reviews). Overall not disappointed,but there are few minor issues that mark the hotel down a little. First the positives:Great position, really easy to get to from the airport - the bus stops around 500 metres away - and central for everything, right next to La Rambla. The roof pool (for dipping) and the bar are really great; they made a great Negroni - very strong. The drinks are expensive but you are paying for the fact you are on a roof with really comfortable seats and a good view. Food is also pricey and not hugely original. One evening we ordered a selection of meats for √à√\u2020√ü?3 and received a plate of one type of ham! Staff on the roof are very willing but service is a bit slow if there are a lot of people. Bedroom was large (Privilege Room) with a fantastically comfortable bed; room was well sound proofed with efficient A\/C. Huge choice of pillows if important to you.Free newspaper (laser printed) every day.We didn't use the spa in the basement but it looked good if a little small.Now the minor niggles, which did not detract from our stay but should be ironed out based on the prices they charge:Free tea is offered every day in the lobby between 5 and 7 pm. The lobby and bar lack atmosphere (everyone is on the roof!). There was no one around to serve the tea and when the barman eventually was found we were not offered a choice of tea (there were 2 types) but the tea was poured and it was pretty awful!One of the bathroom taps kept falling off and we were only supplied 1 small piece of soap (both these issues were rectified the day the hotel was notified) The A\/C control is inside the main cupboard: It's very hard to read the control and if any staff member needs to get at it they have to go into your cupboard where all your stuff is stored - not a great piece of planning.No biscuits in the room with the coffee - a bit penny pinching.We did not eat breakfast at the hotel (v. pricey) but there are loads of places outside - even a Starbucks in the hotel building if you like their coffee!The staff at the main desk are polite and efficient but as has been mentioned by other reviewers they do what is necessary and no more. That little extra touch is missingOverall we would stay again in one of their standard rooms and spend all moments at the hotel on the roof, which is the highlight.One other thing; Eat at Alkimia restaurant, Industria 79 behind La Sagrada Familia. Fantastic chef - and yet again precise, cool service - must be a Barcelona trait.
