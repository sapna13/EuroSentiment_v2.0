{"text":"Unexpectedly great! My fiance and I just returned from a 4 night visit to Amsterdam. We stayed at the NH City Centre, which was booked in conjunction with airfare in a package from covacations.com. We liked the location. A little alleyway over were the tram stops, which, once we figured out how to take them, was very convenient. From the tram stop, it's only about two or three stops away from Leidsplein, a fun area with more restaurants and shops. The hotel is very close to the Spui Square, which had a few bars, coffeeshops, and restaurants nearby. The street the hotel itself is on has great restaurants: of note, an Indonesian restaurant across the street called Kantjil (definitely try the Rijstaftel) and a Dutch restaurant directly across the way (can't remember the name) that had delicious traditional Dutch food. In terms of things to do, Dam Square is about a 5 minute walk, with several shopping streets close as well. Magna Plaza is a nice shopping center to check out. When we travel, we love to check out the supermarket, so stop by an Albert Heijns store! The room itself was simply furnished with a modern color scheme. We had room 503 which was sort of awkwardly wedged in a corner, but the room itself was not cramped. There were tea making ammenities, a bottle each of still and sparkling water for purchase, along with a minifridge (no minibar in there for us though!). The bed was really comfortable. We never checked out their pillow menu but thought it interesting that it was an option. The bathroom was nice. My fiance's concern with hotels in Europe is that the shower stalls (or curtains) are claustrophobic, but we had no problem here. Their stall was basically just a glass partition from the toilet, with ample space to slip under the shower head. (We liked it so much that we were thinking to remodel our bathroom similarly!) They have their own line of colorful green and yellow toiletries (though I didn't really care for its fragrance), along with a comb, brush, loofah, sponge, and sewing kit. Their breakfast buffet was superb! There was a great assortment of rolls, cold cuts, cheeses, fruit and juices, yogurt, along with bacon and sausage, scrambled and hardboiled egg, tiny pancake bites, even apple pie and spanish tortilla! Sounds funny, but my favorite part of breakfast was their coffee machine. You put a little cup underneath, press the cafe au lait button, and it's the best coffee to start your morning!I think I've covered the basics, or rather the most important points. There is a computer for internet access in a corner of the lobby. You can ask the desk for a 15 minute complimentary voucher once for the duration of your stay. The staff is great and sincerely tries to make your stay pleasant. The hotel definitely made our stay excellent. We would not hesitate to book here again when we come back to Amsterdam.
