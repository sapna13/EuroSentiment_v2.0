{"text":"Great stay but one issue Booked directly with the Hotel and stayed over New Year. Emailed them requesting a car service from the Airport and received a prompt reply. Service was very efficient at the hotel desk in the airport to the car.The Hotel is right next to the Mongkok MTR subway and transport links are truly excellent both to the airport and Hong Kong island. Mongkok is busy, with a very high people density.I'd booked a suite on their club floor and hence checked-in at the Club Lounge on 36th which was pleasant change from the normal hotel hassle. The club itself has great views and the service from the butlers is excellent.The room itself is a little bit on the small size, but not a big issue. Everything was of very high quality, including the plasma tv! The restaurant on the ground floor for breakfast was excellent as was the gym\/swimming pool facilities.The only issue we encountered was that my wife suffered from food poisoning - presumably at the hands of hotel food given we'd only eaten in the hotel for the previous 24hrs.The hotel staff responded extremely well, getting an english speaking doctor (actually he had trained as a doctor in Birmingham, UK!) and paying for him. However, a day and half was knocked out of our holiday because of this.I've previously stayed at the JW Marriot at Admiralty, Hong Kong island which was more convenient as a base for access to both Kowloon and Central. However, Langham Place is a very good hotel (and more reasonably priced that the top hotels on the island) so as long as your happy to be put out by 10min or so travel, I'd highly recommend staying here.
