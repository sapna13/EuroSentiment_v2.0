{"text":"Travelers be Aware of Dreams Punta Cana Resourt I would like to share my experience about staying at Dreams Punta Cana Resort. When you pay about $1500 a person you expect a service in return that corresponds to this amount. In fact you get nothing even close. You planing to get away and relax but the most relaxed people at the resort were staff. My adventure started then when I opened a door to my room and found that someone have already occupies it. On my request to get a room I was promised, I was tolled that me, my business partner and her 6 years old daughter have to sleep in one bad. Another disappointment brought to me that fact that there is not going to be Internet in our apartment, in fact there was no Internet at the hotel at all. Even though it was advertised and when I called to the hotel from Toronto I was assured that Internet exists. Imagine for a moment that you run an Internet enterprise with all its client's emails, requests and accounts, you need to respond quickly if someone's credit card declines or your partner needs the monthly report tomorrow morning. Other than that the weather was awesome and the ocean was refreshing and relaxing but that had nothing to do with the hotel. My advise is - that you don't trust advertising, ask someone who's been there, someone who can tell you from their own experience what one particular hotel is like. As for me I will never jeopardize my vacation by going to Dreams Punta Cana hotel ever again. ","annotations":[]}
