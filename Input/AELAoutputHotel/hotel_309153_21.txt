{"text":"Romantic Gateway!!! Actually i stayed there twice already! First on 2004 and the second one recently on April 2007. The first time i went there was for my honeymoon. I stayed in Ayung River Villa with spectacular view! The most great experience for me is their Mango Tree Spa. Totally unique spa experience that i never see anywhere else before. They also use this natural products for their spa which suitable for my sensitive skin. The staffs are really kind and helpful for arranging our first trip in Bali. They also has great food there. The best time would be in the morning where you take breakfast with spectacular view of the hills, rice paddies and the river. I still have this great impression on my second time to stay there. I stayed in other villa which is Duplex Pool Villa, it was different villa which is more spacious and consist of 2 storeys but i still feel the romantic arrangement there. On this second stay, I found this romantic candlelight dinner on the lobbypond and it was a perfect romantic arrangement. Scattered flowers on the pond, gleaming candles around you, one table just for my husband and I to enjoy this spectacular night under the starlights, and excellent choices of menu which makes this service is not just about a great venue factor to enjoy this romantic arrangement. You should go earlier like about 6.30PM to enjoy the spectacular view of sunset in Ubud. I highly recomend this service for couples who would like to have the private romantic dinner. This is non standard restaurant service because you can feel the evening privacy, great service, food, venue and timing. I just can't wait to go back there with my husband for having a nostalgic time. ","annotations":[]}
