{"text":"Great location, excellent hotel experience This is a beautiful, modern, nicely decorated, very clean small hotel in a fabulous location off the Champs-Elysees; short walking distances to the Eiffel Tower, the River Seine, L'Arc de Triomphe, shopping, and restaurants. Excellent access to George V station for the metro system, or easy to find a cab, bus, or tour bus within a block or so. We also walked to La Louvre. The bed was comfortable, the linens were crisp and fresh, L'Occitane soaps and products were provided at no charge, as well as other nice touches such as cookies, chocolates at turn-down, and most of all an excellent, friendly, multi-lingual staff who truly cares about the guests and does whatever they can to ensure that your visit to Hotel Bassano and Paris are pleasant and enjoyable. I found this 4-star-rated hotel on a website. The pictures and descriptions are accurate of what is there. The lady who assisted me on the telephone when making our reservation was incredibly helpful, as she provided insight to the hotel's superb location, that it was newly redone, why it was a good location for visiting Paris, and she did a great job of describing the accomodations. She was prompt and efficient, as well as were subsequent e-mail confirmations. We stayed there four days\/three nights, thus met several of the staff members; all were wonderful. Clearly, the management is doing a very good job in training all the staff how to properly run a hotel to make the guests want to return, as well as recommend it to others.(We are a married couple, living in London, although from the USA.)
