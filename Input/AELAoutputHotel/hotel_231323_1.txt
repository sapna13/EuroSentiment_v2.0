{"text":"An Old Favourite I booked into the Ibis beside the Centraal Station in Amsterdam from 20\/27 December 2008. I have stayed there many times (about 20!) and usually go back mainly because of its location: it's beside the terminuses for the tramcars, buses and boats and a very short walk across a bridge to a great shopping street that leads down to the palace.First, the gripes: As a journalist I use my laptop a great deal and they charge √à√\u2020√ü?5 a day which is a ridiculous price and would have come to √à√\u2020√ü?75 for the week. Fortunately, my regular coffee shop has a number of computers with Internet connection and I worked from there every day for about one or two euro per hour. Also, the service in the restaurant at the Ibis is very, very slow, although the food was excellent when it eventually came.Talking about restaurants, I can highly recommend the Silveren Spiegel - a few minutes walk from the hotel - and also The Five Flies (that's the name!) further down the Spuistraat. Both are expensive. The best kept secret in Amsterdam is a restaurant IN the railway station (on platform 2b) and about 2 minutes walk from the Ibis. It's like something out of an Agatha Christie novel, with the waiters dressed in black with white aprons, fine decor in an eastern style (the oak double linenfold panelling around the restaurant is of superb quality), and a large white parrot or cockatoo - sometimes noisy - called Elvis, on the service counter. Don't get too near him as he might be in one of his moods! The food is excellent and very reasonably priced. I can especially recommend the steaks and wiener schnitzels for dinner, while the Dutch stews are the best value for lunch anywhere. I go there every day (it took me about 3 years staying at the Ibis before I found the place in its most unlikely situation) and is another good reason for staying at the hotel. Say hello to Dino the Libyan waiter from me if you go there.The Ibis Hotel is also handy for the shops in the station, especially the small supermarket, the chemist's, and the stationery shop. There is also a good Information Centre on platform 2 where you can buy various travel tickets for a week or so and get pamphlets on what's going on in the city.
