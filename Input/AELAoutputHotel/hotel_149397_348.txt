{"text":"Great Hotel, Beautiful Beach and Relaxing Atmosphere I have to admit that I was nervous about what to expect at the hotel upon arrival due to all the bad reviews I read online before leaving. I wanted to take the time to share my great experience so that people do not get the wrong idea about this hotel. To begin, I will address what many reviews seem to say are the weaknesses: Food and Rooms.We spent 5 nights at the hotel and never had to eat at a buffet for dinner. We got a la carte reservations for every night at normal eating hours (between 7 and 8:30). Nobody in my party got sick. I have a chronic stomach problem and was so worried about geting sick having read the reviews but the food really was good. For dinner, the steakhouse and italian (ate there twice) places were good, and the service was just fine with the meal taking about 1- 1 1\/2 hours from the time we sat down. I would recommend getting pasta at the italian restaurant. Both of these restaurants were not air conditioned. We also ate at the Japanese restaurant twice. This restaurant is air conditioned AND the service was GREAT! We did not try any of the extra cost places since the other options provided us with great food.Lunch- the grilled chicken by the beach was GREAT! Better than what I make on my own grill at home.Breakfast- I am not a big breakfast eater, but it looked like there were pleanty of options. I stuck with toast and jam since thats mostly what I do at home.Rooms- our room was fine. Yes, the rooms could use some touching up on the paint BUT as long as you do not go expecting 1000 thread count and four seasons atmosphere I do not think you will be upset. Some people mention a terrible odor. THere was a scent to our room but it was not bad and it essentially impossible to have no scent in such a tropical humid environment. We both have allergies but had no problems due to our room. THere was always lots of hot water and the shower had great water pressure (believe me, I hate bad water pressure).Also, we did not go platinum and we felt no need to. The staff was attentive to us and we had no complaints about service at all. The pool is very nice and the grounds are just immaculate. The beach in front of this hotel is the nicest on that streatch of beach with a nice big sandy beach and very very very little seaweed.Hope this is helpful. I would definately consider returning to the same hotel and would suggest this as a great location to visit.
