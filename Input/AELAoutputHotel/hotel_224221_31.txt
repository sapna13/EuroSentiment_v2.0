{"text":"Secret gem in the heart of NYC We spent five nights at Library Hotel in October 2008 and here are the comments on this stay:- Great location one block away from the Grand Central Station, at Madison and 42ond - Very √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√πamous√à√\u2020\u2022?neighbourhood with the Chrysler building around the next block corner, the Grand Central two minutes away and the National Library down the street- Some nice restaurants in walking distance (Benjamin Steakhouse √à√\u2020\u2022?haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ had meat in a long time? Go get cured!), Todai (All-You-Can-Eat Japanese Seafood Buffet Restaurant at 6, East 32ond), the Grand Central Dining Concourse Hotel itself:- Very nice, quite small, with early twentieth-century flair with nice lobby and extremely friendly, reliable and helpful reception staff (don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think I ever encountered a team this well working together and professional before! Every one of them.) For those who can't live without reading: the MUST on the East Coast.- Bistro-like restaurant on the ground floor (unfortunately didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get the time to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¥ine-in√à√\u2020\u2022? and very nice open air terrace bar on the 14th floor (attention: this is also open to non-residents thus getting crowded √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√¨fter hours√à√\u2020\u2022?and with no reserved space for hotel guests ... :-(.)Rooms:- Rather small (try not to pick the cheapest category), but stylish, with loads of theme books on the shelves)- very nice270√ä√©?- view on Madison Avenue and 42ond till up to Central Park from corner rooms - Loved the windows you can open- Tiny but well equipped bathrooms with mat glass wall inlay towards the room, allowing some daylight to shine inSpecial:- The complimentary wine and cheese bar in the early evening (great if heading for a concert with dining afterwards!!)- Nice complimentary breakfast, though slightly cramped, with helpful staff and a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬£ean√à√\u2020\u2022?choice ... but then, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ (nearly) free ...We were very pleased with our stay there and can recommend the hotel (though quite pricey... √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ central mid NYC!). Staying there gives one the notion of bustling New York with landmarks around every corner.
