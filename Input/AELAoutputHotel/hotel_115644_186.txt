{"text":"Chancellor - why go anywhere else? Overall - great for location, staff efficiency and friendliness, price and convenience. Would we recommend it? - YES - I can see no reason to stay anywhere else. In fact we have already passed on the details to friends and family who will be there next month. Why did we choose the Chancellor? √à√\u2020\u2022?from the great reviews on Trip Advisor.The details of our stay ....We had a 5 day stay at the Chancellor Hotel in March 2008 - 3 days before we left for Las Vegas\/Grand Canyon and 2 days on our return. The location and the service were first class -- we had front rooms on both occasions and it was just magic to be able to hear the SF cable cars as they passed within a few feet on the hotel - there is a stop in both directions just steps from the door - making it easy to get to Fisherman√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Wharf etc. The rooms might be on the smallish side √à√\u2020\u2022?but we did not intend to stay in the rooms for long and we knew this beforehand from previous reviews. Some nice toiletries in the bathrom saved us buying when we got there, although there was a Wallgreens just 2 minutes away which stocked anything a visitor could need,We had great views of Union Square - with Macy's and the Levis Store about 4 minutes away. Down on Market (10 minutes walk downhill or 4 mins. on the cable car) was a huge Mall with all the usual US stores -- a great place to exercise your credit card!The staff were unbelievable -- because we were on a 5-hour city tour when we needed to check in on-line for our SWA flight to LV - Shamina on the front desk did all this work for us and our boarding passes were at the desk when we returned that evening and she also checked our final flight time home with the airport a few days later, and changed the time of a Lorries Shuttle pick-up for us. Thank you Shamina. We were able to leave a bag in the hotel while we flew east and picked it up on our return -- very handy as it saved us carrying too much weight on the internal flight. Also as it was my birthday when there -Wes Tyler had arranged for a bottle of champagne and a gift in the room - thank you Wes! The convenience of having the restaurant on the ground floor for a large US breakfast and the bar in the evening for aperitifs was great. The bar closes early but we were able to stop on walk home from dinner for our nightcaps! Muni passes can be bought from Suzie in the lobby and there is an ATM machine in the lobby too. We bought our last two Lorries Shuttle vouchers from Suzie too.Thank you to all at the Chancellor and yes √à√\u2020\u2022?we will be back!
