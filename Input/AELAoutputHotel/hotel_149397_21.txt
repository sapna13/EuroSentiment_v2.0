{"text":"Was excellent ignore the fussy remarks and try for yourself. We arrived on the 29th September, we had read various bad reviews prior to going. When we arrived the people were so friendly and helpful in the hotel, the grounds were absolutely immaculate. The locals were gardening every day and the scenery was brilliant. The Entertainment was fantastic, always a great show at the evening and the pool area throughout the day always had various activities for all ages.The food, although it was not the strong point of this hotel, was well varied and has a different theme every night in the buffet area, the tanuki restaurant was an amazing experience too.The hotel was amazing, the beach(wow!) and the bar staff were very friendly. The rooms were a little bit dated, but what do you expect you are not exactly stopping in the worlds richest country. They have air-conditioning and satellite tv, the rest of the time your on the gorgeous beach.The grounds are huge, excellent wildlife, and a nice walk in the afternoon, some reviews complain about the distance walking from the beach to the reception area, but to be honest its a 5 minute walk if the carriages are full from time to time, with 2 or 3 small carriages circulating the grounds constantly to take you to where you desire.To summarise our holiday, it was outstanding, make sure you pay that little extra with the legitimate excursion reps, cheap isn't always cheerful and go to Catalinha island!!!! Amazing day but quite expensive. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":996,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":992}]}
