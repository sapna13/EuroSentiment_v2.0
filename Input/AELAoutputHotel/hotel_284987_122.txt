{"text":"Loved it... We stayed at the Grand Melia from April 23rd until the 1st of May. After reading reviews on this site I too was a little hesitant about what our experience would be like, but after arriving my concerns vanished. Not to discredit previous reviews, but I find it odd that not once did I hear anything about √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áed bugs√à√\u2020\u2022?during our stay from the 30 other guests that were staying here. When you visit a tropical island there are mosquitoes and bugs that come out, especially after rain. Some people may confuse these bites as √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áed bugs.√à√\u2020\u2022?Anyways, from the moment we arrived everyone treated us with a warm smile. There was one minor incident where we needed something brought to our room. I was told that it would be there in 5 minutes, and after waiting a little longer than that I decided to call the front desk again. They quickly apologized and immediately sent the item over to our room. Other than this, everything was perfect. The employees quickly remembered our names and greeted us every time they saw us. It was a very relaxing stay. I would also like to add that after reading reviews on here, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand why people continue to complain about taxi rides into town or to the airport. If you plan on venturing out of the hotel, like we did, save your self some time and money and rent a car. Thrifty offers medium cars at $25 a day. We enjoyed driving to Luquillo everyday, to enjoy the fresh coconuts with a couple of empanadas. The beauty of this hotel is that it is away from the city, but still accessible with a car or taxi ride√à√\u2020\u2022?I will defiantly return to the Gran Melia in the future!
