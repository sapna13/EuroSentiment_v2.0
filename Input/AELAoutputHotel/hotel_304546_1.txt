{"text":"good hotel, super location, superb staff Very convenient for a business traveller to Japan. There is a direct hotel bus from Narita Airport to the hotel - 3000 yen each way, or, some Narita Express trains stop directly in Ikebukuro or, when arriving by Shinkansen from Kyoto etc: get off in Ueno or Tokyo Main station and take the direct train (Yamanote line) to Ikebukuro, a fairly large station. Once there: just look for the Metropolitan Plaza exit and the hotel is 2 mins from the exit! Stayed 5 nights in Oct 08, 12th floor, small, but for Japan decent size room, good bathroom, very quiet, very clean (I had specifically requested a non-smoking room ... probably a good idea in Japan as smoking in restaurants and hotels is still widespread. Breakfast was included as booked early on the web, decent rate of about 20000 Yen \/ room all inclusive. Buffet breakfast was very good with plenty to choose from including +++ fresh melon, pineapple, oranges, all the usual hot and cold options, all varieties of good tea and coffee \/ latte \/ cappuccino. Some chef made a delicious vegetable omlet on request ... The double bed was a bit small (1.4 m wide) and too hard - but the excellent, very friendly, superbly efficient staff organised some more duvets to put on top of the hard mattress to ensure a comfortable night's sleep. We had a few meals in the hotel, although good, they were VERY expensive. There is the Tobu department store right next door which has superb restaurants including a fantastic sushi bar on the 11th floor - much much cheaper. Free fast internet access in the room (though NO WIFI). PCs, Printers etc on the ground floor if you haven't got a laptop with you. Gym \/ Swimming Pool use possible - but expensive (2500 Yen \/ visit) I will most definitely come back to this hotel ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1018,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1015},{"endOffset":1029,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1023},{"endOffset":1050,"mention":"cappuccino","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cappuccino"],"startOffset":1040}]}
