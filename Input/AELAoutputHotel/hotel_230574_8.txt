{"text":"A business hotel first and foremost Everyone was efficient. And smart.The room was well-proportioned and equipped and we had a lovely view of the river.Large lobby with open-plan bar that offered speedy service.Well-presented restaurant that oozed that hotel restauarant kind of decor that was impossible to dislike but unmemorable at the same time.All very up to date with the brand standards ! A proper Intercon !We had no complaints. But we do have an observation !This is is a big hotel and the weekend we were there, completely over-run with a convention such that there were more coat racks in the lobby than I have ever seen before ! There were convention people running everywhere ! All weekend !That's why I suppose I wanted to post this review. Just because, efficient and comfortable as it is, that kind of trade is important to the hotel and, I imagine, likely to be frequent. But it left us feeling a little bit out of place. Combined with the slick but big feel of the place we concluded that perhaps this wouldnt be a place we'd rush back to or recommend for a weekend break. For business ? Absolutely. But we stayed at Meridien Parkhotel last time we came for a weekend and just found it more characterful and relaxed than this one. I think I'd rather send a fax from the Intercon than spend a Saturday night there again ! But give me a briefcase and a laptop and I'd return there happily the following Monday morning !!
