{"text":"Great value - Have booked to return! It's a fact of life: there is no pleasing some people. Our stay at the Ambassador was very pleasant and great value for money. The location was fine - it was nice to walk off dinner returning to the hotel from restaurants downtown. The location was handy to all buses we even walked to Ala Moana Shopping Center, Ward Center and Diamond Head from here.Some reception staff were very friendly and helpful - just couldn't do enough for us. Greeted us with a genuine smile every time. Some other staff .... well, how friendly are you at work? Not that they were rude in any way.During our stay the foyer was under reconstruction. This was carried out in a well co-ordinated manner. I welcome the improvements being made (with minimum interruption) other people may choose to whine about any minor inconvenience.The standard suite room was h - u - g - e. Furnishings and kitchen somewhat dated but fully functional. Beds comfortable, daily cleaning was fine. The garbage trucks were a bit noisy early in the morning but the reality is, hotels generate trash which needs to be collected. Name a hotel in Waikiki which does not use this service.The pool was basic but fine. Nice to cool off or lie around. Business Center was handy for internet access.A few tips for Waikiki while I have your attention:Frozen mac choc coffee at Vintage Coffee Stand Ala Moana (excellent sandwiches from sandwich bar 15 steps from there).REAL Frozen smoothies at the back of International Markets (just add a shot of Malibu to the pina colada)$20 for a 4 day Oahu bus pass available at ABC shops.Beach fries with ranch dressing at Dukes Go to Moose McGillycuddy's for excellent great value breakfasts \/ food. Half price vouchers for this and many other deals available in This Week in Oahu and similar booklets free in street stands.Excellent meals at The Cheesecake Factory though hard to get a Sunday Brunch which was not sweet.For the ULTIMATE romantic fine dining - Hano Hano room top level of Sheraton Hotel.Oh .... and did I mention staying at the Ambassador?
