{"text":"Terrific Time! My husband and I celebrated our 24th anniversary at Hotel Kabuki, and we had an amazing time! We arrived in the pouring rain and were pleasantly greeted with sake and wine tasting before we even got to the front desk to check-in. When we checked in with Michael at the front desk, he upgraded our room when he found out we were celebrating our anniversary. Tomo refilled our glasses with sake and invited us to take our glasses with us to our room. Later that evening, Michael delivered more of the yummy sake and some delightful, tasty snacks as a nice anniversary treat. I jumped in for an enjoyable soak in the wonderful tub--the sake was a great complement to the bath! Then we enjoyed the lights of San Francisco in our corner room. The room was nicely furnished, and the Lather bath products were a nice touch. In the morn, we awoke to a beautiful sunrise sneaking over the buildings on the horizon. We had the weekend planned and took Michael up on his offer to help us with anything we needed--we wanted to take a bottle of the yummy sake home with us. Michael got us a bottle. We would highly recommend Hotel Kabuki. The price was right, the room was great, and the staff was awesome. Parking was good for a large city: we parked in the underground lot next to the hotel--very easy access and out of the continuous rain. We didn't spend near enough time in the hotel. And, we didn't take time to enjoy the Kabuki Spa, which we heard was great. Guess we'll have to plan that on our next visit to SanFrancisco--and we'll definitely stay at Hotel Kabuki!
