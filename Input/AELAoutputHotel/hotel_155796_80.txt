{"text":"We love it. Fantastic pool, nice clean rooms. The hotel is on a hill, so its a tough walk up to the lobby and down to the pool, especially if you have to drag luggage. However, if you have a car, you can park it right outside your door.We only stayed here to go on the East Winds snorkel tour to Cuelebra. They pick you up at this hotel for $14 per person so you don't need a car.This hotel is supposed to be only 1.5 blocks from the ferry, but it's staight uphill and the locals told us to take a taxi. The Taxi cost $20 for only a 3 minute drive, so I felt cheated.After the bad reviews about the food being bad and expensive, I was relieved that the food was pretty good and not that expensive. The average dinner at both restaurants was $7-$15. There's a refrigerator in the room so you can take leftovers back, but take a plastic fork to eat it with later. There is no microwave. If you need a taxi from here back to San Juan, I recommend Angel and Mary. They live in Fajardo, speak English, and are very punctual and reliable. I Reserved the taxi 1 day in advance. and cost $60 for 3 of us with luggage.I wished I could have stayed longer, just to relax by the beautiful pool. It had a water slide, waterfall, and crystal clear water that didn't smell of chlorine. Do not bring any valuables to the pool. There were 2 young, kids, around 9 and 14 years old, not guests, walking around and around the pool very slowly, looking at all the chairs as if waiting for you to get up and leave your things unguarded. If you wanted to swim after you checked out, there are showers and lockers by the pool. But you need your own padlock and the lockers are not big enough to hold your luggage.The mini golf was $2 per person per round. They give you really large, thick beach towels, but charge you $20 if you lose it.They have an internet room in the lobby. I think it was about $5 for 30 minutes. But if you have your own laptop, its free. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":32,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":28}]}
