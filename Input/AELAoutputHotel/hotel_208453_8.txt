{"text":"Ok for free but there are better options available I've stayed in a number of the hilton family hotels and was very excited to get a chance to stay at this one. I read the reviews and came to my choice that this would be best. I arrived at the hotel and was pleased at what I saw. Half a block from broadway very close to everything. Then I checked in that went very smooth. They didn't have the breakfast coupons at the time they said they would slide them under the door over night. Get to the room and we were pleased. A good size room for NY city. The over all set up of the room was ok could use a redesign that is more modern. Then we check out the bathroom and that left for a lot more the be desired. Really showing the age of the hotel when you see the bathroom. Other lower grade hiltons are mush nicer decor and bathrooms are higher end then what they have. So, it just leaves me as an OK based on appearance. The next day no coupons under the door. So, we go down stairs and it all gets resolved. Breakfast is well worth it there. One of the best free breakfast in town. However if you have to pay for it the cost is $26 and not worth that price. The waiters that really do nothing for you expect a nice big tip as well and are not so nice the next few days if they don't get a good tip. In the end what you pay isn't bad for breakfast if you have the coupons. The breakfast alone would be the only reason I would stay here again other then that I would much rather stay somwhere else.
