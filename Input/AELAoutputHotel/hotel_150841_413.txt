{"text":"Great All Inclusive for the entire family Overall we were very impressed with this resort.We were a group of 10 with ages ranging from 6 to 75 and there was something for everyone. I faxed the resort before we came requesting a newly renovated rooms and we all received them.If you are a family I highly recommend this resort, if you are a couple getting away pick an adults only resort.The Pro's-food was very good for an all inclusive (we ate lunch at the beach grill a few times but then realized how quiet and nice the buffet restaurant is for lunch)-I highly recommend the cajun and japanese-the steakhouse was okay -the resort was very clean, I was very impressed with how clean all the public bathrooms were especially by the pool area-the staff are very friendly and the maids do an excellent job (tip them everyday it will be worth it)-they had Smirnoff, Stoli, CC etc... at the bar which was good-wine at dinner was okay, the red much better than the white-lots of golf courses to choose from, rent the clubs its easier than lugging yours down, don't forget your golf shirt -the entertainment at night was good, the icebreaker games at 9pm were usually very funny-lots of great beach volleyball, the more competitive play usually does not get going until about 3pmThe Con's (nothing too major)-very few English speaking kids in the kids club-we had to have our room keys replaced 6 times as we would get back to our rooms and they would not work (very annoying)-you need to reserve chairs by the pool before 9am if you want anything half decent and the pool area can feel very crowded, by 11am there are no pool chairs left, the beach you can be a bit later-the pool bar is shaded which I'm sure is great in July and August but in January it gets a bit chilly-they needed a little bit more kid friendly food, we had chicken nuggets once but then could not find them again-they had a few mornings without bacon at the breakfast buffet-the tennis courts (3 in total)were okay but you had to get up at 7:30am to reserve one for the next day and you always want to get on court 1 or 2 as they are clay courts and dry quickly (it rained 3 or 4 times a day but only for 10 or 20 min)-make sure when you check-in you take your own bags to your room, it took them over an hour to deliver our bags -get a room on the second floor, the peacoks are always on your porch if you are on the first floor-the pillows are terrible but the beds are very comfortable-the casino is okay a little small and the tables do not open until 8pm (slots open at 4pm)-they have two ping pong tables by the pool which are always busy and very hard to get on, they are always running out of balls as well. They need to add a couple more tables, and perhaps add a sign up sheet restricting play to 15 minutes.I highly recommend this resort to families and large groups, we never had a problem getting a table for 10 at any meal. The Europeans still love to smoke, wear their banana hammocks and go topless, but that you will find that at any resort.The beach is great and so nice that you can walk on it and check out the other resorts or bargain at the huts with the locals.Thanks to everyone who posted reviews, it was the trip advisor reviews that I read in Sept. that helped me pick this resort.
