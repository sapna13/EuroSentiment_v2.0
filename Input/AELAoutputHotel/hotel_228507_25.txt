{"text":"Nice inside, convenient to trains, but in seedy part of town My opinion of this hotel is a little schizophrenic. We chose this hotel for the last night of our trip through Southern Spain and Northern France because it was adjacent to the car rental return, where we needed to drop off our car before flying out early the following morning. We figured it would be convenient to both returning the car and getting a cab to the airport. Both were true. However, I had forgotten from being there in the 90's as a backpacker how seedy the area is. In general, train stations in Europe can be infused with seedy scammers looking to pick-pocket, etc., and the train station in Barcelona is not really any exception. Even the employees at the car rental (Hertz) were a little obviously paranoid about someone coming into their business if they didn't have a reservation. HOWEVER, this hotel upstairs from the station was actually very nice. We returned a day early from our driving and they accommodated us with an extra night prior to our reservation. It is more upscale than the average hotel, the food was decent, although not very authentic to Spanish food, it was of good quality. The people were friendly, speak English very well, and the rooms were truly sound-proof as described. Where it lacks in charm, it makes up for in cleanliness and modern accommodations. I generally prefer the quaint, smaller, homier hotels, but this fulfilled our need, which was a convenient place to sleep between car return and flight. Since we came back a day early, we did some sightseeing again on our extra day in the city, and nothing is really close by to see on foot, but you can get a subway train or a taxi very easily. Just hang on to your bags, your kids, and anything else valuable and keep your peripheral vision acute until you get out of the immediate area of the train station. I wouldn't recommend this hotel for a long-term stay, as we found a much more quaint hotel in the heart of the Jewish Quarter for our initial 3 nights stay in Barcelona where we could walk to sites, markets, restaurants, and the Rambla, but if you are renting a car or taking a train out of town, or if you want something more American and modern, this hotel does just fine.
