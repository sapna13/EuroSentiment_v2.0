{"text":"Bad bad bad experience I had a pretty bad experience staying at the Adam√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Mark in Dallas last week, a really bad experience. I will avoid that place in the future. Their totally over hyped restaurant at the top was unsatisfying. The setting is nice, the service was fine, but the food was really expensive for what I was served. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go there, even for the view, there are way better places. There was almost no service and it was bad when there was. There was no water pressure in the bathroom. My breakfast order came in wrong at 6:00am, bad way to start the day. My back still hurts from the really bad mattress. It was 60 degrees in the room at 5:00am because the staff turned the heating off I guess. My room was not done when I got back to the Adams√à√\u2020\u2022?Mark hotel at 6:30pm. And after providing the management team feedback using their Web site, they basically reimbursed one night and really did not care. I wonder how this place is still in business. These folks obviously don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ understand lifetime value. I stay in hotels in Dallas pretty frequently and I have about 50 years to live, not mentioning all the people I am going to mention it to. Adam√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ marks, do the math, how much is that going to cost you versus just getting it right in the first place, or at least fixing it? I actually told them I was going to write about it and they did not care to fix it anymore. ","annotations":[]}
