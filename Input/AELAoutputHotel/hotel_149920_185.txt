{"text":"Loved the Marriott in San Juan My wife and I and another couple just returned from a week at the Marriott Resort in San Juan. Our friends booked hotel and flight thru a travel agent, we booked directly with the Marriott website and used award points for the airfare. The wife and I had no trouble at check in, getting exactly what we'd expected. The friends were delayed getting their room, being told it would be just a few minutes. Two hours later, they were given an upgraded room with executive club privledges with an apololgy. When they went to the room, it was already occupied. they were moved and a little while later, another couple was given the same room. After the initial logistical problems were worked out, the remainder of the stay was uneventful.Pros: The staff at the Marriott is amazing. All - the front desk, the housekeeping, bar and beach attendants - were very courteous, helpful and there to do anything possible to make the stay enjoyable. The Conceirge staff is spotty, with the experienced folks (few) very knowledgable and helpful and the younger folks (many) helpful but not having the experience to really have any value-add. The grounds are spotless and people are always working relentlessly to keep them so. The beach is beautiful and the soft sandy bottom extends out farther than you can stand. The rooms were spacious and clean, very quiet and the A\/C worked great! The Tuscany Restaurant on the ground level is one of the best Italian restaurants in San Juan - be sure to ask to be seated at a table served by Alfredo. Great health club! Leave your laptop at home, you get one hour per day of PC\/Internet time in the business center per day. Cabs are cheap, figure on $12 to go just about anywhere.Cons: Food and drinks are abundant but not cheap. Average drink price is $8-10 and plan to spend ~$150 per couple on dinner with a fair bottle ($45) of wine and around $45 per couple on lunch with a beverage each.The hotel is located in town and there's a lot of construction going on around it. Some of the buildings look like they're ready to fall down and they do detract from the experience. It does look like they're trying hard to refurbish the area. Overall, it was a great vacation. We probably won't do it again but only because we'll continue to explore the islands for new and different experiences.
