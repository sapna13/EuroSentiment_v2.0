{"text":"Avoid at all costs Avoid this hotel at all costs. Yes it is in a great location but to be honest, there are a hundred other hotels also in this area which have to be of better standard than this hotel. Never have I encountered such rude staff. Iit seems that if you are British (as my fiance is) they will be rude and arrogant and unhelpful and will ignore you. Being Australian, I seemed to be able to get a little bit of helpfulness from the staff but not much too be honest. The hotel to be blunt, stinks of sewerage. This smell seems to be present on all floors the floors, in the two rooms we stayed in and even in the lift. I know Barcelona isn't renowned for having the best drainage system but this was so bad it left you feeling physically ill. After our first night we requested to change rooms after the room wehad had a broken shower head, broken mini bar, no tv reception, broken sink and cracks in the walls that left me in shock that the building was still standing. Our next room which appeared to be an upgrade was a bit better although the toilet seat was broken in half and you had to leave the windows open all the time to avoid being suffocated by the stench of the drains. All the rooms are smoking rooms even if you request a non smoking room although this tends to be a common problem in main land Europe.All in all, I have stayed in backpackers that are of higher standard and half the price. I would never return to this hotel and by no means could I recommend this hotel nor its staff to anyone.Avoid! ","annotations":[]}
