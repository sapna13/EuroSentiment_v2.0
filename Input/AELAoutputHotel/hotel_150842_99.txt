{"text":"Great beaches! We spent five nights at the resort from February 21st through the 26th. THE BEACH- The beach was the best part of the resort- great sand, wide, and long (great for long walks). A consistent breeze kept it comfortable.THE DRINKS- The frozen drinks left alot to be desired. But, the beer was cold and we eventually found a couple of drinks they made well.THE FOOD- We were told we had one trip to a specialty restaurant trip available. After eating the first night at the buffet, we showed up dressed decent to the speciality places and asked if we could eat there and were never turned down!! We ate at four specialty restaurants in five nights! Each were decent meals. The buffets were okay, nothing exceptional but nothing terrible either. THE SERVICE- The service was great, better than at all inclusives we have been to. You are greeted friendly everywhere and no one ever seemed put off by a request. We tipped some and it was always appreciated but we never felt it was necessary to tip in order to get good service.THE ENTERTAINMENT- It does seem like the popular music lists get delivered to DR by horse and buggy. The music in the disco and in the shows was from the late 70s to early 80s at best. OVERALL- We've been alot of places and Punta Cana ranks high for the overall value and especially for the great beach. We will likely return but would be open to a different resort or would return here if the price is right. The annoyances of cheesy entertainment and mediocre drinks was overshadowed by the other positives of this resort. I would recommend it. ","annotations":[]}
