{"text":"a wonderful stay I just returned from a 3 day, 3 night stay at the Biltmore (Wed - Sat) and I think there were tears in my eyes when I pulled away last evening! It was truly a pleasure from the moment I checked in until I left. I paid in advance for a deluxe resort room in the Valley wing which was large with a lovely balcony overlooking Camel Mountain to the left and the large lawn and a glimpse of the Paradise Pool to the right.I was travelling alone (woman, mid 30s) and the staff made extra sure I was comfortable regardless of what I was doing. They remembered me from the front desk, to the restaurant, to the pool. Normally when I travel, I use the hotel for sleeping only, this was not the case for this vacation. The only time I left the resort was when I went shopping on Friday at the Biltmore Fashion Park (free shuttle service) and the Fashion Square (5 miles down on Camelback Rd).Two of the evenings I ate on the outdoor patio of Wright's Bar and was able to order food from the Grille. I also spent 2 full days in a cabana by the pool where the staff were attentive and lovely and I also had a terrific, relaxing massage at the spa one of the early evenings.Because I was there mid-week through the weekend, I noticed a huge difference in clientele. Mostly business men and women Wed-Fri and then families on the weekend. The pool was much livelier on Saturday and I recommend splurging for the cabana to escape from the noise and sun if necessary. I loved my stay here and would recommend it to single travellers or families. I hope to return for many more vacations.
