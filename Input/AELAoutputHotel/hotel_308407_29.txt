{"text":"Value for Money Stay I have to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this unpretentious yet totally charming Bali-nese style hotel in the midst of throbbing Kuta. Had come here last weekend for a regional NGO retreat, expecting to be presented with a business-like conference-type hotel. Far from it! This was a haven in the midst of busy Tuban, and once inside its sprawling grounds you'd be hard pressed to think you were actually in a town setting. It had far more charm than the Intercon that I moved to subsequently for my own personal retreat. The staff were helpful and were fast to respond to calls for help from the room (adaptor, TV control, etc). The main grouse was that the aircon in the rooms (the standard range)was not cold, and when told the next day, they kept the aircon on through the day to improve matters! I'm sure this is something they can correct.Also, they do not have a spa to speak of, providing only a massage service. Apart from that, it is truly a value for money hotel for its proximity to shops, sunset view (not as good as Jimbaran), delightful staff and garden retreat setting. The villa section especially has a lovely pool setting and walk path. Overall, Santika Beach Hotel as a homely, warm feel about it which makes one feel extremely comfortable and relaxed, and wanting to return. Its short 15 minute ride to the airport is another plus, allowing you to max your stay in the place. ","annotations":[]}
