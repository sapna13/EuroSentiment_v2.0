{"text":"NY Palace the best with American Girl Place A friend and I took our daughters (ages 8 and 9) in August 2007 to the New York Palace and the package day at American Girl Place. We chose the NYP for the AG trip because it was the closest to AG (about 1.5 blocks away) and, of the hotels AG has for packages, it was less expensive (believe it or not!). Late August weekend is less expensive, I think. We only stayed one night.The hotel was fabulous. We were on the 14th floor overlooking St. Patrick's. We drove from New England, and the valet took the car and we were on our NYC adventure! Everyone in check-in was very friendly. They wowed our girls with their questions and knowledge of the AG dolls and the girls loved the attention.The room was larger than I expected. Ours had 2 double beds in it like a standard hotel room, but it was more spacious around the edges. We were able to check in at 1pm, the staff was able to find rooms nearly next door to our friends (there was 1 room in between). They were ready and we settled in for a few minutes before we were off to walk around midtown.When we returned in the evening, my daughter was just thrilled with the little American Girl bed and satin blanket that was turned down on her bed, along with her own bed. She loved the slippers they put out for her and wouldn't take them off! The AG bed is part of the package and you take it home when you leave.The view was just amazing. At night overlooking St. Patrick's, with Rockefeller Center lit up behind it was great. My daughter and I just sat at the window until long past her bedtime just taking it all in. I had never stayed overnight in Manhattan, just been there on day trips when visiting relatives on Long Island. So this was very special for both of us.When we were leaving the hotel staff was very helpful. They retrieved our car much faster than I expected, maybe 15 minutes. I went to the concierge to get information about what was the best way to drive out of Manhattan and was put in contact with their head dispatcher for drivers and I chatted with him and he was very helpful. I think we will both remember our special weekend in NYC forever. And the New York Palace helped make it that way.I want to try and return with my whole family soon.
