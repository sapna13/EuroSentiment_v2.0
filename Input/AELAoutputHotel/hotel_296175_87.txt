{"text":"Fabulous hotel - we loved everything about it We stayed at Hotel Davanzati in Florence for 11 nights in August\/September 2008. We chose it because it was #1 on TripAdvisor and we were not disappointed. It is a wonderful hotel and I would recommend it to anyone. Can't wait to return.As many other reviewers have pointed out, it isn't 5 star luxury - it is the amazing service that makes this charming family-run hotel so special.We staying in a basic double room rather than a suite, and it was perfect for our needs. The room was large, it had a very comfortable king-sized bed, plenty of storage space, free wi-fi and use of a laptop, functioning air conditioning and it was spotlessly clean. They even provide a noise-muffling machine, although we never used it as the room was very quiet.Breakfast was included in the room rate and was excellent - with a wide selection of breads, croissants and pastries, fresh fruit and fruit juice, ham and cheese. Good coffeee too. The hotel also provides DVDs and games (as well as a good selection of travel guides and books) for the use of guests, although we were so busy enjoying the city that we didn't make use of these.The hotel is very well located, 5 minutes walk to the main sights, but on a quiet road. The service provided by Fabrizio, Tommaso and the rest of the family is amazing. They greeted us by name as we arrived (a great personal touch) and couldn't do enough to help throughout our stay. Before we arrived they had booked for us all our entrance tickets to the museums, plus a couple of guided tours, so we didn't have to queue anywhere, and they booked restaurants for dinner every night. Everywhere we ate was excellent. We also enjoyed their free happy hour - where they encourage guests (the majority of whom are English speaking) to mingle. What could be nicer than sipping a glass (or two) of prosecco and nibbling bruchetta whist chatting with like-minded travellers!We can't wait to return to hotel Davanzati!
