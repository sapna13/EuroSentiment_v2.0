{"text":"Good Location -- Nice Boutique Hotel This was great hotel, centrally located. My husband and I stayed for a weekend. We booked our hotel through AMEX using our points, so it was a steal. After reading the reviews I was a bit nervous, but compared to the other boutiques, 9-0 had the least amount of bad reviews. We arrived late on Friday and the staff were very nice and welcoming, especially Brian from the valet service. I had called ahead and asked for a room on the highest floor and they said they put a note on my file. When we arrived to our room, which we paid extra for a view, I was disappointed that our view was of a building across the way. We were then moved to a room on their top floor and the view was better, but honestly, I would not pay the additional money for the view, unless you want to look at the top of buildings. The beds were comfy, the shower was good and I liked knowing I was staying at an eco-friendly hotel.We didn't have any noise complaints, except that the suite next door let their alam clock ring for an hour, but when we called guest services they sent someone up to take care of it immediately. Overall it was a great stay -- if you like the swank, boutique hotels. I found the people of Boston to be a little less than warm and fuzzy, but the staff including Scotty, the concierge were more than happy to accommodate! You won't be disappointed.
