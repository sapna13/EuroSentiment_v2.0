{"text":"Despite the other reviews, I thought it was quite good! I have just returned from a three-night stay at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Amsterdam CIty Centre and I was rather surprised to read so many negative reviews of the hotel -you have to speak as you find, and I was pleased, overall, despite there being some shortcomings. Briefly:PostiiveStaff -always, without fail, friendly, informed and helpfulFood and Beverage -consistantly first class -this is the thing the hotel does best.Location -four minutes from Central station, two minutes from the nearest tram stop.NeutralPool -it's quite small, but, this is a city centre hotel, so there has to be compromise somewhere. There is also a sauna and a mini gym which are both great, although a jacuzzi or steam room would have been nice!Room -My room was not small based on EU average and I can only assume that either there is another wing of the hotel with tiny rooms, or the previous reviewers have only ever stayed in US hotels -even then, an average NY hotel room is smaller than this room was. The bed was comfortable, and the minibar well stocked. The bathroom was ok and plenty big enough -the shower pressure, whilst not fantastic, was fine. Yet, the room felt a little tired, although it was spotless. There was BBC1 and BBC2 on the TV along with CNN, National Geographic with Dutch subtitles and BBC World Service for English language.NegativeI can't really find anything BAD to say about the hotel to be honest. If I was being picky, I would say that the rooms could do with updating and that housekeeping should refill the minibar every day, but, the hotel is a good place to stay in my view.
