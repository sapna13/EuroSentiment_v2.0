{"text":"Perfect Aprile Have just come back from a four-day break at the Aprile in Florence and couldn't have been happier with it. It was spotlessly clean, the staff were great and it was a fab location, not too near the rowdy bits. We took the train from pisa to Florence so it was great to only have to walk around the corner to the hotel.Had good breakfasts - plenty to fill up on for a busy day sightseeing. We easily managed to accommodate a non-dairy eater too without feeling hard done by. Found the staff to be cheery and helpful. The afternoon receptionist booked our Uffizi tickets, which was a relief. All those queues can be a bit confusing!Didn't think the bar prices were too steep - much of a par with the rest of the city really, which isn't cheap admittedly. There are some good restaurants and cafes within easy walking distance so you don't have to pay over the odds for a decent meal.We'd asked for a room off the main street, having looked at tripadvisor before booking, and were given the lovely room 28, with great views of the historic Santa Maria Novella behind. Only downside were the mossies, and that wasn't anyone's fault but my own because I didn't take a spray with me. There was a plug in deterrent supplied but it wasn't enough because I'm covered in bites! (the other half hasn't a mark on him!!) Would suggest people make sure they dose up on brewers yeast before heading out or spray daily while staying there.Will definitely be looking to stay there again if we return to florence and wholeheartedly recommend. Enjoy...
