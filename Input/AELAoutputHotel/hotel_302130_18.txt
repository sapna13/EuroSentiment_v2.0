{"text":"Could be a lot better Just got back from 2 night stay at this hotel. I did vow never to stay at another Shangri-La after a very bad experience in KL Malaysia (I checked out the same night to the Mandarin across the road and nobody at reception even batted an eyelid). Having given them a 2nd try and in another country I thought I'd be safe but quickly started to realise that was wishful thinking...don't get me wrong it COULD be a great hotel because the investment's there and the facilities are great but in my opinion it all comes down to staff training.If your staff are not properly trained and are unable to do the basic stuff consistently well then there's no point in trying to deploy all the fancy nice little touches because by that time your guest is thoroughly hacked off (take note senior management if you're reading).For me it all started to go wrong when at 13:50 our 2pm check-in time was unavailable due to our 2 rooms still being cleaned; when I re-checked at 2:20pm the receptionist told me I will check right away and come and update you in the looby, where I was forced to wait and take a very posh coffee (not complimentary). At 2:50pm I had to go to reception AGAIN (by this time less than happy and feeling rather meaningless) and was told by the receptionist and the front desk manager that we could have the keys but the rooms were still being hoovered.Ok no problem (at least we had the keys!!) so we finished our coffees and went up about 15 minutes later when we were assured that our luggage would be waiting for us. Fortunately the cleaners had finished but I had to call down and chase the luggage.Again at breakfast a similar story...my plate was cleared by 1 waiter and my dirty cutlery taken off my plate and placed by my side for re-use...my colleague sat opposite me had his cleared by another waiter and the cutlery taken away at the same time???They appeared paranoid about you signing the breakfast bill too so that was dumped under our noses mid breakfast a bit like a road side cafe`\/diner.Anyway pause for a deep breath and sigh... the Shangri-La has the potential and the assets to be a lot better than it really is which is frustrating. I suggest they send all their staff to the Mandarin Bangkok to attend their in house training school then we might really see a true 5 star hotel instead of a wanna be one.If you're travelling on business or it's just a 1 night stop over you should be ok; if you're on a special trip and want a bona fide luxury 5 star experience with impeccable service and all the trimmings I suggest you research a more serious player.
