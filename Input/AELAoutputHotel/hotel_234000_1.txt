{"text":"GREAT, RARE VALUE for a Hotel near FRANKFURT I stayed here for a one night stopover before catching a flight out of FRA the next day. The rates were superb compared to staying at other FRA airport hotels; my rate was nearly 4 times lower than the Sheraton Airport, although this place is much farther from the terminals..Checkin was fast and efficient and, as a previous reviewer has written, they give you a drink amenity if you are a Priority Club member. The room I stayed in was small by American standards but everything worked and it was clean. There was air conditioning, it was working, but the ventillation was poor so that fortunately, I could open the windows and getter better air circulation and cooler air could enter the room. I dont think this would be as nice however in the hotter summer.The bed was very nice for me; very firm mattress, clean, crisp sheets and lots of working space for your computer and reading. Not alot of towels, however, and I arrived after the maid service but if you go down to the health club, there are towels there.My room did not have a tea\/coffee service and I missed that.Other people have written about the outstanding breakfast and my experience was no different. LOTS of great cooked hot food as well as breads, fruit, cereals, etc. Friendly and efficient staff in a bright and cheerful eating area overlooking the garden. In my view, this breakfast was better than the much more expensive Sheraton Airport.The hotel is situated near a great park area with plenty of walking\/hiking\/running areas so for me this was perfect. The health club was a bit disappointing as it was small and there didn't seem to be any running machines.You have a complimentary shuttle service to and from FRA so for those of us on a budget, this hotel, considering the above average cleanliness, quiet location, and efficient staff make this the BEST value I have seen for a hotel near the airport.
