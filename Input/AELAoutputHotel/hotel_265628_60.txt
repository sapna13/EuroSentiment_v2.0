{"text":"Fantastic Time ! Great Hotel ! We have just returned from the Dominican from staying in the Sirenis Tropical Resort - 11th May till 18th May 2008. The Sirenis is a great relaxed and organised hotel, beautifully kept gounds in the most magnificant location. The hotel possesses a beautiful lobby area and enterance. The rooms were fine, clean and furnished well, maid service was good with a fully stocked mini bar everyday for free !The grounds of the hotel are very well kept and look great. The pool area was clean and well kept - there was always sunbeds freely available around the pool. If you like activities like me - this hotel is great. it has a decently equipt gym, a great spa with ice tub, hot tube and steam room. Tennis court, ping pong, archery and a few other things. The entertainment staff are great, always about organising activities, water polo, beach football etc....also if your there on a weekend you can verse the locals in arm wrestling ! The food is great, loads to choose from and 6 different resturants to book - all inculded in your package ! I would recomend the Italian and the Japanese ! The night entertainment is ok, with a different show each night.....the karoke is a laugh too ! The casino is small but also good !The hotel staff were all very friendly ! The beach is amazing, with a selection of water sports included in your package !This was a great holiday for me and my fiance and were thinking of going back in november. ","annotations":[]}
