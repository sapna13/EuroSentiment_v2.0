{"text":"Excellent hotel in a very convenient area. Stayed here for 3 nights while on a business trip in Boston. I managed to get a great rate for the standard room and was a little concerned that I would end up in a miserable corner somewhere in the depths of the hotel. Thankfully I ended up in a nicely appointed room next to the elevator. And - no elevator noise. The view was less than stellar - a rooftop and looking up to the Prudential Center but I wasn't there for the view.The closet was a true walk-in closet with plenty of quality hangars, luggage stand, a safe, ironing board and iron. Also provided were terry cloth robes for in room use. I could even fit my luggage in the closet and still get to my clothes with no problem. The only down side was the safe was too small to fit a standard laptop computer. Not very useful from that standpoint.The queen bed was comfortable and turn down service was provided every evening. The room was quiet and I didn't even need to use my earplugs. The free wireless internet worked fine and the flat screen TV worked fine. Lighting in the room was excellent.The bathroom was smallish but efficiently designed. Shower water pressure was strong (very strong) and hot water was consistent. The standard amenities were available and replenished when used.The service at the hotel is excellent. The front desk was more than polite and informative. The bell staff was helpful and polite. The valet and doorman went out of there way to get a cab from around the corner during a heavy rain. The only restaurant I used on the premises was Solas the Irish Pub and I had the Mussels in white wine broth for an appetizer (excellent with great bread for dipping) and the Apple Crisp with Ice Cream (a little burnt on top but still tasty). I was stuffed. Service was polite but a little frazzled.The location of the hotel is excellent. I went to a restaurant on Newbury Street, Tapeo, for Spanish tapas. It was within easy walking distance of the hotel. I had been there before and recommended it to a small business group. It turned out to be a winner again. Excellent service and great food. You can walk to one of two T stops to get around town and there are plenty of other good restaurants and shopping in the area. Checkout was easy and no surprises. All in all an excellent stay.
