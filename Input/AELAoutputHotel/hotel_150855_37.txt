{"text":"Second Trip to Punta Cana -Riu Taino not the best!!! Enjoyed our stay at the Riu Taino Feb 20-27th (Two adults age 41 and 37, two kids 14 and 12, Mom and Dad in-law 77 and 79 years)but were disappointed with a few things. We had read many reviews both good and bad. We are not picky people, good old Saskatchewan folk, but we found the Riu pale in comparison to the Grand Palladium Resort and Spa we had stayed at in 2006. I guess the biggest thing was the rooms, now I know you don't spend much time there but they were small, older and yes musty. 15-20 years of humidity like that no wonder. We did get used to this after a day or two. But it seems to me they have added the older resort to the Taino, as we were left of the second pool, this is shown as a seperate resort on many maps- no patio doors on these older style villas, wished we had been in the ones that are pictured on the web site. The beds, which eveyone complains about, I actually found to be ok, except there were no blankets, just a thin, thin bedspread on a sheet. They are firm beds, and yes smaller than what you may be used to....but just have a rum before bed!! Ha ha. We asked the front desk for blankets and they delivered them before 3 that day, then all was well. The water and beer guy was good the first two days then we didn't see him much. Maybe should have tipped more????Hotel staff at the restaurants, bar, pool all great. Beach fantastic, resort grounds very nice. Food ok, not as good as last trip. Not as much selection I guess. We got tired of the buffet after a couple days. We did the Italian and the Steak house, both pretty good. All in all, we still had a great trip, just not as 5 Star as the Grand Palladium. But taking the kids there would have been considerably more $$$$. Excursions: We did the Outback Safari, 2nd time with this company,(Peurto Plata 2001) we enjoyed this much more than the Monster Truck Safari-they just look after you better. Also did the Dolphin Island tour, quite an experience. More costly than Manati Park but apparently more time with the dolphins. Not much for English speaking staff here, they spoke more French and Spanish. Oh well the dolphins don't speak either, and that is why we went. They are truly beautiful, gentle creatures.This year we didn't take anything but American cash, we spent about 400.00 on bracelets, t-shirts, cigars, vanilla, coffee, coconut oil etc. More because of the kids of course. Lots of nice shops on Caribe Street, in the center of all the Riu's. Skyservice was fine, no leg room, but big plane, food was good cause we were starving!!! Our flight was two hours late leaving Punta Cana, we enjoyed the Wendy's at the airport very much. Almost exactly like home.So in summary, if you want 5 Star, book at the Riu Palace, or Grand Palladium Resort and Spa. IF you just want a clean friendly resort where the ocean is turquoise, the sand is soft and white, the Riu Taino will not disappoint.Shannon- Nipawin Sk, Cananda ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1902,"mention":"Monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Monster_Energy"],"startOffset":1895},{"endOffset":1902,"mention":"Monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Monster_Energy"],"startOffset":1895},{"endOffset":1902,"mention":"Monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Monster_Energy"],"startOffset":1895},{"endOffset":2378,"mention":"vanilla","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mille-feuille","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Vanilla"],"startOffset":2371},{"endOffset":2386,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2380},{"endOffset":2453,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2449},{"endOffset":2780,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":2774},{"endOffset":2780,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":2774}]}
