{"text":"Nice stay We stayed at the Hilton Caribe for 3 nights 7\/28 to 7\/31. Cab ride from airport to hotel for 3 people with 3 bags was $23. checked with others, and everyone paid under $25.Nice hotel, nice people working there, very clean. Lots of places to eat at hotel, some more expensive than others. Drinks are not cheap, pretty standard for resorts. No complaints.Our room was in the tower and was very nice. It was clean, the bathroom was updated and very nice. Our housekeeper was a wonderful lady that did a great job and went out of her way to make our stay comfortable. We had a small fridge in the room that we stocked with water and drinks from the shop across the street. No complaints at all.The beach area is sheltered by the man made reef area, we enjoyed it, great for kids to play in, and mine loved the big slide out on a float. We snorkeled every day at the Caribe beach and saw amazing fish! Highly recommend - they rent the masks\/snorkels for $5 at towel hut. Every room can get a beach umbrella free of charge, and that made staying out for long times bearable.We liked the pool, although it is a small one. My child liked jumping off the sides into the pool, and the waterfalls. The pool does get a bit dirty, however, I saw them scooping and cleaning everyday.Only downside for this hotel is how far away it is to Old San Juan. We wanted to shop and sightsee, and heard cabs were about $12 to get to Old San Juan. We did walk to the bus stop, easy walk around the corner. Bus ride is easy and quick and no more than .75 cents. Bus stops running at 9pm. We went with a big group in cab and they charged us $3 per person instead of flat rate, so just be upfront with them.The bus stop in Old San Juan is right by cruise ships, and it's quite a bit of walking to get to the old forts and the other side of shopping area, so wear good shoes and bring a map. There is a free trolley that goes around Old San Juan, however we found that the cruise ship people took up all the seats and you could waste much time just waiting on a trolley. We had no problems with the trolley the day there were no cruise ships in port.We did eat at the Parrot Club- very good, highly recommend.
