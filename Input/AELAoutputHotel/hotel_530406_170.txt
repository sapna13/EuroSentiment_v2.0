{"text":"Excellent resort Although I had read reviews here before I left, the negative reviews had me a little bit sceptical. It turns out we had nothing at all to worry about. Everything from check-in to check-out went smoothly.The grounds were beautiful and the beach was awsome. All the staff were very friendly and tried their best to cater to whatever you asked for and did it with a smile. They also have a very good Medical Facility on the grounds, which we had to use when our son broke his toe. The Doctor was really good and the insurance part was handled with no problems.There were several restaurants to choose from along with the buffet and I would say the food was above average with something for everyone. The type of clientel can change from week to week, but our experience is that this is a fabulous family vacation spot for kids up to around the age of 15. We have a 17 year old and a 5 and 4 year old. Our teenager didn't meet too many people his age but still had a good time enjoying all the activities provided around the pool and at the beach.This is exactly the same property and resort as the Ocean Blue, so I don't know why it is advertised differently. I found while shopping for the vacation that the Ocean Sand was cheaper.My only two negative points which are very minor in my opinion, and that I had also read about prior to going, is the Time Share guys who meet you everyday at the Buffet entrance. They wear golf shirts that say Royal on them and they bug you going in and out, but just say no and keep walking. You'll get sick of them after a few days. Also the language barrier I did find a problem at times. I don't expect the gardeners and cleaning staff to be able to speak to you, but certainly the Front Desk staff and Guest Services staff. They will try and do their best with a smile, but it might take a few trys to get what you want.Last thing, if you are a coffee lover Mikes Coffee is a must. If you aren't, you'll be a coffee lover by the time you leave.
