{"text":"A great few days but marred by noisy building works As there are a great number of hotels in Florence we researched extensively before deciding upon the Casci, which was rated highly in both the Lonely Planet Guide and on trip advisor. On arrival, after a short walk from the train station, we were somewhat surprised at the entrance off the street, which was clad in scaffolding and appeared to be in a poor state of repair.We were greeted by extremely friendly staff and shown to our room which was smaller than we'd anticipated, but its location more than made up for this. The hotel is situated within a 5 minute walk of the Duomo and other central attractions of Florence and couldn't have been better placed.However, we were awoken the next morning at 8am by builders renovating the hotel and adjoining properties which was a most unwelcome start to our first day's sightseeing. The works continued throughout the day and the constant noise only ceased at around 4-5pm. Night-time was also interrupted by the room's extremely noisy air conditioning system, which was essential during our stay as temperatures were in the mid 20s at night.Breakfast was an interesting experience, with two helpful, but extremely fussy serving assistants, who wouldn't let us help ourselves to food or drink, even though it was a self service buffet! This made breakfast a somewhat unpleasant experience for all the guests who were visibly uncomfortable with this strictly enforced regime.After our experience, we are amazed that the Hotel Casci is so highly rated in Trip Advisor, and the Lonely Planet Guide. If you want a hotel with a great location then look no further, but i'm sure there must be equally priced alternative hotels without the issues highlighted above. ","annotations":[]}
