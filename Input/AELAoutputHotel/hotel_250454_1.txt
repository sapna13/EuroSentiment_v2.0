{"text":"Excelent location We Flew from Stansted to Sch√ä√ª√∂nefeld with Ryan air then we had to get to Berlin itself which was very easey indeed The quickest way to get into the city is by taking the RB14 Airport Express Train(use this to get back to the airport too) from platforms 3 or 4 at Berlin Sch√ä√ª√∂nefeld Flughafen Station which is an easy six minute walk from the airport terminal. Once at the station you get yourself a travel ticket from the multi lingual machine which will only cost you a few Euro's with plenty of options depending on your stay. It only took us 25 mins to get to Alexanderplatz. Once we arrived we needed a U pass for the underground which was excelent by the way and you pay depending on which zones you want to travel to. This is the best way to get around by far it was so simple. On arrival at Hotel we were swiftly checked in. The only fault i could come up with was that the smoking room we asked for smelt quite strong of smoke ( Yes i might be stating the obvious) That aside it was a very nice clean good sized modern looking room  nice firm bed too. I certainly have a no problem staying here again it was a very nice Hotel. Food  Drinks can be a little on the pricey side but at the time the dire Euro rate wasnt exactly helping matters anywhere we went. Berlin has alot to offer you we went for the xmas markets and they very good. At the same time we done alot of sight seeing like Checkpoint charlie, Berlin wall and Brandenburg gates to name a few.. Also the shops had alot to offer too its a great place to shop but as i said earlier the Euro rate stopped us from shopping unfortunately. Overall i recommend Berlin and the Novotel Berlin Mitteas a recommended stay. People were friendly good things to see and do. We had rain on our first day there but it didnt dampen our spirits thanks Berlin ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1028,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1024},{"endOffset":1071,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1067},{"endOffset":1028,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1024},{"endOffset":1071,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1067},{"endOffset":1153,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1149},{"endOffset":1420,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":1416}]}
