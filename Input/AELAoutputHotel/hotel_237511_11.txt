{"text":"Such an accommodating place - Wonderful surprise! My travel agent recommended this hotel - after I had spent weeks on end researching properties. We are two women who wanted to stay in a safe and affordable location, but since I travel frequently, I am SUPER picky about where I stay (it has to be nice). Hotel Giglio was everything we were promised and more. When we got lost because of a protest and street closures trying to find them, they sent someone out on a motorbike to find US! He then proceeded to help us schlep all our bags about 5 blocks to the hotel location. They were so nice and accommodating and helpful about the local attractions  area at check in, and even though we had only booked a double room, we ended up with a quad that actually had a balcony overlooking the street. The room had high ceilings, big windows with shutters and doors that opened for fresh air, a nice bathroom with a good shower and great ambiance - older Italy, only new  updated. They have airconditioning in the room (not that we needed it, it was fall) and a flat screen TV. They even have free wireless internet (which worked better in the lobby than the room). The lobby has a small bar and espresso machine - and there was breakfast the next morning, which was a wonderful surprise. Right across the street there is a cute cafe  sandwich shop - just the place to pick up a snack, and just a short walk away you find all the museums, the outdoor market and everything you want to see in Florence, as well as great food!I highly recommend this hotel - it was a delight and if I ever return to Florence, this will be where I will stay.
