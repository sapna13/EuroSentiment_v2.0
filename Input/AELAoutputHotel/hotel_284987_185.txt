{"text":"Worst Service Ever Experience (Stay Away). Stay at Westin The grounds of the resort was beautiful, but their so called beach is NOT A BEACH. It's a rocky shore where you can't really swin. The pool was beautiful. Outside of that here I will grade each area of SERVICE WHICH IS THE WORST OUR FAMILIES EVER EXPERIENCED.* Restaurants: Three weeks prior to departing to PR, I spoke to their ServiceXpress (Joanna) and was told that 3 restaurants will be opened during our stay. Well to our surprise, ONLY 1 RESTAURANT WAS OPEN FOR THE ENTIRE WEEK and the japanese (NAMI) is opened only on Fri  Sat. Now that is totally riduculous. You go on a vacation and expect to have a nice dining experience but you are stuck eating the same food. We had to rent a car to go out of the resort to eat after 2 days of the same food. We went to Old San Juan (Highly recommended)  El Conquistador (Highly recommended). DON'T STAY AT GRAN MELIA.* Service: The service experience from the restaurant to the pool side was THE WORST. Gran Melia just doesn't care of taking care of their guest. If we asked for a drink, it seemed that we were bothering them. After complaining about 10 times to various management and front desk, their only excuse was that people were laid off. Even the people working there all agreed that service has gone done after Gran Melia took over from Paradisus. The restaurant personnel are not trained properly on how to serve guests. People don't care to wait on guests. At least in Mexico, the service personnel are eager to help the resort guest. That is not true of this resort. * Quality of Food: We ate at both the Italian and Japanese and it was well below par. The japanese restaurant hibachi grill cook used a ton of soy and all you tasted was soy sauce. The breakbast buffet (almost $30\/person) didn't have a variety.On a postive note, the rooms and the resort layout was beautiful but that doesn't help when your overall experience was horrible. I spoke to their management and they seemed not to care. SO PLEASE TAKE THIS RECOMMENDATION AND DON'T STAY AT GRAN MELIA PUERTO RICO. STAY EITHER AT EL CONQUISTADOR OR WESTIN RIO DEL MAR.
