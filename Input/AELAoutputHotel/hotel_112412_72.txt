{"text":"Relaxed, modern, understated, affordable luxury We stayed for a week over New Year and were upgraded to a King room (the one in the brochures!) Huge, very comfy bed, french windows, big basket of yummy food and other goodies (with accompanying price list), as well as a mini bar and coffee machine. The bathrobes were funky animal print, and I even succumbed to the oh-so-soft socks that were for sale in the wardrobe. We wanted for nothing - whirlpool bath, hot shower, plenty of Aveda products in the bathroom that were reguarly replaced by housekeeping, and the nightly turndown, and room tidy up with chocolates made it feel extra special. It was great to have two armchairs. Almost every time we wanted a taxi, the doorman offered us the services of one of the hotel's drivers, for not much more than a taxi fare, so we travelled in soft leather seats, in style.This hotel is perfectly positioned for ease of access by foot to all of the Seattle tourist attractions. The bookbar is a lovely bar to pass the time of day, with indie\/aor\/soft rock\/ music playing, as well as lots of magazines, books and tvs to view. A great place to watch the world go by. We had a couple of breakfasts inThe Library Bistro, and found it to be a laid back, chilled out place, where child diners could be kept entertained by drawing on the brown paper tablecloths provided. We managed to catch only one wine reception between 5-6 as we were so busy, and were given a choice of good-quality wines, to sip whilst I painted a postcard. The artwork on the walls was changed whilst we were there, as well as the selection of magazines in our room. Probably the best hotel I have ever stayed in and would definately look to Kimpton when choosing another hotel.
