{"text":"melia caribe is the best!!! whats up fellas? my name is Jason from NYC. My dad, my brother, and I stayed at the Melia Caribe from july 6-15th and all i can say is, GO HERE! this was our third time in Punta Cana, and Melia is simply the best resort you can hope to find in Punta Cana. We went there to celebrate my 19th birthday and I had a blast. Melia Caribe is fairly big, but the grounds and landscaping is SOOOOO beautiful, you will hardly even notice the duration of a walk. All the exotic trees, plants, and little animals running around is breathtaking. The water of Bavaro Beach is NIIIIICCCEEE! the water is clear blue and just the feel of it is so smooth to the skin, you have to experience it for yourself of course! Melia has several restaurants and buffets, along with 5 or 6 bars. All the restaurants are excellent, but the best one in my opinion is the French restaurant called Ma Maison (eat the salmon dishes!!) The food is excellent in Melia, the drinks are just as good! The Dominican People are VERY VERY nice, so different from what you find in America! They are always smiling and very friendly! ... The rooms are comfortable and clean, most are spacious...DO NOT forget to catch the shows in the Caribe side of the hotel starting at 10 pm, it is terrific.. all you need for the show is a seat, a nice cold Presidente (dominican Beer)..the drinking and gambling age for that island is 17, so i was made! ... The lobby is big and beautiful! ... All in all, the Melia Caribe is the most beautiful and accomodating hotel in Punta Cana. Friendly staff, great food and drinks, fun shows and disco clubs. STAY HERE BOTTOM LINE!!! You will NOT regret it!
