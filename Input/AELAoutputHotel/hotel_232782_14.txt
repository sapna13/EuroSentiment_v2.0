{"text":"Excellent location We have just returned from a 4 night stay at Hotel Lleo 13 - 17 April 2008.We, myself husband and 9 year old daughter, booked this hotel direct via their website at a significant saving than going through a travel agent. We paid 160.00 Euros per night for bed and breakfast including taxes.The hotel is lovely - we had a large clean triple room with electric beds, air conditioning, piped music overlooking the street with a small balcony. With the balcony doors open it was noisy but to be expected for a city centre hotel - its surprising how much noise the doors cut out! The bathroom was fully functional if a little dated. Breakfast was excellent - definately something for everyone - buffet style which was constantly topped up - cooked food as well as contential meats and cheeses - we really enjoyed it.The location is excellent - just off Catalunya Square and La Ramblas - within easy walking distance of the beach and the hoards of restaurents and shops.The staff were efficient and polite - allowing us to leave our luggage before the room was ready and after departure.We booked the hotel, flights etc all seperately but, fortunately it all worked out well - take the Aeorbus from the airport to the Square at a cost of 4.05 Euros leaves every 10 mins or so and takes approx. 25 mins. We used the tourist bus which was excellent and covered all the major sights - you can 'hop on and off'. Public toilets are non-existant - a slight problem with children - but theres always McDonalds, Starbucks for these conveniences.All in all, we would definately stay here again - I just regret not staying longer - Barcelona is a fab city with fantastic buildings and lots to see and do - its great to have a beach to relax on.
