{"text":"Looks like a dated retirement home Just like many of the other reviewers we received a discounted rate through an auction site. This is apparently the only way to fill their rooms since they have little else to go on. This must be one of the worst decorated 4 star hotels in the US. They have some weird plastic log cabin theme complete with dated prints, a dirty bear foot stool and a teddy bear on the bed.The decor is dated and the carpets are worn through. The rooms are decorated in terrible taste but I have to give them credit for a comfortable bed and a small but functional bathroom. If you are used to large American style hotel room you will be very disappointed since they have tiny European style rooms. To make matters worse the room had some weird odor which is either from old age or from smoking. The waterfront view was overrated since the first bunch of rooms have their view obscured by the ugly building next door. Even though we were on the other side of the train tracks we still heard the trains coming by every hr or so.The lounge was decorated in the same bad taste log cabin style decor but played hip ultra lounge music. After scrutinizing the poor drinks menu and paying too much for our drinks we got the hell out of there. You can only stomach so much of the ugly decor. You want to save all your energy just to get through the night in the ugly hotel room without jumping in to the water.We will not stay here again even if it is the last hotel available in Seattle. In a city with such diverse and amazing hotels it is hard to believe that this place is still in business. Next time I will book directly with a well reviewed hotel and pay a little extra a night.
