{"text":"Not your usual four-stars If you're looking for the standard 'marble and brass' of most four-star hotels, then you'd be in for a bit of a shock at the Great Southern. This hotel is a 1920's pub that has been faithfully restored with a classic art-deco theme. At the same time, careful attention has been given to all the modern conveniences such as large wide screen LCD TV, ducted air and modern bathrooms. The fact that it is a real old-fashioned pub is both its strength and its weakness. It oozes character, but it is bound by the limitations of an old building; small box-like rooms without big windows, squeaky floors, small lifts etc. Despite it's modernisation, I still felt like I was staying in an old-style pub.The hotel is located close to Central station and in close proximity to Chinatown, markets and Darling Harbour. That makes it far more than a stroll to the main harbour area. However, buses run regularly down George Street and the train is quite close. It also means that it is in the rougher area of the city. Generally Sydney is very safe, but some people may feel more intimidated by the nightlife around this area of the city. Being on the main road, there was a little bit of noise. However, the double glazing reduced the worst of it. No noise from the pub below seemed to filter upstairs.Cheap counter meals are available at the pub downstairs. I couldn't see any sign of room service and the mini bar was empty. There were instructions on how to purchase items to place in the mini bar from the pub below. Not really what you expect from four-stars. Breakfast was satisfactory, offering cereals and a limited selection of hot dishes; Asian and English. There were no pastries and no fresh fruit. For an additional $18, I would rate the breakfast as ordinary value for money. Staff were helpful and courteous.However, the thing that impressed me the most was the bed. I have endured some pretty ordinary hotel beds. However, this bed was fantastic! It was incredibly comfortable, with a heavy, warm quilt and big fluffy pillows. If you choose your room on bed comfort, then this hotel is right up the top.However, the main reason that you would go to the Great Southern Hotel is the price. Rooms are discounted as low as $100 AU a night (without breakfast). You'd be lucky to find a dodgy two-star for less than that. This place is great value for money. As it is newly renovated, I suspect that this price is part of the drive to build up a customer base.If you're on a budget and your main concern is a clean, comfortable place to sleep, then you can't go past this hotel.
