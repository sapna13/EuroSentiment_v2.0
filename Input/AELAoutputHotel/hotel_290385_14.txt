{"text":"Good overall but also pricey for what you got! Chose this hotel because it looked decent and a bit more contemporary than some other 4-5 star hotels that appear to sometimes be quite dated, even if clean. Everything was good in terms of cleanliness and prompt service etc. We got one of the rooms on the top floor (601) with a nice view of the Eiffel tower. The room was not that big but ok for our needs and bathroom was relatively clean. The only downside was really that it felt a bit as if one was only paying for the decor. I mean, one small soap for two people is a bit tight and even more so if it is not replaced with a new one after the first day. Same for shower gel. I mean it does not cost much, and i appreciate hotels trying to avoid customers just bagging them every day but you should expect one soap per person at this room price. That was the only downside and it would have been nice to have breakfast included at this room price too although it was clear before that it wasn't and that it is pretty standard to have a room without breakfast. However I stayed at other hotels that are much better in terms of price for money, but in other cities, Lisbon, Brussels etc. Paris seems a bit more expensive. If that is acceptable to you, go ahead and book this one, as it is a nice small smart boutique hotel that your significant other should enjoy as well.
