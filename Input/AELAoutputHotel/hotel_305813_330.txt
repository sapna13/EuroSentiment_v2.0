{"text":"One of My Favorite Hotels A little about me, I'm a college graduate with an Architecture degree and am not rich by any means and thus don't have the funds to stay at hotels of a luxurious sort and though I have been fortunate enough to stay at some pretty suave hotels in my short life The Langham Place was simply one of the best. Though I would have preferred a hotel located on the HK Island side of the harbor the location was fantastic. Getting to the hotel was a simple bus ride away from the airport and you literally do not have to go above ground to get from the MTA station to the hotel. The hotel is connected to a brand new shopping mall (with a Starbucks right outside the lobby) and the famous Mong Kok shopping markets right outside the doors. The design is hip and wonderfully fun. The hotel bar is hopping with live music at night and the spa, gym and rooftop pool are all free for hotel guests to use. The gym may not be fully equipped and I'm sorry to say I did not try paying for the full spa treatment but the rooftop pool was spectacular. The room features were wonderful and the bathroom was a design treat. Don't forget to ask for an iPod stereo if you happen to bring your iPod. And while there's free internet downstairs there's only a few computers and it's slow but to get the quick connection in your room you have to pay around $20 a night. So all in all the hotel was amazing. So much so that it was dangerous because we spent much more of our five days in Hong Kong enjoying the hotel than we would have liked to. And that's one of the biggest compliments I can give it.
