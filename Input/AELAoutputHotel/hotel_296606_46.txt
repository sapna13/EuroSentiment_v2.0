{"text":"Superb Deal This is the second time we have stayed at the Luxor, and it is just the same. Very friendly staff, hotel reception is clean, well decorated, warm and welcoming. I noticed when we booked this hotel it was classed as a 1 star, last time we stayed here is was a 3 star. While i dont agree with it being a 1 star, it is a very high 2 star or average 3 star. We got a very good deal of √ä√£¬¢120 for two people for 2 nights, including breakfast and city tax, which considering its location is very good. Location is right in the heart of the city, red light district is around the corner, good range of places to eat a stones throw away, as are cafes. It can get very busy outside and if you get a room over looking the street it can get noisy, but we had asked for a room at the rear and got it, which made a huge difference. The rooms are well laid out, nothing grand, but clean and comfortable, the bathroom we had was great, continetal style, walk in shower with endless amounts of hot water, and i mean hot, with a shower that if put on full blast will knock you over( ideal after a cold wander around the city)Breakfast is served until 11am, which suits us, no need to fall out of bed early !! Breakfast is as you would find in any other hotel, cheese, smoked meats, boiled eggs, selection of bread and rolls, jams etc, all very nice, very fresh. The coffee is great, just what is needed to wake you up. It has been mentioned in other reviews aboutthe size of the breakfast area, yes it is a little cramped, but no worse than other hotels, and if the breakfast area is full then you can use the tables up around the bar. If anything it is better up there as you can watch the world go past as you eat breakfast.The doors of the hotel are locked, this is to keep out the riff raff, and should by no means put you off, just press the buzzer and door is buzzed open, but to be honest we never had to buzz as there is always some one at reception.To sum the Luxor up, cracker of a little hotel, well worth the money !
