{"text":"Exactly what I expected We stayed at the sunroute from jun 28th thru july 4th and thanks to all the helpful reviews from tripadvisor, we got exactly what we expected. We took the limousine bus, which was nice to see all the sites on the way to the hotel...It took about an hour and a half with a little traffic, but it was pretty convenient.Yes the rooms are tiny, but very clean and manageable. Only complaint is that our room was very humid, since the lights and ac only works when the card is in the key slot, but once the ac was on it was okay. Oh and don't lose your keycard b\/c they charged us $5 for the one we lost. Loved the toilets! and they provide everything you need in the bathroom. They also give you one very soft and one very hard pillow.We tried the breakfast buffet the first day and it wasn't worth the money (about $15) and the food wasn't that tasty...I've had much better in other hotels and for $15 you have a lot of other options. Also, Starbucks, Krispy Kreme, McDonalds, AMPM (great sandwiches for real cheap), and lots of coffee shops are nearby.The computer lounge is great, but there will always be people waiting to use the computers. Use the southern terrace exit from the shinjuku subway station and its a 5 min walk to the hotel. If you use the south gate exit, there is a great ramen cart right in front of the exit (opens around 8pm) You really can't beat the location...its close enough to everything, but its still nice and quiet.Staff's english was quite good and they were pretty helpful. Overall, we had a lovely time and experience with the sunroute plaza shinjuku and a memorable time in Tokyo! Your too tired at the end of the nite anyway that all you need is a comfy bed.
