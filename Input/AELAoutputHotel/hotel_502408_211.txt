{"text":"TA Scores Again Our family (two adults and two teen agers) were steered to this hotel by other TA reviews and, as usual, were not disappointed. The room was large; for New York, very large. The decor was stylish and attractive. The beds were very comfortable and luxurious. We had plenty of closet space, the bathroom was great and first class. Really a nice and comfortable space.The hotel staff was way beyond what I expect in terms of service. Unlike many, I find New Yorkers friendly and helpful as a lot, but the staff here was as helpful and attentive and fun as any I have ever experienced (and that is a large database). The common spaces were somewhat tight, but typical for Manhattan. The exercise room had everything I needed..good, but not the best. The location was good for us...just on the edge of the busiest part of Midtown east...a short walk to either MOMA, theaters or the delightful residential neighborhoods near the East River. If I had to pick on something, it would be that the kitchen was a little downscale from the rest of the room. Given that we received a free upgrade to a room with a kitchen, I can't complain. And it was fine, but just a little on the cheap side relative to the rest of the room and hotel.We paid about $300 per night in high season for the four of us...not too much by Manhattan standards. In short, unless you are going budget with price as the necessary and primary concern, this is a great hotel and a great value. ","annotations":[]}
