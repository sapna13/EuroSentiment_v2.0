We also stayed at the Condado Plaza Hotel  Casino. Martineau Bay is more tropical and less intrusive. A fancy looking villa resort with a casual feel. The lobby was big and the check-in was fine. We were shuttle to our room on a golf cart so we didn't have to walk. Although the rooms used keys we felt very safe. Something that can never be said of keys for most hotels. The room was wonderful and welcoming. The decor was beautifully stated with tile floors. The tub was big enough for two! The shower was tiled from top to bottom with no door. Very romantic bathroom for honeymooners. But I was there with my teenage daughter which was still fine. Mainly because you are hidden slightly while you shower. If that is not private enough you can simply close and lock the bathroom door. The toilet has it's own door in the bathroom but mind that privacy is only a breezy shutter door to cover you. With double sinks and lots of toiletries, all in all, the bathroom was a vacation favorite. The patio is small but very pretty with outdoor table and chairs. The walkways from all the villas lead to the pool and are lit at night. The pool was no deeper than 4 feet and very roomy. A swim up bar leads up to a large hut which sits between the pool and the patio deck for eating. The view of the ocean can be seen from both the patio and the pool while swimming. To go to the beach you simply walk down some steps and beach lounges are there on the beach. The water of course is warm. To go off the resort beware of the taxi prices. With that said we highly recomend eating at the affordable Richard's. The place is quaint and we didn't hold alot of expectation being that the name was American. Even though we live in MD and love our American food, we are also Puerto Ricans and know out stuff. Were we surprised. This place serves freshly made athentic Puerto Rican food. So, we ordered a ton of food with cocktails and left very happy. We had the taxi take us to a local mini mart and grabbed orange juice and little prepacked muffins (breakfast), chips, Coke, and Bacardi (snacks) to take back to our room. We then got prepared with our swim suits for the Bio- Bay tour. Amazing, amazing, amazing. Just go! Definitely get in the water. Don't hold back. The bus ride there and back was hilarious. It is the roughest and fastest ride you will experience. We couldn't stop laughing thru the whip lash. If you have no sense of humor and are tightly wound, this bus ride is not for you. Later that night we went with our snacks to the pool, meeting our other friends staying at the Resort. No one was around after 10 o'clock but the pool and patio stays lit. We grabbed wine glases from the pool bar, fixed our rum  cokes, crunched on chips, lounged and talked for hours. The highlight that night was floating on our backs with up lights on the plam trees sourrounding the pool and the stars that took our breathe away. On check-out day we did indeed order food and cocktails from the Resort's pool hut. It was very expensive and we only did it once. It was good and the view from the patio deck was gorgeous to go with it. Book this resort thru the hotel directly.
