{"text":"Very Nice Indeed I stayed at Library Hotel this past Sunday night and I was very pleased with the experienced.I actually live in Brooklyn, so I wasn't exactly coming in from out-of-town. What I wanted was a one-night stay in Manhattan in order to recharge my batteries. I work long hours, often from home, and when I actually have a day off, I find myself drifting back towards my desk to work. As such, I literally needed to get out of my own home in order to get some rest and peace. I chose Library Hotel based, in part, on what I read on TripAdvisor and I got the recharge that I needed.The hotel is very nicely done. It's modern, but not in an in-your-face kind of way. The staffers I encountered were exceptionally nice and helpful. My room (including bathroom) and all the common areas were spotless. The wine  cheese reception was a nice touch. I slept in and didn't partake in the breakfast. The 14th floor bar was closed because it was Sunday (as was room service, which is fine because I know the restaurant and I'm not impressed by it), but you could lounge up in the bar area if you wanted and it looked like a fine place to enjoy a cocktail. I got a pretty fair rate directly through the hotel because it was a Sunday and this is a rather slow time of year.The only drawbacks I could see is that the rooms are small. I stayed in a Junior King Suite and it was easily the smallest suite I've ever stayed in. I, however, knew this going in so I wasn't very concerned and the room itself was fine. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the shower pressure was excellent. The bathtub was not huge, but I'm a big man and I fit in it without a problem.Here's who I think would absolutely love Library Hotel: Bookworms (obviously); travelers who prefer a boutique hotel experience versus a high-end chain; travelers looking for a quiet alternative to other mid-town locations; and, people who enjoy staying in at night at least once during their stay (the common spaces, DVD library, stacks of books, etc. provide plenty of free entertainment, plus there's the nice lounge upstairs).I probably wouldn't stay at Library Hotel again, but that's because I live here and the next time I vacation in Manhattan, I'll look for something higher up the luxury scale and with more amenities (a bigger room being the biggest thing). However, I will and have already recommend it to my friends who come for a visit and want to stay somewhere nice, a little bit different and in a good location.Library Hotel gets high marks and their rating on TripAdvisor is well-deserved.
