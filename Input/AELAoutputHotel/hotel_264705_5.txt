{"text":"Can't say enough about this Hotel! - Please read about lost wallet!!! Hotel Innova is terrific. It was my runner up for a trip last december, and I was glad I got to stay there this time. My girfriend and I stayed for a couple nights and everything was great.They were renovating the lobby when we stayed, and it looked like it would be very nice when finished. The rooms were nice, and the elevator was newly renovated. It's easy to see that they are putting a lot into the place. Breakfast on the 1st floor was very good, and they also offer free internet in the lobby.The best part - I left my wallet in the nightstand, and the manager went way out of his way to get it back to me. If you're a frequent traveller and have ever left something in a room, you know how hard it is to get it back. Well, the housekeeper found it and gave it to the manager, who then called my us cell phone and emailed me, before I even noticed it was gone. We took the TGV to the south of france that morning, and arranged to have DHL pick it up. He put the wallet in an envelope inside another envelope and sent it back, everything inside. My GF and I both speak french and had a good time in France, but as always, there were a few times when we struggled with the 'indifference' french people in service businesses show to travelers. That's why we were so amazed with the extra effort and professionalism the hotel showed. I would definintely recommend that you stay at the Innova. ","annotations":[]}
