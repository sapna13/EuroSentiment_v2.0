{"text":"Nicely located hotel to explore Amsterdam My stay at the IBIS Stopera was very good and I give it top marks for location, access, hospitality and functionality. For UK residents, the IBIS Stopera in Amsterdam is the equivalent of the Travel Inn, Travel Lodge or Holiday Inn Express. Rooms are standard with a double bed with en-suite decent shower and toilet facilities.The hotel is 15 √à√\u2020\u2022?20 walk to the city centre, 10 min walk to RLD and 5 min walk to the underground train station and overland tram. Getting there from Schiphol is easy. Take the train from Schiphol to Amsterdam Central. At Amsterdam Central take the underground to Waterlooplein (Second stop). If all goes well the whole journey is one hour from Schiphol. Buy a return ticket at Schiphol if you know when you are returning (It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ √à√\u2020√ü?.60 each way). I will also suggest that you buy a 24hr, 48hr or 72 hr travel card, as it can be used on the bus, tram or underground.If you do sleep light, then I suggest you request a canal view room. There are no tea or coffee making facilities but there is a supermarket minutes away. The controlled TV has CNN, BBC1, BBC2, MTV and Eurosport. There is air conditioning as well. To go on the Internet you can use the PAYG computers in reception or buy Wireless Hotspot Pass (√à√\u2020√ü?.95 for 60 min) if you want to gain access using your Laptop. I had wireless connectivity in my room, which was quite good. I did not have breakfast and they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try to impose it on you as hotels do in England (Food is cheaper elsewhere). On the whole I enjoyed my stay here and if you are not fussed about being waited on, lush surroundings but want a very decent, clean place to stay then the IBIS will not be a bad choice. I will go back if I go to Amsterdam again.
