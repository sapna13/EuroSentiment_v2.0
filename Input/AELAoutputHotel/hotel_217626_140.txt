{"text":"Exceeded expectations I stayed at the Benjamin on 1\/6 having received the recommendation from a friend and liking the central location. There are a number of hotels within this block including Affinia 50, Doubletree Metropolitan, the Kimberly and the San Carlos. I booked an online rate of $198.00 with Hotels.com. The room on the 22nd floor was small but with a nice view and very comfortable amenities - super comfy bed with down comforter, thick towels. Nice mini bar selection, printer, internet access etc... Only complaint was that the room lacked a full length mirror. When I called to ask for a mirror, the hotel offered to upgrade me to a different room, but I was already settled and asked if they had a mirror that could be brought to the room. After a few phone calls back and forth between the front desk and housekeeping, not only did I get a full length mirror brought to the room, but also a voucher for breakfast to make up for the inconvenience. Room was very quiet. and amazingly had none of the usual aircon\/heating challenges of most NYC hotel rooms. Room service breakfast ordered the next morning came within 30 minutes and was nicely presented, hot and felt like someone in the kitchen actually cared about making it. Also took advantage of the hotel's spa for a facial which was excellent. The treatment rooms are a bit sparse but the esthetician's pleasant manner and expert touch more than made up for it. Service all around - excellent. I would stay here again and would recommend it as a great place to stay.
