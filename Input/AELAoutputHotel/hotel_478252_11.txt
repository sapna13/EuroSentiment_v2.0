{"text":"Extra Large Resort The entire site is generally very well maintained, clean and the gardens are beautiful.DominicansSmiley and courteous, most services are available in English and French. It is a good idea to get to use a few classic phrases in Spanish as a number of waiters at the table and room mates speak Spanish.RestaurantsWe had no problem to make reservations for 6 dinners in restaurants (3 per week). The Garden Grill, Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ de Paris and El Charro were excellent and the buffet was better than the 3 other we went to. The buffet is well diversified.From 10 AM to 9 PM, tea, coffee, muffins and croissants were served on the terrace of the Lobby Bar. The only place we found where the coffee was hot.Internet$12 USA for 30 cumulative minutes on 4\/5 days.Good speed and many interesting options for laptop rentals.CucarachasWe saw cockroaches or similar insects near and into restaurants, lobby, near the pool and a few feet from the door of our room. Hugh!RoomGood size, the furniture is getting a bit old. The cleaning of the room and the replacement of beverages was done properly at 50% of the time.Hair rinse and skin cream are not supplied.About every day, sewage odours were present in the room, we had to pour water in the sink and bath tub to seal the drains.2 out of 14 days, air conditioning was not cooling the room.Evening ShowsWe saw 8 different shows. Then, it was a repeat.Pools and beachUnless you have paid for a special club privileges only 2 pools are available. They seem to be well maintained.Chairs at the pool and at the beach are comfortable but at times less than one per cent is available.This is a huge resort, nice, clean and comfortable. The food is good. The service is uneven.Deficiencies in the room, uneven quality of service make it too expensive for the $ paid and consequently should not be rated 4.5 stars. We have seen much better in 4 stars resorts.
