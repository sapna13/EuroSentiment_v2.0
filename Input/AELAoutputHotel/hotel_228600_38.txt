{"text":"Can't really fault the hotel Spent 5nights at this hotel between 10th-15th June. Found the staff very helpful and friendly (thankfully not to the American 'have a nice day' excess). The Concierge was more than happy to book restaurants, taxi's, help with directions and find tickets to 'sold-out' venues.Hotel is located in a quiet side street in an extremelly central location. Our rooms were at the front of the hotel  the lighter sleepers did on occassion hear the nocturnal bin men, but i'd imagine no hotel is immune to the din these guys make.Otherwise sound insulation was superb, helped by the side street location.For a Spanish 4Star hotel it was plusher than I expected (their website images dont do the hotel justice), Decent sized rooms (i'd describe the beds as firm which suited me fine), large bathroom with excellent shower, mini-bar and free in-room safe. Air conditioning\/heating worked fine  windows that fully open .Didnt sample the restaurant, but drinks at the bar were well priced  service attentive.Back to 'location'. It's about as Central as you can get without being on a busy (noisy) main street. Just 2minutes walk to Puerta Del Sol (metro station  Madrid 'Vision Bus'), 3minutes to Gran Via  100yrds from the nearest Police Station (not that we ever needed to visit).Didnt see any hookers hanging around the hotel either (as mentioned in an earlier review). The only time we came accross them was when walking along one of the streets leading from Gran Via towards the hotel (closer to other hotels than the 'Maria Elena'). They seemed well behaved\/restrained, werent approaching anybody and could go unnoticed if you're not paying attention. The street can easily be avoided anyway if you are of a delicate natureNon of our party could find fault with this hotel, excepting a very minor grumble that the hotel didnt have a loan iron (so, dont forget to pack a travel iron).Would recommend this hotel without hesitation ","annotations":[{"endOffset":167,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":163},{"endOffset":1544,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":1539}]}
