{"text":"Perfect in Every Respect When I first saw all of the overwhelmingly positive reviews I almost suspected some sort of scam. But after having just returned from a seven night stay let me add my voice to the chorus of praises for this gem of a hotel. First of all, the location is perfect. Across from Luxembourg Gardens, a stone's throw from 4 metro stops that let you access the city with ease, and just a few quiet cobblestoned blocks away from restaurants, bars, cafes, upscale shops, jazz clubs, and whatever. Our room on the 5th floor was perfectly sized with a large, ultra-modern bathroom. We had one window overlooking the quiet courtyard and another overlooking the supposedly noisy Rue de Vaugirard which turned out to be a pussycat on the scale of noisy urban streets-- Paris is, after all, a city. The English-Speaking staff was helpful when we needed them to be, with restaurant recommendations and reservations and such, and maintained a dignified reserve when we just wanted to be by ourselves. The small bar and library was the perfect place for a drink before going out for the evening or a refresher after returning from a long day. The hotel breakfast, while simple, was more than adequate and provided an opportunity for us to plan each day's activities. I would not recommend this hotel as a place to stay with children, as it is intimately sized, without its own restaurant, and probably offers little opportunity for kids to meet other kids. But for the adult couple looking for the perfect Paris experience I couldn't possibly think of a better place. ","annotations":[]}
