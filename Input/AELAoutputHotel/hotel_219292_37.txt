{"text":"It Was Perfect We stayed at the Wyland Waikiki Sept 25-30th and when we first got there it was soo beautiful. The hotel itself is perfect. The art outside of the hotel and inside was so pretty and is so new so we loved it. We got the 3rd night free and a free upgrade which ended up being partial ocean view. The hotel is a few blocks away from the ocean but we got a nice view of the sunset at night from our room. 1703. Top floor. The room was soo nice, enough room for us 2 for sure. It was a room with a kitchenette and was beautiful. Shower is a lil small for 2 people but perfect for 1. We just loved everything about it. We got the free breakfast and it really isnt enought for breakfast so we ate out at a resturant for breakfast (On Lewers Street Moose McGillycudies is SOOO GOOD  SOO CHEAP) but we used the vouchers for bottled water before we went to the beach and a bagel too. It was good. The fron desk has free pixie sticks and the pool has free otter pops. A nice little extra they throw in there. The chill room has masage chairs and the bar has great virgin pina coladas as we do not drink :) we didnt eat at spada but it looked good. We were so happy overall with the hotel. The free 15 mins per phone call was awesom so I was able to call my 3 year old son in CA everyday and not have to worry about phone charges. Also there are computers to use in the lobby. Over all if we went back to waikiki I would stay at the hotel again. We didnt have a rental car but I think the hotel does charge $25 a night for parking so just keep that in mind.
