Breakfast- fried egg station, pancake station, variety of boiled egg,scrambled egg, potatoes, bacon, sausage, many breads, many juices. Table service for coffee, water.Dinner: Pork, lamb and fish available. They rarely had chicken or beef. Various rice, pasta, veggies. Table service for wines, mixed drinks, water. Lunch: buffet by beach, smaller. Was mostly pizza, pasta, salads, rice, fish. Table service for drinks.Drinks: wine was quite bad, saw many tables send it back and opt to pay to order bottles. Wine list that was availablewas mostly Chilean- 20US$- over 100. At the bars, they were generally generous with the alcohol in drinks- mostly mai tai, sex on beach, margarita, daqueri, and various rum drinks, one type draft beer. Lobby bar was the favourite.They also have tacos and pizza available upstairs above lobby buffet. Tacos are okay, pizza quite good.Resort: Many pools, well maintained, cleaned daily- open 7am-7pm. Beach had calm warm water, never a shortageof chairs. Vendors were limited to walking along perimeter next to ocean, not allowed to walk on beach and bother you. Overall, we were very happy with the resort, given the cost.
