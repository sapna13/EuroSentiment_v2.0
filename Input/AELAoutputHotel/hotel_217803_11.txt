{"text":"Clean hotel was just okay but very convenient to SeaTac This hotel is a bit dated but it is located right across the street from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport so it is very convenient. They have a free hotel shuttle so you may not need a car because parking is extra and is more expensive than even the adjacent off-airport parking lots.The initial smell inside the lobby was a bit musty. The elevators are a long walk from the check in desk and hard to find.The rooms are large and have decent furnishings that are not totally worn down like I was expecting. The beds were a little firmer than I liked but it did appear clean. I was expected a bad room based on the smell of the lobby, but I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were nice and we had very innovative and unique housekeepers.The room had a nice large desk and the Internet service was fast and easy to set up.While this is a decent place that has good prices, you have to take into account that you are right next to the airport.There is a great deal of airport noise and combined with the very loud air conditioning in our room, it is not easy to have a quiet night's sleep.Plus, there is a major construction project going in right across the street (they are building a light rail system from the airport to Downtown Seattle that opens in 2009. No more long taxi or shuttle rides that cost a lot and clog the roads).So, this a pretty good place to stay but be ready to deal with noise issues.
