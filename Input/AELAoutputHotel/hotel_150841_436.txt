{"text":"Iberostar Bavaro ~ Amazing Resort, Abssolute Paradise! My husband and I went to this resort for our honeymoon. Well, I didn't want to ever leave! This was the most romantic, beautiful place I've ever been. From the flamingo's and peacocks walking around, to lovely gardens and flowers, this was heaven. They had the most gourmet restaurants and food We'd ever experienced. The staff were so polite and friendly we enjoyed every minute of this holiday. All the restaurants were incredible, and our favourite was the French one. The buffet was equally as good as the specialty restaurants, and had so much food it was hard to walk away from! You could get really large on this holiday with all the amazing food! At the pool there is a health bar, fresh fruit blended into a cool drink. I definately recomend having a few of those a day! So refreshing. There is so much to do here you could stay for weeks. Games going on all the time, the staff keep you going with all kinds of activities so there is always something to do if you don't want to just lay on the beach. The entertainment at night....well, nothing less than amazing. We went to the show every night, and they have some incredible dancers and singers here. It was so much fun, and very entertaining. Totally worth going to. And the drinks at this resort were always amazing! I can't even begin to tell you how much we loved the Iberostar! I've heard that they are highly recomended, and I 100% agree. This was such a fantastic honeymoon for us I definately want to go back. If you are used to first class, this is the place to be~If you have any questions or concerns let me know. This resort is all it's said to be and more... star_doc@hotmail.com ","annotations":[]}
