{"text":"Excellent place for a honeymoon Great place for a honeymoon; this place is a wilderness palace with lots of modern amenities. We had a pool villa for two nights, and also got the romantic candle-light dinner. We appreciated the smiling faces, beautiful views and pool, and spacious rooms. THey also had free internet access, which could be particularly useful in a pinch. The staff was extremely amenable. We chose to watch the sunrise on Mount Batur, and we had to leave very early in the morning (3 AM). Despite this, the staff put together an amazing boxed breakfast and had tea and coffee waiting for us in the lobby area. When the internet would not work, they sent an engineer to come and help us get it fixed. The room came with a surround sound entertainment system. The place had a different vibe than our previous place, the Laguna in Nusa Dua -- being that it was out in the jungle, it was much more green, but also more buggy. Bugs were everywhere, but I must say they did a pretty good job of pest control overall. The shower and tub are outdoors, which is cool, but not if you're trying to avoid all life forms while bathing. The candlelight dinner was pretty good -- the food was good (except we didn't really have a taste for native indonesian food...but the spring rolls were some of the best we've had). They set up a very formal dinner set (with chair covers included) and we had a private waiter (who came and went), along with our own balinese musicians. Overall the place was great. We also found that our friend, Dewa, was very helpful -- [-] ","annotations":[{"endOffset":94,"mention":"palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":88},{"endOffset":581,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":578},{"endOffset":592,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":586},{"endOffset":581,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":578},{"endOffset":592,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":586}]}
