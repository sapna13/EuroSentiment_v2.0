{"text":"Loved the suite! I wasnt too sure about this resort at first because it was listed as 4 star and a rating of 3.5. I'm pretty sure it's a 5 star.Here are some perks I remain thankful for:-Hot water, good water pressure, ALL THE TIME-Two pools, once for relaxing, another for the activity minded-Beds (often taken though) on the beach.-Key for the safe is free-English tv-Fresh warm beach towels, all the time-Lobby looks great at night-Free catamarans (if you're feeling lucky dont pay the insurance)What surprised me the most was the suite, which is the standard room. There's 8 of them in each building. It's quite spacey and decorated well enough, with paintings here and there. There's no balcony in the back as in many of the places I've been. However, the doubledoors will give you a nice view of the grounds.There's no lock in the bathroom, but revolving doors that separate the toilet and bathtub from the sink\/quadruple mirror.Given your sizeable room, the problem then is that there is much space to cover between the beach and the lobby\/buffet. Transportation can come often enough but I have waited for more than 10 min on some occasions.Repairs were still going on the 3 restaurants by the beach that had burned down (fixed now). In the meantime, they allowed us to make reservations on the 3 sister resorts. We went to the Caribe Princess I believe for Brazilian food. The food was good, but the resort didnt look as nice. It made us very happy that we went to the 5 star.Some of us werent too happy that there was no AC, except in the Japanese restaurant. They also serve the same things for lunch and breakfast everyday :(You cant expect a Vegas-like performance from their troupe: they're doing 7 different routines a week.The Carribean ones were the better ones (for the sexy costumes) and I like Thriller on fantasy night.The other one I saw was The Lion King and thought it was horrid.Service was very good. The only glitch were the reservations, which were inflexible at the time but you wont encounter that anymore. We also never got our working remote control, a pen, and the missing umbrellas arrived one day later.The rest was fantastic, especially if you make an effort to speak Spanish. A warm and enthusiastic staff really makes your day.We got to know maybe 40 of them. By the end, people were waving at us and we smiled back, having no idea who they were.We really pushed it on our last night there: we came back at 3 am, went to the buffet, took some food (amazed that it was still available) and asked them to wrap it so we can take it back to our rooms). Then we asked them to send us a car, that would take us back to our room.Nightlife btw is decent. There's club Arreito which belongs to the chain so you can get in for free. 2 min by cab and one free shuttle at midnight I believe. There's also Mangu in the Occidental Grand Flamenco. Entrance is $6 USD and free drink.Both have two dance floors. Reggaeton, hip hop and dance music are abundant. They'll mix in bachata and merengue, maybe 5% of tracks. There are lots of locals on the sidelines which is really a sad story for me. I didnt think that's a wise use of their money...For those who are going to a resort for the first time:If you're going for expeditions, shopping outside, exploring, getting lessons from the aquatic club, just be careful. Know that you can bargain. This is a third world country and they will lie to you to get money. Know the rules and what they can charge you for. Being nice to them, being firm and giving them a nice tip instead of having them rely on commission from their boss will get you ahead.
