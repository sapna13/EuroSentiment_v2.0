{"text":"Nice looking but horrible hospitality I think this place is terrible; the only thing that I found to be fun was of course the casino. They give you complementary drinks and ham and cheese. However they say they close at 1 o√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√úlock when in fact they start kicking everyone out, and refuse to let people in 30 mins till. I complained to the manager and he gave me some B.S. excuses which I immediately spotted. The manager then told me he would get back to me in the morning after talking to his manager, which he never did his name was Joe. Getting back to the beginning of my trip and after a lengthily check in process, which I feel like they have 2 security guards for every 1 person. But for check in only one person which took us close to 30 mins to check in. After settling into our room we went to the pool bar which closes at 6 pm. We arrived at 5:50 and when turned away for food, we were directed toward the cafe which didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have any selection and were told to order room service which is expensive as hell, plus they conveniantly put a 17 percent tip on. I argued to the manager Rafael which understood and compt our food. Was the nicest manager in the world. However the next night we arrived at 540 pm at the bar thinking that this would be ok. Nope got turned away again saying they turned the gas for the grill off while 4 hamburgers where being grilled. My girlfriend was complaining about getting bitten on her leg and foot, and I saw little red spots on my feet. THERE FREAKING BED BUGS. I thought maybe mosquito bites but after reading other reviews she was right.The beach looks like crap, terrible terrible beach, the pool is nice and big, but after walking around it at night it had this huge build up of foam or slim. Disgusting.Comps at the casino where said that they were going to be given to us, since our attendance there was every night almost. We had to ask multiple times what was going to be compt. Finally after a 45 min check out we found out that it was a breakfast for two and there was five of us.After already talking to the manager multiple times and nothing was changing, I felt it better to stop complaining and to try and salvage what I had left of my vacation trip.Couple other things, no outside groceries allowed into the place, double check things and make sure you get people√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ names because nobody seems to have the same information. That is a totally different story. I am reminded about the stay that guy had in that movie Ocean's thirteen. Watch that, and you will have a little idea of the stay.
