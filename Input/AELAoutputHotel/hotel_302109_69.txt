{"text":"Great hotel, superb service The Shangri-la is a superb, top class, hotel. The rooms are excellent, as is the staff, and quality of service. Unfortunately, we could only stay for one night on a stopover on the way to Australia.It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a 30 minutes taxi ride from Changi airport to a friendly welcome from the efficient staff on arrival. Despite our early arrival (11am), check-in with our prebooked voucher was a breeze. Our heavy luggage was whisked up to our deluxe room by a friendly bellman (with a bright red jacket and pill box hat) who delighted in showing us all the room√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ facilities. The room in the Garden Wing on the 10th floor was spacious with chairs, a desk, broadband, a large well-appointed, bathroom, and a comfortable bed. The gardens are really nice with luxuriant flowers and other vegetation; we did not have time to use the nice swimming pool.The buffet breakfast offered good, wholesome, hot and cold food with a wide variety of choices, including good back bacon (not the cheap streaky\/fatty stuff offered by US hotels). Really excellent and hassle free. Had a sumptuous Cantonese meal at the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ (expensive) Shang Palace restaurant. Truly a culinary experience with excellent service.Although you are near to Orchard Street and various shopping malls (Singapore prices are not that cheap!), the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ suburban location means a lot of (cheap) taxi rides. In the one and half days we spent in Singapore, we visited Chinatown (don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss the China Town Heritage Centre on Pagoda Street, which provides a poignant portrait of the territory migrant history, the Islamic Mosque (Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect much if you have visited Istanbul or the Middle East), and Little India. Not having visited India, we were enthralled by a visit to the Sri Mariamman Temple temple on South Bridge Road and the Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple on Serangoon Road in Little India, where we witnessed a remarriage ceremony, which involved the man and woman being doused by successive dunks of water, and numerous believers receiving √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√álessings√à√\u2020\u2022?from the numerous swamis.Expensive but good value for money given the quality and location of this hotel. The staff is excellent: every time we passed a staff member, we received a friendly smile and solicitation.We would have liked to stay longer and were sorry to leave. One negative: no free in-room internet. Given the cost, this is rather sad.
