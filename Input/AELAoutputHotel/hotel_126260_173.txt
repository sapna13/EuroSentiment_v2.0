{"text":"Delightful! I booked this hotel based on the strength of its Tripadvisor reviews, and was not disappointed. My husband and I arrived at the hotel at 8am after an overnight flight from the west coast. The front desk clerk found us an available room and allowed us to check in early, which we appreciated. We had booked a deluxe room, and we were assigned a deluxe room on the 23rd floor. The clerk apologized that she did not have a view room available that early, but promised to provide my in-laws (who were checking in later in the day) with a view room. As it turns out, our room had a nice city view, although it was on the opposite side of the building from St. Patrick's Cathedral.I was initially concerned that our deluxe room (the hotel's base-level room) would be worn and dated compared to the other, more luxurious levels of rooms and suites offered at the hotel. Not so. The room was spacious, elegant, and totally updated. It had many wonderful amenities, including a large flat screen television and a lovely marble bathroom with excellent water pressure. The king size bed was oh-so-comfy, perfectly outfitted with crisp white linens, fluffy pillows, and a down comforter (no yucky, scratchy bedspread here!) I think the picture of the deluxe room on the hotel's website must be an old picture, because the bedding and furnishings looked more like that pictured in the executive room.The room was spotless and the maid service was unobtrusive and friendly. We returned each evening to our room to find the curtains drawn, the lights dimmed, soft music playing, the bed turned down, and chocolates on the pillow. Gotta love turndown service! As other posters mentioned, the prices at the hotel bar and restaurant are breathtakingly expensive. To us, it was worth the extra cost to sit in the beautiful surroundings and sip an evening cocktail while watching the assortment of people coming and going through the lobby areas. There is great people watching at this hotel. The hotel is decorated beautifully for the holidays, and the friendly staff passed out complimentary hot chocolate, hot apple cider, and cookies one afternoon. We found this very welcoming after a chilly day of shopping and walking about the city. Our package included an American breakfast for two in the hotel restaurant, which otherwise carried a $30 per person price tag. The American breakfast consisted of cold scrambled eggs, decent toast, decent bacon or sausage, and truly awful hash browns. We ate it on two mornings, and went elsewhere the other two mornings we were there, even though it was basically free for us. It was not very good, and was most definitely NOT worth the money if you are paying out of pocket. All in all, we had a wonderful experience at the New York Palace and we would return in a New York Minute!
