{"text":"Fantastic Location, Outstanding Staff, Great Room My 14 year old son and I were in town to see The Who at the Nokia Theatre and stayed here from November 5-10th based on the positive reviews posted on this site - let me tell you we were NOT disappointed by our choice!! The location couldn't be better -a short 5 minute walk down Highland and you're at the Kodak Theatre, Chinese Theatre, Jimmy Kimmel's nighttime home, The Metro subway train, which we used to take us to the Nokia theatre on Sunday night , we were at the theatre within a half hour and only a $1.25 for each of us - Note: it takes two trains to get there. L.A. Tours is also just up from the corner and we booked our 5 1\/2 tour thru them which took us around Hollywood, out to Venice Beach\/Santa Monica and the Stars homes along Mulholland Drive\/Bel Air. Great little supermarket AND a Starbucks across the street from the hotel - always felt very safe. Van Morrison was doing a two nighter at the Hollywood Bowl which is practically next door to this hotel as well. They made arrangements for us to do a Paramount Studios Tour and due to an error on the part of the clerk, we didn't get to go but they accommodated my son and I by booking us the Warner Bros Tour instead and it was FABULOUS!! Also, arranged the cab, which cost us about $15 each way. The room was so comfy and cozy - we were on the 5th floor and didn't hear anything from other rooms - The breakfast was great and such a bonus that it's included with your stay. We filled up on that and started our day! Great outdoor pool and never had an issue with waiting to use the computer in the Business Centre. Yes, you have to take a different elevator if you're staying higher than the 5th floor but seriously folks, in the big picture that should'nt stop you from staying here!!If I'm ever back in L.A. which I will be as I'm a huge fan now of the Nokia Theatre for seeing big name acts in smaller venues - I will always stay there.Thanks again!!
