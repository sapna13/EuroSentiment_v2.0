{"text":"Wow! What a find! I've always liked staying in smaller hotels and although this property is not exactly small (212 rooms), it is modest in a city where the Marriott has over 2000 rooms.THe lobby is small and reminds me of so many mid-century apartment buildings on the east side. When you take the elevator to the second floor, you enter a whole new world. As you step off the elevator, you will be greeted by the concierge who will go out of her way to make your trip to NY flawless. Behind her desk, through a glass wall is a wonderful, cheerful public space consisting of a 24-hour coffee\/tea bar, a business center with computers and two lounge areas with comfy sofas and club chairs -- one room has a large TV, the other does not.In this area, breakfast is served (a nice selection including nova -- smoked salmon, pastries, cereal, etc) as well as a manager's reception every weekday (early evening) where complimentary wine, cheese and crackers is served and the guest socialize a bit.The room is very spacious. My room had a queen bed, armoire, desk and 2 night stands and there was plenty of room to move around. The tub\/shower was large (I'm 6'4 and I did not feel cramped) and there was a floor-to-ceiling mirror on the wall near the door to the room which made it easy to see myself from head to toe on the way in or out.There were three laundry options presented to me when I arrived: do-it-yourself laundry on the basement level; laundry service provided by the hotel staff or sending the laundry to a neighborhood laundering facility. I chose the first option since I need to wash some clothes for a dinner with friends that was happening 3 hours after my arrival. The room had an iron and ironing board.Great staff -- totally commited to making you happy!
