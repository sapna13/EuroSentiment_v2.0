{"text":"Fantastic hotel My husband and I just stayed here for 5 nights. I am a Diamond member with Hyatt so we got upgraded to a corner room (645 sq. feet) rather than a normal room (452 sq. feet). Our view from room 902 was fantastic since there were huge windows on each corner wall. We even saw Mt. Fuji from our room one morning. I used to live about 1\/2 mile from this Hyatt but never really saw Mt. Fuji since my apartment was on the 3rd floor and my office was on the 5th floor. So, seeing the skyline of Tokyo from the 9th floor was a real treat. As a Diamond member, we also got free access to the Grand Club (aka Regency Club in the U.S.) . It was great for breakfast (starting at 7 AM every day) with a very fresh assortment of breads, meats, cheeses, yogurts, cereals and fruits. In the evening from 5:30 - 7:30 they serve alcohol, appetizers and desserts and my husband and I made that our dinner every night. The 4 women working in the Grand Club were very good -- standing and greeting us when we came and left and always making sure our beverages were full and quickly clearing away empty plates.The service was impeccable and the room was simply outstanding. We were using free nights so that made it even better. We also got free internet. I think that is for all hotel guests and I don't think that had anything to do with me being a Diamond member.As a Gold Passport member (not even Diamond level, just being a member), you can have free coffee or tea delivered to your room every morning. There is also an electric kettle and instant coffee and tea bags in the room and a refrigerator, too, that you can ask them to empty of the overpriced beverages.I looked at the gym and swimming pool area (the pool area is free for Diamond members but other hotel guests have to pay for it -- the gym is free for all) but never used it. Gym clothing can be rented.The hotel is very close to Roppongi Station to catch Hibiya and Oedo subway lines. The Limo Bus stops right at the hotel from Narita Airport for 3000 yen per person each way which is definitely the way to go to and from Narita when staying at the Grand Hyatt Tokyo.I've stayed at Hyatts all over the world and as far as a non-resort Hyatt goes, this has been one of the best. FANTASTIC!!
