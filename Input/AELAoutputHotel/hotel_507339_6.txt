{"text":"great october weather This was our second visit to Venice Beach and this hotel. We enjoy being right on the beach and not having it cost a fortune. October is a great month to viist, good weather and less crowds, during the week especially.The roof top deck is a wonderful spot to view the sunset and the ocean. The patio out front is spacious and clean,,enclosed by a glass wall that helps keep the wind out, if it is slightly breezy. There are several teak tables with umbrellas and chairs While the area is sometimes active with people, the feel is still one of relaxation,The room was clean and bright. Great shower and fresh linens.You can walk a block to several restaurants and a starbucks or local coffee house, ice cream too!. The pier is also right there to walk out on and watch the surfers, or look for seals or dolphins or to see if any of the folks fishing have caught anything.We rented bikes around the corner only $6 hr and we pedaled down the bike trail past santa monica to pacific pallisades beach. The day before we took a long walk to the santa monica pier, whoch was about an hour walk on the pedestrain walking trail that goes along the ocean. We had ride back to the hotel with a friend. We sat on the beach one afternoon and just enjoyed the sand and sun.It was very nice to fall asleep at night with the sound of the waves coming thru the shuttered windows of our room.This is kind of a no frills hotel but has many amenties such as coffee, tea , juice, pastries, wireless access, microwave and fridge, hair dryer, flat screen tv with many channels, and very friendly manager and staff as well as the patio and roof top deck.We love the ocean front rooms. There is also a suite that has kitchenette and living room.We will stay here again. We were saying that it would be a great place to be in the winter during rainy weather too, watching the big waves and enjoying the sound of the rain.
