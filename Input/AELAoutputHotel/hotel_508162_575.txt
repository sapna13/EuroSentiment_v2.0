{"text":"Lovely spot - family friendly We just returned from a 7-day holiday at Dreams Punta Cana. We went for the week of Jan 20th with our three year old child. I used this site a lot to research our trip, and overall the reviews listed here are pretty accurate. The weather was beautiful and it is a lovely, more remote spot. Lots of young families, extended families and couples.Pros:- Weather- The service was good - very friendly- The pool was great - they also had a wading pool which we used.- The beach - great sand, surf and a breeze that takes the edge off the hot sun. If you go in the water, be careful of rocks. We saw some people with bandaged feet. In the water, it can be hard to see the bottom and if you land too hard on a rock, you can cut your feet.- The kid's club - although our daughter, at 3 1\/2 was a little young for it. It runs from 9:00 am to 10:00 pm - they will take your kids to the World Cafe for meals. We put her in for the mornings. If your kid can't swim, make sure you bring a life jacket\/floaties with you.- World cafe - food generally good, fresh and they have a solid kid's buffet (you will notice lots of adults picking from the kid's buffet!)- We were satisfied with our room, although I had requested a king size, we got two doubles which worked out fine. Walls are thin, so you can hear your neighbors - annoying for the light sleeper.- Nightly entertainment was amusing -Everything was pretty accessible - we did not bother to bring a stroller- The landscaping - beautiful. Flamingos, parrots, roosters, turtles and koi!Cons:- We flew skysservice - our flight time was changed to an earlier time and if we hadn't double-checked we would have missed our flight out.- Pirates ship and Kid's club pool closed due to construction. they opened the pool on the day we left.- The road to the resort is indeed bad, as stated in other reviews. It was fine going out, but I felt pretty nauseous on the way back.- Mild construction - lots of tiling going on- our a la carte dining experiences were poor - italian (food was mediocre - world cafe is better), mexican (stale nachos, burnt quesadilla) and seafood grill (terrible, slow service)- confusion at the punta cana airport on departure (they list the check-in time instead of departure time on the signs)- We all got some diarrhea - our daughter had the hardest time.- The whole towel thing. At least at the end of the day most of the chairs are clear but it starts up again early the next morning.My only regret - I didn't try the spa. Overall, we had a good time and came back feeling refreshed and relaxed.
