{"text":"Not value for money. We stayed at The Raffles hotel for four nights on our way back from Sydney. On the way out to Australia we stayed at The Oriental in Bangkok, the two hotels did not bear comparison. The service at The Oriental was second to none!Raffles is a good hotel but is also a huge tourist attraction in Singapore and it is this that diminshes the service and ambience for hotel guests.We arrived at midnight having phoned from the airport to inform them that we were on our way. The taxi driver who had just told us that this it is 'the best hotel in Singapore' was embarrassed to have to hoot his car horn several times before anyone materialised to help us.We were shown to our room and told about the 'magic button' that, when pressed, would alert our butler in minutes. The magic had clearly worn off because pressing the button might mean a phone call after about 15 to 20 minutes. We took to calling room service direct. Service at breakast on the first morning was appalling but feedback to staff was worthwhile as they did try to improve,There is wooden flooring throughout the building. This looks great but we were in a ground floor room which meant that we could hear the guests above moving about their room at all hours.The pool bar can cope with simple requests such as a beer or a coke but all food and drinks from their 'speciality. menu come from the main kitchen which takes at least 20 minutes. Don't expect all diners to receive their meals at the same time either! When we ate lunch there the food arrived at different times so that some of us had finished our meal before the others had even got theirs.The pool itself is situated immediately above the main kitchens which means that whilst relaxing in the sun or swimming guests are subjected to the smells of whatever is cooking - we could smell onions, curry, fish etc. Not very pleasant! The hotel needs to decide if it is hotel or a theme park and act accordingly. A stay there is very expensive and not value for money. We will not return.
