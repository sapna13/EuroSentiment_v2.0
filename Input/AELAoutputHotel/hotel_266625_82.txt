{"text":"Can't say enough good about this place! My boyfriend and I went to the sirenis for a week, we just returned a week ago. It was his first all-inclusive vacation while I had been to many different all-inclusive trips. This establishment was by far the nicest I had been to. I was very impressed with the folks that worked there. The bartenders are the most polite and friendly bunch ever! Whether at the bar in the lobby or the pool bars, the service cannot be topped. You actually have to sneak away from the bar if you do not want your glass to be filled back up. A small $1-$2 tip will go a very long way! I was also impressed with the fact that they served the drinks in real glassware, not plastic. It made it feel just that much more special. No matter the time of day every worker we came across had a smile and always spoke to you. HolaWe only went on one excursion while we were there, the Saona Island tour. It was great. Dancing and drinking on the boat out and once there on the island they cook a huge lunch for you and again with the open bar. After leaving the island, they race you back by speed boat to a nice shallow area where you get out and play with the star fish that are peppered throughout the ocean floor. And of course...open bar. There is entertainment every night, although we were in the sun all day and didn't make it most of it. The sun will wipe you out. I can't wait to go back to this very place! We met soo many wonderful people while in the pool that I know we will be life-long friends with. They do have shopping at each end of the resort where the natives have little shops set up. It's all bartering. You can get on the internet in the lobby area by going to the front desk and purchasing a card with a special code on it. It was $6 for 30 mins. There are many different restaurants you can make reservations at as part of your all-inclusive meals. We ate at Jade which is Japenese. It was very good. Watch out for the Mamajuana juice. It is said that the locals use it as medicine and as a aphrodisiek (?). The stuff is wicked! They can give you some at the bar to try, you 'll either love it or hate it. The beach restaurant is the best for lunch. They grill chicken, burgers, porkchops, and french fries. They also have another bar right next to it where you can serve yourself pop or get drinks from the bartenders. The regular buffet is pretty good, for breakfast you can get eggs and omelets made to order and for dinner you can get pasta made to order. It is different every day. There are two sides to this place, one is regular rooms and one is suites. The people in the suites usually have on blue bands and the regular rooms wear gold bands. You can all eat drink and lay out and swim anywhere. The grounds are simply beautiful! Very well kept. The water was beautiful, a bit rough for kayaking, but we did see people try...unsucessfully. I hope to go back next year!
