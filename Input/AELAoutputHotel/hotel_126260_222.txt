{"text":"Great hotel, but try to find packages Stayed at the Palace over Easter weekend, this is my second stay at this property and will defintely no be my last. Booked through the hotel's website and goot a good deal (stay 3 nights and 4th is free). Even though I find no fault with the hotel per se I do think that the regular room rates are not justified. If you can't find any type of promotion you'd be better off staying at the Pierre or Four Seasons for a similar rate. Still, this is a good hotel: location is excelent (try to get a Cathedral view room), rooms are huge by NY standards and with very comfortable beds and furniture (although a little dated), public spaces are wonderful, staff is professional and very helpful, but not on par with the rates they charge. Gilt is a wonderful restaurant, one of the better meals I've had in NY in the last few years, and the Gilt bar is hip and trendy in a very exclusive way (similar to the Campbell Apartment but no throngs of crowds here, very sedate and civilized). The hotel's casual restaurant is very small and can get very crowded for breakfast (don't order room service, same hidden charges and surcharges added an extra $40 to the exact same order we had in the restaurant the day before). The hotel caters to well heelled families mostly Spanish, British and Mexican, touring and shopping due to its proximity to landmarks and Madison Ave. and Fifth Ave. stores, but has every amenity you should need in a business trip. All in all, try to pay under $400 a weekend night and you've found yourself a great deal on this place!
