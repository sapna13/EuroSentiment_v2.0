{"text":"good hotel and good experience, however nothing extraordinary I stayed there for a 1day stopover in February and got a quite a good rate through one of the internet brokers. I mainly chose the hotel because of it's location and th reviews here on tripadvisor.We arrived quite early after a long flight from Europe and where lucky enough to get an early check-in which was much appreciated. The reception staff was efficient and friendly but somehow lacked a warm touch.The room was on the 5th floor and was rather small and dark, however it was clean and nicely furnished. The view from the window was terrible tough, just looking at a wall and one could here the loud air-conditoning units from the building next door. Somehow the windows in our room had a gap as it was quite noisy.The bathroom was clean and new but the drainage of the sink was not working properly. One of the best features of this hotel is the close proximity to Orchard road (Takashimaya, Paragon etc. all in walking distance)and the free wireless internet as well as the complimentary mini bar.Check out was quick and efficient with no complications.All in all for the price I paid it was a good experience as I was only there for 1 night. If I would stay longer, I would most likely choose another hotel and if I would have to pay more than 250 USD I would definitely choose a much better hotel.It was good value for money tough!!
