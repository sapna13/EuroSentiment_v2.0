{"text":"The best trip ever!!! Go Diamond Club My boyfriend and I went to the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana from April 30th till May 14th 2007, we are in are late 20's early 30's. We booked the Diamond Club and we were in villa 31 on the 3rd floor. Everything was amazing, the french restuarant is by far the best, we went 3 times. Japanese and the garden grill restaurant are also very good. Service at the fish restaurant is amazing, sooo great and the food was decent. The Italian was good for the diamond club lunch but the dinner was not great, don't eat the chicken at this restaurant. Mexican was also not great, I would not recommend it. I left a shirt at the diamond club pool and it was taken so they gave us 2 extra a la carte dinners and 2 free shirts, they were very good about it. The room was very clean and well stocked. The night life is sooo great, we were never bored in 2 weeks. I highly recommend the Marinarium sunset cruise, it is well worth every penny. The Saona trip was good, but the bus trip to the boat is too long 2.5 hrs each way, although they told us 1 hr. I have been to 4 different resorts and this is by far the best resort I have visited. The lounge is great on the diamond side, a highlight was the guy playing the piano and singing from 7-10pm Monday to Friday. Go to this resort, it is soooo good. If you are looking for American food etc then stay home but this is the first time I have been able to eat while away and I gained weight for once instead of losing weight. Thanks for a great trip, we will be back!!!!
