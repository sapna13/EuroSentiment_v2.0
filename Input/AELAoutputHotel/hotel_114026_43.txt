{"text":"Nice place, but not as good as advertised. The Waikiki Parc Hotel is a nice place to stay. The lobby was excellent, the staff was friendly, and the location is great (easy walking to shops\/restaurants\/beach). Two bottles of complementary water was also nice. However, I would have expected better since it was rated as a 4-star hotel. I stayed at other 4-star hotels and they are MUCH better than this. I would consider Waikiki Parc to be a 3-star hotel. A few reasons why I say this:1) The room is a decent size, but smaller than what I expected. There was room for a queen bed, desk, TV, dresser, and fridge (and of course some walking room). I was expecting a small sitting area as well (based on other descriptions).The furnishings in the room and bathroom was excellent -- very modern furniture (they even had LED lamps at the end tables). However, if you look past the furnishings, the room looked somewhat old with a bit of quick renovations.2) I decided to pay for self-parking instead of the valet service. Cost is the same $20\/day, but I saved a few bucks from tips for the driver... Be aware of this though -- there are limited parking spaces for self-parking and the lot is used for public parking as well. What this means is that during busy periods, the lot may be filled with public parking and you may drive back to the hotel and there will be no spots for your car. I suspect this is happens mostly on weekends. For $20\/day, I would expect some guarantee for available parking spots.3) If you want to use the business center for internet access, you'll need to pay $3 for 15 minutes. Internet access is not complementary. (You'll also need to pay for internet access in your room.) This applies even for printing boarding passes -- however, if you ask the front desk nicely, they may provide the access code for free. The business center has both a PC and Mac so it is handy for both types of people!All in all, I enjoyed my stay at the Waikiki Parc, but I had expected better. Next time, I think I'll look elsewhere. I think I can get a better place for the same price.
