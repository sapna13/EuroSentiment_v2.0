{"text":"Good for families Just came back from a 5 night 6 day stay at the Riu Bambu. Overall a good vacation. We travel to DR at least twice a year and stay at all different resorts. This time we traveled with our 5 and 8 year old children, and they had a blast. Let me start with the good: Great food, plenty of things to eat for everyone with a great variety. When traveling to DR always bring stomach medicine, everyone's body reacts differently to the food, there are times when I have gotten sick and times when I haven't, it just depends. Great kids programs, they had activies for the kids every morning at 10:30 am, and then again at 3:30. They also had a mini disco for the kids at 8:00 where they go on stage and dance and play a game. Overall a very clean resort. People very friendly. Kids also stay free at this resort. Beach is amazing, water is beautiful.Bad: The rooms are very small and the beds VERY hard. We ended up upgrading to a suite for $50US a night and it was worth it, much more spacious with a living room area and a huge bathroom. They have 2 pools directly next to each other. They main pool has a bar, but I found that the pools aren't really for kids that can't swim. The shallow end is about 5 1\/2 feet, so if your kids do not swim - bring floaters. They do have a children's pool but it's away from everything.We walked to the other resorts directly next to the Bambu. The Riu Punta Cana Palace is beautiful! One of the nicest resorts I have seen in the DR, you have to have a bracelet to enter but we definately want to go back and stay there. Nothing really spectacular about the others. If your staying with children, Riu Bambu is probably the best for families. One thing to note is if your thinking of traveling to DR and have never been is to realize that you will be relaxing and not much else unless you select to do some of the excursions which i highly recommend if you think you will get bored at the resort.
