{"text":"Fabulous Location We chose this hotel because it is not the typical chain hotel like Four Seasons etc. Sometimes with these once you have been to one you know what to expect.The lobby is very none descript and not at all like the picures on the internet - the entrance off Maddison Ave is the grand elaborate one - we arrived on the 5th Jan and all the christmas decorations were still there - very pretty.Check in was very efficient if a little expensive - tips for taxi driver, door man, man who took luggage to reception, then man who took us up to our room, then man who brought our luggage up to our room all within the space of 20 minutes of arriving when you are still getting used to the new notes and havent always got small amounts at hand.Our room was large, immaculatly clean and overlooked St Patricks cathedral - the view at night was stunning. The bed was huge and after hours of shopping and sightseeing we fell into what felt like a giant white marshmellow - it was so comfortable.We stayed 5 nights room only so didnt really use the hotel for much other than sleeping in. We did have a drink in the lobby bar - the service was shocking but then another night we had one in the new restaurant bar and that was very nice - decor was fantastic.We did use the concierge who were all very helpfull and managed to get us booked into all the very best restaurants - use the Zagat guide book if you like good food - quite a lot of the best ones are within walking distance of the hotel the best being Le Bernadin - truly sublime (no problems walking round at night) iIn the rooms there is a concierge guide which is very helpful and does give some fantastic recommendations for all sorts of things- its nothing to do with the hotel- its a list of recommendations from a variety of 5 star hotels in the city and was very informative.We did enquire about a show with the concierge who said they have to use an agency and quoted $1200 for two of us - yes one thousand two hundred dollars to see Jersey Boys - we declined.All in all we really enjoyed our stay here the hotel is a fantastic location, Saks is just over the road on Fifth Ave, Central Park is a ten minute walk away and the rooms have a stunning view at night are big, comfortable and spotless. Cannot ask for much more !!
