{"text":"Refurbished rooms are outstanding!!!! I recently stayed at this hotel through priceline for a very reasonable $110 and came away very impressed. If you read through the past reviews, the consensus is that the hotel, while in a great location near the Museums and Vondelpark, left a little to be desired. Recently the hotel went through some rather major renovations and this probably contributed greatly to the bargain price. Anyway, I cannot say enough about the quality of the newly renovated room I stayed in. You can get a good idea of the value management placed on imparting a luxurious impression to the visitor by the quality of the improvements. Lets start with a 42 inch high definition flat screen television. How is that for luxury. In the bathroom we have black granite countertops, Grohe faucets, Villeroy and Bosch sink, and real porcelain tub. Then we move on to what looks to be solid cherry wood accents throughout. In the bedroom we have a nice Marriott take on Sheratons Heavenly bed. Very cushy, plenty of pillows, etc.... The desktop is solid black granite, with a nice high end leather or leather look chair. The rug was a beautiful red pattern somewhat akin to a Belgian rug. You get the picture. This is serious luxury we are talking here. The room itself, and the outside matching renovated hallway look 5 star all the way. The other parts of the hotel. Well, they were not bad. The outside of the hotel is not renovated and appears seriously dated.Inside the lobby, the renovations are not as obvious. Although the area does look new, it does not stand out. The location of the hotel is quite ideal. Walking out the door straight ahead about two blocks you head straight into the center of one of the cities hottest Restaurant sections (Leidesplein). and a Tram stop for convenient transport to the Central Station area. You can of course walk to Central station from the Marriott, but it is quite a nice hike. I would say 40 minutes or so. Also a short walk accross the street are a number of Canal tours. To the right one block or so is one of the cities largest parks (Vondelpark), another block or so down is the Rijksmuseum where you can see many of Rembrandts finest works. The Van Gogh museum is also in this area.  I tried the Quo restaurant for the breakfast buffet at $25 Euros and was underwhelmed at the quality of the offerings at that price. A few days later, for comparison, I tried the breakfast buffet at the American Hotel and formed a similar impression. This time it was only $21 Euros. Anyway, you get the picture. If you can get this hotel at the price I paid via Priceline you will likely get yourself a luxurious room at a great location for sightseeing.
