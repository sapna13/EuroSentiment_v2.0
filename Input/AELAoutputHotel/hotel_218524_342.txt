{"text":"Excellence by name, Excellence by nature Just back after 14 nights at the Excellence. Yes, the roads are hazardous being riddled with potholes, but I looked upon it as 'different' and fun transferring from the airport. There is clear evidence that work is underway in building new highways, but until they are complete, don't even consider car hire!Only one issue with the hotel - after travelling half way across the world - door to door in 15 hours - we were told that our room wasnt ready !! Initial disappointment was soon overcome as we waited for an hour at the Martini bar and had a few refreshing beers served by a smiling replica of Ronaldinho.This really is a spledid complex, ideal for adults. Our room was of a very high standard - 4 poster, jacuzzi and a well stocked fridge replenished every day.I don't believe you get any advantage by paying for an ocean view room as the grounds are so well kept and colourful you cant help but get a great view each morning as you draw the curtains.We really enjoyed the selection of meals which included the opportunity to dine at a variety of global a la carte locations all with air conditioning. The French, Mexican, Italian and 'Spice' being our favourites.All staff were extremely friendly at all times and most of them, I believe, really deserved the odd dollar or two for their pleasant and sincere approach to guests welfare.Whether you prefer the beach or pool both offer a clean and tidy environment - the ocean can be a bit powerful but good fun crashing through the breakers or trying to stay on a boogie-board.I have noticed a number of reviews referring to the mossies - I can tell you that they are there in numbers, There was no evidence of them for the first 3 to 4 days but they must have come to life all of a sudden and went to town ! They don't normally like me, but for one night they had a good feast on a night we deceided to eat in the open.Evening entertainment is lively and wide ranging, not always my cup of tea but judging by the whooping and hollering of the audience (90 - 95% USA \/ Canada) went down a treat.You can also pay a visit to the casino and try your hand or sit at the bar and watch others lose.During the daytime, and only if you wish, you can take part in a wide range of activities. Every day Eeez showtime including [--] VolleyballWe tracked the weather forecast a good 10 days before we left and were dismayed to see everyday showing a minimum of rain with frequent thunderstorms. Even when we got there the rolling 3 day forecast posted daily at the concierge desk showed exactly the same pattern. The reality was one heavy downpour on one afternoon surrounded by daily, continuous sunshine.All in all, a truly memorable and brilliant holiday. If we didn't have a policy of looking for somewhere new each holiday we would beback like a shot - however if we did, I think I'd ring them the day before to get our room ready.They do, however, have a branch in Cancun, Mexico, so that will definitely be on our shortlist for 09.hope this is helpful ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1992,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1989},{"endOffset":1992,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1989},{"endOffset":1992,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1989}]}
