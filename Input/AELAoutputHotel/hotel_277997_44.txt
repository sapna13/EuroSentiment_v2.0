{"text":"Very Nice All-Suite Resort This resort was a welcome surprise. It was beautiful 20 years ago when I was in college, so I was a bit concerned that it could be very worn down. To my surprise, it was in great shape. It was very obvious that the rooms had been refurbished. My wife LOVED it and wanted to stay a couple extra nights. The check-in went very smoothly even though they had a temporary front desk set-up because the lobby is getting refurbished.The pool was great! There was a water slide for the kids. It was closed when we were there, because it was cold out, but they had a sign in front of the slide saying that you can ask the bartender to turn it on if you want to use it. I thought that was pretty cool.You can drive and park in front of your room. If you get there in the day-time there is plenty of room-front parking, so you will not need the bellman to help you. If you arrive at night, GET THE BELLMAN'S HELP! This is because the parking is very crowed at night and you probably need to park away from your room and walk. I was there on a weekend and at night parking was VERY crowded. I guess you can take a drive to the room to see if you can find a good spot and return for help if it does not pan-out...??There is no short-term parking, so either there is a spot or there isn't. The streets are VERY narrow, so if you try to double park and unload, you will block the entire street.I will be going back for sure! ","annotations":[]}
