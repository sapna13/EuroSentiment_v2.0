{"text":"Clean but noisey We stayed in the auto hogar in mid Sept. From reading the numerous bad reviews on this website about air con not working and noise (Rather stupidly after booking the hotel), we asked at check-in for a 'quiet and air conditioned room'. We were directed through the car park to a room on the 5th floor. The room was rather small and its only view was three walls, i.e we ere in the centre of the hotel. Thankfully the air conditioning, shower etc did work. The room did have a safe however we were unable to open it. Despite asking specifically for a quiet room we found our room quite noisey, not from the traffic outside but from the traffic passing by our room. Our room was right beside the elevator and the walls were like cardboard. Everything could be heard. Also at the time it appeared that building work was ongoing which added to the noise level. On a good note though, the location is brilliant and the buffet breakfast was fantastic with plenty of choice. The rooms and towels were cleaned\/changed daily (Although we had left the 'do not disturb' sign, on the door each day they still came in, so i wouldnt advise leaving valuables\/money lying around, not that we had any problems)All in all I guess you get what you pay for. I wouldnt recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet, relaxing holiday. Its more suitable for younger people who will be out all day sightseeing and out on the town until late every night. (Although thats what we were doing most of the time and we still found the noise annoying the odd time were were there) I wouldnt return to this hotel again, id rather pay a little extra for a nicer hotel or do my research a bit better!!!
