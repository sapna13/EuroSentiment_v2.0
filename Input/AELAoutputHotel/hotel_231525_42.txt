{"text":"On a city break ? Stay here. So you're planning a city break to Barcelona ? Never been before? You're reading all of the reviews but can't decide where to stay ? When you don't know the city at all, it's so confusing having to weigh up the various permutations and options. After all, you want to enjoy the trip, not be let down by a bad choice of hotel, right ? I had the same difficulties, but am very glad that I opted for the Raco del Pi.If you want roof-top pools, plush facilities or funky interiors to relax in whilst visiting a great city, this hotel is not for you. However, if you want a clean, comfortable and friendly base for exploring the delights of the city on a long weekend, with little time to waste, Raco del Pi will suit you perfectly.Previous reviewers have not lied. The location is absolutely PERFECT (in the heart of the gothic quarter). The discreet entrance is on a pedestrian only street (though taxis can pick-up \/ drop off at the door). The Cathedral is only a moment√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ stroll away. In the opposite direction Las Ramblas is no further. Shops and cafes abound. Similarly, the waterfront area, museums and main central tourist sties can all be easily reached on foot from the front door. This truly is a central location.We booked a standard double room just one week before our 3 night trip. The only request I made was for it to be non-smoking. We were greeted by a friendly √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥ola√à√\u2020\u2022? a glass of Cava and a front facing room of ample size on the first floor, with a balcony view of the street below. The bathroom (with customary toiletries) was large enough for a bidet. Both rooms were spotlessly clean and a room safe allowed us to store valuables. The beds are firm but very comfortable and the air conditioning can be easily controlled by a wall thermostat.The rate was for a room only, but we welcomed not being √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢ied in√à√\u2020\u2022?to breakfast in the hotel (though it was extensive and a 50% discount was offered for the first morning). English newspapers lay on a table for guests to read. If you prefer, there is a very pleasant coffee shop 10yds up the street serving a wide selection of pastries or a pretty church square 50yds the other way with two cafes. We were happy to mix it up.All of the staff are very friendly and helpful. Complimentary tea, coffee and pastries are available every afternoon and the free Internet is also available for guest use. If you have a late departure, the hotel will gladly store your cases after check-out so you can enjoy the last few hours in the city.We both enjoy staying in more opulent hotels, but on a city break with so much to offer, the amount of time spent in them doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ justify their cost. Not once did we regret booking this hotel.You can waste your time looking at more options if you want to, but at the Raco del Pi you won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be wasting any time in Barcelona√à√\u2020\u2022?
