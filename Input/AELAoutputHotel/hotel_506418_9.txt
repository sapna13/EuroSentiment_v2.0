{"text":"A Perfect Stay We have stayed at other JDV hotels which is one reason I picked Hotel Vitale. We completed the last days of our Honeymoon in San Francisco and decided to try Vitale due to their location and their excellent reviews on trip advisor. We were not disappointed in any way. Megan was great in making our reservations and noting it was our Honeymoon. First off, our room was upgraded to waterfront view. Since it was not ready on arrival, Daniel offered us drinks in Americano's bar. We had two drinks each which the hotel picked up. We were then shown to our room which had an amazing view of the East Bay bridge. Off we went for dinner and upon our return, Champagne and chocolates were left at our bedside. Romantic is the only word I can think of due to the soft music and low lights left on for us. It was a little noisy due to the bar downstairs, but we just kept the soft music on until the bar closed. The noise was not something you could really hear unless you focused on it. We slept VERY soundly during our stay there, yes the beds are perfect too.There was a running race I decided to run Sunday morning and again, they help to direct me to the place to sign up and gave me some bandaids prior to my run. Little things that convey their committment to customer service. We didn't try Americano only because we have our favorite places to eat in SF. We loved our stay at this hotel that modestly claims to be a three star hotel. It was a perfect stay and we plan on staying here many more times.
