{"text":"Perfect stay on Honeymoon Although not even close to the most expensive, The Hotel Torre Catalunya was by far the best hotel we stayed in during our 15 day honeymoon in Spain. From exceptional restaurant recommendations to public transit tips, the level of service from all staff members was exceptional. Additionally, most, if not all, are multi-lingual; patient with those wishing to use Spanish, no matter how imperfect, but able to speak in visitor's native tongue. The facilities are modern in design, larger in size and scope than many European hotels and well maintained. The rooms offer sweeping views of the city, the hills and the ocean. We stayed in an executive room and it was large even by US standards. Comfortable beds, separate bath and shower, plasma tv, cd player and in room coffee and tea service. The hardwood floors are clean and sleek. All the amenities that we took advantage of were to our liking: the spa (with turkish bath, hydrotherapy and sauna) for 6 Euro is relaxing, if not quite as glamorous as it looked in the brochure. The lounge, for drinks or meals, is excellent. Try the Menu Del Dia for 12 euro and enjoy 3 courses and a glass of wine. We did not use the adjoined rooftop pool as it was overcast, but it's available. Visual Lounge is excellent for a drink in the evening. Location cannot be beat : A few steps from the Metro and a stones throw from the train station. Very safe area.
