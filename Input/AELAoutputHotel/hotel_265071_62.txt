{"text":"Great City Hotel Just returned from a tour of Italy and stayed 1 night at the Delle Nazione in Florence, I was apprehensive before arriving as with most cities its a minefield trying to find a decent hotel without paying the earth, I wanted something fairly nice as we were in Florence just for 1 night for my husbands 40th Birthday. I did email the hotel beforehand to request a nice room and I was plesantly suprised by the hotel, it was contemporary, clean, great location directly opposite the train and main bus station and great location for walking to all the main sights. The staff were all really nice and hospitable and recommended us to a great local restaurant for a fantastic meal in the evening. We were lucky to get a suite with a balcony which was a huge room, the bathroom was a little dated but overall a nice room. My only gripe would be that the air con didnt work so I opened the window and boy was it noisy from about 5am but hey your in a city!!! The hotel has several computers with free internet usage which is a great service. We were driving so needed a hotel with a garage or parking, this has an underground garage next door to the hotel which is owned independantly but I didnt think that 17euros was bad for 24hours parking in a city. Breakfast was plentiful with fruit, cereals, croissants, toast, ham, jams, ect. Overall a lovely city hotel and I wouldnt hesitate to reccommend or stay there again myself.
