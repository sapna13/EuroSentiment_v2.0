{"text":"Expensive Decision There is no doubt the Westin Palace in Madrid is centrally located and very nice looking. Our first problem, though, was that the price they assigned to our room at check- in was 50 Euros higher than how we had reserved the room over their website. The only record we had of the reservation (trying to convince them that they had accidentally uped the price) was the confirmation email they had sent us . . . bearing all info on the reservation but leaving the price mysteriously unstated. We had not noticed this ommission when we made the reservation, so we had no proof of what we clearly knew was an inflated room charge. Nevertheless, we decided we were too tired to look elsewhere and would just pay the extra. I noticed as we were going to bed that there was no bottled water in the room, and so I called room service and asked if they could bring up a bottle. They promptly arrived, bearing a regular size glass bottle of water (and a wine glass) and presented the charge of 11.50 Euros for the bottle of water (i.e., about $17 or $18 in American dollars). Silly me, I thought that, for what we were paying per night, it might have been sent up without charge. I signed and tipped the porter, but then went down to street level to see if there was another more reasonable source nearby. Practically next door to the hotel was a grocery market with bottled water, same size, for 1.2 Euros each . . . and they were even chilled. I bought two bottles, brought them to my room, called room service and told them I woiuldn't be needing their $18 bottle of water after all. After that, we felt the hotel was little more than a beautiful tourist trap looking to drain every dollar from its guests before they left. Never again will I set foot in the Westin Palace Hotel \/ Madrid.
