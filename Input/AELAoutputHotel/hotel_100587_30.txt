{"text":"Truly unique character and a great location at a reasonable price Hotel Max was an excellent choice for our recent three night stay in Seattle because of its central location and affordable rates. The modern\/contemporary and artistic design was a draw for us, setting it apart from the traditional hotels in the immediate area. We wanted a reasonably priced hotel with character and class as an alternative to the simplicity and lack of style generally found in some budget hotels. Location was great. It was a quick walk from the hotel to Pike Place Market and only two blocks from the mall and shopping on 4th and 5th avenues. Our only criticism, which I was aware of from reading other reviews before our trip, is that the rooms and bathrooms were very small. They are unique and interesting but probably not a good choice for someone who is accustom to the design and layout of a conventional luxury hotel. Overall, for us, a couple in our early 30s who wanted a nice, unique hotel but didn't want to spend $300\/night Hotel Max was a good choice.As a side note: We had two excellent meals while in Seattle. One was at the Icon Grill on 5th Ave where they have 1\/2 price bottles of Washington wine on Wednesday nights. The meal was delicious, wine was excellent and the service was fantastic (ask for Lindsey B.). The restaurant's tables were entirely booked with reservations but we easily got a seat in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°irst come, first serve√à√\u2020\u2022?lounge area. Our second great meal was a sit down breakfast at Bacco on Pine Street, just a block up from Pike Place Market. The have great Belgian waffles and omelets with a nice outdoor seating area for people watching if the weather is nice.
