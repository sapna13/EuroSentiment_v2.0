{"text":"Excellent Choice Like all the other reviews, we found the Hotel David to be excellent. The Hotel is a 20 minute walk, along the river, from the Centre but we found this to be no problem. If you don't fancy the walk, several different buses can be caught from almost directly outside the Hotel. On arrival, we were greeted warmly, with our cases being carried into reception. Our bedroom was spacious, quiet, spotlessly clean and very comfortable. The Hotel offers complimentary drinks and nibbles in the early evening which was the perfect way to start our nights out, before wandering to the Centre to enjoy the wide choice of restaurants and bars available. We particularly liked the excellent-value little Trattoria Cibreo on 122r Via de Macci. Very enjoyable with a most helpful waiter, willing to translate the menu into English. There are a couple of restaurants local to the Hotel but its well worth going to the Centre in the evening, as the choice is much better. Also nice to see the Duomo and the other amazing landmarks after dark, and without the day-trippers. As two women travelling alone, we felt quite safe walking around the city at night. Common sense with carrying bags etc., must prevail at all times. For a local drink, we would also recommend bir Bacco on Lungarno Ferrucci, just around the corner from the Hotel David. Very pleasant atmosphere with charming bar Staff. Good experience.Anyone looking for accommodation in Florence, with beautiful surroundings, very caring, friendly Staff, good choice of breakfast and every whim catered for, could do no better than the Hotel David.
