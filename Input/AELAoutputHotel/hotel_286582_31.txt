{"text":"This Will Take the Shine Off Florence I have been lucky enough to visit Florenece many many times. I have stayed in some beautiful hotels there. This time, and at the last moment, the best I could arrange was the Athenaeum Hotel. End of May was Pitti week, a big exhibition week so choices were very limited and I needed a hotel for 5 nights. Sorry to say it was a very bad experience. From arrival, and no help with my luggage, to the very small box like bedrooms, I looked a 3 and there was little to choose between them, all poky and dark. No gratis drinking water in the room [only mini bar!], no iron or tea  coffe maker, very small storage and equally small TV, and the decoration is very IKEA. The main photos of the hotel show this beautiful antrium but you will not see that from your room.Breakfast is in the basement, and the one day you could look forward to spending the time enjoying a cooked breakfast, Sunday morning, they give the chief the time off, so you'll only get cold! Don't try and eat luch here, on Saturday the restuarant doesn't open and on the Sunday they would not serve me because they had rented it out for a party!This hotel is a long walk from anywhere you can get a decent meal. No ATM nearby either.The staff stay firmly behind their front desk and are aloof and as unhelpful as the worst kind of 2 star hotel. definitley avoid like the plague! Only to be used by the cheapest type of 'package holiday.
