{"text":"Fantastic Place, Fantastic Location, Fantastic Staff We stayed at the Affinia Dumont from 15th to 18th May in Room 3103. After requesting a view of the Chrysler Building from a high floor, we were not to be disappointed and had spectacular views of the building. We could also see the Hudson River which was a bonus. If it hadn't been for previous reviews on Trip Advisor we wouldn't have requested this room and would have missed out on a treat. We were also left a complimentary bottle of wine which I presume was down to us celebrating Birthdays \/ Wedding Anniversary while we were there.From a location point of view, it couldn't have been better. 10 mins walk and you could be at Grand Central Station in one direction or virtually Times Square in another. The Empire State Building was only a 5 minute walk along 34th Street. We didn't go up the Empire State and elected to go for the Top of the Rock - this was only a 10-15 minute walk away and didn't have the horrendous lines the EPS had - it also gave a fantastic view of the empire state itself and great views of Central Park.Everything within the Hotel was great and the front desk staff were genuinely friendly and made you feel wanted from the moment you stepped foot in the place (larger chains should take note)This was our first stay in NYC and we loved the place. We do want to return next year and on the basis of this visit would only consider booking the Dumont.
