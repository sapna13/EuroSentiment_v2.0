{"text":"The Westin NYC is AWFUL I had planned a surprise trip to New York for my wife to celebrate our 10th Wedding Anniversary. I chose the Westin because it was a 5 Star Hotel and close to the centre of Manhattan on the corner of 43rd and 8th. I emailed the reservations department online and it took then 8 days for them to respond to a booking request. In the meantime as I needed to book the flights, I decided to ring their reservations team. They were rude and arrogant. Finally decided to just book online as they guaurantee their best rate online. The Hotel claims to be a contemporary Icon in the centre of Manhattan - its more like prisoner cell block H. The club rooms and suites are arranged around a central atrium on levels reminiscent of a 1960s high rise tower block -its badly lit and rather depressing.I asked for champagne and flowers to be delivered to the room for our arrival. When we got there, there was no sign of the flowers or champagne. The room was also filthy dirty - there was a large stain on the carpet, there was makeup on the bed sheets, two pubic hairs in the bed linen, and a pubic hair in the bath. The tiled walls in the bathroom had never been cleaned and were badly soiled. The whole room was frankly just unpleasant.We complained bitterly and asked to be moved (by this time my wife was close to tears). Unfortunately the hotel claimed to be full and refused to move us. They did arrange for a complimentary bottle of champagne to be delivered to the room, which arrived 5 hours later (after having chased reception twice for its whereabouts) and a cleaner finally showed up and cleaned our room. The replacement bedsheets were also dirty, so she had to go and get some more which took another hour. By this time I was ringing around other 5* NYC Hotels - unfortunately they were all full as it was the weekend of Elton Johns Birthday Concert in Madison Square Garden. In the end we just decided to stay make do and try not to get stressed, about the inadequacies of the place. The following morning we got up, and we enquired at reception where breakfast was served and we were directed by them to Shulas Restaurant. They neglected to tell us that guests staying on B  B in the execvutive suites had access to a private lounge where complimentary breakfast was also served. Shulas charged us $40 for a coffee, a tea, two orange juices and 4 slices of toast and Jam. only realised this when we came to check out. I needed to access to the internet and a printer, and so was directed by the Hotel to the business centre, which was a poky little room, with 3 pcs in it hooked up to a broken printer. On the last night of our stay at this god awful place, we were given notice that the water was to be turned off from 9.00pm until 5.00am for maintenance. I also noticed the doorman taking back handers off the cabbies, which as I understand it in New York is illegal. We stayed for 3 nights and had to pay $2000US for the privelege of staying in this awful awful hotel. New York is a fantastic city and well worth a visit - just dont stay here at the Westin - they ruined our anniversary trip.
