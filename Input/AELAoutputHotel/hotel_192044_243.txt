{"text":"Ok, but not great. We stayed here for a weekend at the beginning of September.Check-in was fine, nice friendly receptionist and she promised us that we had a great room and it was nice enough - good size, nicely decorated and a good bathroom.It was late and we were hungry so we tried the Georgetown restaurant which was, to be honest, pretty poor. Very, very ordinary food (i.e. I could have made better myself and I'm no chef by any means) at not-so-cheap prices. Definitely, do _not_ eat here.Next morning, we had breakfast downstairs in the 2nd restaurant which was ok. The restaurant is kind of cramped and the cooked food is buffet style but it was alright. Apart from one chap who appeared to be running the place, the rest of the staff were a little like Zombies in that they neither asked nor seemed to care whether you were enjoying your food or not. In fact, they didn't seem to speak to the guests.That night, we got back to find that in the bar below (Borough?) there was a disco that went on until around 1am or so. This turned out to be right under our room so it wasn't so easy to sleep until around 1.30 or so as all your disco favourites from Grease, Abba and so on were very loud in our room. We also noticed that corridor noise from upstairs was pretty loud too. At some point in the night the bar also seemed to drop its empty bottles onto the street making a bit more noise.Everything else was fine. The location's good if you want to be South of the river (which we did) and it's very accessible as it's right near the tube.Checkout was a bit weird - different receptionist who didn't even offer to print a bill and show it to me before charging my card. So...all in all. Nice room, good location, not too bad a rate for London. On the downside - indifferent staff, pretty noisy and not very good food.
