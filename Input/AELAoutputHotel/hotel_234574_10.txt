{"text":"Nothing to Winge About I have just returned from Barcelona which was brilliant. I had booked the Laietana Palace over the internet and wasn't quite sure of the location having never visiting Barcelona and read mixed reviews was a little unsure. When arriving it took us about 20 min to get from the airport to the Hotel, costing 25 euros!The hotel is on a main street but your won't find many hotels that aren't! The hotel has air conditioning and staff were very friendly on arrival. When arriving at our room we were pleasantly suprised with the size of it (double room).The floor was marble with nice furnishings, overall very clean.The bathroom is also a great size, with toilet, beade, sink and shower and enough room to swing several cats! A little dissapointed there was no bath but shower was great.The hotel is very quiet although if you get a room facing the main road you know when its morning with the sound of traffic waking you. I did not find this much of a problem though. The hotels location is brilliant. A two min walk to the port, restraunts accross the road, gaudi musuem near by, picasso museum near by and La Ramblas is directly behind the hotel with a small walk up to it!We found taxis cheap when lost or in a hurry or legs just too tierd to walk any further, just a few pounds to your destination. Staff at the hotel are really helpful on any information you need. Make sure you check out all the back lanes benhind the hotel, quite interesting!
