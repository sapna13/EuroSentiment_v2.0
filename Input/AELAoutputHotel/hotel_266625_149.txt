{"text":"Super trip! We were at the Sirenis Cocotal from March 11-18th. The hotel is great....can't really relate to the negative reviews we read prior to leaving on the trip. I believe our whole airplane was staying at this hotel, thanks to a screw-up from Sunquest Vacations...They put the wrong price on their website, so most people got the trip for a steal! Thought the line up for check- in would be awful since there were four full buses that arrived at the hotel all at the same time, but they were very efficient. They had the room cards already filled out.... not too long of a wait at all. Enjoyed a couple of beers while we waited. Room- Fine, very clean...oceanview L block. Kind of noisy out in the hall as we were on the ground floor by the stairs. Maids left nice flowers everyday around, fridges stocked, lots of towels etc. Brought adapter from dollarstore...worked well.Beach- beautiful...windy but breeze was nice or it would have been to hot to sit out for too long. Food- Good, can't complain...I agree that it got boring after a while but I am a picky eater...Didn't get sick at all.... which is the main thing. Excursions- Go on the ATV Quadrunners...fabulous... real hoot!Husband went deep sea fishing... rough....lots of sick people on the boat.. didn't catch anything but saw lots of dolphins. Staff- very hard workers, friendly (most) Activity Staff- Tried really hard... lots of fun Grounds- lovely... staff working all day to keep nice.p.s. Can't complain about trip....well worth it! ONly advise... don't eat the pizza at the airport...husband and I both got sick about 1 hour into flight from it! Not good to have stomach and butt problems on such a small airplane!!Jill and Darcy ","annotations":[{"endOffset":770,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":766},{"endOffset":770,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":766},{"endOffset":770,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":766},{"endOffset":1456,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1452},{"endOffset":1540,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1535}]}
