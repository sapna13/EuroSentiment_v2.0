{"text":"One Word - Magnifique!!!!!!!!!!! 5 Star Experience My teenage daughter and I just spent her Spring Break week at the Sofitel. From the moment the car stopped in front of the hotel we were treated like royalty. Every guest is greeted as a welcomed loved one returning home from a journey. The greetings, smiles, and genuine attention to every service need or request underscores the superelative service of this hotel. I work in the travel service industry and travel to NY often and have stayed in many lovely hotels in and around Manhattan. With all of the state of the art bedding that is touted by other hotel chains, Sofitel's is far and away the most comfortable. I have chronic lower back pain and can only sleep on any mattress 5 hrs at a time. Well, I slept a full 8 hours on their wonderful bed w\/o any kinks, crimps, or negative physical impacts. I fully intend to try and buy one of these beds for myself. My finicky and highly pampered teen ADORED the hotel. The internet access, the friendliness of the staff, and the superb room service - the food is fabulous- had her raving from the moment we entered the room. The delectable Lenotre chocolates each guest receives each evening helped to seal the deal that this is now the ONLY place my daughter wants to stay when we visit NY. Daniel -the best doorman on the planet, Ronald- The most informative and debonaire reservationist ever, Nick -the spot on bellman, and the the classy and helptul Concierge all underscore the serious commitment that the Sofitel makes to serving their customers. The lovely location, critic's choice cuisine, blissful bedding, and stupendous staff all underscore the Sofitel's universal appeal. Make the Sofitel your home base in NYC. ","annotations":[]}
