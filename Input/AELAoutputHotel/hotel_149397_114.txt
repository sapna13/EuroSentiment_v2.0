{"text":"Dancing Under the Stars We are members of a travel club, and our home resort is the Bavaro Princess. Of course we read most of the reviews, and are always interested in what others have to say about this resort. Through the years, for some reason it has remained our favorite. We know that Bavaro Princess is not as new as some of the admitedly gorgeous places that have been recently built in the Bavaro area of Punta Cana. Still, here goes:When we are at Bavaro Princess we feel that we really are on vacation. Our Spanish is not that good, but the staff - from check-in to the restaurants and bars to the animacion staff to the house band - all contribute to making our stay there a lot of fun. They are always - at least to us - gracious, and go out of their way to make service a pleasure. When we read that some people say that the staff is partial to Spanish speaking people, we do not feel that is accurate. Just slow down and little, and speak softly - they will get it. I think most of them do a remarkable job hadling all the languages and trying to make sense of it all! Usually, the managers (bars, restaurants, reservations) will have a fair command of English if you really need to speak to someone. At the night Lobby Bar, and night stage bar, Richard, Dulce and Nelsa are great bartenders and will make you feel at home!The thing we enjoy most at Bavaro Princess is the house band. We have heard some people say there is no dancing there. Here's the deal. If you go up to the lobby area about 8:30 PM, the house band plays most nights in the courtyard near the buffett restaurant Hispagnola. During this time they play mostly jazz cover music (standards). At about 10PM the animacion show begins. We were a little disappointed in the shows this past visit; but the dancers do their best and the shows were OK. Often they are audience participation type or lip-synch dance shows. As soon as the show is over, near 11PM the house band starts again. They play a great mix of merengue, salsa, tango and other latino styles. They seem to get better every year. We do not dance well to this music, but ample whiskey and Banana Mamas do wonders to one's co-ordination! Soon anyone who wants to dance is dancing under the stars in a beautiful open courtyard to a great band. The animacion staff dancers will also drag you out on the dance floor (if you want) and dance with you if your wife or partner is a little shy. We were at a place last year, and their idea of a band was a keyboard player and saxophonist playing cover Beatle music from the 60's. The place was empty. Most of the places think that American cover music is what people want to hear. I am soooooo grateful that Bavaro Princess plays native music. Why would I fly all those miles to listen to an American lounge act? Boring!!!! So if you are open to this type of stuff, don't miss the band. The musical director (Federico Ortiz)deserves lots of credit for putting together a great collection of singers and musicians. After that, you can listen to a decent latino\/americano DJ mix, or stop by the nearby Casino (they provide transportation) for a while. We seldom get up in time for breakfast at Bavaro Princess. Drinking, dancing, gambling, Dominican cigars - I guess we are just too corrupted here!!!Bavaro Princess has a very European and Latin American feel, and it is not uncommon to see several generations (grandpop, dads, and grandkids) still up at midnight. Ditto a very European feel on the beach and pool area, so the scenery can be a little different to what North Americans are used to. I just say Viva la difference. We always have fun there! Just be open to a different experience, and up for a good time!
