{"text":"Excellent! Don't bother looking anywhere else! We have been lucky enough to take several vacations in Europe this summer. The Fira Palace in Barcelona is by far the best hotel we have stayed in. The room was very large, with two full\/queen beds, sofa, desk, flat screen, etc, etc. The room and amenities were just as nice as the five star hotel we looked into, but the beds were bigger, and more comfortable, ( and if you've read the other reviews, yes the sheets are REALLY nice!). The bathroom was superb, with body sprays in the shower, and a full set of toiletries on the marble vanity. The executive rooms have bathrobes, and extra amenities as well. The front desk and service personelle were helpful, and friendly, and all spoke English. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Oh, let me not forget the price. We paid two star prices for what we considered a five star experience! It was in a lovely area, with a fabulous bakery across the street. Thus we did not choose their breakfast. We also did not have time to use the pool or gym. Some complain of the location, but a taxi stand is in front of the door, the bus stops a few meters away, and the metro station is about two blocks. What we would pay in taxi, bus\/ metro fare, we saved in the super price of the hotel! We brought a car, and the car park opens into the lower level of the hotel. Super safe!
