{"text":"PreCruise Hotel - Good, not great Stayed one night at the Embassy Suites (Carolina) near the San Juan international airport prior to leaving on the Carnival Victory and a southern caribbean cruise.Traveling from California, we had to leave at 6am Pacific time and not arrive in PR via Dallas until 10pm PR time. By the time we got to the Embassy Suites, all the restaurants were closed despite the website indicating that the Outback steakhouse would be open until 2am. The manager said that only the bar was ever open that late. When I informed him of the error in the hotel's website, he seemed to care less. I would hope they would correct this information because on the cab ride to the hotel, the cabbie offered to pull into a fast food place and get my family food (two very young, starving kids plus 4 exhausted adults). Instead, I opted to trust the hotel website and it was wrong.Secondly, we arrived to a virtual Calypso concert in the hotel lobby - so loud it was hard to hear the clerk at the check in desk. Apparently at least one wedding and one 50 year wedding anniversary were being celebrated. It was mid-night. No one could tell me when the party would end. We were tired and hungry and it didnt seem that rest nor food was going to come anytime soon. This is not what I signed up for.Had to take a cab 6 blocks to a very busy Chilis for dinner. They took an hour to make 5 sandwiches. Got back to the hotel at 130am with music still blaring. still no clue when the party would end. The room was able to void out most of the noise and my 1 year old was able to fall asleep with ease. Room was typical Embassy Suites - clean and comfortable. Breakfast bar was extremely busy and hard to find a table. Buffet line for made to order breakfast was a joke so I opted for precooked eggs, bacon, etc which was just fine and very fresh. otehr choices included tropical fruits, oatmeal, cereals, breads, coffee, milk, juices as you would expect.No newspaper delivered to our room and no Hilton Honors amenities (as an honors gold member, I typically get a free snack and bottled water on check in waiting in my room). I am used to this from all other Hilton brand hotel stays - but not a deal killer by any means.There is a small casino at this hotel with slot machines and a fwe table games.Check out is at noon and this was a very very busy time for the lobby. If you can check out earlier, you will miss the busy period. Check out seemed to maximize around 11am to 1130am.One phone and one remote control in our room was broken. We reported these to front desk but no fix ever came.Overall it was a cozy night, but a bit loud and searching for food options was not fun (pizza delivery ended at midnight). The rooms were fine as was the buffet (althought busy). I'd probably stay here again if just staying one night because of value and proximity to airport - but if you are looking for a long stay in San Juan, I would opt for something closer to the beach or closer to old town. We were advised not to walk the 6 blocks at night to the Chilis restaurant by hotel employees.The description of the beach being 1.5 blocks - hmmm, those are some long blocks.If you want optimum proximity to the cruise terminal, there is a Sheraton in old town right across the street from the terminal. The Embassy Suites is about a 30 min cab ride to the cruise terminal - and costs around $30. Cab from airpor to the hotel was $25 but we suspect we overpaid even though the cab fairs are predetermined by some cab authority at the airport. I bet we had some surpluss added just because we were picked up at the aiport. This fare was based on # of people. The fare to the cruise terminal seemed to be based on distance traveled. Whatever. I was confused. I didnt particularly like Puerto Rico anyway.I'll leave a review on the Carnival Victory elsewhere. If I fail to mention it there, the cruise terminal is horrible and mismanaged. The aiport in SJ is also very undersized and not very well run.
