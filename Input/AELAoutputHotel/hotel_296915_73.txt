{"text":"In Love AGAIN with Hotel Pulitzer October 2007 was my first visit to Hotel Pulitzer after arriving from BCN very late on a rainy night; the reception could not have been more accomodating; when I first saw my room, I was a bit disappointed because I wanted a room where I could open the windows and get fresh air; well, asked and received; only comment was that the view was of rooftops; however I had fresh air anytime I wished just by opening the french type doors onto the rooftop; the bar was comfortable and bar personnal friendly and helpful; since I eat very light breakfast I asked for yougurt, fruit, a pastry and coffee and the price was adjusted accordingly; the location was excellent; walk everywhere; I walk with a cane so was grateful Ramblas, double busses, Cortes Ingles, were all well within my walking comfortably range; I am planning to return to Barcelona October 2008 so I searched the internet for more hotels in the general area to see what they had to offer; ; I have to report that in my opinion, I will not find another hotel with the same ammenities and services, personnel and charm so I have booked The Hotel Pulitzer again; my search for the perfect hotel is over; it's the Hotel Pulitzer for me and I have already recommended this hotel to several of my friends who are going to Barcelona this year, 2008. Well done Hotel Pulitzer and I am looking forward to October 2008 and many Octobers thereafter.
