{"text":"Beautiful hotel Just came back from an all girls trip to Puerto Rico. We originally booked the Caribe Hilton with the expectations of a nice hotel. The lobby was beautiful but after seeing the room we quickly exited stage left. Definitely not worth the money!!So we headed over to the Marriott. It was beautiful. The lobby was nice. The bell men were cute and the rooms were clean and nicely decorated. Our first room had some leakage problems and we were promptly relocated (with help) and given a $100 credit. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat at the hotel at all, too pricey for us. There is a great restaurant down the street with really good Puerto Rican food that is open 24 hours. I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ remember the name of it but it is right next to Walgreen√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ on the Ashford Ave. side. The portions are large so we either shared or took the leftovers back to the hotel. We inquired about a microwave and a few minutes later a guy was knocking on the door with a microwave to put in the room, free of charge!!After realizing all the taxi rides were going to cost a small fortune, we chose the bus. Only $.75 each way! The bus goes everywhere from Old San Juan to Isle Verde and even the airport. Old San Juan is nice and perfect for tourists. We found a little shack by the port that served the best Marlin pastelillos, the manager, Andres is really nice. We also caught the ferry over to the Bacardi plant for free drinks!!! The souvenir shops definitely weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ as cheap as the Bahamas. The clubs were okay. Too many young people though. Senior Frogs has a great atmosphere but leaves something to be desired in the food department. We decided we wanted to get away from the tourist spots and wanted to rent a car. The Hertz desk at the hotel wanted $40 a day!!! So I went down to the business center which is open 24 hours a day and booked a small compact car using Hotwire for $12.95 a day. The total for the day was less than $20. The only bad thing is the $14 parking fee at the hotel is ridiculous!!! We rode the bus to the airport, picked up the car, and hit the highway. There are small tolls as you drive up the highway, the most expensive one was $1.50. We drove up to the El Yunque rainforest, which was only a 45 minute drive. The tours from area hotels range from $40-$50. So we were expecting an entrance fee of some sort. Well to our surprise it was completely FREE. We walked the trail to the La Mina waterfall. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go to the peak this time, we heard it was beautiful. Either way, you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ beat this FREE excursion.All in all we had a great trip to Puerto Rico. I would stay at the Marriott again, however, I would rather rent a condo off the beach.
