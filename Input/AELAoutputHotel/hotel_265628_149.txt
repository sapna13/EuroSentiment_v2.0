{"text":"Amazing time at the Serenis! My partner and I travelled to the Domincan Republic on Nov 22nd for a fortnight. We stayed at the Serenis Tropical Suites in Ulvero Alto.Flight there:- We flew with My Travel from Gatwick via Manchester(we did already know this prior to our trip) On arrival in Manchester we were told there was a 'fault' with the door on the plane and would have to disembark. After 1.5 hrs we boarded a Thomas Cook plane and set off! (We later found out that they do this regulary!!!) Flight was fine no problems made up some time in the air and arrived about 230pm in the afternoon. Having already been to the DR and Punta Canan I knew what to expect on arrival and it all ran smoothly and we were on our air conditioned transfer buses in no time. Yes the roads are very bumpy so be prepared and there are no rules on how to drive it seems and quite frequently they change sides of the road! I would not reccommend driving out there during your stay.Hotel- On arrival we were greeted with a refreshing cocktail and check in ran very smoothly and we set off to our room which was T101. We got everything we requested,a gorgeous sea view on the first floor. The rooms are very basic but very clean and served there purpose well. My only comment is that the A\/C was very tempremental so didnt use it much and at this time of the year wasnt a problem. The food was amazing. We used the buffet alot but also tried a few of the Speciality restaurants. We went to the Mexican,Chinese,Steakhouse,Italian and the Medditeranean. Our favourites were the Italian and Mexican. Book well in advance for the steakhouse but its well worth a visit! Sample menus are available at Guest Services for you to look at.Drinks were in abundance too and some of the cocktails were lovely. My fav was the Strawberry Daquiri and my partner loved the Pina Colada and the local drink 'Coco Loco' The staff in this resort were so friendly and helpful and always greeted you whether it be in the restaurant or just walking on the sidewalk! They work so hard 24\/7 and keep the resort immaculate. The entertainment staff were fantastic and we made it to quite a few of the shows and would recommend the Dirty Dancing,Grease,Domincan and the Stars shows. They put in so much effort throughout the day but won't hassle you to join if you dont want too. 'Spaghetti' (one of the guys)was soo funny and amusedus when we were lazing by the pool.The sea by the beach was a little disappointing as was very choppy and not ideal for swimming in. We spent most of our days by the pool which was fantastic and kept very clean. Our only comment was that in our second week they started doing repairs and tore down the bridge which resulted in a lot of noise and mess but I guess it had to be done at some time and didnt affect us much(we just moved further away)We did two trip both which I reccomend. We went by Catamaran to Saona Island which was amazing and the sea was gorgeous(will post pictures) We ate lunch there and sunbathed and then came back on a speedboat which was great fun!The other trip we did was to the Marinarium abnd we snorkelled and swam with the stingrays  nurse sharks which amazing.Overall we had a fantastic holiday and would not hesitate to return ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1491,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1484},{"endOffset":1804,"mention":"Strawberry","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Strawberry_pie"],"startOffset":1794}]}
