{"text":"Fantastic hotel- shame about the building work Stayed at the hotel Estherea after reading excellent reviews on trip advisor. I travel a lot and am always a bit dubious about trusting reviews but this really is an excellent hotel, one of the best boutique hotels I have stayed in. The decor is elegant but the hotel is very relaxed with a friendly and cosy ambiance. Our room had been very recently renovated and was immaculate combining traditional decor, furniture and comforts with all the modern extras you would expect from a discerning hotel including an LCD flat screen.  Unfortunately for us as our room was so newly renovated,the room next door was in the process of being renovated which we found out as we were awoken at 7.30am to the sounds of drilling and sawing!. Was very very disapointed that a hotel with such apparant high standards would not have pre warned us of the buiding work at such close proximity, especially as I had e-mailed the hotel just 2 days earlier. The hotel were appologetic but only after I had approached them and I was compensated but would have rather enjoyed a more relaxing stay. Would still rate this hotel very highly as the buiding work is coing to an end, and guests arriving after the renovations are complete will have a wonderfull stay, however, if your stay is soon, I would check with the hotel before your arrival to avoid dissapointment. The hotel is idealy located for all attractions and there are some great neighbourhood resteraunts and bars. In particualr Casa di david @ Singel 420, about 5 mins walk, is an excellent Italian.
