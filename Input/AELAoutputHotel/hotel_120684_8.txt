{"text":"Great vacation This is my second time staying at the OWB, after our stay 2 years ago we vowed we wouldn't stay anywhere else.So many great things about this hotel, free calls to USA and Canada for keeping in touch with family (this came in handy) booking activities, rental car, transportation etc through hotel, literally a one stop shop. I found that our hotel had the best restaurants in Waikiki Beach, we kept returning after walking the strip because nothing could really beat the views and the quality of food, Chucks, Dukes and Hula grill were fantastic, the store in the lobby came in handy as well with bottled water very reasonably priced and accessible near the beach and our room. My only disappointment this time were the thin walls, I never realized it as a much during our last stay but we were kept up at night with the sound of flushing toilets, people bathing, talking etc. we were situated right next to the maid supply closet and trust me they weren't quiet when speaking to each other. If you do stay here and realize you are in a room ending in 00 maybe request a room change, all the floors with 00 for (200, 300, 400) have the supply closet next to it which is accessible at all hours of the day by the janitorial staff, Also these same rooms overlook the roof of the Royal Hawaiian hotel that is undergoing a huge reno and their A\/C fan is on the roof deck right outside of the 00 rooms and is extremely noisy . We mentioned this to the hotel staff and they quickly switched us into another oom, aside from the thin walls that all the rooms have, I was again a delited guest, service was great! Oh and another thing to be aware of is there is a pushy timeshare person offering discounts right next to the activities desk so be aware when booking an activity through the hotel that you may be bugged 1 second later by a timeshare rep telling you that they can give it to you for free if you attend a session of theirs. Which I found kinda unfair to the hotel activities sales people who were very helpful. ","annotations":[]}
