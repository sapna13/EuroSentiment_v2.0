{"text":"Best hotel on our trip I don't normally write reviews or fill in rating forms at hotels, however I used Trip Advisor Hotel reviews for all accommodation I booked for my trip to Italy therefore, I felt I should post my review to help others out. I have just returned from an 8 day trip to Tuscany, the San Gallo Palace was the best hotel that we stayed in on the whole trip. The rooms are lovely, very plush, modern, spacious and immaculately clean. We had a double room on the first floor, and it was very quiet and peaceful (it's in a quiet area). They also provide slippers and bath robe which is a nice luxury after travelling around for a few days! There's a reasonably priced mini bar in the room but it is in effect a small fridge and therefore has space for your own drinks (water etc which is very handy). The price of a beer in the mini bar was cheaper than in the hotel bar (just recheck that but as I far as I remember that was the case!) The breakfast was very good, lovely food and good selection. The accommodation is expensive and that is the only downside it has. We paid √à√\u2020√ü?25 for 3 nights. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ averaging √à√\u2020√ü?08 per night for a double room BB The service was excellent and we found the reception staff could not do enough to help us. We ended up staying an extra night more than we planned in the hotel. It is in a good location, about 20 mins walk to the Duomo. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
