{"text":"The Best I've Ever Stayed At Booked a valley wing room for a two-night (one-day), stopover based solely on the reviews here.I can honestly say they live up to any amount of praise thrown their way.Hotel Transfer:Had arranged previously and the team was there to greet me as expected. They even went out of their way to try and locate my gf who was flying in from elsewhere and we had mixed up which terminals we were meeting at.Check-In\/Check-OutAs soon as we walked into the lobby a lady came up to greet us by name and led us directly to our room. On the way to the room she informed us that we had been upgraded to a suite. Once in the room, the butler gave us an induction to the room while the clerk took our passports\/etc. and filled out the check-in forms. Within 5 minutes our luggage was there and we were checked in and alone to relax. Check-Out was just as quick. We had an early flight our last day and our luggage was picked up and loaded in the vehicle and bill paid for in a matter of 5 minutes agin.RoomThe room was quite impressive. I think it was the little things that really struck me. the jack so you could plug your iPod into the stereo; the pot of tea in it's own warmer; the selection of chocolates, and the automatic controls of eevrything.ServiceBest service I've ever come across. Nothing was too much trouble, our butler literally walked us half the way to Orchard road since we said we wanted to walk and he didn't want us lost. Probably interacted with 15 different people working for the hotel in the 36 hours we were there and all were better than I have seen elsewhere.FoodNever got a chance to have breakfast (Up too late first day and gone too early the next), but did have dinner at The Line one night. I can't see anyone going hungry here......or not finding something they absolutely love to eat. Only thing here I found kind of over the top was the 1.5 liter bottle of water that cost S$16, but the food was worth it.LocationIt is very convenient to the one end of Orchard Road, maybe 5-10 minutes walk, but since it is not right on Orchard, you are relieved fro all the hustle and bustle. I actually couldn't think of a better spot if you want quiet\/convenience.I really cant say enough good about this place. Unfortunately on my way back through I stayed at the Marriott for comparison purposes and missed out on another great stay. I won't do the same next time.
