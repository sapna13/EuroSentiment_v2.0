{"text":"Just Perfect. My boyfriend and I stayed for 10 great nights at the GBP. Last year we went to Mexico and got cought up in Hurricane Wilma. It was a dreadful experince, and i have to say going back to the Carribean was both on our minds prior to going. Once there, we had a ball. Fantastic resort. The food was excellent. In my opinion the Japonese and French were by far the best, and the worst was the Mexican. Service by all staff was excellent, they would whip the plates from under you just to clear things and have them tidy!. Everything was spotless. Its a very poor country, but i have to say that they are the happiest people around. It certainly makes your holiday to see so many happy people around you. I would have liked to venture out a bit more, but it wasn;t all that safe and we were advised against doing so. We had to leave a little early in the end. Nothing to do with the hotel, there was a death in my family. The Mytravel rep was useless in helping....thank god for internet access!!...i look back very fondly on the hotel and would certainly recommend it as a place to go to. An after thought goes to one of the trips we went on. The horse riding on the beach at sunset. Dont go!!...the boys running this were blind drunk the day we went. My boyfriend was never horse riding before and one of them took the rains off him and went off galloping...i dont know how the poor lad stayed on!...i was laughing my head off but he says he will never get on a horse again so just be careful if you are thinking of this one!!.
