{"text":"Never be tempted to stay here! The worst hotel I've stayed in for a long time, and an unbelievable price rip-off. We will be taking up their dishonest charging practices with our credit card provider!The room was not cleaned the first day and on two days of four it was cleaned in the late afternoon while we were trying to relax in the room. Cleaning staff were friendly and polite. The rest of the staff were arrogant and unhelfpul, and at times downright rude. Getting attention for anything from checkin\/checkout to concierge services required standing in long queues. Bell-boy services were non-existent. Information on facilities and services was very poor. Advertising messages left on our room phone drove us insane and rendered the voicemail service completely useless. Excessive noise and poor air conditioning that caused us to boil, then freeze, meant we got no sleep.Lifts didn't work properly. (We almost missed an expensive tour because we had to wait for 20 minutes for an elevator!). Food costs were outrageous - $17.50 USD for a small bowl of oatmeal! And despite a rate of over $300 per night, an internet connection was an expensive extra! Even the in-room coffee was limited to enough to make 2 cups per day if you didn't need sugar, and only 1cup per day per room (regardless of number of occupants) with sugar. The buffet breakfast was quite good, but at $19.95 USD each, you would expect it to be! As for lunch and dinner, the restaurants around the corner offered far better at a quarter the price, with courteous service thrown in at no extra cost! And don't even think of booking activities through the Marriott! Tour service operators one block away offered identical tours and activities for an average of 60% of the price and were much nicer to deal with!My daughter arranged our bookings at $159 USD per night, but when we checked in we were told no bookings existed at that rate and it was actually $275 per night, but they could offer a 4th night free special. (My daughter actually paid the apparently non-existent $159 rate for an identical room!) On checkout, the charge levied was over $300 per night, and no fourth night free. When I complained, we were told they had a 'pre-auth' on our credit card and had placed the charge and did not need a signature or approval of any charges. (That suggests they think they can defraud whenever they please! I'll be taking that up with my card provider!)Overall, a miserable experience that spoiled an otherwise enjoyable holiday.
