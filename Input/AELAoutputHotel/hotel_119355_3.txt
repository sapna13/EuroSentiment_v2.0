{"text":"Poor Crowne Plaza This is the worst Crowne Plaza I have ever visited. Although the hotel was renovated at some point, as evidenced by the lobby and some updates to the room decor, this hotel is not one that I would recommend.Upon reaching the airport, it took over 20 minutes for the shuttle to show up after I called the hotel. Since I arrived at night, I thought this was a little long considering a key selling point of this hotel is that it is an airport hotel.I had emailed the hotel my requests related to my room, as I am a light sleeper and need quiet to sleep through the night. I am also a member of the hotel chain's loyalty program. No one responded to my email, which was sent through the property's website at least one week prior to my arrival. After discussing my preferences with the front desk person upon arrival at the property, I was given a room on the quiet floor. In the first two minutes in the room, I heard train whistles blaring. OK, let's try another room... The next room features the delightful sounds of aircraft engines. I have stayed at other airport properties (including one at LHR) before and have not heard this much noise. I don't think this property is familiar with the concept of sound-proof or double-glazed windows. I suppose that I should just be grateful for the earplugs and the Sleep Advantage CD in the room.The room is too dark. The lamps do not provide enough light. The lighting in the bathroom is also too dark. The light fixture in the bathroom has a broken covering, too.Now here's the gross part. I always request two beds, even when I travel solo because the beds are not always up to my standards. I figure with two beds if something is wrong with one, I still have another. Well, in my room at the Crowne Plaza, the first bed has someone else's hair on it. I am not talking about one random strand that may have fallen off the housekeeper as she was making the bed. I am talking about several hairs of different lengths and textures. There is no way that someone could have made that bed and not seen all of that hair on the white sheet -- especially since the hair was jet black!!! The other bed did not show any obvious filth, and given the late hour of my check in tonight (and being on my second room in this hotel), I chose to use the second bed and plan to address the housekeeping issue with management in the morning.There is one bright spot -- the free wireless internet!What an overall disappointment! There are many hotel options in Phoenix, I recommend you avoid this one!
