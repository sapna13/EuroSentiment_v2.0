{"text":"Average Hotel but still a lot of Fun My husband and I just got back from our 7 day vacation to Punta Cana (Feb. 16-23) and we stayed at The IFA Villas Bavaro Resort. At first we wondered what we go our selfs into when we walked into the resort.. because it looked so small...then we realized there was 3 parts to the resort and it actually is very big. Our room was average.. nothing fantastic. The pools were great for the most part and they had decent entertainment around the villas pool area. The beach was BEAUTIFUL! It was a little bit of a walk to the beach because the resort is big but definately worth the walk..thats where we spent most of our days. The food at the buffets are average..it took me a couple days to get use to because everything has a bit of an odd taste. But again not horrible. Dont even bother with the Mexican, Seafood, or Japenese restraunts.. they were horrible. All you get to drink is water there...we asked for soda or beer but never got it at any of those restraunts. The portions at these restraunt could probably not even fill up a 6 year old because they are so small. I just wouldn't bother wasting your time in those restaunts...And be sure if you decide to make reservations at any of those restraunts.. go at least 3-4 days a head of time to get a good reservation. Otherwise you may not even get a reservation or you wont be able to eat until 10pm at night. The only thing we really found horrible was probably only 3% of the vacationers and staff spoke english...we were so lonely and it got extremely fustrating not having most of the staff understand us. The employees spoke spanish and french mostly very very little english. We would recommend going with friends or family members to Punta Cana because if you think your going to meet english speaking people down there.... think again. We didnt meet someone who spoke english until our 2nd last day. So honestly that was the only thing really hard to deal with. Overall the hotel was ok\/ average... if you get a good deal to stay here then its worth the money.
