{"text":"Breath Madrid We were pleasantly surprised by the hotel room, and this was in line with most of the reviews we read on tripadvisor. The room we had on the 6th floor was very clean, and larger than the average room. The bathroom is top, and includes all necessary amenities. We could see on the map that all hotel rooms have a different size. Some are faced to the street, some are facing the interior of the hotel. The location of the hotel is splendid. You have direct access to the underground (Callao station), and you are within walking distance of the Madrid central square. However you have to get used to the noise of the city centre, which is similar in Paris or London. Some nights were noisy, not only because of the traffic, but also because of ongoing construction across the street. Also we could hear the people next door go in the shower in the morning. An group of american youngsters kept the place busy and noisy during the night. Breakfast is good value for money, and worth the 9 Euro's, but we also went for breakfast in the city centre. Most staff is friendly, certainly when you try your best spanish. On the top floor are 2 outside terraces, with a nice view of the city. During summer (it was 33 degrees when we were there), you can sit there from 7 pm. Prices of drinks are affordable, and I also think that the prices of the minibar are reasonable. We took the underground from the airport to the hotel. It is feasible if you don't have too much luggage, because you need to change 3 times. The hotel bus is 6 Euro per person and goes about 6 times per day to the airport.
