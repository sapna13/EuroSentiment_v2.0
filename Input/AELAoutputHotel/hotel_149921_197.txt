{"text":"Great Stay My wife and I went down for our 25th and had a great stay. Had a room in the main Bldg. in the executive floor. Had a view of the lagoon and ocean, very nice view. Very quite and laid back. Room was very nice and cleaned everyday. The view from the other side is of the ocean and the city. Were givin the chance to have either view. The exective lounge was a great extra to have. Very nice Cont. breakfast in the morning for free and were able to get water , soda for the beach for the afternoon. Save alot of money that way. Pool and the lagoon were real nice and clean. Not very many people were there so we could sit almost any where we wanted to. Service at the swim up bar was ok. Morton,s steak house was GREAT. Went into town for another dinner, the cab into old san jaun was 10.00 plus 2.00 tip. Also went to the El San Juan hotel and casino for a 20.00 cab. Hilton was a great place to really relax and just chill out and enjoy the good weather. PS. If you get a room in the new towers bldg. it is a pretty long walk to the pool and lagoon. The main Bldg. is right next to everything. The Garden view section has its own pool but very small and people tell me the rooms are very old too. If you want to just get away and chill out , the hilton is the place to do that.
