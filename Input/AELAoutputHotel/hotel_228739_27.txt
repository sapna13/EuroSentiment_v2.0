{"text":"Amazing romantic vacation - this hotel made all the difference My travel agent suggested this property as I specified I wanted to be close to the Eiffel Tower, and this hotel in an exclusive residential area really fit the bill! The rooms were clean, the bathroom immaculate and the breakfast is well worth it. We arrived on May 11, 2008 and stayed 5 nights in a Deluxe Room. The area was very quiet in the evenings, which made it perfect for our early morning tours. We were within a 10-15 minute walk to the Eiffel Tower, and a 20 minute walk to the Arch de Triumph and Champs Elysees, so our location was ideal for us. Also, the Metro Station, Trocadero, specifically lines 6 and 9, were perfect when we wanted to go into other sections of Paris and see the touristy sights, then come back to our cozy room and relax at night. There is a perfect cafe just a few steps away from the metro - Cafe du Trocadero. You can have an excellent meal in the evenings, and from their outdoor tables you have a clear view of the Eiffel Tower lit up in the evenings and you can stay as long as you like - the waiters don't rush you out. We ate there twice and both times enjoyed watching the Eiffel Tower sparkle like a Christmas tree in the late hours. The front desk staff at the hotel are extremely pleasant and helpful. The fitness room is available throughout the day and is well equipped in my opinion as well as well maintained. Also, there is water available there and we helped ourselves to refilling our water bottles just before leaving on our scheduled day trips or sightseeing. For breakfast, there is a hot buffet available and it is refreshed regularly up until about 20 minutes before closing. There is also an excellent selection of juices, pastries and cereals as well as yogurt and fresh fruit, so every appetite is taken care of. The breakfast staff will provide coffee, tea or hot cocoa and the breakfast room is very clean and the table linens and assorted pictures of the Eiffel Tower bring elegance to the overall room design. The deluxe room is a good size and typical of European hotels. There are no drawers, but they do offer several shelves and when we requested more hangers for our clothes the front desk staff responded politely and promptly. Our hairdryer was not working in the room, and a replacement hair dryer was brought to us within minutes! I simply cannot complain about this hotel. They even offer room service late into the evening. The prices are consistent with local restaurants in the area, so if you have sticker shock over the Euro, I suggest that you budget accordingly and accept the fact that it will take nearly two US dollars for every Euro you spend. As far as this hotel is concerned, I would definitely recommend it to other guests. In fact, when we stayed it was quite crowded with guests, both American and European. It seems to be a well kept secret for great Parisian hotels, and I can see why. My husband and I loved Paris, and plan to stay here again on our next visit.
