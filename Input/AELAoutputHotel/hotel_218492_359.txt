{"text":"Best hotel, out of this world!!  I would certainly reccommend this hotel to everyone who would enjoy a luxurious stay at a 5 star hotel!!!! Our family was treated like royalty!! The staff were 100% comitted to making our stay as enjoyable as it could be. I think the manager tries soooo hard to please the guests. They have wonderful games, shows and movies which are played and shown daily. The food there is excellent! They have a number of restaurants of different cultures that offer an excellent variety of food. The rooms were very nice, I definately enjoyed staying in our room, the beds were comfortable, the washroom was kept clean. The maids did a fabulous job. The drinks there were nice. They had nice fruitty flavours, soft drinks and authentic concoctions. You can choose if would like alchohol in your drink or not, for your child's sake. Mentioning your children, they have a place were your kids can stay during the day called the Kids Club, which has a very nice nanny who looks after all the children throughout the day. They go and play in the pool, go inside and play with the lot of toys they have or go and dance with the staff who will show them alot of dances which they will remember. I know I will!!!! They have a tremendous snorkeling trip, where they take you out in the crystal clear ocean, on a nice boat, and will assist you in and out of the water, so you can swim with all the colorful fish which will swim around you. They have parties on wednesdays, thursdays, and on the weekend. There is the manager's cocktail party, where you get to dance with staff or your wife\/husband. They have a lovely beach party where they set up tables on the beach, and they also set up a buffet. There is live music, dancing and games to play. I give my full support to this hotel and all the staff that works there. I hope you will take this reccommendation to your own advantage. I also hope you will take a chance on this hotel, because you will not be dissappointed!!! I am definately coming back next year for an extra week!!!!!!!
