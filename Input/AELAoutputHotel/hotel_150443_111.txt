{"text":"Awesome!!! Totally renovated, rejuvenated  Wow.... what a difference a few years make. This place is outstanding. The renovation is spectacular and very chic. From the lobby, to the rooms, to the restaraunts, to the pools, and outside grounds, this place sparkles! I was traveling with my 2 teens and they were also taken back by the change in the whole atmosphere of this resort. It was cool and chic and everything was new.We stayed here on 2\/14\/08 for one night, and then moved over to the La Concha for 5 nights, and what a mistake that was. I regret not booking my whole stay at Condado Plaza.Checking in was a breeze we immediately changed into our bathing suits to check out the pools. We stayed in the ocean side building and there were 2 pools, one even had salt water, which is more enjoyable than chlorine. The pool area is unbelievable, the young man got our towels and our chairs ready, for a moment I almost thought I was staying at the Ritz. There is great kids water slide and a nice swim up bar in one pool. There are a few private secluded areas that looked very romantic, and there was a tent set up for massages by the sea. Although the beach is public, there was security and it was safe. One of the greatest things to do is to grab one of the many hammocks and just relax under the palm trees.The view from the room was really breathtaking and the sounds of the crashing waves against the sea wall were so soothing. Everything was new and in working order in the room, and the bathroom was huge and had plenty of storage for clothes. The towels were thick and soft and the bathroom supplies were plentiful. Two people could easily be in there at a time with plenty of room leftover, compared to La Concha where the door almost hits your knees when sitting down.The Strip House restaurant is located here and was bustling for Valentines Day, they said they would room for us because we werwe staying at the hotel, but the kids unfortunately just weren't into it, so we ended up at Chili's down the street. There is another restaurant there which was very good for breakfast, but I can't remember the name. There is a great little ice cream parlor which is still there and the kids really enjoyed that.The casino was hopping and so was the bar\/disco in the lobby, and the best part was that there wasn't any construction going on in our building. This is a great location because it's close to Old San Juan and the new convention center, and it really has something for everyone. From the tennis courts to the kayaks on the lagoon, to the spa, and the hammocks.... oh and the Starbucks, how could I forget that?My only regret was that I didn't stay here longer, I only wish I could have left the construction at La Concha and return to the tranquility and hospitality of the Condado Plaza. Thank you Condado Plaza for making my stay so relaxing, I can assure you that I will be back.
