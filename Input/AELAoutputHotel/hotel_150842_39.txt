{"text":"It was fun!!!! :-) Our vacation was from Monday, May 26-June 2 FLIGHT: The flight from home (Cleveland) to there was great, very smooth. At the Punta Cana airport, everything went just as I thought and read about, very smooth. You do have to buy a $10 tourist card on the way in. If you booked through Apple Vacations, you don't have to pay the $20 to leave the country. RIDE TO RESORT: Big bus, bumpy ride, not to bad though.RESORT: Beautiful. The grounds are absolutely beautiful. The people there, are for the most part, very friendly. You did have some that would be a bit rude, but I just smiled. ROOMS: Here we go......1st room, 1st floor garden view, air did not work, fridge was not cold, and our sliding glass door lock was broken. 2nd room, not a garden view, fridge didn't really work all that well, air worked great though. My boyfriend asked our Apple Rep if we could get a garden view instead of looking at building from our balcony. He spoke with management and we were upgraded to the Bavaro.....we got an oceanfront villa. IT WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!! We did flip him a $20 though. It was soooo worth it!! From then on, no problems in the room, we left our maid some money everyday with a small gift, she filled our fridge with lots of beer, water, soda. The coffee in the room is very good. I loved it. There was 2 newts in our room....tiny lizards, wasn't bad.FOOD\/BUFFETS: Breakfast...good, they do have some homemade omelets, potatoes, fresh fruit, pastries, etc. But then they also have this other stuff, I called it mystery meat......YUCK!! The gourmet restaurants: The Steakhouse...good, The Lobster place....good, the Carribean Restaurant.....(I was not feeling good that day, the smell made me more sick...I ordered the Grouper, it was excellent, but the sauce they put on it was disgusting, that was the only thing I could eat there, my boyfriend ordered the grilled tuna, and it was good as well. Over the whole week, I really did not care for the food. I ate alot of fruit, salad, potatoes, eggs. We did drink the water, didn't have a problem. I did take tums and imodium everyday though.BARS: Pretty good, if you wnat more liquor in your drink, just ask, no problems there. Mamajuana.....all I can say is......be careful, that stuff will [-] you up!!! LOL!!! It's strong! We liked it and brought some home. It keeps for years and years, and you can make it yourself. It has this bark\/wood stuff in it, you mix it with honey, red wine, and rum...let it sit for a week or so, and then do shotsof it. WOOOHOOOO, we had fun with that!!! The lobby bar serves top shelf liquor....stay away from bloody mary's.....I found a snail\/slug in mine, I almost threw upo right there at the bar....I really think it was put there on purpose, becasue when the guy gave us our drinks, he disappeared!! I wanted to DIE!!!!!! OMG!!!The bar at the beach wwas great!! We had our 52oz. Bubba Kegs.....ITS A MUST!! They fill it with whatever drink you want, and it stays COLD for hours on the beach, then you don't have to keep going back to the bar. BEACH: OMG!!!! AMAZING!!! WONDERFUL!!!! There really isn't more to say, we had no problem finding chairs, there are topless women, my boyfriend was in heaven!! LOL!!! The water was so nice, so blue, clear, the sand is like powder. We spent almost all of our daytime on the beach.We went on the Maranium excursion, they take you out on a boat, go snorkeling, swim with sharks and stingrays, that was awesome, then you get back on the boat, they serve you this CocoLoco drink....made with real coconuts, rum, etc, it was good, then they take you to this area, where you wade in the water and they serve you drinks in the water, that was fun as well. It cost total...$160 US Dollars for the both of us.Over all, we had a blast, we met alot of people from all over the world, made friends, we would go back, but stay at another place.
