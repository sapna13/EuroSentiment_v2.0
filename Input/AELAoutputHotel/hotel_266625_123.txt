{"text":"Just back from Serenis this morning!!!:( My Daughter and I have just come back from the Sirenis cocotal beach and Spa in the Dominican republicAt the airport, it was a breeze, no complications at all and the locals could not do enough to help. The transfer to the hotel was nothing to complain about...my daughter slept all the way since it was dark there was really nothing to see. The check-in at the hotel was smooth with no delays we were quickly were given our keys, and went to our room which was really pretty ...just remember to take your mosquito net with you....we took ours and did not get bitten even once!!! also always spray on your mosquito repellent(use one with deet ...it really does work). The lady who cleaned our room was very pleasant (don't forget to tip as it does make their life a bit easier it also ensures that you are well looked after because the word does spread around)!The buffet meal had a large variety and we honestly could not fault it. We had a meal at one of the speciality restaurants (the Mexican ...which was a dress up affair and good fun. We decided not to go to the other restaurants as we just wanted to chill as opposed to the formality of ordering etcWe did not go to the casino, or night club, as my daughter is only 11 and therefore not allowed into those areas we did however catch all the shows that they put on every night and one of my fav was the Michael Jackson show (they have a lot of talent in DR which is not even recognised)We booked one of the excursions through our tour rep and I think that is one of the best things we did(we did a full day tour on the monster safari...stopping off at different places to see the life style of the locals .. we visited some schools , church, sugar cane plantation , swam in the river shopped at a local market (don't forget to bring some spending money) and met the children(we brought some pencils etc with us for the children and they were so appreciative, it just makes you realize how we take things for granted The swimming was great (word of advise, if you are like my daughter with very sensitive skin....keep away from the pool nearest to the Mexican restaurant as it tends to get very hot there that is unless you spend most of your time under the bridge and near the pool bar where it is cooler . You are better off going to the pool on the tropical side where there is more shade). It does tend to get very hot between 10-3 sometimes even as early as 9 am so be sure to use that sun screen (we used factor 50 and my daughter still managed to get slightly burnt on the nose and cheeks:(Take part in the activities. Not only are they fun but you can also win prizes e.g. Dominican rep T shirts and the local drink which a lot of people seemed to enjoy doing. They have so many activities you don't really have time to get bored sometimes you have to remind yourself to slow down as you are on holiday. (The one sad thing I found about the activities is that some of the Dominicans tended to be extremely competitive and always had the Us against them attitude which sort of spoilt the fun-but hey that's just a few people so I shall not go into that)About the beach wear...lol.... I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not going to burst any ones bubble but I will say this much if you want to go semi nude, why not book a nudist beach holiday. A lot of these all inclusive holidays have children and some of the younger boys were getting really embarrassed in front of their parents when they would see a woman topless.All in all we had an amazing holiday √à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Would we go back!!!!
