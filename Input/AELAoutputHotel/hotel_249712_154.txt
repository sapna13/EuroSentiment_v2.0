{"text":"Great Hotel  We just got back from a 3 night stay at the Westin Times Square. As other reviews have said, the location is great! The hotel is very nice. Seems new and fresh. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived around 10:00am so I figured our rooms wouldn't be ready even though I had requested early check-in,, and I was correct. We had a pary of 10 so had reserved 3 rooms connecting or very close together. Since the rooms were not ready, we left our bags and went out to enjoy nyc. When we got back at 3:30, I was told that the rooms still were not ready. The reservationist saw that we had children and had already been there once to check-in, so without my persuasion she went to speak with a manager. When she came back out she had 2 rooms connecting for me and the other right beside those. The rooms were spacious (especially the corner room, which had great views)clean, and modern. Our children loved the flat screen television and the computer. They were disappointed that the internet cost extra though.The negatives:Called for additional hand towels and a blanket and it took over an hour to get them, and then they brought the wrong items.The counter in the bathroom is not very large which makes it difficult to get ready in the morning.Other then that we loved it, and would without a doubt stay there again if we could get the deal we got this time which was $200.00 a night. Wow, what a value! ","annotations":[]}
