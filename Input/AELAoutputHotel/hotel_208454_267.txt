{"text":"Nowhere better to stay! My husband  I have just returned from a 4 night break in New York staying at the Sofitel. The hotel is fabulous, we booked a double room on a high floor and although we didn't have a fantastic view, the room and bathroom where perfect. The room was very spacious, plenty of room to spread out and with a work station and a small seating area. The bed was amazing, the best I have ever slept in! The bathroom was large too with a separate bath  shower. We found all the staff we spoke to courteous and helpful from the reception staff to the concierge and the bartender who mixed a perfect Cosmopolitan! The location is idea between 5th  6th so it's convenient for both shopping and the attractions of Time Square.  I read in another review a recommendation for the Red Flame diner a couple of doors down from the hotel, great place for breakfast, and their pancakes are delicious! The concierge also recommend the Osteria Al Doge restaurant which is on 44th between 6th  Broadway, this is another nice place to eat, food is good and the cost reasonable. Finally, on taking the advice of another reviewer I joined the Sofitel Privilege card program before our trip, great tip, it meant we could get a late check out on our final day, and with a flight at 7pm a 4pm check out was ideal.When we come back to New York, we will definitely be staying here.
