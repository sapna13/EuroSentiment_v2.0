{"text":"Disappointed in Naperville Just got back from Paris and loved the city. My husband and I were hugely disappointed in this hotel. The hotel is in a great neighborhood- Rue Cler and is convienent to restaurants , patisseries and The Eiffel Tower. We had booked hotel about six months in advance with a written confirmation from hotel. I e-mailed them prior to our arrival to reconfirm. Everything seemed to be on track. We were to stay four days at the beginning of our trip and a final night at the end after returning to Paris from Loire Valley. When we checked out after four days Iwas informed by Cedric that owed for five days. I said no we only stayed for four. He said you told me you were staying for five. I said thats right but this time we are only here for four at which point he pulled out my fax to them which clearly detailed the dates we were staying. Cedric was very mad and said he had a room he could not sell. Why is this my problem\/ He was the one who made the error in our dates. I told him repeatedly that we would be back on the 19th for a final night. I think he was so mad that he didnt pay attention to what I said to him very surly attitude. When we returned on the 19th we were told the hotel was full and no rooms despite my written confirmation. I was offered a free cruise on Seine and they managed to find another hotel for us albeit in a less concienent location. I was also told by Arnaund that is was my resonsibility eo schlep me own bags over to the new hotel. After I continued to protest he finally relentd and gave us 10 euro. Never recieved any apology from hotel-very bad customer service. I can net in good faith reccomend this property ","annotations":[]}
