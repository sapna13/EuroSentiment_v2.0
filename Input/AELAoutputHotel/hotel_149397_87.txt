{"text":"Fantastic Vacation for a great price! We stayed at the Bavaro Princess April 29th through May 6. It was our first time ever in Punta Cana. The resort grounds were absolutely beautiful and impeccably clean.We arrived late Tuesday night and after seeing our room (near the lobby) we immediately upgraded to the Platinum\/VIP package. HUGE difference in rooms - the new room was located steps away from the beach and a stone throw away from the actual Platinum lounge which offers premium liquors as well as movie rentals and free internet access. Snacks through out the day are also available in this area. The staff were phenomenal. Yes, there is a language barrier but this caused no frustration on our part, you make the most of it and everyone makes a good effort to try and help you and understand. Just remember, you are on vacation, in THEIR country. We read some bad reviews about this place - about the food being terrible, about bugs and musty odours... I can honestly say the food was fantastic everywhere we ate! The selection of fruit was mouth watering with sooo much flavour. The grilled lobster and shrimp at Chopin was excellent! The selection at the buffets was fantastic. Great variety of foods for breakfast, lunch and dinner. We never had any problems with any of the food at the many restaurants and buffets. I don't know what people were referring to when they complained about bugs and mosquitoes..yes we got some mosquito bites but you get those anywhere, especially after it rains...it certainly was not as bad or even close to what some people wrote. Our room never had that musty smell so I cannot comment...but is that not normal especially when its humid out? I think the problem is that when some people go away on vacation they forget that they are in a less developed country. I don't have anything negative to say about this resort. All the staff - from gardeners out in the morning tending to the flowers and trees to bartenders and maids, everyone always greeted us with a friendly welcoming smile. Johanny from check in was superb in ensuring we were content with our upgrade and called often to make sure we were happy. I would recommend the upgrade to anyone, for the room alone it was well worth it..never mind all the other perks you get with the upgrade such as bathrobes and slippers (soo comfy), cigars, 20 minute massage by the pool which was absolutely wonderful (they definately know how to massage) 1 hour of free snorkeling (they take you out on a boat - so don't pay for it if you are approached on the beach). You also get to eat at the neighbouring Princess resorts - which we never did as we were quite content with our resort. You also get Free room service 24 hours a day which we took advantage of quite a bit . Platinum staff made reservations for us at Licey (if you're not part of Platinum, you pay 30 dollars to eat here). Licey was an upscale restaurant with fantastic menu options. I had the lobster and it was amazing...The beach was absolutely breathtaking...powdery soft sand, no rocks whatsoever....the water...very refreshing and picturesque. Three of us (girls) traveled here and never found this place to be unsafe in any way. Maybe some people should stay off the mamajuana.... All in all, we had a fantastic time here. I'm not a fan of vacationing more than once at the same destination but would return back here in a heartbeat.Hope this review helps....remember, take the negative you read with a grain of salt, there is just no pleasing some people and I don't find it fair to do this place injustice. Relax and enjoy.....From the T Dot ","annotations":[{"endOffset":484,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":477},{"endOffset":484,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":477},{"endOffset":484,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":477},{"endOffset":1128,"mention":"Chopin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chopin_vodka"],"startOffset":1122},{"endOffset":1128,"mention":"Chopin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chopin_vodka"],"startOffset":1122},{"endOffset":1128,"mention":"Chopin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chopin_vodka"],"startOffset":1122}]}
