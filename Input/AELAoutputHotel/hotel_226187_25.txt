{"text":"The Most Luxe for the Least Price The Sonesta Coconut Grove is a great combination of quality, service and value. The Sonesta is comparable to other four star properties with little touches that lend a boutique flair. The lobby nor the restaurant nor the pool nor the fitness center are grand yet I found each more intimate and serene than more well known chain hotels.Our room was the Superior category, the smallest offered. If you planning to spend a lot of time in your room you may want to upgrade to the next category but we found it just fine. The bedding and the bed itself were extremely comfortable. The bath is modern and in good condition but simple. We did not have a flat screen TV as shown in some of the on line pictures but perhaps the upgraded categories offer that. Our rate included the oft-maligned continental breakfast. We found the French pastries and juice absolutely delicious. You can upgrade to a more substantial breakfast but the price difference did not seem worth it to us. Any and all service requests were honored the first time. We found the staff to be generally professional and congenial at the Front Desk, valet and Restaurant.Dollar for dollar you are going to get more hotel at a better price at the Sonesta Coconut Grove than South Beach or downtown. Coconut Grove has its own personality without quite as much insanity as South Beach. Unless you are doing the beach every day, Coconut Grove is a great alternative to South Beach or downtown. You have plenty of restaurants and shops within walking distance and even more within a five minute drive. You are ten minutes to downtown and twenty to South Beach. I would definately book the Sonesta again.
