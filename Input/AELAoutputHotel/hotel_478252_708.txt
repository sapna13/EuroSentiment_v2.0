{"text":"Miss it already! My husband and I just returned from our 1 week stay at the Bahia Principe Punta Cana. All I can say about our vacation is that it was wonderful!We stayed in building 60 which is part of the Gold Club. If I had to pay extra for it, I don't think that I would, however when we booked it was actually cheaper than any other section of the hotel. The mainhighlight for me for having booked this area of the hotel is that it is steps away from the beach which is a big plus for me!! The only perk that we received that we actually used was the free internet access in the gold club internet hut which is located near the bridge. You get 15 minutes per room per day which is good to keep in touch with loved ones back home. Yes, the resort is huge. But if you don't want to walk you can use the trolly which brings you everywhere. Don't let the size of the hotel intimidate you. It is very easy to get familiar with. Rememberthat there are 2 resorts here, BP Bavaro and BP Punta Cana. They are mirror images of each other. Something that I just found out today which I wish I had known beforeI booked!! DO NOT PAY VISA TO CALL HOME!!! I just checked my account and we made 2 phone calls for $40 each. Absolutely nuts. If I had known that before I went away, I would never have called home. Use the internet, it's free and quick!!! In Pueblo Principe they have an internet room for all hotel guests, that is cheaper to use than calling home, trust me!! Food was excellent. I cannot complain. Lots of variety and I am a very picky eater. Those of you who love meat - well you're in for a treat - many varieties. Those of you who are vegetarians - do not worry, lots for you too! I like to enjoy an ice cream at the beach when I'm hot and I found out that the only places where you can get ice cream during the day are the restaurants that are air conditioned (buffet or the specialtyrestaurants that are open for lunch). I wish I could have got it at the snack bar at the beach\/pool. You have to be with shirt and bottomon for the air conditioned restaurants or you will be kicked out.Huge language barrier at this resort...if you know any spanish speak it! Lots of Europeans here so if you know any language from there you'll be fine too. (I.e. Italian).The beach\/pool chairs - yes, you do have to play the towel game. I got up every day around 7-7:30am and I had no trouble finding a seat under an umbrella very close to the beach. If you don't care where you sit, then there are seats available all day long, just not in the shade. Word of advise, if you want to use the water sports - book them as soon as you arrive. We went to use the peddle boats one day and had to reserve them for 2 days later. Not what I've experienced on other AI trips. You must try the Japanese restaurant. Even if you don't like the food, you have to go for the experience. It was great!!! Again, I'm a picky eater and I was full when I left. Nighly entertainment needs improvement. I was quite disappointed withit. Being a 5 star the entertainment should be better. Anyway, that was my review. Overall, the resort is a 5 star. Don't listen to the negative reviews and go there and have fun.
