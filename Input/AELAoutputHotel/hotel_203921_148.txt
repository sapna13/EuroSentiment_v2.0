{"text":"A low cost gem! My wife and I stayed for three days during our honeymoon and the Hotel David was a great find. The location of the hotel is excellent and within walking distance of all the downtown Florence tourist sites including the Ponte Vecchio, the Duomo, the Uffizi, and the Accademia Gallery. I would advise having a pair of comfortable walking shoes if you plan to travel on foot, but it will help to burn off all the great Italian food! The Hotel David is very clean and the staff are quite helpful if you need some assitance in locating anything around the city. We were very happy with the large room and tiled shower that was big enough to accommodate a 'full sized' person. The room was air conditioned, which was a blessing during the warm weather in July. We initially requested the room with a balcony above the garden, but we found that the noise level was a bit high from the traffic outside (and the room smelled of cigarette smoke), so the staff relocated us to a very nice room on the interior of the hotel (no view, but nice and quiet). We especially liked the free happy hour that the hotel would put on every evening. Free red and white wine and light snacks were offered. We met some really nice folks from Ireland, Australia, and California during our stay as we all sipped wine in the garden. This was a nice added touch that allowed us to get to know the other guests at the hotel and learn about where they came from. The hotel also has a single Internet point that guests can use for no extra charge. Wireless internet is available if you need Internet access in your room. The complimentary breakfast in the morning is good for the price of the room. We had better breakfasts at other hotels, but we also paid significantly more for a nighly stay.We would definitely stay at the Hotel David again if we are lucky enough to visit Florence, which is a beautiful city that should not be missed. The Hotel David is economical, convenient, and clean. You won't be disappointed.
