{"text":"Lovely rooms in a quiet neighbourhood My husband and I stayed at the Bilderberg Garden for three nights in the week before Christmas. The total cost was √à√\u2020√ü?00 and we stayed in an executive room. The room was lovely, really clean and large, with modern furnishings and a huge bed, TV with many stations in english, CD player and seating area. Each evening a lady left us an apple each. The first night, the room was really hot and we couldn't get the air conditioning to work properly, but we mentioned it to the receptionist the next morning and when we returned in the evening it had been fixed. During the evening a staff member came to check that it was OK and brought us a card apologising for the inconvenience, and a box of chocolates, which was a pleasant surprise. Although we did not eat in the hotel restaurant, the menu was modern and not unreasonable for a special night at √à√\u2020√ü?9 for three courses. Many of the guests were obviously business people but we did not feel out of place, and the receptionist gave us a very helpful map and showed us the best places to go. In fact, that free map was more useful than many of the maps in the guide books as it contained tram routes, canal bus routes and shopping areas all on one page. It was a five minute walk to the tram stop and there were 8 trams an hour into the city centre - about a 15 min journey. We bought a three day tram ticket from the hotel and it was hassle-free after that. The hotel itself is in a leafy suburb just off an up-market shopping street and the area was very quiet although there were restaurants within walking distance from the hotel. I would stay here again. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":744,"mention":"chocolates","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":734}]}
