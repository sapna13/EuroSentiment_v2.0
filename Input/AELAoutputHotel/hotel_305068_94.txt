{"text":"The Under-Side of Hong Kong I'm certain that my experience is somewhat unique to my situation, and may seem foreign (excuse the pun) to those that don't fully understand the unspoken complexities of Hong Kong society. For background purposes, I'm a Chinese American that frequently travels to Hong Kong on business. Firstly, for those that don't know, it is generally understood by Chinese people (almost everywhere) that Hong Kong Chinese people employ discriminatory practices against other Chinese people. It sounds strange, I agree, and I'm not sure I believed it myself until I experienced it first-hand at the InterContinental. One morning, while sitting in their lobby and waiting for my driver, with Starbucks coffee in one hand and a scone in the other, I was told by hotel security that I was not allowed to eat or drink in the lobby waiting area. Already seems ridiculous doesn't it? I was told I had to sit in the lobby lounge. It seemed strange to me, as I wasn't the only person eating\/drinking in the waiting area, but I did notice that I was the only non-white person. I didn't think much more of the situation as my driver had arrived.The next morning, attempting to follow their rules, which somehow seemed only to apply to me, I sat and drank my coffee in the lobby lounge with my colleague (who happens to be white), who sat at the next table. Strangely enough, the hotel staff specifically approached me and told me that I was not allowed to drink coffee in their lobby lounge; the hotel staff completely ignored my colleague√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ violation. I was irate. Lucky for me... or perhaps for them... my colleague stepped in on my behalf and berated their hotel staff. That evening, I spoke to the manager of the hotel, who acknowledged the discriminatory treatment as something that they were dealing with and apologized for his staff.They've since sent me an apology letter; however, I still feel offended and compelled to express my disappointment, and expose the under-side of Hong Kong society. I'm sure many of you will not care as it will not affect you, but my feeling is discrimination is discrimination no matter how you spin it. Stay if you wish, but know that I have not had this experience at the Shangri-la or other hotels Kowloon.Oh, and I also had problems with the hotel water shutting off in the middle of my shower. For these prices, isn't one complaint too many?
