{"text":"Happy Holidays! After a great deal of trawling through lists and lists of hotels we decided to book The Library to celebrate my wifes 50th birthday and we were not disappointed. Yes it is quite expensive - we were there from Thanksgiving to 1st December so all hotels are a bit more expensive anyway but actually you save quite a bit on time and money by considering the following:-1. The hotel is centrally placed in midtown so if you're reasonably fit you can walk to most places(and therefore see and experience more of he city) and save money\/time in the process.2. The complimentary breakfast is excellent- great food to start the day.Most other hotels either don't provide this or charge for the privilege.3. As the hotel supplies coffee\/tea pastries etc., all day long we went out shopping say on 5th avenue and returned to the hotel a few hours later to recharge ourselves- again saves on costs4. The wine \/cheese in the evening was great- we'd often chat wth fellow guests and save another bundle of cash on pre dinner drinks\/hassle of finding a nice bar somewhere.We had a Junior King suite which was perfect for my wife and i and our 17 year old son was more than happy with a large sofa bed in the same room. The room was kept in pristine condition- immaculately clean,flat screen tv, luxurious bath\/shower and complimentary bottles of water .A couple of tips if you go to New York and you want a special message displaying to a loved one\/birthday treat is to phone Hersheys Times Square(or call in when you're there) and for $5 for 15 minutes they will display a message on the moving screen facing Times Square for all the world to see- My wife couldn't believe it when she saw the message about her birthday- we were lucky since as Hersheys was actually closed on Thanksgiving for $10 our message was shown from midnight the day before and all day Thursday.Another tip is try and book a helicopter flight- we used Helinyc.com who were excellent. Check the weather forecast before you go and enjoy some fantastic sights on a trip to remember. We booked the basic New Yorker trip costing about $150 each person for 15 minutes and again we were lucky as we had the helicopter to ourselves.The south seaport - pier 57 i think , near Brooklyn bridge is also good for shopping\/city views and reasonable restaurantsAs far as restaurants go we had a couple of OK meals at recommended places and they were quite expensive- Benjamins Steakhouse on 41st \/Madison ,Trattoria Trecolori on 47th\/Broadway and Padre Figlio near UN building on 44th\/2nd\/3rd ave. The best meal but again a bit expensive was at Salute- Madison and 39th- i don't mind paying a bit more for quality and this meal was superb.One word of warning going back to airport if you ask your hotel to book taxi- make sure you know how much the taxi is going to charge you ...this isn't a problem going to Manhattan from the airport since from JFK its around a fixed $60 incl tip\/tolls but going back they can try and charge you what they like. Our hotel told us our people carrier cost would be $88...i was OK with this but when we arrived at JFK the driver tried to charge us $150....after a little chat the driver accepted $88. One final point when arriving at JFK...DO NOT GET INTO ONE OF THE UNOFFICIAL CABS WHO MIGHT TRY TO LURE YOU WITH A CHEAPER DEAL ...when we were there we heard of cases of muggings\/tourists being taken to a different destination and made to give money from an ATM ...queue up and after a few minutes the attendant will get a yellow cab for you to take you SAFELY to your destination.All in all an unforgettable trip and we will return to this fantastic hotel and city.Happy Holidays!
