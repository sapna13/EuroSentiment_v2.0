{"text":"Terrible service - DO NOT STAY HERE I stayed at this hotel for five days last week and all I can say is if you have any other choice in Hong Kong, then take it! It started off badly - you cant check in before 2pm, so if you have an overnight flight and arrive at the hotel to want to take a much deserved nap, you will be told to come back after 2pm at the earliest!The rooms are tiny - i had a upgrade which only gave me a DVD player! If it was supposed to be for two people, I am not sure how you would get around the room without falling over each other.As it was a business trip, my company paid two days and and I paid the other two - however, you only get hotel points if you paid for it yourself - a real frustration if you are a businessman who collects hotel points and wants to use them for pleasure.Finally, when you check out, dont pay the final bill in US dollars - the rate outside the hotel is 7.70, inside the hotel its 7.17!When I asked to see the Manager, I was told he would call me within 20 mins - he didnt. When I asked him to call me on my mobile on the way to the aiport - he didnt...and now I have asked him to email me - and you guessed it...no email!There are plenty of other fanstastic hotels to stay in Hong Kong - I strongly suggest you give this one a miss - unless you like to pay for terrible service, be ripped off at check out and enjoy tiny spaces!
