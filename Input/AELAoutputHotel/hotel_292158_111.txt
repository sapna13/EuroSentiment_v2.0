{"text":"Strong 4* Resort We stayed at this hotel from April 20 - April 27th. I would rate this resort a 4*. We stayed at the Majestic Colonial last year and we found that resort to be a 5*. The flight was great, and was on time both ways !! The flight attendants were more than friendly and offered great service. When we arrived at the airport there was lots of confusion. The signature rep was sending everyone to one corner instead of telling us what bus to get on. This was very frustrating for everyone. Once we arrived at the hotel, check-in went very quickly. We received a room in building 4000, (oceanview) which was very nice. The weather was very good but it did rain on two occassion for the entire afternoon.This resort is very large so be ready to wait for the train. The Hemmingway Bar is beautiful. This bar is located behind the Bavaro Lounge and serves great drinks. We had no problem getting into the restaurants at 7:00 p.m. The buffets offered a great variety of food as well.The beach is beautiful. I have to say that after being in Dominican Republic 8 times this was the smallest beach area I have seen and yes there is a problem getting lounge chairs if you get to the beach after 9:00. The 3 pools were well maintained and very refreshing. Now the negative;My husband tried booking golf on several occassions and each time, he received a different answer from the guest service representatives. He was informed that there were tournaments on the course when there wasn't tournaments and the price to golf, changed daily. After all of this, he decided not to golf. The Signature Representative at the hotel was not very helpful. If you asked him a question, he made you feel like you should know the answer and would look away when answering. Thankfully, we would find the answers to our questions on our own without having to approach him. Overall, we would rate this resort a 4*. We might consider returning to this hotel again. Have a great trip !! ","annotations":[]}
