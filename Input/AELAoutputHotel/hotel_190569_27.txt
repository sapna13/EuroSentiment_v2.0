{"text":"Perfect location, elegant surroundings Perfectly located opposite the Prado Museum, and less than 5 minutes' walk from the Parque del Buen Retiro (Madrid's Botanic Gardens). Lobby not as dramatic and impressive as I would have expected for such a grand exterior, but I simply loved La Rotonda, where light meals\/refreshments can be partaken under an enormous and spectacular stained glass dome. Breakfast spread typical 5 star hotel spread. I paid extra for an exterior facing room, with a view of the surrounding streets, but you have to cough up even more $$$ for a view of the fountain and roundabout in front of the hotel. My room was very comfortable and elegantly furnished, although the old-fashioned TV (i.e. no plasma or LCD) was surprising for a hotel of this standard and considering the prices charged. If you're lazy or unfit, request for a room near one of the 2 banks of elevators, as the corridors are LONG! Service overall was ok, not overly friendly. I appreciated the gym on the top floor, which offers great views of downtown Madrid, and for a hotel, it was decently equipped, although the dumbells were rather limited. I had booked and prepaid my accommodation via a third party website, yet the hotel still billed my credit card, and, 3 weeks after my stay, is still dragging its feet in refunding me, in spite of my providing all evidence showing that I had prepaid it. The 2 staff with whom I dealt (prior to checking out) about this issue seemed disinterested, and were very insistent that the hotel had done nothing wrong, and that it was obviously the customer's mistake. No effort made to check with the website through which I had booked, they simply stared at their darn computers and told me that I was wrong. Hey, how about some customer service and goodwill here?Aside from the debacle above, I highly recommend this hotel, for its location and elegance, but service a bit iffy, ","annotations":[]}
