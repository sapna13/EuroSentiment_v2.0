{"text":"A Great Little Find We stayed for a week in this lovely hotel, and we would definitely recommend it to others. When booking we requested a twin room with a balcony, and this turned out to be a good move, as we looked in to some other rooms that were not as big as ours. Our room was large with a lovely (little) balcony looking out onto the quiet little street that Gravina is situated on. Even with the door to the balcony open we slept through the night, noise was not an issue. The air-con was so good that we were able to sleep with blankets covering us, even though it never went below 22degrees all week!! The room itself had everything that we needed for a week long stay (although we did notice no tea and coffee making facilites, we are not hot drinks people!) with comfy beds, a big spacious bathroom and a flat screen tv. The room was cleaned every day.Also, the hotel staff were very friendly, greeting us with champagne on arrival and always giving us helpful advice when we asked. The maid was also lovely, and always said hello when we went by! A small piece of advice for anyone that ends up in room 106- the toilet flush will only work when the bathroom light above the mirror is on! We did not have breakfast in the hotel, because we were on quite a strict budget so paid for room-only, but we did have a drink in the bar one night, beware it is rather over-priced!! However we bought breakfast things and drinks from the supermarket two doors down, which is owned by a really nice guy who we made friends with! Aside from that, the hotel is friendly, clean and comfortable, how a 3* should be. Of course if you are expecting luxuries or a honeymoon break then it is possibly not the place, but for a weeks sight seeing in a great location, the hotel greatly exceeded our expectations.
