{"text":"Great spot for a relaxed vacation This a great hotel--service was wonderful, people friendly and beach amazing! We read all the bad reviews and were a tad worried--remember that this hotel houses more or less 2000 people ( which sounds like a lot but they're well spread out) Some people were unhappy--that will happen anywhere you go! We asked for an ocean view , paid extra for it (about an extra $100 each but a great investment)and got it in building # 6 which is about 50 yards from the beach. The room was pristeen clean, we always had hot water and a turn down service with fresh cold water to drink (everything on the resort is done with purified water--you can't drink from the taps--but other than that the fruits, vegies and plentiful drinking water is available) Presidente is the beer of choice as were many other drinks, inclusive.If you like to chill on the beach, walk the pristeen white soft sands and relax, this hotel\/beach will do it for you. It's small enough not to be overwhelming and is charmingly laid out. The main buffet restaurant has enthusiastic waiters\/hostesses and the food is good---with a fair amount of variety. The Italian (Michelangelos) is the best a la carte, followed by the Asian. We learned how to snorkel in the pool (a great lesson) and took advantage of the plentiful land\/water exercise classes. The staff are sexy eye candy and full of fun and mischief. We took the tour of the Marinarium ($83 US each) which is a 1\/2 day snorkling and tour adventure--very cool --you get to snorkel in a conservation area with Nurse sharks and stingrays--coral and coloured fish. The crew ( Hola Captain Sharkey !) were full of fun, and the music made you want to dance (Bob Marley, etc) and the crew danced with the passengers. They were having as much fun as we were.This was our first trip to Dominican. If you go off resort, you do see the poverty, and there is a lot of renewal and construction going on outside--the Dominicans are beautiful people and know that tourists only help their economy. There is an artisan flea market about 100 yards from the front gate...you can bargain for everything from t shirts to rum, jewellery etc. There is another one that's an hour walk up the beach, we didn't go but heard it was great. Be willing to bargain--it's a game, but be fair and pleasant and you'll have fun. Back to the hotel-- Bring lots of $1 tip money and be generous--bring extra dollar store items for your maids--spread our Canadian wealth around and you will be rewarded with big smiles and muchos gracious. Bring a spanish\/english dictionary and learn some basic words like--por favor--which is please. Go. Enjoy. This is a nice hotel.
