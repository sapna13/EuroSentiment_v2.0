{"text":"Nice property, friendly staff, large rooms I checked into the Holiday Inn Express following a cruise. The hotel is mere blocks from the airport with zero of the noise! The property is about a 20-25 minute drive from the cruise terminal. Upon arrival at the hotel, the front desk was extremely helpful, friendly and welcoming. I was checked-in within 3 minutes and my room was ready at 10:45am. I inquired about a late check-out, and was extended a 2pm checkout with ease. The agent also pointed out a free high-speed internet terminal with printer near the front desk which was perfect for printing a boarding pass. There's also a small sundry shop open 24 hours. Enroute to the room, I discovered vending, ice and washer\/dryer machines - a huge convenience. (Wash $1.50, Dry $1).The rooms are spacious 2-room suites witha cozy sitting area with a tv and fold-out sofa, comfortable working desk and coffee table. The middle of the room offers a kitchenette-like area with a large fridge, microwave, coffee maker, and plateware upon request from the front desk. Across from the kitchen is a reasonably-sized bathroom with the amenities you'd expect. The only negative feedback would be the need for some light preventative maintenance such as caulking and grout. The room (and most importantly the bathroom) were extremely clean.The bed was a tad on the firm side of comfortable and offered an assortment of pillows (2 soft, 2 firm - and labeled as such right on the pillowcase! Cool!) Although there's no on-demand movies, they have over 70 television channels. There was a LodgeNet controller for videogames, but no LodgeNet menu. Wierd.Although I did not partake, the property offers a complimentary hot breakfast with eggs, bacon, pastries etc. A nice perk!In the surrounding area, there's not much. A 10-minute walk takes you to a Denny's, Taco Bell, Jack In The Box, a diner and an awesome BBQ restaurant called Grand Roaster which was quite the dining experience. Check it out. Also, a little dive of a casino, the 'Silver Dollar' with only table games - no slots. I won $850!Overall, this was a great experience at the property and I would certainly return.
