{"text":"Time for an update and to stop nickel and diming you to death I booked the hotel because it is the only Western hotel chain next to the Zona Rosa. The Zona Rosa is the gay section of Mexico City and has bars, rest., clubs, etc. The hotel is typical of a 3 star Shearton. If you book a room with a king bed expect a very small room. I moved into a double bed room which was huge compared to the king bed room. The carpet and furniture are dated and worn. As a Platinum member I was upgraded to a Platinum floor which means I√à?√¨m able to eat in the club on the 18th floor which saves money for breakfast and dinner. (You cannot wear shorts in the club room they will send you back to change) The club is very nice and so is the staff. There are a few drawbacks to the hotel. FIrst there is no sound proofing between the walls or the outside. Therefor if you are visiting over a weekend you will hear disco music if your room faces the Zona Rosa so avoid these rooms. Unfortunately these rooms have the best veiw of the Angel. You will also hear the other adjoining guests in their room and especially out in the hall. I√à?√¨ve been awoken daily by doors slamming from other guests. The Air Conditioner does not cool very well, especially late night so you will awake feeling wet\/clamy. If you are a person who likes it cold avoid this hotel. I also do not appreciate the cost for the gym, coffee, etc. Unless you are a platinum starwood member I would sooner spend the money at the Marco Polo hotel. It has a better location and appears nicer. Have fun.
