{"text":"Nice Stay at the Langham Place We chose the Langham Place after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor...and we were not disappointed. We spent 2 nights at the Langham Place last weekend.We took the Airport Shuttle and reached the Hotel at around 12 Noon. I had booked an experience package and we were given a room immediately on arrival, even though check-in time was 3 PM.We were offered cold towels, and were presented with Welcome Drink vouchers and a complimentary Mongkok Guide book. (Much helpful), and were given a room on the 26th floor. Room was small but well equipped, view from the room was nothing to write home about. We did try the room service that night and the food was excellent, compliments to the chef... However we preferred to walk across the lobby and into the Langham Place Mall food court for the remaining days. I would recommend the food court. The food is cheaper and they have quite a large variety on offer.The Bar was quite a decent place to lounge around in, DJ early in the evening and then a live band later in the evening.Computers with high speed internet connections were available complimentary for guests near the Lounge. I used them to check in online for my return flight. I would however have loved it if they had provided free internet access in the rooms.We had booked the Hong Kong Island tour through the Hotel and the tour organized was excellent. Available: Large Plasma TV, DVD Player (However no DVDs), Cisco IP Phone, useful to check your account, however didn't find any use for it other than that. What sets the Hotel apart is the staff. They go out of the way to be of service. They even allowed me a late checkout , no questions asked. I would just stay here for the service. However I would expect more value for money.
