{"text":"Great place, great price Just come back form a four night stay at Royal plaza on Scotts.Location √à√\u2020\u2022?the location is perfect, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ very central and great if you like to shop. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ about a 5 min walk to the tube station. There are shopping malls, shops, places to eat as soon as you step out of the hotel lobby.Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?for the first two nights we stayed on the 11th floor, the room was nice but did not have a bath. That was not an issue. The room was very clean and drinks were free in the mini bar.The bed was a good size and comfortable.Stayed in a club room for the next tow nights and the room was more or less the same with a larger bath room that consisted of a bath tub.Price √à√\u2020\u2022?very good for location, the hotel is located infront of the hyatt and about √à√¥√ú the price.Staff √à√\u2020\u2022?the staff were friendly and helpful. Check-in\/out √à√\u2020\u2022?did not have any issues with check in, would advise you to check your booking and see what it includes prior to check in as we were initially told that the room rate did not include breakfast\/meal but then told it was by another member of staff.Room service √à√\u2020\u2022?breakfast was 25 mins late and cold on arrival.Hotel restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022?wow, had dinner there one night, buffet√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√ì√µ√\u2022resh lobster, crab, sushi, roast meats, Thai food, Italian food, Indonesian dishes√à√\u2020\u2022?.the list goes on. Could not fault it what so ever. For the price that you pay (150 SGD for two people), the quality was great. Just as good as an a la cart menu.Breakfast, was nice, nothing special really.
