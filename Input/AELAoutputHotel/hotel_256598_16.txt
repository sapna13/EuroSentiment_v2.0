{"text":"Not a too bad! I'd stay again. I am a frequent travler for both business and pleasure and I've stayed in the Sydney CBD several times. Overall, the Mercure was a pretty decent experience considering my stays in the Sydney CBD hotels in this price and 3-4 star range. I paid $170\/night for a double room, which is not bad for this area of Sydney. I am an American who now lives permantly in Australia and I have to say that from an American perspective Australian hotels are generally more expensive and smaller than most U.S. hotels. Mercure hotels are similar in quality to Holiday Inn Express's in my opinion. Due to concerns about street noise (yes I'm high maintenance because I'm a light sleeper) I had requested a room on an upper floor and was disappointed when I checked in and I was put on the 4th floor. However, the room was quiet and clean (and I am VERY picky when it comes to cleanliness). The amenities in this hotel are very basic, but high speed Internet access in the rooms, comfortable bed, cable TV, good hair dryer and iron\/ironing board, small refrigerator, writing table and the shower is good etc. It is clean and comfortable and the staff are generally friendly and helpful. The location is great as it is right by the train station and very close to UTS, Paddy's Markets, Haymarket, Chinatown etc. There are TONS of great China town restraunts nearby and it is only a few blocks to great shopping. You can comfortably walk to lots of attractions from here. To summarize, if you're looking for a luxury accomodation this is definitely not it, but if you're looking for a comfortable, conveniently located and clean hotel then the Mercure Sydney will meet your needs.
