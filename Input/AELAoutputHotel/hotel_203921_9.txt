{"text":"A True Gem Generally I find the reviews on TripAdvisor over generous - a normal, solid hotel tends to be reviewed as the best, extraordinary and mixed up with our overall feelings of having had a good vacation, rather than something truly being an exceptional hotel. I myself am to blame for this as anyone and have generally avoided reviewing hotels now because of it.However, after just returning from a month in Italy, and staying at a number of places, both average and better, there was one hotel that really stood out, and merits the praise that it has been given.Hotel David is a very, very good hotel and worth your consideration when visiting Florence. It is not perfect, nor is it perfect for every type of traveler. If you want super luxury, Ritz Carlton accommodation, modernist, cutting edge architecture and electronic amenities, this is not your place. This is an affordable hotel costing less than 200 euro a night that has the right service to cost ratio.Instead, it is a very comfortable, carefully maintained villa near the Arno in a true neighborhood just outside of Florence's center, about a 20 minute walk away. The management clearly knows their clientele and has made some nice adjustments to meet their needs. It has larger, comfortable rooms with high ceilings, parquet floors, and characteristic 19th century styling and furnishing. (And you'll hear the upstairs guest footsteps if you're on a lower floor, but such is life with wood floors) The breakfast is quite good and very substantial, somewhat less typically Italian - it's more German in terms of selection and size. Fruit, cereals, yoghurt, fresh croissants and breads, meat, cheese, a savory tart, etc. in addition to both brewed coffee and espresso. There is a common room and patio, where each evening snacks and wine are offered in a comfortable setting.For a traveler like me, who tires of the tourist treadmill of cheap trinket shops, restaurants with lousy food, no locals and tourist menus in 5 languages, this hotel and its neighborhood is a welcome respite. It combines a homey (but not cheap and tired) ambience with nice touches of familiarity so foreigners feel welcome -- various foreign language newspapers, satellite TV with CNN and BBC, an excellent multilingual staff, free wireless network and free parking. There are a number of excellent restaurants in the surrounding neighborhoods, and the staff is quite helpful at pointing them out. They are true neighborhood gems, not touristy schlock. The staff is really outstanding. Multi-lingual, well trained, and truly helpful. They are ever ready w\/ maps, suggestions, bus tickets, etc. So many thanks to the staff and management for a lovely, comfortable stay - this is a hotel worth keeping in mind by the independent traveler when in Florence.
