{"text":"Good Hotel We have just returned from a three night stay at The Monopol . Check in was quick and efficient and the guy on reception was very friendly and informed us if we needed any help\/info about the hotel or the city in general that he would be happy to help us, he recommended a great restaurant in the old town and told us of a great neighbourhood in the north east of frankfurt, along the north of berger strasse that had some non-touristy shops and cheap boutiques. There are (from what I gathered) 4 male reception staff and 2 female staff One of the male staff is very unfriendly, as is one of the female staff, bith seem to be more interested in finishing their shift than dealing with clients. The room (twin room) was spacious, very clean and the beds were comfortable, free minibar was a bonus, (the door of the cupboard where the minibar was fell off when we opened it and we rang reception, within 15 mins the door was repaired.) Bathroom was very clean and there was an abbundance of hot water all day.The buffet breakfast was great (bread\/rolls, cold meat, scrambled eggs, bacon and sausages and tea\/coffee\/juice)The restaurant was ok. food was a bit pricey but of good quality. The only downside is that it took over 30 minutes for our starter to arrive (we would have left only we were very hungry and to tired to go elsewhere), but when it arrived it was fab.The location as mentioned in previous review has its pros and cons, its across from the south exit of the main train station but in the red light area, ( the main problem in the area is not actually that its a red light area but that its full of drug dealers and addicts so be careful at night.)Overall, The hotel was very reasonable for the level of service provided and I would recommend it to anyone. In my opinion its definetly the best within its price range.Ps. for anyone whos travelling by ryanair fron Hahn Airport (which is a 1hour 40 minute drive from the city) The shuttle bus for Hahn airport is located at the end of the carpark to the left of the hotel, It costs 12 each way.
