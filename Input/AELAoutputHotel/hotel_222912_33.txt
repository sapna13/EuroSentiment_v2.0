{"text":"Quite good hotel - Excellent location The hotel was quite good and the location magnificent.We booked a twin (double) room and stayed 5 nights. We got room 64 which was located on the 6th floor looking at the back alley of the hotel. As a result the room was very quiet (we did not even hear the bells of Saint-Nicolas du Chardonnet church which was located right opposite to the hotel - something that seemed to bother other reviewers in Trip Advisor). The bedroom had double-glazed windows and air-conditioning of a very good quality.The bedroom was relatively small but it was very clean and recently refurbished (note: not so small though by Paris or London standards). The bed mattress was excellent. The bathroom (with shower) was exceptionally clean, good in size and fully equipped.Service was excellent (we got in contact with five different employees at the reception - everyone of them spoke English and were very helpful)The location is magnificent to say the least.Very near there are shops, caf√ã√\u2022√ñs, bistros, brasseries and restaurants etc. Also it is very near or near to Paris' main attractions (Notre Dame, the Louvre, Latin Quarter, Boulevard Saint-Germain, Muse d' Orsay, The Eiffel Tower etc.).There is an excellent boolangerie (bakery) only a few meters from the hotel (it is called Eric Kayser and is located at 8 rue Monge: turn left as you go out of the hotel and a few meters down turn left again and you are in rue Monge). It has excellent croissants and other goodies.Try a stroll through Rue des Ecoles [fist street as you turn right getting out of the hotel] - and try La petite P√ã√\u2022√ñrigourdine on 39, Rue des √ã√\u2022√ñcoles for some excellent and rather cheap French food - beware though the menu is only in French and written on a whiteboard).You can also try some of the numerous establishments found on the nearby Saint-Germain and Saint-Michel boulevards (most of them have English menus).For an excellent dinner at quite good prices you can try Le Petit Prince de Paris it is located at 12, Rue Lanneau (quite near to the hotel - 3 to 4 blocks away and off Rue des Ecoles - better to find it on a map though or at http:\/\/maps.google.com\/).The metro stop is only two blocks away from the hotel (station Maubert - Mutualit√ã√\u2022√ñ at Boulevard Saint-Germain).Tickets can be used also at buses and RER trains cost:1,60 Euro per ticket, but is a better idea either to buy a carnet of ten tickets at a price of about 11 euros (that is 1.1 per ticket) or even better to buy a Paris-visite card (unlimited travel for 1, 2, 3 or 5 days at 8,50 - 14 - 9 or 27,50 euros per person - see details at: http:\/\/www.ratp.info\/informer\/anglais\/paris_visite.phpAll these tickets can be bought at all Metro stations (in every station there are employees where you can buy them - besides vending machines).Try to use the buses if you can (they have an excellent online system of letting you know the itineraries and the waiting time in every bus stop). Buses are quite fast and you can also see a lot of Paris by traveling on them. Otherwise try the Metro.In concluding we had a very comfortable stay, at a good price an in an a more than excellent location.I would strongly recommend this hotel to everyone.
