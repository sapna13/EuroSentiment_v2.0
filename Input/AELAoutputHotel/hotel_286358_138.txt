{"text":"Plaza Mayor was a good deal and location! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in August - We had a very nice stay and recommend it to others looking for a clean hotel, nice bathroom, and good location for sightseeing!We arrived at Barajas airport and took the metro to the Sol Station (3 changes  45 mins) for a couple of euros. Then we walked to the hotel by going through the actual Plaza Mayor diagonally and found our hotel on a corner. We had easy access to all of the museums by 10-15 min walk on foot and found plenty of food close by. Best of the trip was finding Retiro Park 10 min from the hotel on foot and spending the day on a boat relaxing. Also, the Atocha train station was 15 min on foot, so we took a high speed train to Toledo as a side trip.The hotel itself was clean and staff were friendly. They are on duty 24 hrs\/day and buzz you in after dark. The hotel is quaint, with some charm. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ realize there was an elevator initially but there is one and it helps when you are on the 4th floor. Our room was extremely clean and equipped with the essentials √à√\u2020\u2022?Beds were firm, as was to be expected. Air conditioning worked very well. The bedroom was plain, but the bathroom was updated, modern, and very clean! The towels were always fresh and were big. We were pleased that the water was hot and the water pressure could be set anywhere from low to peel off skin high. Breakfast isn't included but you could purchase the buffet in the lobby for 8 euros if you were hungry; otherwise, there were cheap coffee\/pastry alternatives within 5 mins of the hotel.
