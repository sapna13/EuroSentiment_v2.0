{"text":"RE: Not for the discerning traveller We arrived in Barcelona on the 23rd December 2006. We booked to stay in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥otel B√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√∏√â\u201A√á¬®√ä√Æ√ëescribed as a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áoutique style hotel√à√\u2020\u2022?that had come highly recommended by many travellers who had stayed there. Upon our arrival we were impressed by the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor but surprised to find the place dark and somewhat devoid of life. We were greeted with a nervous laugh from the receptionist who tried to make light of the fact that we were one of the few guests staying in the hotel. √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬£ever mind√à√\u2020\u2022? we said in true British fashion, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢here√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ always the pool√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√∏√â\u201A√á¬®√ä√±?\u201A√á¬®√ä?√£t√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ closed for repairs√à√\u2020\u2022?she replied. √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u2022h well√à√\u2020\u2022? we retorted, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢here√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ still the sauna√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√∏√â\u201A√á¬®√ä√±?\u201A√á¬®√ä?¬¢hat√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ closed too√à√\u2020\u2022?she replied and laughed nervously again. We had e-mailed the hotel beforehand and explained how much we were looking fwd to using these facilities but at no time did they make mention of such repairs. We checked into our room, which was well appointed and clean. We relaxed for a little while and then headed down to the hotel bar, only to find it closed (at 10pm). The receptionist quickly urged one of the staff to open up and serve us a drink. At this point we still managed to maintain our composure and thought we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° head out into the city to find a bar. We walked for 2 minutes down the road and stumbled upon a bar that we later found to be unsafe. Given the limited facilities in the hotel (all we had was a room) and the safety factor in the local area we decided to cut short our stay. ","annotations":[]}
