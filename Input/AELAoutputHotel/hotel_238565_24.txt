{"text":"The Best Little Place in Amsterdam! One of the huge bonuses of this place is its handy location. You just hop on a train from the airport, and the hotel is visible from the train station. You can get there within 2 minutes! It is also located right in the heart of Amsterdam, within walking distance of everything a tourist would want to see. The staff were helpful and friendly, allowing us to stow our luggage until our room was ready (we arrived at 7.30am Sunday morning due to our flight!). Despite jetlag we went straight to the Anne Frank Huis and were first in the queue for when it opened at 9am! The rest of Amsterdam was clearly still sleepy from revelry the night before!The room was very small but quite adequate for a short stay. The bath room was modern although strangely designed in that the shower water went everywhere and almost out onto the carpet. The first shower I took almost flooded the bathroom (due to a block in the drain) but help was sought and the problem speedily handled by the management. I wouldn't advise elderly or disabled people staying here, however. The stairs were very narrow and very steep (much like the rest of Amsterdam) and we had to climb up them to our bedroom. It was very warm when we stayed so we just turned the fan on and opened the windows. There was no street noise at all and we slept very well. The breakfast was very good and prepared us well for our busy days. I think people who criticise the breakfast would do well to recall that it is complimentary and that in most other countries this would not have been complimentary.Overall, it was a great stay and I would definitely stay there again without hesitation!
