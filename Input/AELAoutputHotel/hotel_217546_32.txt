{"text":"Not bad at all I don't mean to damn with faint praise -- we booked the Holiday Inn Beacon Hill for a very reasonable rate through Hotwire, and we were not at all disappointed. The location of the hotel is great -- convenient to Charles Street, Beacon Hill, and not far from the Common, Quincy Market, and downtown. We got lucky and found a legal street parking space at 6pm, so we were good for the night.Inside, the hotel is perfectly satisfactory. The facade is new, but a quick study and you get the program: recent facelift on 1970s property. This held true throughout our stay. The lobby is pleasant but small, with low ceilings. The elevators are older but have been face-lifted (they're still very slow, though). The hallways are fine -- dressed up but still narrow and low. And the room, which was comfortably appointed enough, feels like an older, smaller room with nicer finishes. The bathroom was, however, eensy -- which made the whole thing feel small for a family of four when it came time to get ready in the morning.A couple minor glitches in our particular room: The TV cable was out altogether, the wireless connection seemed to bounce randomly, and the beds (which were on the harder side of firm) weren't attached to the headboard, so if two people sat on the foot of the bed at once (we did, several times), the whole bed tips up alarmingly.Overall - a decent hotel for a good price -- conveniently located, satisfactory quality. You could do a lot worse in Boston. I am not sure you can do a lot better for the money.
