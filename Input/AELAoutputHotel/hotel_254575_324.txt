{"text":"Great Family Hotel We were returning from Nairobi, Kenya from seven weeks at a children's home and wanted to stay in London for a few days to relax and have a vacation before we returned to America. It was our first trip to London. We booked the Luna and Simone hotel sight unseen based on tripadvisor reviews and we really enjoyed our stay there. Everything about the place especially the friendly service is excellent. While we were there the story of the plot to smuggle explosives onto aircraft at Heathrow broke and many questions about our return flight occurred. The owners were very helpful in calming concerns about staying extra days and our return flight back to California.  If you look at the list of top London hotels, you will notice they are all over $200 a night with most over $400 and $500. We picked the hotel mainly on price and were amazed at what a great value the Luna and Simone is. We had a small, but very clean and tidy room on the third floor which involved several flights of stairs which we didn't mind. The shower worked well, the bed was comfortable, and there was coffee and tea on the desk. The ambience of the hotel including paint job, paintings, carpet, etc. is clean, neat, beautiful, and well organized. All of the staff including the wife of one of the owners and the son were friendly, helpful, courteous and pleasant. We enjoyed having dinner at the Italian restaurant, Sole Mio, on the corner as well as the Mekong Vietnamese restaurant also around the corner. I was able to walk down to see Westminster Abbey, the Parliament, and Big Ben in about half an hour to forty five minutes. The breakfast was of OJ, egg, bacon, and beans as well as toast and coffee was delicious and filling. We will stay there again if we ever make it back to London and would highly recommend the place to anyone who is looking for a great, great hotel value in London ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1104,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1098},{"endOffset":1112,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1109},{"endOffset":1421,"mention":"Mio","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MiO"],"startOffset":1418},{"endOffset":1421,"mention":"Mio","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/MiO"],"startOffset":1418},{"endOffset":1582,"mention":"Ben","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bens_De_Luxe_Delicatessen_&_Restaurant"],"startOffset":1579},{"endOffset":1691,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1686},{"endOffset":1702,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1696},{"endOffset":1691,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1686},{"endOffset":1702,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1696},{"endOffset":1691,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1686},{"endOffset":1702,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1696},{"endOffset":1691,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1686},{"endOffset":1702,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1696},{"endOffset":1691,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1686},{"endOffset":1702,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1696}]}
