{"text":"Honest Review from and Honest Person We were at Natura Park from March 15 - 22 - 2008. On arriving at the resort it took us minutes to check in. We headed for our room and right behind us came our luggage. Our room was excellent, clean and smelling very fresh with fresh flowers throughout. Everything in the room was as it should be in any 4 star resort, had no problems with anything, the AC worked great.Room maid was very accomadating as far as providing us with extra coffee, cream, sugar. Mini bar was fully stocked everyday without request, and our room was clean and fresh daily. And yes you can have everything in the mini bar No Extra Charges.Food: Being there for 8-days we were able to make reservations at 3 of the restaurants, Seafood, Steak, Pasta. Reservations were quick and easy. Food and service at these restaurants were excellent, could not ask for better service or food.Buffet: If you could't find something you liked it was your own falt.There were different meals every day and night, and the foods were very good.Grounds: We found the grounds to be exceptional, maintained daily. The workers were always busy keeping the ground very well groomed,Pool: Nice size, very clean. You do need to arrive early around 8:30 in order to get a lounge chair.Beach: Very clean, yea some seeweed but cleaned up immediately by workers.Lounges  Entertainment: Found to be very interactive with the crowd, people were having a great time with it. Constant service at your table to bring you drinks.Excursions: Plenty to pick from, we did Reef Explorer and Zip-Lines. Had a blast at both, from the bus ride there to the bus ride back to the resort. Talked to others that did other excursions and they all had a wonderful day.Public Bathroom in resort: Spotless, fresh flowers, all shining marble, beautiful.
