{"text":"Jack of all Trades - Master of None? This was our first trip to the Caribbean and our first 'All Inclusive'. To date most of our trips are bespoke touring\/ stay as you go, so our expectations were wide open. The hotel was great value for money (2adults 1kid 1infant worked out at about $70 each per person per night), clean, well maintained, and given there are 2200 employees a very friendly staff. The resort is huge and well manicured making walking about a pleasure, or take one of the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬∂ne a minute√à√\u2020\u2022?hop on buses to get about. There are some great idiosyncrasies about the place; firstly you are strongly encouraged to book restaurants on the first day and yet the four we went to were only two thirds full. We managed to walk straight into one (Gourmet) with a few smiles and some fast talking so it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ worth being a little pushy. Secondly, the maids pick the flowers adorning the sidewalks which you will then find embossed into a towel sculpted as a swan when your room is cleaned (which is I guess why sometimes they aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ cleaned until quite late in the day). Third, the day\/night entertainment is David Brentesque at best, the pool side arm-wrestles to the Bahia Principe theme tune, or Micheal Jackson cameo concert. None of it seems too intrusive though if it is not your thing. Lastly quirky √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√ªolden club\/ diamond club√à√\u2020\u2022?is a nice idea but just adds confusion, although if you are a sucker for room service, go Golden! Highlights. The beach area is fantastic, it does get crowded right by the resort but it is very clean, lots of shady palm trees and even an ominous shipwreck out on the reef. √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022?ueblo Principe√à√\u2020\u2022?is a nice idea that adds a focal point for nightlife (without leaving the resort), bars, casino, boutiques, more shows. The buffet offers a great variety and to be honest is as good if not better than most of the A La Carte. They have also done a good job at trying to keep the food √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬∞ust made√à√\u2020\u2022?(see TripAdvisor reviews from 2005 if you want to know what I am talking about!) with BBQs, Carvery√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, eggs cooked to order, fruit prepared fresh. The rooms are a good size, cool (remember to shut your balcony door properly or the AC will switch off), clean, good bathrooms, with balcony√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ overlooking the imaculate and pretty grounds.Travel Tips. We booked the hotel direct and asked about transfers. They agreed to pick us up\/ drop us off as part of the deal which was a nice touch, no cab negotiations or tour buses just a driver waiting to whisk us away. Spanish √à√\u2020\u2022?speaking even a little (show the effort) goes a long way to getting what you need. At the very least check back for understanding before walking away. MiniBar √à√\u2020\u2022?only has 2 beers and a few bottles of water\/coke. The drinks in the main lobby area are generally a little better than those 'poolside'. Tip the maid on the first day if you want it well stocked! Avoid busy check in\/out times (just ask the hotel in advance) as the process can be convoluted. Given its size and that it is an all inclusive it will probably never fully satisfy everyone but they certainly want to try. If you are unhappy with any part of your stay be sure to tell them and given them the chance to rectify. (A side note to Quality Mangers out there; whenever we called for something from our room (say extra towels), they not only delivered quickly, but a few minutes later someone would call to confirm we received exactly what we had asked for. This was a nice touch something often lacking in other hotels and other businesses!)Hope this is useful to someone. Thanks to those who wrote the reviews we used to book our trip!
