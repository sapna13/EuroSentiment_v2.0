{"text":"Good Hilton in lively neighbourhood We, a family of 5, stayed here in 2 rooms, 4013+4014, for 2 nights on HHonors points.Checkin was without problems. Only disappointing to hear that only the HHonors card holder gets a complementary breakfast. However he can invite 1 guest. This forced us to send our kids across the street to get a breakfast....... $26 without taxes is too expensive....The room is large and has a nice plasma. In our room however there was no remote control, and channel 4 NBC to watch the Olympics was not very clear. The beds are very good, nice and soft. I don't like those hard ones you'll find in most hotels.Breakfast is ok, although I'm used to have a much larger choice in the Hiltons I visit. Staff over there could be a bit more friendly as well.I asked the concierge for the NYC official City guide, but they don't have it. Instead of saying that they don't have it, they everytime (I asked twice) told me that they were already gone......Annoying as well are the persons next to the elevator trying to sell a Hilton time share. Ok, you get 500 HHonors point for listening to them, but further I would not go, although they make nice promises ;-)Other staff, check-out and porters are all very nice. No complaints.Of course the location on 42nd close to Times Square makes it a very good choice.I can't give it 5 stars though, if I compare it with the Kuala Lumpur Hilton we visited last year. That was absolutely top of the bill. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":421,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":417}]}
