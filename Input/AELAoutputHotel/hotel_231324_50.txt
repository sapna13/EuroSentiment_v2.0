{"text":"Not Great by Any Means I stayed at the Ibis Stopera for three nights at the end of July for the Rolling Stones concert . I booked the hotel largely based on reviews on this site, breaking my golden rule for short city breaks. I.e that the hotel should be right in the middle of the action. I can only blame myself but I was slightly disappointed. This hotel has a number of problems.Firstly location. It is situated on one of the most non descript streets in Amsterdam, a decent walk from the main nightlife, with very few cafes, bars or shops of any description. It is not much fun walking back late at night through deserted streets. The street outside the hotel, despite having a lot of traffic has virtually no public transport either.Having been in Amsterdam before I thought this slightly offside location would guarantee a decent nights sleep but the hotel is popular with the British stag trip crowd so you can expect to be woken between 4 and 5 at weekends by slamming doors and drunken voices singing the virtues of Inger-lund If the Brits dont wake you then the housekeeping will.The second issue are the prices. The room rates are not too bad for cental Amstaerdam (although this is stretching the idea of central) but everything else is expensive. Breakfast is a bit pricey at 13 euros (and quite mediocre) whereas internet acces in the lobby at 5 euros for 15 minutes is a total ripoff.Although the hotel is clean and fresh, the public areas are extremely souless and joyless.The bar\/restaurant is possibly the least cosy I have experienced in many years of travelling. Leave this hotel to the tour groups and the lager louts.ChrisStockholm ","annotations":[]}
