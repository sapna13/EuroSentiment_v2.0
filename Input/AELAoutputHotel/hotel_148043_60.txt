{"text":"Great hotel in a lovely area I recently stayed for one night at El Convento in Old San Juan. It is a lovely hotel set in a building with a long and interesting history. The lobby area feels like you stepped into a museum or an important building of some kind and it's decorated in old pieces to bring out the historic nature of the structure. I had read other reviews that the staff was not responsive to guests, but we had the opposite experience. Our room wasn't ready when we arrived, so the front desk, which was very helpful, stored our bags, told us how to get an internet connection up in their library (which is a nice area with coffee\/drinks etc), and then they came up shortly after to tell us our room was ready. There is a pretty bar\/lounge in the courtyard of the hotel with a giant tree going all the way up in the middle of the courtyard.The pool, on the roof top, is quite small, with a hot tub next to it, but there are lounge chairs and it's nice to sit and look out at the old city. Our room had a huge and well-stocked bathroom and was decorated in a unique manner;definitely not the usual chain hotel room. The only negative in the room was that it had a queen size bed (they didn't have many rooms with Kings) which moved when you leaned back against the bedboard to watch TV. The hotel is located in an utterly charming part of San Juan - small hilly cobblestone streets, with pretty buildings, cafes, stores etc., and it's also just a few blocks from the forts and the water. I would definitely stay here again. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":626,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":622}]}
