{"text":"Nice Surprise We arrived at the Riu Bambu on Thursday, December 18, 2008 and stayed until evening of January 1, 2009. After having read some of the other reviews about the hotel, we (my family and friends that we travelled with) were apprehensive of what we were getting into. Suffice it to say that we had a great stay. Rooms were clean (we had 4 rooms - for 9 people) all located on 1st floor of our unit (each unit is two stories and has 16 standard rooms -- 8 on each floor). We were located a fair distance from the pool area, which turned out to be a bit of a blessing as it was absolutely peaceful at night (no intrusion of the festivities from the nightly shows that occur in the pool area).We found the buffets to be very good, particularly dinners. Although we had 4 choices for other restaurants, we only went out twice (in 14 nights) to a location other than the buffet. The buffet had great variety and many theme nights. Christmas Eve dinner and New Year's Eve dinner were wonderful!Staff were exceptionally friendly (both the Riu staff and the staff from the water sports company that operates from the beach). Everyone was helpful and very welcoming.Comments we read about the dirt, problem matteress, slimy pool, poor food, etc., just aren't true. The pillows are, however, something to be desired (very small and very flat).Definitely bring along a two prong extension cord to fit into the recessed outlets to the extent you have any of the square electrical adapters that need to be plugged in. Also, if you are a face cloth person, you'll have to supply your own.The beach is beautiful with great swimming, but no snorkeling at the beach adjacent to the hotel (that is, nothing to see). We arranged for a boat for our group of 9 (cost was around US$350) for about 3 - 4 hour tour of the coastline, snorkeling and sunset drinks at a spot in the ocean where the sea bed rises abruptly so that even though you are about 1 mile off shore, the water is only 3 feet deep, with beautiful sand bottom. We bathed in the warm waters with our rum cocktails and watched the sunset.If you are expecting 5 star (a real 5 star) this is not the place. What I consider to be 5 star is the Riu Palace Punta Cana (which is right next door). I would rate Riu Bambu, purely on basis of rooms, as 3.5. However, the combination of the location, the staff, the food, the daily and evening entertainment and the beach, I would rate between 4 and 4.5.Hope the above helps.
