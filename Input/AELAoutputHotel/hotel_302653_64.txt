{"text":"Wonderful place My partner and I stayed at the Melia this past March. Everything you would expect from a 5 Star resort, except I must point out now that although I've stayed in a good many resorts in my time, I have never received such genuinely warm and gracious service in my life. It was amazing, we were blown away. Perhaps it's just the Bali way. Yes it was humid but ,you are afterall just south of the equator, and if you follow the hotel guidelines and keep your balcony door closed, no problem, very comfortable. Yes it is pricey for the bars and restaurants, but the hotel offered a very good deal for a discount on drinks and meals purchased in the hotel. The best bet to save a bit is to go to the new shopping centre ( the name escapes me), about a 10 minute walk from the hotel, although there is a free shuttle. There's great shopping and about 8 restaurants, quite a variety, and about half the price or less than eating at the hotel. Most of the restaurants allow you to sign the bill to your hotel account. It's true as others have said the breakfast really was not up to 5 star standard but it was really good nevertheless. By all means, take a spa treatment at the Yhi Spa, on the grounds. We had a couples massage, 2 persons, 1 1\/2 hours, $90.00 U.S. A great deal and it felt wonderful. The masseusses are really good. All decent and above board. Finally, we will return there one day, only this time it will be a longer stay. It was pure pleasure. ","annotations":[]}
