{"text":"I will go back to this hotel for all future Barcelona trips I agree to all other good reviews on this hotel. It is excellent.I normally avoid going back to the same hotel so I could try new places, however, this is one of a few places I would actually go back as my regular hotel in this city.The rooms are stylished decorated, yet very functional.Housekeeping standard is very high.The location is simply fantastically convenient to go anywhere. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly.Only two negatives, if I am to raise:1. As one of of the previous reviewers commented, King sized bed is actually made of two single beds, which obviously is not ideal.2. This is probabaly only summer time but just in case some travellers may not like it - The hotel shares its courtyard area with the next door hotel which has a open air restaurant\/cafe there. From about 21:00, they have open air cinema, which is quite loud and if your room faces this side (which itself is a good thing as it is quieter than facing La Rambla) you will hear it even with your window closed. It finishes around 23:00 so, if you are out for dinner for these hours, it should not cause you a headache. Also, if you leave your window open overnight, you will be woken up by the strong smell of breakfast preparation from this restaurant in the morning. You may wish to shut the window and leave AC on if you would rather avoid this. ","annotations":[]}
