{"text":"A Work in Progress I stayed two nights in early May, as the temperatures were starting to rise in Phoenix. For $109 per night, I think that this hotel is a terrific deal. On the positive side, the room was very clean, recently renovated and had an outstanding quality bed and pillows. The new flat screen TV was terrific. The free local and long-distance telephone service turned out to be a real asset. The work space and closet were great. The Aveda amenities were a plus.When I came to my room both nights, music was playing and the lights were on. While this was in some ways a pleasant and ethereal effect, the environmentalist part of me wishes that they would save a few cents on electricity and just leave one light on.There were three bigger issues. First, the WiFi did not work in my room. That turned out to not be a big deal as I could use my Treo to access the internet, but I can imagine for some business travelers that this would be very annoying. This needs to get fixed or the hotel needs to not put people needing WiFi in rooms that do not have functional WiFi. Second, the AC did not work well in my room. Despite turning down the temp, I was really not able to get the room to come to a comfortable level for sleeping. The staff suggested I turn up the fan; quite honestly, that just made more noise but did not solve the problem. This is an issue the management really needs to fix. Third, the continental breakfast is pretty bare bones -- coffee and muffins. The bran muffins were really good, but that was about all there was. In addition, a sense of disrepair was reinforced by the fact that the restaurant was not operating due to water damage. So, to get dinner at 8:00pm, I needed to walk four blocks over to Central, where, in fact I had a terrific meal at Fez. I did not find the area unsafe or a problem, and the desk staff correctly assured me it was not. However, there were few people on Clarendon, so for some I can imagine it could be a bit spooky.Finally, on a positive note, the desk staff did a great job of getting me a limo that knew how to avoid the morning rush hour traffic and get me to Sky Harbor in 15 minutes. That was MUCH appreciated.If you are on a limited budget, give the Clarendon a try. From what I could see they are working to make the place better, and I expect that they will succeed.
