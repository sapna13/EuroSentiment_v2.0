{"text":"A beautiful, stress-free vacation Thank you, Trip Advisor, for the unbiased opinions and advice! Since we booked our own trip, rather than through a travel agent, it was very valuable to hear other people's opinions! We stayed at the Grand Palladium Bavaro Resort in Punta Cana. We were very worried that everything would work out as we planned, but it did without a hitch. We booked our taxi ahead of time on Internet, with Silvatours (Rafael Silva at Dominican Airport Transfers), and not only were they reasonable ($40 for 4 vs. $80 a person with other tourist taxi companies), but he was waiting for us at the airport and whisked us away into a comfortable van and was very helpful, courteous and a good driver. We were very pleased with their service, both to and from the hotel. We were able to check into our rooms immediately upon arrival and they were very nice. A patio, indoor jacuzzi tub, king size bed, overlooking gardens and palm trees. The resort is big, as it is combined with other Palladium resorts, but it gave us many restaurants, bars, pools and pathways to explore, and the grounds were beautiful! Our teenage daughters wanted to be independent, and we didn't feel apprehensive at all to let them go on their own, even to the disco at night. There were security guards on the beach and around the resort, so there were no worries. They enjoyed meeting people from all over the world, and practicing their Spanish with the Dominicans. The best part was the gorgeous clean beach, where you could walk for miles and enjoy the turquoise-colored ocean. There was a breeze, so bugs weren't ever a problem, except at night by the restaurants when they bit our legs, so bring bug spray. There was lots of food and we gained weight! The coffee was fantastic, but being an American and in a hurry, I was always more anxious at breakfast to be served my coffee right away, and the Dominicans move rather slowly, so I had to learn to be patient! And not enough chocolate desserts, too many custardy things, but still good. They did not give clean towels daily or clean the room every day, and our sink area was small and dimly lit, but most of our time was spent outdoors so we tried to not care too much. It would have also been nice to have windows that opened, rather than just a patio door, so at night you could have fresh air. But, it was really quiet and we could sleep soundly in the comfortable bed. All in all, the people working at the resort were polite, friendly, and their goal was for you to relax and it worked, and we had a great time....loved the weather, the beach, the sun! Although I will recommend this place to others, I don't know if we will come back, but only because there are so many other places to see and go to.
