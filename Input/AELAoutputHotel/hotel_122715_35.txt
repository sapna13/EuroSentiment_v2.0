{"text":"Stay With Pleasure OVERVIEW: as with all of my reviews, I rate the property to similar area facilities not class of hotel in one area vs. same class in another area.Located equidistant from Love or DFW airport the hotel is along a freeway with minimal facilities around the property. Cab ride from Love was $30.00. Single building, public areas are semi Roman in design. Small Gym and outdoor pool. There is a shuttle service available about $15.00THE GOOD: Rooms were spacious with soft contemporary furnishings. Large 42√à√\u2020\u2022?plasma t.v. Work desk with plugs for high speed and additional electric outlets at desk. Very nice bath with some granite. Bellman at door on arrival. Check in flawless. Sound proofing excellent. Never heard freeway noise (room on freeway) or neighbor. Great bedding. Breakfast buffet in the restaurant outstanding and a great value. Excellent cookies provided during breaks. Mini Bar service, daily paper.THE BAD: The food service provider for banquets should not be considered as a provider of a palatable source of food. THE UGLY: As there was a large (for this hotel) convention. The single in hotel restaurant was closed for a private party. Forced those without cars to eat snack food at the bar. No support facilities were noted nearby so if you arrive without a car√à√\u2020\u2022?BOTTOM LINE: This is a great business hotel. If I was passing through Dallas and needed an overnight, this hotel is an excellent value. The hotel seemed to perform flawlessly for the convention (except for the food) and is a very nice upscale, quiet facility.
