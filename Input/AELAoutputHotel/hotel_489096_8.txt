{"text":"Absolutely Amazing!!! If you are traveling with a family look no further. This is going to be the best deal you find in the city. The location is out of this world (2 blocks from Darling Harbour) and the views are to die for. We booked a 3-bedroom luxury apartment and paid less than the cost for most hotel room in the city.Our unit was located on the 73rd floor. Keep in mind that the Meriton World Tower is one of the tallest buildings in Sydney. When you first enter the unit you have a large foyer with a desk, phone and oversized closet. This place had more closets than most family homes! The kitchen was fully stocked with plates, silverware, and cleaning supplies. A double oven, stovetop and stainless steel refridgerator as well. The living and dining rooms were larger than most hotel rooms. The living area had a modern L-shaped couch, LCD TV and a DVD player. The entire unit has floor to ceiling windows overlooking the city. We weren't on the Darling Harbour side:-( but our view was still spectacular. It was like looking down on a street map!Each bedroom had a king-sized bed, plenty of luggage space, and multiple closets. The Master Bath had a jacuzzi tub and seperate shower, while the 2nd bath had a walk in shower that could fit an army. The small laundry room was the icing on the cake.We never made it to the indoor pool located on one of the mid-floors. We looked though and it was gorgeous...kind of scary with all the windows though! Internet is a charge which I was not happy about, but I realized that that was the case throughout Australia..very different from the US.All in all I could not find anything bad to say about this place. In my opinion it is one of the best I've ever stayed at and is the only hotel I would recommend in Sydney. Happy travels!
