{"text":"Location, Location, Location During our recent trip to Barcelona to visit our daughter who is studying abroad there, we opted to stay at the five-star Hotel Claris. While I'm not sure it deserves its five-star rating, we were pleased with many things the hotel offered. First and foremost, the Claris is located in one of Barcelona's most elegant neighborhoods√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√≠√ò\u201A√á¬®√ä√®√Ø'Eixample. It's a stone's throw from Paseo de Gracia, one of Western Europe's most beautiful boulevards. Within walking distance from the hotel, we were able to tour La Pedrera, Casa Batllo, Placa de Catalunya, Las Ramblas, and Gaudi's unfinished masterpiece, Sagrada Familia. A little further away, but still within walking distance, was the Bari Gotic quarter.There are numerous caf√ã√\u2022√ñs and restaurants within walking distance of the Claris. At 25 euros per person, there's no need to take breakfast at the hotel as there are excellent, moderatey priced caf√ã√\u2022√ñs right around the corner. Plus, it's infinitely more fun to frequent places where the locals go. Also within walking distance is Dow Jones, an American-style sports bar, where we were able to catch the Patriots and Giants playoff games.The hotel combines an Old World European facade with modern amenities. Glass elevators overlooking the hotel's interior whisk you to your room, all furnished with antique kilim rugs and Brazilian cherry floors. My husband and I happen to like modern furnishings, so we were very pleased with the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor.The hotel's staff was uneven at best. Some people, especially bell staff and doormen, were extremely helpful and attentive, but some front desk personnel were rude and impatient. There were very few English speaking television channels, and by the end of the week we started to grow tired of the steady dose of CNN and Sky News. Our in-room movies, something you expect at a five-star, were not working and the front desk was unable to fix it.. It was January and the hotel was not busy, so the staff accommodated us by giving us access to the room next door.There's a small collection of museum-quality Egyptian antiquity on display on the second floor, which is definitely worth a look. There's also a rooftop bar\/restaurant and pool, but since we were there in January those facilities were not operational. On the flip side, January was a perfect time to visit Barcelona. The weather was ideal for long walks and you didn't have to fight the crowds anywhere in the city. ","annotations":[]}
