{"text":"Very nice...teens loved the buffet My husband stays here on business and we decided to join him this time for a little get away. Although we would have liked to have beach front, this was great. The morning buffet and afternoon manager's reception were great for us as we hung out awaiting my husband's return from work. The kids loved the frozen virgin pina coladas, and we all loved relaxing by the beautiful pool. John at the Waterfall's Restaurant, and Victor at the Outback, both located inside the hotel, were wonderful. They offered so much info about where to go and what to see....as we wanted not only touristy things, but also to enjoy local things. An Embassy staff member gave us information about visiting the bio bay...which was a big help. Our suite was clean and comfy....as much as we loved the made-to-order omelets, it was hard to get out of the comfortable beds each morning. We had a view of the pool from our suite, which was beautiful at night. It is close to the airport, which was convenient. The planes coming in were actually incredible to see. We had a late check-out because my husband had to work that day, and they were very kind about extending our suite availability. We headed off for one last drive to Old San Juan to visit the fort, and they kept our bags for us until we headed to the airport that night. We felt very comfortable there, and yes, we would stay again as a family. If you want great food...(other than the delicious meals at the Waterfall's and the Outback), walk down the block to Mi Casita's and try a mofongo.
