{"text":"AWESOME VACATION!!!! My husband and I were there November 15th -19th. This was a great vacation. The staff are all very nice and most speak english well enough to understand. The Star Friends are awesome. They get you very involved in the activities. The room was very nice. There was a slight musty smell when we first got there but got used to it right away and it didn't bother me. The room was recently remodeled. It had a nice king size bed with a couch, mini-bar, tv... Everything you needed in a room.The food was great. We ate at the Japenese, Gourmet and the steakhouse along with the buffet. At the buffet you can get almost anything you like. There are plenty of choices. Lunch and breakfast were also very good. The beach was beautiful. Nice sand and blue water. We walked up and down the beach every day and loved it. There are plenty of topless women and men in speedos!!! The sun is very hot down there. Make sure you wear a lot of sunscreen. It did rain everyday but only for a few minutes. The only thing I didn't like about the resort is that there are a lot of smokers. Also they need to add music at the pool and the beach. It gets very quiet. They also need to spread out there activities. They must have about 5 different activities going on at 3:30 but no activities between 1-3:00 pm. My husband I would have loved to do more of the activities but you can only choose one at each time. I would definetly go back again. It was a great trip!!!!
