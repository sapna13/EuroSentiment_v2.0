{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Value I spent a week in Florence (Sept. 14-20, 2006) and was thrilled with the choice of the Hotel Casci. Its location is spectacular -- right by the Duomo and by one of the best outdoor markets (San Lorenzo) for buying gift items, like Pashminas, and one of the largest indoor food markets. It is a very short walk to all the historic sights and museums in Florence. The hotel owners and staff (Paola, Carla and others) are extremely helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. I broke a tooth on the flight over and the owner immediately booked an appointment for me with his own dentist who saw me right away and did an outstanding job on the repair. The restaurants recommended by the hotel were all good and we went back to a favorite pizzeria (Pizzeria Nuti) four times for very thin crusted pizza. The hotel is immaculately clean, the rooms are extremely quiet even though the hotel is in the heart of town, the beds and linens are high quality, the bathrooms are modern. Although I generally have an aversion to small rooms, my room happened to be a little one and I loved it. It had everything one could want, including a small balcony overlooking a garden, a desk with high speed internet connection, and a bed with a great mattress. My brother and his wife had quite a spacious room but no more comfortable than my own. So don't let size get in the way. The buffet breakfasts included cereals, a variety of fresh breads, hard or soft boiled eggs, a special fresh pastry each day, coffee, cappucino, latte, tea, juices. We never felt a yen for the big American breakfasts.We booked with the hotel directly and it couldn't have been easier. Tip: We asked the hotel to books reservations in advance for us to the Uffizi Gallery and to the Accademia. I strongly recommend doing this because it saves waiting in very long lines at the museums.
