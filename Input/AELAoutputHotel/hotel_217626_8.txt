{"text":"Avoid the Benjamin Just returned from a 3 night stay at The Benjamin in NYC over Thanksgiving weekend (Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights November 27th, 28th and 29th, 2008. This was our annual Thanksgiving pilgrimage. In the past we have stayed at The Plaza, The Palace and The Parker Meridian. Due to the economy, I tried to save a little money this year and booked at The Benjamin, but still spent $4,800 for 3 rooms (about $500\/night). I would not return to this hotel for the following reasons:√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?e had reserved a 1BR Suite and 2 smaller rooms. When we arrived at 5:00PM, one of the rooms was not ready.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?he hot apple cider pot in the lobby (apparently offered to all guest) was empty.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?uggage arrived promptly but we noticed a wet yellow stain (apparently pet urine) beside the bed in the 1BR Suite. I can not imagine how housekeeping could have missed it. √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√ò went down to the front desk and asked did they allow pets at the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√°nd was told yes. I explained the situation and asked to be moved to another Suite, but they had nothing comparable. The front desk clerk (Selena) was not very nice, compassionate or helpful. We were given free breakfast certificates and the carpet was cleaned while we ate dinner out√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂hat was our only option.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ√ò needed a drink only to find that the hotel bar had closed at 8:30PM.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?he next day while making dinner reservations with the concierge, she asked what pet we brought with us to New York. I responded that we have 2 dogs but left them both at home. She said oh, I asked because you are staying on the pet floor. This was not disclosed when we booked the rooms or when we asked to be moved. √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?he hotel has only has 2 elevators that service over 200 rooms. The elevator waits were long and the cars often full upon arrival.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?e were on Floor 14 (The Pet Floor) and the noise from fire and police sirens kept us from sleeping well most nights.√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?hen it was time to depart, I was unable to print boarding passes for the flight back home because the hotel printer did not work. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ it√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√≠ive and learn. I hope this helps other travelers. Thank you Tripadvisor.
