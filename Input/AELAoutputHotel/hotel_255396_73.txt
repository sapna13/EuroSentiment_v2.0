{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location My boyfriend and I stayed at this Holiday Inn. We booked it at the airport when we got in. See, we are airline employee travelers and didn't know when we could get on a flight to SYD. At first, the room we booked was not available. We were suppose to get a nonsmoking room with a double bed. They gave us a choice of a smoking room with a double bed or a nonsmoking with two twins. Luckily a manager was nearby and told the girl to give us an upgrade. She was reluctant to do it, so the guy did it for us. I would have been disappointed otherwise after flying 14 hours from SFO and not being able to sleep next to my boyfriend or dying in a smoking room. Other than that, the only downfall is that it does not have a pool for the hot summer months. Also, do not buy into the mini bar. You can go around the corner to a bottle shop and get alcohol for HALF the price. It was around 7.50 AU for a bottle of Bacardi. It's not cheap in Sydney.The location was great. There is a little fast food place called Aporto's that we just fell in love with for a quick breakfast or lunch. Across the street is Patty's, a great and cheap place for gifts. You can also walk to Darling Harbour, which is where we spent most of our time. The subway is a good walk away, but not too far. That will take you to the Opera House. I thought the hotel was a little pricey, but so were all the others. It was a nicer Holiday Inn at least with the room we got. We paid about $800 for 5 nights, I believe. ","annotations":[]}
