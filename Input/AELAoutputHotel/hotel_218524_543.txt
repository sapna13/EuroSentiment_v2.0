{"text":"Super Excellente We stayed from 20th February to 5th March 2008.We travelled as a family of three English people.We had two garden\/mountain view rooms in building 11.We had room 11111( yes five ones very easy to remember) and 11706.The rooms were good,spacious, clean and well presented.The maid always did a good job.The mini bar was restocked everyday and the turn down service was excellent.We got towel art regulary.Both our rooms looked over ponds with fountains and lots of coconut trees and tropical plants.When we came to our rooms at the end of an evening we liked to watch the fire flies flying around the lights in the distance,as we had never seen them before.The grounds were very well maintained and you never saw any mess.The flamingoes,parrotts,ducks,chickens and Turkeys were lovely and some of them had youngsters.The security was very good with regular patrols day and night.The restaurants were all good.We thought Agave was the most fun with the Merengue band playing to you.We then liked Toscana,spice,barcelona,lobster and the grill.We did not go to chez isobel or Oregano.The pool was great very well maintained during the day and cleaned at night.The main pool is massive and very upscale.The drink service was brilliant we drank beer, sammy sosas,miami vices and lots of water.The pizza delivery man came to your chair every lunch time.It was great as we did not have to change to go for lunch if we did not want too.You could also get small sandwiches from the Sol bar.The Beach was good but the ocean was rough but well maintained.The drink service was good there as well.We walked the beach everyday and found a nice area to swim in.The shows and ice breakers were good.Our favourites were the Dominican,circus,international, magic and of course the Micheal Jackson. We went to the disco twice it was good and the entertainment team were good dancers and fun.We listened and danced alot to Domingo's music both in the lobby and in Plaza santo domingo.We also danced to merengue bands when domingo was not working.While the entertainments were going on in the evenings we were supplied with our favourite drinks White wine, champagne, drambuie, water and even hot tea! The hotel staff were all fantastic and really nice.We would like to thank you all.Some were really special and went that extra mile.If you are thinking of going to stay at this hotel put your hands up in the air and go.It is wonderful.
