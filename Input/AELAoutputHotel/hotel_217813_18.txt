{"text":"Wonderful location My daughter  I found this hotel comfortable, in a great location and we were pleased with the cleanliness. It was easy to reach Fisherman's Wharf, Pier 39 and the tram terminus. It didn't take more than 10 mins to walk to Lombard Street though it's uphill all the way. The hotel is only two streets away from the water\/Embarcadero  we felt safe in the area. Parking was quite expensive, though in the city it is more expensive than here, however it was valet parking and the guys were very nice. We found the reception staff very helpful on check-in and through our five day stay. Our room was an internal one overlooking an internal atrium so we had no outside noise. The room was clean and there were plenty of towels in the bathroom.Breakfast is included in the price - you help yourself to cereal, Danish, buns, toast, eggs, some odd stuff I didn't recognise (but I'm British so it might have been grits?), sausages, fruit juices and other things. The choice was good however there are crowds of people from around 7am - jetlag worked in our favour in this instance so we were there before the hoards at 8am. There was still plenty later on although some of the guests were acting as though they weren't going to find anywhere to eat for the next year!! I'd have no hesitation in returning there as it was the ideal base for us in San Francisco. We booked through Hotwire and I didn't feel we had a bad deal from the hotel because of this.
