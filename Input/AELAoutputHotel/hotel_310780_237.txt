{"text":"Felt at home We can highly recommend Hotel Europa, Via Cavour 14, Florence. We spent 3 nights at this hotel at the beginning of our trip. We had a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºuite√à√\u2020\u2022?which looked out on a quiet courtyard and the Duomo for 150euros. The room was spacious and attractive with a large comfortable bed and was equipped with an air conditioner, TV, and a safe. Friends also had an equally large and appealing room. The bathrooms were clean and more than adequate and were equipped with a hair dryer. At the end of our trip we again stayed at the Hotel Europa for an additional night. This time our room was a little smaller but very comfortable and quiet (it was also 10euros less). We did not see the regular rooms as we had decided from reading Trip Advisor before booking that the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºuites√à√\u2020\u2022?might be worth the extra expense. We were all delighted with the hotel. It is family run. Gassim and his daughter, Miriam, and the family were very warm and helpful which made the stay so pleasant. They are also fluent in English. We were happy to return there for the final night of our trip. The location is excellent. The hotel is only one and a half blocks to the Duomo. This central location made it possible to walk to all the main sites. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be fooled by the entrance to the building. There is a small elevator which will take you up two floors to the lobby of the hotel. The suites are just up one flight so we used the stairs once our luggage was up. Breakfast is included and consists of cereals, yogurt, fruit, hard boiled eggs, and croissants. Especially good is the large coffee machine which makes everything: expresso, latte, capuchino, americano etc.. We booked directly with the hotel via email. Communication was easy and replies were prompt. When we return to Florence we will definitely stay again at the Europa. A great find!
