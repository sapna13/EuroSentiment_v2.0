{"text":"excellent we travelled to new york for my 21st birthday and stayed in the millenium hilton as soon as we got there the hotel staff couldnt do enough for you. we were taken upstairs by the bell boy on the 52nd floor the view was amazing!!! massive plasma t.v big comfortable room with the best bed you will ever sleep in!! we didnt eat in the hotel but looked nice on the 5th floor. we thought that we may be looked down upon as we are younger and have in other nice hotels but there was non of this from any staff in this hotel which was nice!there is a outlet called centry 21 next to the hotel in you are from ebgland and like tk max then you will like that but no my sort of thing so didnt buy anything.the subway is next to the hotel but is not as nice as the london tube but is handy to get into the centre. and get a taxi back.the only thing with this hotel is the work that is going on outside the front of the hotel on ground zero but we had a letter in our room on arrival from the manager apoligising for the noise and offering ear plugs if needed but me and my partner dont struggle to sleep and we were high up believe me when you are walking for miles around new york and get back to your big bed the noise is not a problem you could sllep through anything!!we loved this hotel and would personaly give it 5*!
