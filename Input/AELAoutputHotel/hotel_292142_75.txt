{"text":"a new favourite hotel I really like this hotel. I used to live in NYC and go back 2-3 times a year for a visit. I sometimes stay with friends but when I need some free time, I will stay in hotels (or with friends who come to visit), so I have sampled quite a few. I have been to the Affinia 50 and the Dumont and I like both but, on a push, prefer this one. Partly for the location, partly because it is that bit bigger, has a nice gym and great views. The staff are really great, the rooms a fabulous size for NYC and there is a sense of space about it. It is more modern than say the Casablanca, which TripAdvisor readers tend to really like, and I actually like it better. It does not (at Dumont but at 50 they do have a wine\/cheese) have the added food\/drink extras for free but it is NYC and half of hte fun is getting out for breakfast or to find those little wine bars....Also the barking dog adjacent to the property is fine and there are cafes all over the place nearby. It is located close to the Empire State building but really handy if you (like me) prefer heading lower eastside for going out. It is just handy for most everything including trips in\/out of JFK and LaGuardia (as it is on the East Side). The rooms that are lower and facing 34th are likely to be a bit noiser, but always ask for a higher room and facing one of the side streets and it is fairly quite. The best part, though, are the staff who are really lovely. Oh and if you are a gym person (and I am) it has a really good hotel gym. The costs are medium for NYC, not way over the top, but not cheap. If you book correctly, you can get a better rate than say the Casablanca (which is smaller, tends to book up quicker and rates go up higher and faster). Again, I like the Casablanca (really) but if you like something a bit more modern and spacious, this is your place. If you want a smaller hotel and will take advantage of the eating for free (bfast) and drinks\/cheese in the evening then Casablanca might be a better choice.
