{"text":"Fantastic hotel We spent three nights at the hotel as part of our Grand Tour of Europe honeymoonOn arrival, we were given the choice of a room in the hotel, or, for the same price, a larger room in the annexe at the back. We were the first people to stay on the second floor and gave the room a test drive. Room was charming, with canopied four-poster bed, huge shower with massage jets, and bath robes and slippers. Obviously no view of the Grand Canal, and no lift (unlike the main building) but extremely comfortableWe found the 5 Euro breakfast excellent value - and took the advice of Tripadvisors to have non-machine made cappucinos. Cereal, fruit, croissants, eggs, cold meats, pastries, fruit juice - and we finished our breakfast by taking our last cappucino and a slice of fruit pie outside to watch the world go by on the Grand Canal (worth 5 Euros alone!) I have no idea where people would go to get a better value breakfast in VeniceThe hotel is a vaporetto ride from St Mark's Square, but we found this to be beneficial as the squares and canals behind the hotel were much less crowded and interesting to explore. Great location for the train station or the Piazza Roma where we left our car (just two bridges to negotiate)Staff were excellent and informative, and sitting at one of the tables in the evening drinking Prosecco or Peach Bellinis just people watching is one of the highlights of our honeymoonAbsolutely intend to return, but with less baggage!
