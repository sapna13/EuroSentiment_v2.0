{"text":"Fantastic! My fiance booked the Sofitel for 4 nights at the end of March\/start of April as a birthday pressie combined with getting my engagement ring at Tiffany  Co. As others have done in the past, we subtly mentioned we were here for an occassion but alas no champage. What we did get though was room 2820. 28th floor, only 3 rooms at this particular side of the hotel and boy what a view! The TV was a bit old, not a great deal in the way of storage space but the room was the best I have seen yet even compared to the Fairmont in Toronto. Kudos to whoever makes those beds as they were the best nights sleep I have ever had. The bathroom was to die for and in a moment of nosiness I eventually figured out the knob in the bathroom was great for knowing what the other half was was watching on TV. The location was amazing with Central Park, Empire State, 5th  6th, Broadway and Times Square all within walking distance although if you do walk to Central Park I'd advise stopping for coffee half way as it is quite far. We received complimentary turn down and 2 bottles of Evian every evening plus the weather forcast for the following day but no chocolates - probably just as well.New York itself wasn't a total let down but I think the weather was very kind to us which helped. Guys, if you're thinking about getting a nice piece of jewellery for your other half (especially the diamond ring variety) definately visit Tiffany on 5th near Central Park. 3 glasses of champagne later and I had the most beautiful engagement ring that would have cost double in the UK.Other things to do\/visit - Red Flame (breakfast, lunch, dinner or midnight snack, this place was always welcoming and the selection and prices were great plus it wasn't all tourists there), Apple store on 5th, Grand Central Station (5 minute walk from the hotel). I, like others, found that the hotel staff thought we were made of money when it came to recommending restaurants. I don't think jeans  trainers helped our cause for door opening but when walking that much, I wasn't doing heels! One negative factor about the trip was the red NY sight-seeing buses. They were over priced, over crowded and at times you could have walked faster. Great for learning more about NY but a travellers guide would be cheaper and warmer. A crowd of 50+ (including us) were stranded for over an hour at Battery Park waiting to get home on a day when winter woolies were required but not worn. We were lucky enough to get on the bus home but had to sit upstairs (open-air) in freezing conditions or risk not getting home at all.
