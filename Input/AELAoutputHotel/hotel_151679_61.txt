{"text":"Charming and Great for the Price All and all my boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay but there weresome things people should be aware of. We booked a room in the At Wind Chimes Inn through Expedia but when we arrived they said that our room was in their other building down the street. This other building is a new hotel that's just opening called Acadiana so there was lots of construction going on. The parts of the hotel that were finished were absolutely gorgeous and it was closer to the beach thanthe at wind chimes (which is only a block from the beach). Even though we were in the Acadiana, we were able to use all the amenitiesof the At Wind Chimes Inn. We ended up not minding the switch but if you would mind, you should confirm which building you will be stayingin.The LOCATION is great! You are a block from the beach and only 10 minutes from downtown Old San Juan. It really is the best of both worlds. The neighborhood is quiet. If you go a block in one directionyou hit designer shops and fancy restaurants but a block in the otherdirection and the area is a little sketchy so be aware of that.The FOOD at the bar was amazing! They cook everthing right in front of you. It's really fresh and just wonderful. It's not super cheap but it's not super expensive either. The bar staff is friendly and welcoming as well. It can take a while if you get there when it's busy though.The POOL is small but a nice place to relax and if you want to swim in something bigger, the ocean is just a block a way. The BEACH nearby was not that crowded and had lots of great waves.I would definitely recommend the At Wind Chime Inn or the Acadiana (when it opens up as its own hotel). I can't wait to go back myself!
