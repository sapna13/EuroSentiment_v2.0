{"text":"What's to say that hasn't already been said? Stayed at the hotel for 6 nights to attend Macworld 2007 with my wife. Got a package deal through Expedia and saved about the cost of one night's stay. The GM seemed quite responsive to questions and requests, so I thought I would drop him an email and find out for myself. I received a prompt response and got exactly what i requested (high floor room with a bit of a view, and breakfast recommendations).So many people have already said great things about this hotel, so I'll probably repeat a few here. This is what stood out for the hotel in my mind -- some stuff might seem minor to most, but it's little things we sometimes take for granted:-- Polite, attentive staff: Everyone always said 'hello'.-- Elevators: My wife doesn't like elevators that feel cramped and old. These ones got my wife's approval. And not only that, they were fast, and there were two.-- TV: Reception was perfect, and included HBO. The last two hotels we stayed at had issues, and it's always nice to watch a little television after a long day on your feet.-- Free coffee in the lobby: not only free, but always hot! I've stayed at hotels that offer free coffee, but don't keep it very warm after hours. -- Free newspaper: always a nice touch.-- Location: Maybe the most ideal location in Union Square if you really want to be picky: For example -- 12 minutes by foot to Moscone, 15 minutes by foot to House of Nanking in Chinatown, and neither involve a big uphill walk!If anyone is interested, our room (1403) was relatively quiet (the only thing you ever heard was the fire truck or police sirens), very spacious (for a boutique hotel), and had an OK view of the Square.What has been a bit of a tradition with my reviews is some tips that I could share that may help some fellow travellers:- Lori's Diner: Nothing special, but the food is priced well, especially since their website has a 20% off coupon. Google it and print a few for your trip.- Sushi joint: my favorite is Sanraku on Sutter. Sit at the bar, chat with the chefs, and watch'em work!- Chinese food: House of Nanking on Kearny. They rush the patrons a bit, but so what? The food is great and two people can leave with full tummies for $20.- Pub crawls: Thirsty Bear and 21st Ammendment are quite good. Try the watermelon wheat beer at the '21A'. The 21A is a bit of a walk from Union Square, but it is doable. Google for them both to check out the menus and exact locations.- Out-of-town excursions: If you are an Apple-fan, head south to Cupertino to see the Apple Campus. If not, head south to Palo Alto and have lunch at Stanford University. Free shuttle around the campus. We ate at Ciao! in the Terman Engineering Complex. Good food for a great price.Enjoy your stay at San Francisco!
