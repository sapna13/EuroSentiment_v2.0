{"text":"Had a Blast @ Ocean Sands!!! We were 2 families, each having a teenage kid - stayed at Ocean Sand (junior suite) during the week of Dec 22nd. We had an amazing time there from the very beginning. check in - had no problem checking in...it was smooth and were transported to our villa # 9 in the golf cart along with our luggage. we were in the room within 30 minutesRoom - was great..comfortable beds, didnt try the jacuzzi as we tried it in the Pool which was great. we had put everything in the safe which is in the closet and it was SAFE. No complaints.Pool - very clean...couple tiles were missing and some parts were a bit slippery but apart from that, a dip in the pool was very refreshing. The pool bar was always stocked and the bartenders were more than willing to serve.Beach - It was our first time in the ocean....loved it!! very clean beach, aqua green water....didnt want to come back. there was no problem getting the chairs at the beach or pool even at the peak times. beach towels were provided any time you ask, up until 4 pm.Service - Excellent. Our cleaning lady was very accomodating...twice in the week we came back to our room from the beach to change and she waited for us and came back and completed her job - not with a frown but a big smile on her face. I had bought lots of stuff from the dollar store for the kids...notebooks, pencils, crayons, small toys, girlie purses, clips etc plus we used to leave a dollar bill as well for her every other day. It is not mandatory to tip but we did it coz they were always trying to please. Food - we tried Mexican on our first day - real good food - loved the enchiladas. The next day we went to Route 66 - another good restaurant. Overall the food was good but repetitive in buffet lunches though. The Italian one was good too. My daughter did feel heart burn\/nausea on the last day....but that could have been from being too much in sun or from our trip to Saona island (must do excursion)Entertainment - this resort has lot of activities during day time - aqua gym, bikini contest, beer competition, etc around the pool area. We attended the theatre for night entertainment - they have nice shows - they did 'Chicago musical one day which was amazing. Overall you will not get bored. It is worth every penny.
