{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised w\/Barcel√ã¬\u2022? Dominican Beach Just got back from the Barcel√ã¬\u2022? Dominican Beach Resort (6\/26 - 7\/1) and I was pleasantly surprised by the property, amenities and staff. I too read the reviews and wasn't expecting what I got. It seems everyone's experience is hit or miss and mine was very nice. The hotel is indeed a short ride (20 min max) from the airport. There were no lines when we checked in and figured it wouldn't hurt to ask for an upgrade. The desk manager said he'd try and we wound up getting an oceanfront (6702) however it was a single and we needed a double. We begrudgingly gave it up for a double in Block 5 (5202) which was also close to the beach. The room was actually more comfortable: bigger and modern. However, it faced the pool and became a lil noisy in the evening when the disco let out. It's not close to the disco at all but some folks would make a racket on their way to their rooms, the 24 hr pizza\/burger place or the beach. One night they hung out right in front of our balcony and we had to call security to ask them to move. It seems the spa rooms in Block 6 are the hot commodity. They're right behind Block 5 but much quieter and more perks.I don't understand the comments about the language barrier. The staff speaks multiple languages. I speak Spanish but my travel buddy doesn't and she managed to get everything she wanted. I thought the staff was very nice and went out of their way to accommodate us. We brought a couple of singles for tip money and that didn't hurt. We were on a first name basis w\/some. The animation staff is full of energy and work all day. You'll see them on the beach, by the pool, in the evening variety shows and then at the disco. They must run these poor kids ragged but they don't seem to mind. They're always smiling trying to get you involved.The food was pretty good at the buffets and a la carts. We didn't get sick but we were very regular. We're picky eaters so we stuck w\/food that was prepared in front of us (e.g., omelets, grilled fish, pork chops, etc.). There is nothing appetizing about food that's been sitting out. Also, don't overload your plate w\/a ton of stuff because it won't sit well in your stomach. Use common sense and you'll be fine. The Brazilian, Mexican and Japanese restaurants are a must. The Italian I could've done w\/out. Note, the only place to grab a bite between 3-6 pm is the 24 hr pizza\/burger place and the lines are out of control. The pizza is good but I wasn't diggin the burgers. Space out your eating time and you won't starve like we did. Btw, you'll see advertising for Captain Cook's seafood restaurant. Skip it. The food is lousy (how can you botch grilled seafood?) and they'll charge you $60. The only thing cool about the place is the free water taxi.The beach is beautiful and there are a ton of chairs. However, if you want shade, you'll have to rise early to claim a palapa (thatched roof umbrella). We got up at 6:30am and threw our towels and some clothes on the chairs then grabbed breakfast. They weren't touched by the time we returned. Yes, it's selfish but everyone does it so when in Rome...or DR. Btw, the massage huts on the beach are a must. They're cheaper than the spa and the breeze is delicious. Faustina runs the one near the beach bar. She's fantastic and the relaxing massage for $30 hr is out of this world.This was my first trip to Punta Cana and I'll def go back. However, I'd like to check out other hotels to compare. I heard the Melia and Flamenco properties are some of the best. Keep an open mind and you'll be fine. If you're expecting five stars go elsewhere. I hear the French Riveria is wonderful.
