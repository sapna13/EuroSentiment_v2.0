{"text":"Go to a different hotel... After ariving to the hotel. As we were lined up to check in we were given cold drinks. That was a nice after a long bus ride. We were told one of our rooms wasn't ready yet. After we waited for 40mins we got to get settled in. I was welcomed in my room with an unflushed toilet. Chocolatey. Seen a couple cockroaches under the mattress. The buffets are nice with many different dishes to choose from. But the waiters tend to ignore you and act like your not there. I had to go and ask them to bring us drinks. I was told one of the times that I need to go to the bar to get it myself. That kinda turned me off a bit. They will give you great service if your a good tipper. Better have some green ready. The ponds along the pathways were very dirty and were greenish brown. The beach is nice other than lots of trash. Not enough chairs to go around. You'll find yourself sitting in the sand. I'm not sure if people are having sex on the beach? But I seen a bunch of used condoms in the sand. We had to wait in line for 40mins to reserve our restruant. Seems its always mexican. It was good though. My friends gf was yelled at by the restrant manager for taking her coffee outside to drink. Kinda silly reason. Theres many day trips you can go on. But there all very exspencive. We all visited maniti park. It was fun. But again cost alot to go. And you have to ride on a crappy rusty old school bus with almost every seat ripped. There were many sitting areas where you can sit and drink. The nightly shows were well done. But are all put on very late. Their casino is ok , A few slot machines and tables. Many sexy ladies in short skirts. Who never smile and they look like they don't want to be there. Grouchy. The shanty town shops along side the beach are ok , The men are very pushy and put necklaces on you and forcfully tried to make my friend put on a t-shirt he didn't want to buy! And the shops seem to sell all the same things. One of my friends was in the shower and was hit in the chest when the shower head shot off. He told the front desk about this matter. But they kinda shrugged their shoulders and said they'd have sombody look at it. Yeah look at it the next day! They didn't hurry to fix that. Theres a couple of dogs that wonder around the resort. I think they belong to the shop owners. I wasn't to happy about them being on the resort. As we were going for buffet dinner. I slid forward and almost fell on my back. I stepped in dog mess that was fresh. I could of been injured. The steak house was very tasty if your willing to spend the extra money. My gf seem to get better bar service than myself. The bar tenders flirt with the guests. Its not right. We had to check out of our room by noon. And wait around with our bags for the rest of the day. The bus ride back to the airport was long as it was on the way to the hotel. Make sure you grab your bags when the bus stops. Or dominicans who work at the airport will run off with them. And them more tipping. This was a fun vacation. But a few things didn't go so well. I'll go back to the Dominican Republic again, But I'll never go back to this hotel again. I hope my reveiw has been a help.
