{"text":"Wow! My 15yr old daughter  I have just returned from a four day stay in Paris and stayed at the Hotel Keppler. It is situated on a quiet street near the Arc-de-Triomphe  all I can say is - wow! The hotel had only just re-opened as a four star after a total refurbishment (was originally a two star I think) and the interior is absolutely amazing. Quality is the word that springs to mind upon entering. We had only booked a few days beforehand - I liked the look of the hotel  it's easy access to all the major Paris attractions via the Metro. We had a Standard room which was perfectly adequate in size for the two of us - there are larger rooms also available but at extra cost obviously. I'm sure the quality of the fittings etc in the Standard rooms are the same as these. The Suites look amazing - maybe one day!The staff were so friendly  helpful - nothing was too much trouble for them. As this was a special trip for my daughter (excellent exam results!) I had e-mailed beforehand to see if they could arrange for something to be put in the room as a surprise for her.The Reservations Manager got right back to me suggesting several things,  she introduced herself upon our arrival.The Chocolates I had chosen were in the room waiting, beautifully wrapped.Breakfast is either served in your room or in the Breakfast Room - (though there are also a couple of places nearby.)Sauna, Steam Room Gym too though we didn't check these out.Within a few minutes walk you are on the Champs Elysees  it's many amazing shops  restaurants - all in all an ideal base for exploring the rest of Paris. We will certainly be staying here again! ","annotations":[]}
