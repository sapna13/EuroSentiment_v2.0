{"text":"Nice Place, Great Beach and Pool, Poor food and english To start the hotel, the pools, and the beach are excellent. I was very unhappy with the food. I took only shorts with me and found out when I got there that I could not go to the restraunts without long pants, only could eat at the buffet. We stayed from monday august 14, 2006 to friday august 18, 2006. I stayed in building 24 room 216. The room was nice, high ceilings, but the bathroom could use remodeling. The ceiling was soffit, americans use outside under our overhangs on our house. The tub faucet was old and hangs out of the wall. The tub was rusting on the outside. The room has a card with controls the lights and a\/c. We had no problem with the maid removing the card, but I heard some people did, I am paying for the room and expect the room to be cool when I get back. Our maid was maria and didn't speak engish but was a great housekeeper. I was not impressed with the shows since I only speak english and the shows and songs are in spanish. The buffet is very slow in serving drinks, since it is not self serve. The workers in the restraunt do not speak english, so good luck trying to get something other than water, do not drink the water other than bottled water, there is a sign on the mirror in the bathroom showing not to drink tap water. The food was very poor, I talked with several people there and they even said how bad the food was. It's pretty bad when the scrambled eggs taste bad. Lots of lamb, frog. and different fish. I have been to Arubu,Jamacia, St. Thomas, and always found american food in the buffets, but not here. The hotel staff was very friendly but in spanish, not many people speak english, I was very fustrated with not understanding them. I would not go back to Punta Cana again, but it's a very nice hotel, grounds, pools, and beach.
