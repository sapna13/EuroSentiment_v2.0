{"text":"Awesome stay We booked this hotel through Priceline after finding out that a decent hotel in the Miami area is very expensive. We were only staying for an evening on our way from Minnesota to Jamaica. We got a great rate ($150 for one night) and had a fabulous stay! The rooms are nicely decorated and the beds are comfortable. Included in our room rate was a breakfast buffet (bacon, sausage, eggs, pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, toast, muffins, fresh tropical fruit, etc), tea time (tea, coffee and snacks) from 2-4, and also a cocktail hour where we received 2 free drinks and appetizers. All of these activities took place down the hall from our room on the 3rd floor. There is also a complimentary shuttle to\/from Miami International Airport. You get a lot of bang for your buck!We utilized the concierge and he was EXTREMELY helpful. We told him that we wanted to eat at a Brazillian steak house in the area. Within 5 minutes he had made us reservations and called us a cab. When we arrived the woman at the front desk was also very helpful in offering dining options!The only negative thing I have to say is that we called the front desk to see if we could get a room at the same rate for our one night stay after our Jamaica trip, and they were not able to accommodate us. I was a little surprised considering it would have been on a Tuesday night, so I can't imagine they would be full. I was told I would need to go through the Priceline process again.
