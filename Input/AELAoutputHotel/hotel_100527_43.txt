{"text":"Pleasant Stay - but hotel needs to address the elevator issues Stayed at the Crowne Plaza Seattle for five nights at the beginning of August and had a pleasant stay.I had reserved a view room, and was able to check-in immediately upon arrival, about noon. Although I had not paid the higher rate for a club level room, because I am a Priority Club Gold level member, I was given access to the club lounge for continental breakfast and evening snacks. There was also access to a microwave for making popcorn at night.The view room was on a high floor (30) and overlooked the city and bay instead of the freeway. Worth the extra $$. It was a large room, with a desk\/chair and an additional arm chair.The location was in downtown, close to shopping areas. BUT, everywhere to walk is downhill, which means it is a long uphill walk back. Pike's Market is definitely walking distance to get there - but I took a cab back up the hill. I was taking in Sox\/Mariners games at Safeco field, and Safeco (and the adjacent Quest field) are about a 20-25 minute walk. The Concierge was not terribly helpful with directions or information on local buses --- just suggested we walk.The rooms were standard Crowne Plaza rooms: fluffy white linens, extra pillows, etc. I think in some other CPs I have stayed at the mattresses may have been pillowtop, but not this one. The mattress definitely could have been more comfortable. The rooms were very clean. Housekeeping serviced the room twice a day: in the morning they made up beds and replaced towels; later, they returned early evening and turned down the beds, closed the drapes, replaced any used towels and turned the radio on softly.I did not dine in the restaurant, but ordered room service twice. Both times I ordered just sandwiches, but they were good and arrived quickly and hot. Room service is available late - until about 1AM. The breakfast in the club lounge was more than adequate. There was a large selection of bagels, muffins, danish and scones, assorted cereals, assorted fruit and choices of coffee, tea and juices.The lobby was always extremely crowded during the day. There seems to be a convention of some sort going on, and they had taken over several function areas as well as the lobby.The biggest problem was the elevator service. The hotel was quite full due to this event. While there was a bank of 4 elevators visible, it appears that at least one was locked down for service use, and another may have been out of service. I never saw it operating. That left 2 slow elevators to service a full 34 floor hotel. One evening I returned around 11PM to literally find a line of folks across the lobby waiting for elevators. It took me 25 minutes to get up to my room. Even more annoying was that the hotel staff seemed unconcerned by this and did not open up the service elevator. At other times there were quite long waits, but 25 minutes was the worst.Overall, I liked this hotel. Next time I may look into staying somewhere a bit closer to the waterfront, but if the rate was better, I wouldn't hesitate to stay at the Crowne Plaza again. (I'd just need to remember to be patient when calling an elevator.)
