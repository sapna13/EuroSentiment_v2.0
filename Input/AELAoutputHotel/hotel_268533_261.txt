{"text":"Good location and nice rooms but a bit noisy! we stayed here for 4 nights in april 2007. I found the location of the hotel to be the best we could have got having explored san francisco as i would not have wanted to stay in the union square area and some other tourist areas are a bit too far away from the centre of everything, but fishermans wharf has a real seaside feel to it. think of a sort of very upmarket golden mile at blackpool without the nasty bits, but you should be aware there are quite a few homeless people around all areas of san fran including fishermans wharf, but i didnt find it a problem.our room had a view of the golden gate bridge and the bay which was fantastic and we liked the decor of the room. it was a big room but we did notice the noise from the next room a bit ,and also you do get some noise from the cable car turnaround outside the hotel, but really, the amenities the hotel offers makes up for this- just take some earplugs!the evening wine reception was a nice touch- make sure you do get there between 5-6pm as they start packing the wine away on the dot! this hotel was quite pricey, but i feel it was worth it. The staff were very helpful, even getting us on a last minute trip to alcatraz even though we had been told by a tour operator that there was no chance of us getting on it as we hadn't booked in advance!we had one breakfast and one meal in the blue mermaid resteraunt which is attatched to the hotel which were both very good, but for an even nicer breakfast i would suggest lori's diner at ghiardelli square- the french toast is gorgeous! Also Boudins bakery at fishermans wharf has a nice cafe to have lunch in.san francisco is a fantastic city to visit - and the argonaut hotel was a great base for us!
