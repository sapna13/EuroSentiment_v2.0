{"text":"Luxurious, but not as clean as I expected, and where's my flat sheet!? Sofitel is located just a block or so from the White House. It is a very luxurious looking hotel. Walking into the lobby will have you feeling as if you are in a world class hotel. Hotel staff are very friendly and well trained.I had a reserved a Superior King room for an amazing rate of $129 per night for New Years Eve. However, there were some problems. Upon turning down the bed, it became apparent that there was no flat sheet in between the comforter and the fitted sheet (although the fitted sheet is really just a flat sheet folded around the mattress). After we discovered this, we noticed that the comforter was quite dirty. I don't expect a hotel to wash comforters after each guest, but if they don't, I at least expect a flat sheet in between the comforter and my skin.I called the front desk and they took care of it. That is, they simply folded the comforter over such that we couldn't see the stains. No flat sheet. I guess this is the standard at 4-star hotels.In the same night, our toilet became clogged and would not flush properly. I again called the front desk, and the problem was taken care of briskly.Decor in the room is fairly new, but all of the chairs and those ottomans (for lack of a better word) had a lot of fading in the middle. Also, I was surprised that for a 4-star hotel, the room had an archaic tube television. The bathroom, however, was spotlessly clean.Overall, I was mildly pleased with this hotel. For the rate ($129 a night), this hotel was amazing. But for a 4-star hotel, I think the problems mentioned really killed the hotel for me. I'll probably pass on this hotel next time.
