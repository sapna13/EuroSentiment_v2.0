{"text":"Good choice for extended stay with family Stayed at the Quay West in October for one week. Arrived via taxi and baggage was immediately taken and delivered to the room. Hotel was quiet and check-in was very quick. Our room, 1003 was a nicely sized one bedroom apartment. Room looked to be in good shape (little wear and tear). We had a partial view of the harbour, mostly of the city. There was a full kitchen. We cooked dinner a few nights. Although plenty of plates, glasses and utensils, there were a limited number of pots and pans. Technology wise, there were plasma tvs in both the living room and bedroom and broadband access (although quite expensive). Washer and dryer were in a separate room. The bathroom had separate shower and bath but some of the towel holders were coming off the wall. Electronic safe was particular as you needed to use a personal credit card to open and close the safe (versus a keypad). However, plenty of space to lounge out.One problem was the street noise. Surprisingly, the windows can be opened and the insulation was poor. We could hear the music coming from outside late into the evening on the weekend.Bed was ok, not the most comfortable bed that we slept in while in Australia. Hotel location is excellent. Walking distance to the Rocks and Circular Quay. In between the Shangri-La and the Four Seasons. Was a steep hike but there is an elevator that takes you up to the lobby from the street below. Breakfast was included in our rate and the buffet breakfast was good but not the largest number of choices. Swimming pool was on the roof. The pool was heated and had a wonderful view of the city of Sydney. Very popular with the kids including my son who wanted to swim every night after we got back.No problems with checkout. There was a 1% credit card charge as they had indicated when I booked the room. Had booked a taxi the night before and was there waiting for us. Overall, enjoyed our stay. The Quay West is a good choice for an extended stay especially with family.
