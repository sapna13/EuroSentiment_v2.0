{"text":"Great place to base your trip to Florence We visited Florence in May 2005 and stayed for five nights at the Grand Hotel Mediterraneo. I found this place to be a fantastic deal. It is not luxurious; however, the rooms were very clean, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was large for European standards. In addition, the breakfast in the morning was plentiful, with both hot and cold choices. I found the location to be perfect. It was far enough away from the traditional touristy places to a bit less expensive; however, close enough for a very pleasant walk. One could reach the Duomo in 15-20 minutes and the main Florence train station in about 35-40 minutes. In addition, we traveled with someone who was in a wheelchair, and the distance of this hotel was not at all a problem for us (although traveling via wheelchair in Florence can be challenging, with narrow\/cobblestoned sidewalks!). There is a charming little park right across the street from the hotel, where we relaxed on our first day. If you seek luxurious accomodations, there are better hotels for you. However, don't think this place is spartan - I found it to be a fine hotel for the price and an above average stay. A great place for families or friends traveling together, but I might choose a place a bit more sumptuous for a honeymoon or something special. Keep in mind that we are the kind of travelers who are constantly on the go, so luxury is often wasted on us given that we hardly spend any time in the hotel room!Ciao!
