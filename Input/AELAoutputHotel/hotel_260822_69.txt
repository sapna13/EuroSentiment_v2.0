{"text":"A Great Experience My wife and I had not been back to Italy since our honeymoon almost 19 years ago when we decided to take a vacation with our 14 year old daughter during her school break this past April. Our first stop was in Florence and the three days we spent there were just lovely.We found the Hotel Perseo to be excellent with updated rooms, and a modern bathroom. But besides those amenities the staff was just wonderful. Prior to our trip they booked museum reservations at the Uffizi and the Accademia for us and gave us advice on how best to get to the hotel. Laura and especially Tani were great and more than just a little helpful. Tani provided an excellent restaurant suggestion, La Decima Musa, which was probably the best dinner of our entire trip and the following evening was successful (after a number of attempts to get through to them by phone) in getting us a reservation at a particularly fine restaurant, La Giostra. Unfortunately, our daughter caught a 24 hour bug that day and we ended up not going that evening as we cared for her in our room. Tani was great as he cancelled our reservation, directed me to the closest all-night pharmacy (fortunately only a few blocks from the hotel) and suggested a restaurant that had full meals as takeout for my wife and myself so we could have something to eat (also not that easy to find in Florence outside of pizza). He went out of his way as he helped us deal with what was perhaps the most upsetting day of our trip.We would absolutely go back to the Hotel Perseo again√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√Æot only for the location and the amenities, but because of the staff.
