{"text":"Catalonia Bavaro We (my boyfriend, myself, my sister and her boyfriend) ages: 25,26,32,41 all spent a wonderful 10 days at the Catalonia Bavaro Golf  Casino Hotel. (We wasted 4 days previously at Barcelo Bavaro Beach-but the less time spent talking about that place the better!) The Catalonia we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find fault with. It has something for everyone. Great rooms with plenty of space. Our room had an extra bed and adjoining rooms- this is great for anyone with families. The beach is beautiful with soft white sand and blue sea. Plenty of beds available.( If you want a bed around the pool with shade expect to be there for about 7\/8am, plenty of beds, but you may be sitting out in the sun.The restaurants are lovely with plenty of choice. When booking up for the A La Cartes you are told to book 24 hrs in advance, but a lot of people got away with booking the whole weeks worth in one go, as they say: if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ask?! Definitely recommend the Cowboy t-bone steak at the american\/steakhouse, it barely fits on the plate!! And tastes every bit as gorgeous!! NB A tip: guys must wear a long pair of trousers(whatever they are- linen, combats,jeans etc), and no open-toed shoes or you will be refused entry to the booked restaurants (do like the men did with us and take 5 mins after dinner to go back to change into a cool pair of shorts if you want). The buffets have a big mixture of food so you won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be stuck (even if a little weird sometimes-watch out for the yukka it surprisingly looks like boiled potatoe). The snack bar at the pool is great. You can help yourself to all types of pizza, ask for burgers (cooked on demand), with fries, salad, or rotisseri chicken, hot dogs, or snack on nachos. The choice is yours. They also have drink dispensers to help yourself to :coke\/diet,fanta,sprite and yes, presidente-on tap!! And the best of all:- there is a whipped icecream dispenser with a big basket of wafer cones , to help yourself to all day !! The pool is massive with many easy walk-in shallow areas, plus large but shallow kids pool. It has a Jacuzzi, waterfall and not forgetting its very own bar! (just don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind if you come home with a tan-just from the waste up!) Fab!! The pool bar has loads of great cocktails to choose from √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√™√∂ou can have √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Üex on the beach√à√\u2020\u2022?without the gritty sand!! The people are wonderful with lovely polite service everywhere and they will always help you wherever you are , especially when they see a woman in distress trying to pour a beer from the self service dispenser (the little pizza chef came out from behind the counter to help me- all I had was a cup of froth, Hey! but never mind, its all-inclusive just have another one!!!!!!!!!!!!
