{"text":"A 3 Star Hotel with a 1 Star Price The Hotel Montreal is truly a great find and superb value. In May, 2007, we stayed in a triple room with private bath for 4 nights. Florence is a compact city. The historical center and River Arno were within easy walking distance from the hotel. One of the best reasons to stay at the Montreal was its proximity to the SMN train station and public transporation. It was convenient and easy to visit local sights, and make day trips to Siena, San Gimignano, etc. Next to the hotel was a small bar. For our stay, we could not hear any music or talking at night√à√\u2020\u2022?thanks to the nicely insulated windows. We felt safe strolling about the neighborhood at 10, 11 PM. There were small shops close by where we purchased water, snacks and fruit. Gelaterias near the station offered tasty gelato and low-cost sandwiches. We found ATMs, Internet shops, travel agencies and a good number of restaurants within a three block radius of the hotel. One restaurant, only a half block away, featured hearty pizza and traditional Italian fare, at a discount to the hotel guests. Our room was in the back of the hotel. It was very clean, tastefully furnished, and considerably larger than many of the hotel rooms we stayed in Europe. The bathroom, in contrast, was quite narrow. The sink, bidet, toilet, and shower lined up right next to each other. The fixtures were relatively new and functional. Great water pressure, and no lack of hot water. With two large windows that opened, our laundry dried overnight. Everyday of our stay, we found 4 sets of oversized and thick towels in our room. The AC was very effective, quiet, and adjustable. The large dresser offered ample room to hang our outfits, and still accommodated two carry-on suitcases inside. We had a LCD panel TV with CNN in English. The beds were comfortable and large (1 queen and 1 twin). Extra pillows and blankets could be found in the dresser drawers. Breakfast was included in the price of the room, offering simple choices of dry cereal, rolls, orange juice, milk, tea and coffee.Overall, the location of the Montreal is excellent, the room more than adequate, and the rate absolutely reasonable. But what makes the Montreal a great find is the service. Stefania, Monica, and a couple of gentlemen behind the front desk were always courteous, cheerful and helpful. The ladies serving at the breakfast bar were equally professional and pleasant. There is no doubt that when we return to Florence, we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l stay at Hotel Montreal.
