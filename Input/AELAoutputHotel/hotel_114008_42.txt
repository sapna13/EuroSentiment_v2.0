{"text":"THey try hard, not quite there yet. Let me start by saying this hotel is a very nice property. Stayed 5 nights in beginning of February 2008. Stayed in the diamond head wing, mountain view room with lanai ($500 night). This room had been renovated already. Renovations are progressing nicely and appear to be in their late stages, my guess would be in the next few months they will be completed based on what I heard, read, and saw. Renovation noise is not a big problem, however during they day you can hear some of it if you are in your room. Overall the renovations are good, however I do agree with several other reviewers that they skimped on certain things. It is obvious. Things like old chipped ceramic floor in bathroom, old cabinets not replaced, old bathtub. The staff overall is friendly and will try to help you when they can. They WANT to get their Mobil five star rating back (ps-they recently lost it). In order to do so they are going to have to go the extra 3\/4 of a mile. Things like, no one at the bell stand on numerous occassions to get your car. No one answering the phone at the front desk. The food is average, definitely not worth it if you are on a budget. Breakfast buffet for two with tip about $80. Would I stay again - probably. It is expensive. The beach is nice. One of the biggest good points is that this hotel is away from the touristy Waikiki.
