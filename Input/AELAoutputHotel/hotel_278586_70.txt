{"text":"Absolutely Beautiful We booked the Santa Maria Novella based on the Trip Advisor reviews and we were 100% pleased. At first upon arrival, they did put us in a room on the 1st floor with just a shower. I was a little upset because I had made the reservations far in advance and paid for a room with a view of the plaza. The first room did face the plaza but it looked right over the parking lot also, as it was so close to the ground. I went to the front desk and they immediately moved us to the 4th floor with a much better view and full bath. It was awesome! We can't thank the staff enough for all their help. Never once did we find any of the staff without a smile and always willing to help. The place is immaculate also. They even come in and turn your sheets down for the evening. Two recommendations: Buco Mario's restaurant which is a very short walk from the hotel is excellent. We ate there 2 of the 3 nights we stayed in Florence. We took a private tour with Chaauffeur Italy Service. There were 4 of us and the tour was 9 hours at only $89 euros pp. The email address is [--]. And the website is [--]. The hotel gave us this information. Francesco was our driver and it was so wonderful. We went on private wine tours through the Tuscany area and visited several small villages and castles. It was well worth the $$! We will definately stay at the Santa Maria Novella next time we visit Florence.
