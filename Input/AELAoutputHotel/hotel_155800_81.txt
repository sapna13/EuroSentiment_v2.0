{"text":"Not so sure... I went for a 5 days get away bymy self to San Juan, upon my check in the Front desk told me my room was not ready so i changed and went to the beach to relex, after 1 hour they called to inform the room was ready, so i got checked in. The room was stunning with a beautifu view, but when i look at the sheets i realized they were dirty and with blood stain also the bathroom amenities were never replaced and still had the previous guest hair on it. Disgusting! room was very dusty and full of hair everywhere. They didnt have any robes or slippers in the room.The pools are beautiful, the pool chairs are very confortable but other guests wake up at 6 am and put their towels in the chair and leave so when you look for a chair to lay down they are all occupied by towels and never guests, the hote should not allow this. Service by the pool is very slow and they close at 5pm, very early.I work for hotels so i can definetely tell that this hotel is not worth for the amount of money we pay to stay there, I am likely to go back to San juan but never to this hotel, it is a 24\/7 party hotel, i had a lot of noise from other drunk guests on the hallway, i was very dissapointed but apart from that Puerto Rico is amazing!! If you are looking for a more relaxing place try el conquistador in Fajardo, just a 40 min drive from San juan and they also have beautiful beaches and most of snorkeing and scuba tours leaves from there!But the hotel El san juan, never again!
