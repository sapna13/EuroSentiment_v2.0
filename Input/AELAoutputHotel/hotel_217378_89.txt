{"text":"A good experience I had read lots of reviews on here and I was really scared to go there but, becuase it was a family event taking place at this location I decided to stay with everyone. I arrived and I was really surprised. The valet when I arrived was really very courteous Wesley I thought was always pleasant and outstanding but, so were all the other guys. We checked in and the front desk staff were also pleasant no problems at all. I actually got my room early and although I had not seen my room decided then to add an extra night to our stay which I would have needed to stay in Miami anyway. I know, risky since I had not seen the room and I had read such bad reviews. Anyway, we got to the room and it was nothing like I expected it was much better than the reviews read previous to travel. Our room was clean and smelt clean and had good daytime light. I do agree the lighting in the night can be improved however especially for reading. The rooms had great storage space walkin closet and all plus lots of drawer space and extra space to hang clothing.Our view although not of the beach was nice especially at night. We had a good time and my cousins wedding turned out really beautiful and the services they provided for that was top class and really that is all that mattered to us. Our entire family had an enjoyable stay. We had about 10-12 rooms and no one in our family complained so I think that sums it up to a great experience! ","annotations":[]}
