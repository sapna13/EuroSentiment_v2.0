{"text":"Great hotel, problems with payment though Nice hotel for the price and well located for Hollywood, although you quickly realise that LA is a car city and end up getting the car out of parking to get about anyway!The breakfast was good, as mentioned before it does end early, so you may have to drag yourself up to get it. Although I can understand that many people may use this as a business hotel (and so are up with the larks), the vast majority I am guessing are tourists. We are on holiday \/ vacation, people - we deserve at least a bit of a lie-in!My only real problem, like some others have found, was with the payment. Having got the Advance rate back in August I expected to have my card charged almost straight away (as per their TCs) - however it never happened (I even decided to ring direct to confirm as I thought there may be an issue with my credit card - although other hotels had gone through fine - something to do with their systems). I ended up paying at the end of our stay. No problem really I know - apart from the pound \/ dollar had changed since booking so I ended up paying considerably more in my home currency!Only a slight issue, but if you are informed of, and decide to enter into an agreement that you will be paying at the time of booking with the penalty for cancelling as losing it all, then I would expect them to at least honour their side of the agreement too and take the payment instantly.That aside, which I will not count against the property for review purposes, I would recommend this hotel - it's new, the rooms are well-atired, staff are good, brekkie comes in the price, and it is well located.
