{"text":"Great 2 star hotel Don't be put off by the entrance to this hotel - a dark building in a busy street and that you have to take an old elevator to the second floor to reach the reception. We had a very pleasant stay at hotel Casci. This was our first trip to Florence. The staff were extremely nice and did everything they could to help us. They even went as far as bringing breakfast back out one morning when we were late getting up (a busy day trip the previous day exhausted us). The staff will book tours etc for you. They also have a very large collection of guide books that they allow you to borrow. This proved very useful during our day trips to Siena (A must) and Pisa.The room was large (as European city hotel go) and spotlessly clean. Even though our room faced out on a busy road there wasn't the slightest noise. We could hear the shower in the next room but this didn't bother us much. Remember that this is a 2 star hotel so don't be expect rich surrounding of a good three star hotel or higher. The location was brilliant and everything was within easy walking distance. The train station is close so it great for day trips.Breakfast was included with the price of the room. They was a good mix of foods for breakfast and it ensured a good start to the day.I would definitely stay here again if I ever returned to Florence. Even on leaving all the staff were out to shake our hands and to wish us a Bon Voyage. We were also given a calender of Florence on leaving (a nice touch).Thanks Hotel Casci Staff for a wonderful trip to Florence.
