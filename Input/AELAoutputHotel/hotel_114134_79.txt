{"text":"We liked it, but My wife and I stayed at the Lenox over St. Patrick's Day weekend (yes, it's a weekend in Boston). The Irish pub in the hotel was jammed and rowdy. So was the other bar -- City Bar -- even if a gentler kind of spot. There was lots of comings and goings through the lobby -- many people not guests but going to the bars. That's not why we were in town and, despite the hubhub, enjoyed our stay. Still...the old-fashioned presence of the Lenox -- very lovely, really -- belies the notion of it as one of Boston's favorite watering holes. Our room was one of the larger doubles featuring two windows and well over 400 sq ft. Not especially well appointed -- certainly could use some updating, and the bathroom was small. Strangely, the toilet seat could only stay up by being velcro-ed to the wall behind it (velcro provided). Good beds and very dark curtains. Didn't pick up much street noise and we slept so well one night we overslept a meeting the next morning. We booked our room on hotel.com and got a very favorable rate, much less than the advertised rate. For what we paid, and for Boston (notoriously expensive), the Lenox was great. Not so sure I'd say that, though, if I'd paid more. One of the Lenox's finest features is the location in the heart of Back Bay -- it's one reason why we picked it . The other reason is because we had stayed there for a night on our honeymoon more than 30 years ago. No real memory of it, but I'm quite sure it didn't have the lively night life then that it does now. The Lenox has a nice authentic old-fashioned ambiance in a superb location -- if only the rooms had some of the same updating that has been put into the public conveniences!
