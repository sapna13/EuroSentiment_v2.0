{"text":"Good location, decent hotel, horrible service Citigate Central is in a very good location, less than a minute walk to Chinatown, and 10 minutes to Darling Harbour and Queen Victoria Building. The surrounding area is also very quiet and relatively safe at night. Stayed in an executive room on the 16th floor and the room was very big. The huge bed and sofa were not too comfortable. There were a few stains on the carpet. Room seemed kind of bland and boring. Bathroom was small and cramped. Basically, we felt it was a decent hotel in Sydney for the price we paid.The customer service was very terrible. After arriving early (9AM) from a 14 hr flight from S.F., I was told by a lady in reception my room would not be ready until 2PM, but she would call me first thing if it was ready earlier. After waiting over 4 hours in the lobby and seeing others check into their rooms, I walked up to the reception and asked the same lady if my room was ready. It was. I was sitting 20 feet away from the reception desk and not even a word or a phone call that my room was ready for me. The lady said she would have someone bring my bags up to my room for me. I went up to my room, and waited over 45 minutes for my bags which never came. Went back downstairs and told the lady about my bags. She just replied for me to go see the concierge myself about the bags. I ended up bringing up my bags myself. This lady was one of the rudest, most unwelcoming receptionists I've ever encountered and will be the reason why I never stay at the Citigate Central again.
