{"text":"Great Florence Hotel My wife and i just got back from a 5-night stay at the Hotel Porta Faenza for our honeymoon. We had a great time in Florence and thought the hotel was great for a 3* in Florence. The hotel is not 'luxury', nor does it claim to be as a 3*, but for the price, proximity to attractions and the train station, this was a very friendly, clean, and decent hotel. They gave us Room 303, which has a large balcony with a few chairs. However, we were unable to use it because it was freezing in Florence the week we were there. If you stay when it is warm, request this room. The room size, however, is a bit smaller than some of the others, but you do get the balcony.The staff was very helpful and friendly. They assisted with contacting the airport to recover my wife's lost luggage. They also booked museums and a great Chianti area wine tour with CAF Tours. They also popped open a bottle of vino for us.The breakfast was decent. Nothing hot, but I believe that is how europeans serve breakfast. There was a good selection of cheeses, meats, and pastries, juices, and coffee.Our only issues with the hotel were that there was no clock or alarm clock in the room (though they did give us wakeup calls), not having an alarm clock made me nervous. I did discover towards the end of the week that you could set the TV to turn on automatically at a specific time. Also, the bed was not the most comfortable, but I dont' think many are in Florence unless you pay a few hundred more for the Westin or similar.The hotel also provides free internet access in the lobby.Thanks Porta Faenza for a great honeymoon.
