{"text":"Best Place to stay when visiting Paris This is the second time we have stayed at this hotel, and both times it has been the best experience. From the attentive staff to the well-appointed rooms, nothing is over looked. Last year we happened upon the hotel through an ad and booked it, much to our delight it is right off the Champ Elysees and located in the best shopping neighborhoods and close to the major site seeing attractions. When returning to Paris this year, we considered no other property and promptly rebooked at this hotel. Upon making the reservation, we were greeted with an acknowledgement email stating that they were happy to have us as a returning guest.The hotel is small and has a bouquet setting, which allows personal interaction with the staff. We found the entire staff, regardless of the hour of day, to be friendly and extremely accommodating. From recommendations to restaurants, arranging transportation to and from the airport, to assisting with site-seeing tours, they are happy to ensure that our stay was pleasant. The rooms are nicely decorated, clean, with all the modern amenities.This year, we decided to add an extra night (on our last night of stay), even though the hotel was completely booked they assured us that this would not be a problem; due to either a cancellation in the morning or they would arrange for us to stay at another property at the same rate. Fortunately in the morning, we were informed that we would be able to stay here at the hotel.We highly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to visit Paris, where else can you feel the romance of the city than right off the Champs Elysees! We are DEFINETLY coming back to Paris and to this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
