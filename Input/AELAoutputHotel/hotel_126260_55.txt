{"text":"WOW! Fabulous Hotel! My family and I stayed at the NY Palace for two nights. There were two adults, two teens in a double room. I can't even describe how fabulous this hotel is! From the moment we checked in we were treated like royalty.( We had just gotten off the train from DC and didn't look like royalty.) We were greeted warmly, given a wonderful room on the 9th floor. Although not a real high room, it was directly across from St. Patricks cathedral and had a great view of many buildings and the street. There was plenty of room for four people. We loved it! It was a little noisy in the morning if the window was open from the cabs honking but not too bad. Everything is first class, the furniture, linens, service, bath products etc... We have stayed at many fine hotels across the world and this was truly one of the nicest places we have ever stayed in. The location is great and the staff are not snooty as they can be in some nicer hotels. The beds are comfortable, room service was really fast and the food was great although expensive. The bellman told us if we liked coffee in the a.m instead of paying for room service coffee, he called and had them send up a coffe set up, which was a full size coffe maker, on a silver tray with cups, silverware, a pitcher of cream, sugar and of course coffee. Great tip. Also, the woman who checked us in told us that it cost 15 dollars to access the internet from the room, but that it was free in the lobby. So if we needed to use the laptop we just went down to the lobby and plugged in and sat in their very comfortable chairs. There were plenty of places to sit and to plug in. The hotel is just lovely and clean and well maintained. We were so thrilled to have found such a gem and can't wait to stay there again.
