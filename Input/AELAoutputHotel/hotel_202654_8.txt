{"text":"Modern, Friendly, Recommend! We stayed at this hotel and were excited to hear from the taxi driver that it was a very good hotel. The lobby is very impressive and the whole look of the hotel from the common areas to the rooms is very modern, clean cut and stylish. The staff were super helpful, friendly and couldnt do more for us, very impressed with the customer service. The rooms were very clean and well furnished but considering how modern the common areas were, the rooms and bathroom were comfortable, functional and just fine but not as modern as the rest of the hotel. We had a nice canal view though and its located in a quiet area. The inclusive breakfast buffet was simple but hearty and fresh with eggs, rolls, cold meats and cheese, fruit, cereals and croissants etc. It is in the business district but if you dont wish to use the next door S-Bahn underground, you can walk very easily to Unter Den Linden (10 - 15 mins walk) and the Nikolaiviertel (about 5 mins walk) where there were lovely traditional German houses\/pubs\/restaurants\/shops selling lovely food. A real gem. The TV Tower (Fernsehen Turm) was also just 10 mins walk and was very busy around that area. Once on Unter den Linden the number 100 or 200 bus can take you very cheaply all around the main sights of Berlin, which I would recommend. Having seen how busy and touristy Kurfurstendamm was, we were very glad to be staying in the area where we were! I would definately recommend this hotel to others.
