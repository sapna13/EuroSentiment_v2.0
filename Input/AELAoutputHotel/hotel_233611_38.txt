{"text":"Lovely Hotel My husband and I just returned from a 6 night stay at the Hotel Langlois. We enjoyed a quiet, spacious room with a small but very nice bath with tub for a very reasonable 130 Euros per night. Everything was clean, the staff was nice, and breakfasts were quite good and reasonably priced (for Paris at least) with enough food to hold us over until dinner. While there are no non-smoking rooms, our room was fresh and there was no residual smell - but we could smell smoke from other rooms, we assume through the venting system, which was a bit unpleasant on occasion. The big and heavy doors in the hotel were easy to accidently slam and the bathroom doors made slamming noises if you closed them tight, but our sleep was not disturbed by this. What did keep us awake was that the beds here are HARD, much more so than we are accustomed to at home and much more so than other places we have stayed (three others on this trip alone). While this hotel had pillows available in the closet (many European hotels do not) they were well-used and had obviously been around for quite a while. Location-wise, there are much prettier areas of Paris to stay in and they are better located to the things my husband and I enjoy when we are visiting. We also came across some street people bedding down for the night at the Trinity Church nearby but they certainly weren't threatening to us or anything - it was just a bit of a surprise and I would probably avoid this area later in the evening. The Opera House is near by but when we've attended opera performances in Paris, they've always been at the new facility quite a distance from here. Two of the major department stores are a few minutes away and they are fun to check out for a short while, but they are not the reason most of us go to this beautiful city. Although it's true that the Metro is right around the corner, I personally prefer to walk to our favorite sights as much as possible and this location didn't allow for that. That said, we found a couple of really nice restaurants in the area by using the Pudlo Guide (found at Rick Steve's favorite English language book store, the Red Wagon - well worth the visit.) and I managed to drop more than a few Euro in some of the antique shops nearby. While it's not perfect (what is?) we would certainly recommend Hotel Langlois as a lovely hotel in Paris.
