{"text":"Well Kept Secret Perhaps I shouldn't be telling the world how good this hotel is?We have recently spent two visits at this hotel and are absolutely delighted with it. Yes, some of the lower rooms are noisy due to New York - not the hotels fault! Fire sirens, taxi's, nightclubbers etc. If you want a quiet nights sleep then book a higher room or visit the countryside!We were in a room on the 3rd floor street side where even though we expected a little hustle and bustle and our room door faced the elevator door we all slept soundly (2 adults 2 kids).This is one of the friendliest hotels we have ever stayed at. The check-in is so quick and easy and you are immediately supplied with maps and some general information on the immediate area - even without asking! This was our first trip to New York - a place where we would admit to having some reservations about the city and its inhabitants. These were immediately removed by the attitude of Affinia 50's staff.The room was very clean and comfortable, maybe not to be described as enormous for 4 people but average sized and ample for us. . The bathrooms were also a little small but had everything required and were fully functional. The beds are very comfortable. The room cleaning was very efficient and perfect every time. Each room has a coffee maker, ironing board etc. We didn't use the gym facilities that are provided but they seemed very adequate on inspection. The lifts are average - NOT small. There is no bar but there are many bars and restaurants nearby within a very short walk.The location is excellent and major attractions can be reached within minutes of the hotel. This is contrary to previous reviews for this hotel but - a 1\/2 mile walk is really not far! Times Square or Central Park is about a mile away and when you take a taxi you miss all the stuff in between. Go on - give it a try.The rooms are great but the major selling point here is the friendly staff of this hotel. The minute you return from your long day of touring the city you are met with a verbal 'Welcome home' from the bell men and reception staff. They are always willing to help and are ever smiling. We took advantage of a late check out facility that was free. This gave valuable extra city time on our departure day as the normal checkout is 12 midday.The next time we return to New York we will definitely stay at this hotel.
