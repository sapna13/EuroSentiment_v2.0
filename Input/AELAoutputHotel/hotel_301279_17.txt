{"text":"Wonderful experience at the New Otani The New Otani is made up of two towers: the original 1964 Olympics tower (which looks austere) and a round-edged white tower built more recently. They are connected by a long corridor and the entire hotel sits on a 10-acre garden that has a small waterfall. (Actually it is a big waterfall if I were to have it but it's a small waterfall as waterfalls go.) The garden is worth a visit. It is intended for the leisurely stroll. There is a teahouse although that was closed when I was there.The executive room I had was very pleasant. The king bed was king indeed. The room was big enough so that my colleague complained that the 42-inch tv looked small when he was watching it from the bed. There is a small working area with lan connection for internet.The bathroom is small but very well stocked with L'Occitane shower, shampoo, conditioner and body lotion. I am still on the road and I took a couple of the lotion.I did not have any of the negative experience mentioned by other reviewers. I had a late flight so I took the morning to visit a friend. I left my bag and my handcarry (laptop bag with no lock) with a staff. He delivered it to the airport bus waiting area. So all I needed to do was to turn up where the bus was with my ticket. My laptop bag was intact and nothing was missing. Amazing.Food at the hotel restaurant is expensive. I had two coffees and a cake for tea and they came up to US$30. I guess someone has to pay for the water pouring down the waterfall.There are two subway stations nearby and they are about 10 mins easy walk. The Akasaka area has one of the train stations and it has a row of cheap (Tokyo standards) restaurants. There are offices in the area so the restaurants are busy during office hours but on weekends they are close to dead.
