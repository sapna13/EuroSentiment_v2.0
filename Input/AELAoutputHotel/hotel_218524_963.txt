{"text":"Excellence es muy excellente! We just returned from Excellence on Aug 3. My husband and I were celebrating our first anniversary. We both agreed that we had an even better time than we did on our honeymoon. I honestly think that the people who wrote negative reviews would not be happy anywhere. The Room: We stayed in a jr garden suite. We were given the option to upgrade to the excellence club at check-in and were very glad we did not. Our room was clean, the AC worked well and the bath was very nice. They kept our mini-bar well stocked and even gave us a bottle of rum. The Beach: This was the nicest beach we had ever stayed at. There were always chairs in sun or shade so plenty of room to fall asleep on the beach. Yes, there were waves but they were small by Jersey Shore standards and if the water was too rough there was always the pool. The Food: The food was excellent we have been to other all-inclusives (Sandals, Iberostar) and Excellence was superior. The service was always great. We went to all the restaurants except Agave and all were 5-star quality. We never waited more than 15 min for a table and our glasses were never empty. The Staff: The staff was what made Excellence so wonderful. Everyone made us feel very welcome and were more than happy to help us work on our spanish. Fransisco taught us some wonderful spanish lessons, and Fransisco the bell-boy was very helpful taking our bags when leaving. Kenny at the Kaffe bar was great he helped us learn more spanish and was fun to talk to. Super Luis is great on the beach allowing people to get together for beach volleyball and encouragaing people to learn Dominican dances. All of the hostesses at the resturants were awesome, they escort the ladies to the tables and are very nice and welcoming. The omlet chef es un professionale- and is very polite and good to talk to.The Excursion: We went on a journey to Saona. The bus ride was very educational about the Dominican people, we also stopped at Altos de Chavon where the posh Casa de Campo is along with shoppes and restaurants. The tour guide was very helpful and very watchful for us. The motor boat out to the island stopped for a little bit at a very calm sandbar, which is part of the national park system. Here we held live star fish and had some good rum and cokes. Saona was very pretty and the beaches had white sand and calm waves. The Catamaran ride back was very fun with lots of rum and coke, cerveza, and Dominican dancers dancing with people in the crowd. On the ride back into the resort we stopped at a store that had lots of good art and souvenirs to buy, the prices were fair and they even came down a few dollars as well.The Horseback Riding: The resort has complementary horseback riding and it was very nice. We rode horses along the beach abd had a good time. When you get back they have CD's with your pictures on them, along with some bottles of the local drink Mamajuna.The Entertainment: The entertainment in the theatre was very good, and i would recommend seeing the Michael Jackson show.What I Wish I had Known: If I had to do it over again I would bring the strongest sunscreen available. The sun is very strong and it does not take long to burn (we used SPF 55 and it was not enough)! Also the food in the airport is very expensive $8 for Wendy's and $6 for a slice of pizza. All in all we were really pleased and would definitely return.
