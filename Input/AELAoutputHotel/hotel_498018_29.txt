{"text":"Icaria Hotel,Barcelona a great find. Having seen the reviews for this hotel on tripadvisor and the excellent location to the beach and the port, plus the great price we got for two twin rooms with breakfast, myself and three girl friends booked 2 nights here a Sat\/Sun at the beginning of Aug.The hotel was very modern and clean with a pool and jacuzzi and a lovely outdoor seating area with big, comfy sofas, ideal for sitting with a drink and book to chill out and de-stress. OK, like other reviews there is building work taking place next door but being a weekend there wasn't any work going on so nice and quiet, i wouldn't let negative reviews put you off using this hotel as the good points far outway the bad.The rooms we had were large with a big modern bathroom and a hot powerful shower and hairdryer, comfy twin beds, air conditioning, fridge\/mini bar, flat screen tv and free safe. There is also a free ice machine on every floor.The rate we had included breakfast which provided more than enough variety of food to start the day, cereal, fruit, cakes, even a full english which we all enjoyed and the great coffee, a perfect start to a days sightseeing in Barcelona.Location, great for the beach and the olympic port, five mins walk where there's a sandy beach, a great beach bar and a good selection of restaurants with excellent sea food which are more reasonibly priced than the main centre. The sightseeing bus is a good way to see Barcelona which you can board close to the hotel, a hop on hop off bus so you can see all the sights without having to walk between each one also taxis are easy to find so don't be afraid if the hotel seems to be out of the centre of Barcelona, as we found it was nice to get away from the crowds to our area of Barcelona which we found very safe even late at night.In the short time we had we found this hotel and location to be excellent and would definetly use it again.
