{"text":"Great location We stayed at Hotel Antiche Figure for three nights during our honeymoon and found it to be the perfect hotel for a stay in one of the most romantic cities in the world. While the hotel is located on the opposite end of all the attractions (St. Mark's Square, Doge's Palace, etc.), it was nice to be near the quieter part of the city, but yet still be on the Grand Canal. Plus, Venice is so small we had fun just walking to places like St. Mark's, being that it would only take about 20-25 minutes to walk there (And who doesn't love walking through Venetian cobblestone streets!)The hotel was a 5 minute walk to both the ATV (water bus) and to Piazzale Roma, which is where we had to pick up the shuttle to the cruise we were taking from Venice. To get to the airport you can either, very easily, take the ATV to the airport or pick up an actual taxi (driven) from Piazzale Roma, which is connected by bridge to the mainland. Another benefit was the hotel was right next to one of the only three bridges that crosses the Grand Canal, so we didn't have to walk far to get to the other side. The only downside to the hotel was the 5 euro breakfast. It served cold lunchmeat, cereal and fruit, not enough to fill our bellies before walking around for 10 hours. I would suggest saving your money for a slice of Italian pizza.
