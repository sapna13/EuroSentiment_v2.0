{"text":"less good than in the past The Legian where we usually stay in the south of Bali has been one of our favourite hotel but unfortunately, the level of quality is less and less good...If the staff is still extremly helpful, nice and professionnal (each member of the staff uses your family name to say hello and it's very appreciable), if the location is still one of the most amazing (the beach just in front of your eyes for some stunning views) and if the cuisine is still very good (even if the Executive Chef had moved, the new one is excellent as well...), The Legian starts to be a bit old and the maintenance is not so great, not what we expect in a five stars resort.Rooms design is not actual anymore and if you want to have black out for sleeping, avoid this hotel because most of the wood curtains are broken and it's strictly impossible to sleep correctly because there is always the light from outside.I've been a bit surprised nobody has changed a broken light in the bathroom and it wasn't possible to stop the one in the entry (i've been obliged to call somebody at 11pm... not so comfortable...)OK, some people love the very large suites but if you have to pay the full price, it's absolutely over rated... Fortunately, i've had an industry rate because for the full price, i think it's better to stay at Amanusa or The Bal√ã√\u2022√ñ in Nusa Dua or at The Sandi Phala in Tuban but The Legian is lucky because there is not a lot of options in SeminyakThe main reason why i don't recommand The Legian is due to the management. I've been considered as a liar because i've dared to complain about the comfort and the GM has been very disgraceful with me... So unfortunate...When you'll go to Bali, just avoid this hotel...
