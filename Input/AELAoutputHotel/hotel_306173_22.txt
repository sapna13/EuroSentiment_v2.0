{"text":"Good But At This Price I Need to Mention It's Faults - Esp. Taxis We stayed at the hotel this weekend on a 1\/2 price Suite offer. The accommodation was spacious as was over 2 floors, with a nice verandah outside between the large pillars. There are many positives to the hotel that should be as the room rates are high, but the experience is not quite as good as it could be. Positives, negatives and summary below:+Nice location, no big deal getting to places if you can travel by cab and if you can get oneGenerous offer - 1\/2 price off suites at weekendsNew and modern - decent LCD TVs, room remote controls, nice amenities, espresso machine etc.Suite nice and spacious, decent sized verandah Speedy check in and check out_ Club lounge closes by 8pm, also generally only 1 staff on duty so response time too slowGetting taxis from the hotel was a complete shambles. The bell captain was enforcing a system whereby taxis would pull up and decline to take passengers unless they were going to be large (mainly to the airport) fares. We spent 10 minutes in the heat waiting, then had to threaten to complain and were then offered to pay an additional fee to the driver to convince him to take a local fareBreakfast not especially nice - buffet style, and much better quality at Valley Wing at Shangri La where things cooked to orderWould have made more sense to have additional room controls for the curtains, do not disturb sign etc. downstairs in the suite as well as upstairsNo TV in the bathroom (pendantic admittedly but the Valley Wing had this)Summary:Very nice stay with a few minor quibbles and one major concern regarding taking taxis. We would stay there again to take advantage of such a nice room.
