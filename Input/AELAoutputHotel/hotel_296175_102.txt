{"text":"Anniversary\/Birthday celebration We chose the Davanzati because of the reports on Tripadvisor and we have never been let down using this approach before. Having said that the hotel is good but not as good as painted in previous reports.Its most important selling point is its location √à√\u2020\u2022?no more than 5-10 minutes from the Uffizi Gallery, the Duomo, the Ponte Vecchio and all the other main sites. Though on a busy little street opposite the main Post Office the modernization of the hotel, including double-glazing, means that it is quiet and relaxing. Access to the hotel is via steep steps from the street and depending on your room location via a lift to Reception and other floors. We had a Junior Suite for 3 nights, which was comfortable but not luxurious and certainly not of the quality of the Bella Venezia in Venice. (If you pay in cash a generous 10% discount is applied.) In the guest book some previous visitors said that the room and hotel were better than places like the Ritz and other 5 star establishments √à√\u2020\u2022?some people clearly get carried away after a few visits to the mini bar! The provision of a laptop was an added bonus if you want to stay in touch with the outside world or to check on opening times of restaurants or key sites to visit as well as to research parts of Florence√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ history.We very much appreciated the copious and friendly guidance from Tommaso via email about local restaurants and tours that can be arranged by the hotel. This was a very special visit for us as it was a surprise combined 24th wedding anniversary and birthday celebration. Consequently, the hotel was booked months in advance and we were guided by Tommaso√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ restaurant advice. On this part we were disappointed because two of the restaurants we chose and thought we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° reserved via Tommaso were closed for annual holidays (in August\/September?) but we were not informed of this until the actual day of our celebration so had to spend some time traipsing around Florence to find an alternative. We were far from impressed. Last year, at the Bella Venezia, we were presented with a bottle of Italian bubbly and wished Sandy a Happy Birthday by the staff √à√\u2020\u2022?at the Davanzati nothing was offered.Breakfast, highly rated by previous guests, was pleasant √à√\u2020\u2022?some pastries, cereals, bread\/toast, yoghurts, cakes, fruit, juice and coffee. We ate at 4 restaurants recommended by the hotel - I 4 Leoni √à√\u2020\u2022?good overall, great tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms- Il Ricci √à√\u2020\u2022?good for fish √à√\u2020\u2022?carpaccio of tuna, swordfish and octopus particularly good, nice setting but averageoverall- Celestino √à√\u2020\u2022?for lunch √à√\u2020\u2022?great lasagne!- Il Garga √à√\u2020\u2022?the best of the lot √à√\u2020\u2022?the calf√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ liver was outstanding as was the risotto with asparagus √à√\u2020\u2022?lovely atmosphere, chef very attentive and celebrated our special event with a complimentary bottle of wine √à√\u2020\u2022?but expensiveBeware, guide prices quoted by the hotel for restaurant prices are conservative √à√\u2020\u2022?you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e normally charged √à√\u2020√ü? each for bread\/covers, √à√\u2020√ü?+ for a carafe of water and 12% service charge. It all mounts up!Tommaso efficiently arranged taxis almost to the minute and booked a carriage tour around Florence and a day tour to Lucca, Pisa and San Miniato (√à√\u2020√ü?9 per head). The carriage tour was supposed to cost √à√\u2020√ü?0 in total for about 20 minutes but after 26 mins of a lovely tour the driver asked for √à√\u2020√ü?00 which we refused and he accepted √à√\u2020√ü?0. The day tour was great as we had the tour to ourselves and our √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√ªuide√à√\u2020\u2022?Paolo, a visual artist, was good with local knowledge and views. This is not a tour, however, where you are guided around the places of interest. You arrive at Lucca and are left to your own devices for 2 hours before meeting up for lunch (included in the cost). This suited us but for others looking for more interaction and information from the guide they would feel somewhat cast adrift. The lunch was a buffet but very good and located in the oldest trattoria in Lucca. We loved Lucca a great deal √à√\u2020\u2022?very clean, lovely views from the walls and great buildings and shopping facilities. Each day we returned for the complimentary √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√ºappy hour√à√\u2020\u2022?between 1830 and 1930 where nibbles of simple bruschetta, tomato relish and crackers were on offer with prosecco white wine or chianti. A time for guests to mix and catch up on the day√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ events, which was a little difficult as the piped music was far too loud.Overall, we would recommend the Davanzati for its great location, friendly staff and pre-arrival information.
