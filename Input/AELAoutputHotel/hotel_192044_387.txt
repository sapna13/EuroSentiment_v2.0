{"text":"Oasis of calm in central London On reading the reviews on this website I booked at short notice through the hotel's useful website. They had a special weekend rate for 2 people which included an upgraded Executive room, fruit bowl, chocolates and wine in the room; choice of breakfast available as room service at no extra charge; and a 3 course dinner  champagne in the hotel's Londinium restaurant.After a particularly stressful drive down the M4, the South Circular and trying to figure out how to get to the hotel entrance via the one-way system around London Bridge Station we made it. Of course, a sensible person wouldn't be bringing their car into London, in which case the hotel is a short walk (100yds) from the station. TIP: if you must drive check the map on the hotel website - you have to go through the setting down point outside the station. Check-in went fine and a reservation for dinner was made.Our room was on the top floor (5th) and pretty much as in the photos on the website. There was a very comfortable king-size bed; a sofa, armchair  coffee table seating area; desk; a walk-in closet more than ample enough to store our luggage; a drawer unit with minibar, kettle, DVD player and large LCD TV. Everything was clean and contemporarily decorated.The hotel did forget the freebie chocolates and fruit, however, on querying this with the reception they were quicky whisked up by room service.Dinner in the Londinium was tasty and the inclusive package we booked allowed us free reign of the menu.After a restful night's sleep room service woke us up with breakfast. Again, hard to fault.Overall, very pleased with the London Bridge experience. Everything was as we would expect for this hotel's price range. In fact on reflection of stays elsewhere, probably better as very little if anything detracted us during our short visit.Would definitely come back for a longer stay but I'll leave the car at home!
