{"text":"Lovely hotel, wonderful location This is a large, modern hotel on the harbour in Kowloon. It's in Hung Hom, which is away from the bright lights and busy atmosphere of the hotels of Tsim Tsa Sui and Nathan Rd. but it's a lovely oasis in a busy, hectic city. The hotel runs a shuttle every 30 minutes that will take you into TST (where you can catch a subway or go shopping or explore on foot). It's a very well-run, clean property with elegant spacious rooms. We booked it as a package with Cathay Pacific, and got a big room with a queen bed, a sofa, table and desk area. The views of the harbour are beautiful, as the hotel is perched right over the waterfront. The neighbourhood (Whampoa) is still full of amenities - lots of very good shops and restaurants including a Pacific Coffee shop up the street, and an amazing supermarket\/dept. store, Jusco, where you can buy everything from a delicious take-out meal (for a criminially low price) to household items, clothing, souvenirs, you name it. The Hung Hom ferry terminal is about a 3 minute walk from the hotel, and the Star Ferry takes you over to Central from there. There's also a big bus zone where you can catch buses around the city close by. Would definitely stay here again, and would choose it over most hotels in the city, including the famed Peninsula (the Harbour Plaza's lobby felt way more elegant than the Penninsula's, which was crowded and loud.)
