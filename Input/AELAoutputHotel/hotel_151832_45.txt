{"text":"Not what its cracked up to be! We were originaly scheduled to stay at At Winds Chime Hotel, however, upon checking in, the A\/C was not working, so we were moved to the Acacia. The staff is nice and the hotel clean, but a few things bothered us. The night clerk can be a bit pushy trying to sell you a tour. There always happened to be exactly 2 cancellations for a tour that was on the next day, and he needed an answer really quick......without giving much info about the tour. One tour we did book with him (the Luminessence Bay Tour) we had $100 stolen out of a supposedly secure van. Upon returning, we mentioned it to the clerk, he denied anyone would do it and refused to investigate the incident - so beware the tour companies the hotel uses! There were water pressure problems almost on a daily basis (no pressure or hot water). The restaurant, which was to be opened in July, was yet to be open, we had to go elsewhere to even get a cup of coffee. The Hotel location is in Condado.......the far edge of Condado, a 5-6 block walk to anything, including restaurants, and almost a mile to the central part of the Condado area. As far as the rooms go, if you are anywhere near the hot tub, bring earplugs, and it wasnt because of the guests - it appeared to be the staff hanging out in it and they were loud! The day before we were to leave, I asked if there was a computer with a printer so I could check in for my flight - I was directed to a internet cafe - 8 blocks away! If you are looking for a full service hotel - this is not the place by far. Next time, We're staying at the Marriott - its worth the extra cost!
