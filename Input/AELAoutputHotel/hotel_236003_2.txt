{"text":"Very quaint quiet European hotel My family and I were very pleasantly surprised by this jewl of a place in Florence. Our travel agent had made the booking on Hotel Connect so were not expecting such an authentic European hotel. There were four of us (my husband and I and two teenagers. We had room Number 1 on the main floor. The room was very spacious including the bathroom and had the two extra single beds in a loft area. The hotel responded to our pre checkin questions via email very promptly. The staff all spoke excellent English. The lady who checked us was very helpful in orienting us to Florence as we only had one day in which to explore the city. She made reservations for us at a nearby restaurant called Aquacotta that we were equally pleased with.I wouldn't have been surprised to hear noise as the buiilding was so old but we didn't. Hopefully though we didn't disturb anyone else as we did have to leave early for our flight home. Our room did open out onto the very lovely garden at the back but we didn't spend enough time in the room to make use of this.We were also quite pleased that the hotel had a computer in the lobby area as well as quite reasonably priced wireless access. It actually worked in contrast to our other experiences in Italy. Perhaps we lucked out!There were only two problems which didn't mar our experience too much - the water from the air conditioner condensed down on to the floor by the patio door leaving a puddle. As well, the first desk clerk upon hearing that we would be leaving before breakfast insisted that we eat breakfast first and said that something would be prepared for us. When we went out early the next morning - the night clerk hadn't prepared anything because no one had left him a note. So we had breakfast at the airport instead. ","annotations":[]}
