{"text":"Stay clear of the Naiboa hotel unless you are happy with a 1\/2 star hotel I have just come back from a stay in the Naiboa Hotel in Punta Cana. First of all, I should comment that the beach is beautiful (although there are nicer Caribean beaches, this beach is more of an Atlantic beach). The pool is clean and pleasant., although the sun loungers should be binned.The staff in the hotel are professional and did their beach given the condition of the hotel. The rooms are an absolute disgrace. We stayed in 2126 for two nights. I have seen better hostals for 10 dollars a night. There was blood and mildrew on the mattress, the bedlinen did not fit the bed properly, sockets were hanging from the wall, the TV did not work and we were told that it this was because of the humidility and it needed to warm up!, the room smelled of mildrew, the bathroom was ancient and worst of all the toilet had a buzzing sound 24\/7 which could never be repaired. We moved to 2187. This was in slightly better shape but overall tired, dated and stinky. We still had an ancient, mildrew mattress base but this time we had a newish, clean mattress. The hotel food was basic and unappealing. The Italien restaurant the worst of them all - the food barely remembles anything Italien! The buffet food is the same ever single day and is enough to get rid of anyone√à?√¨s appetite. I got severe diarrohea after eating in the Mexican restaurant. We didn√à?√¨t even get to try the grill restaurant as it was always booked. Basically we spent all of our time in the Taoni as it felt cleaner. The Naoboa rooms, lobby area and entertainment area are depressing. It feels like you stuck in a time warp and barely mertis a 2 star hotel.I will upload photos in a few days to give readers a chance to see the rooms. I will never ever stay in a RIU hotel again.
