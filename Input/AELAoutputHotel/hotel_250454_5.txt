{"text":"Handy Location great buffet breakfasts I arrived pretty late about 11pm, and the check in was very quick and I got allocated a room on the top floor which was quite good. I don't speak much German and the staff generally spoke pretty good English. I was at the back of the Hotel which was quite good as there was a view over some gardens towards the canal. There were a few 20 floor tower blocks nearby but not close enough to overlook too much. The front of the Hotel would have been noisier as there is a busy 6 lane highway, so the back suited me as I like to open my window rather than just use the aircon.The Hotel seems built to a good standard with wide hallways and spacious rooms, I think it was built about 5 years ago. I was next to the lift which was handy, but the motor could be faintly heard but not enough to be annoying. I think there were 3 lifts and 3 staircases.The bed seemed comfortable and pretty firm which I prefer.One of the best things was the buffet breakfast which gets served till 10.30am. I ate bacon, scrambled eggs, sausages, fat chips then croissants with jam followed up with fruit salad, but this was only a fraction of what was on offer. My aim was to fill up so that I could get by with just a snack during the day which I managed quite well.There was a handy lobby bar for draft pilsner beer etc, and a restaurant where I tried a pasta dish which was not bad for about 10 Euros. There is a handy supermarket only yards from the entrance where I stocked up on German Cheeses, Sausages breads and deserts for when I wanted to snack in some evenings rather than eat out.The Hotel is only a couple hundred yards from the U Bahn Station and this links to Alexanderplatz for getting the S Bahn to the Airport (EUR 2,80). It cost me EUR 38 for a taxi from the Airport (Schoenfeld) to the Hotel.The checkout time was noon and they have a secure place to store bags which was handy as I had a late flight out.
