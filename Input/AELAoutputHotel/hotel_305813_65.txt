{"text":"Great location Myself and my husband stayed here at the end of our honeymoon. We stayed in 3 hotels in Thailand before we arrived in Hong Kong. We had arranged the hotels car pick up service which was fast  efficient. On arrival at the hotel we were being led to the main check-in desk however as we were staying in a club room we shoudve been taken straight up to the lounge to check in. I had emailed the hotel letting them know we were on honeymoon and they said they would have champagne for us but we didnt get any. We were disappointed after the fantastic treatment we received in the hotels in Thailand.The room was on the 38th floor and we had an amazing view and could even see the harbour. We went to the club lounge every evening. We found the drinks selection limited with only one type of red or white wine and on 2 occassions there wasnt any wine left. Champagne was nice though! Sometimes it was hard to relax in the lounge as there was a lot of business deals going on around us. The internet access was handy too except when you had to wait ages to get on a computer.The suite was big and had a kitchen. we didnt use it but look out for the free haagen daz hiding in the freezer!! The bed was so comfy with lots of pillows.The location is excellent and with the fantastic subway system you can get around very easily and cheaply. The markets near the hotel are excellent. We had to buy an extra suitcase (in the market of course) to take all our purchases home. The hotel provide a free guided tour of the markets and shopping near the hotel - this is a great way of getting to know your way around the area. We had breakfast in the hotel and it was plentiful with a great choice. We had the buffet one evening but found it quite expensive. We also used the chuan spa and got massages which were ideal before our long flights home. If you are going to Hong Kong then definately stay here. You are only a few stops away from the harbour area and will get a better experience staying in Mong kok.
