{"text":"Riu POO POO!!! The clue is in the title!!!!!Me  my girlfriend (both 22) stayed at the Riu Bambu for 2 weeks from 19 May - 02 June 2008. First impressions were good the lobby is nice and the room was fine. We went for dinner in the buffet resturant on the first night and trying to be optimisic i would describe the food as OK!!Following on from eating there for a day or two we both had constant diarohia for the remaining 12-13 days. Speaking to various other guests during our stay we did not speak to one person who did not have diarhoria. I am 100% convinced it was the dodgy food!!! I have been fine since leaving the hotel. By the second week of our stay we were sick of eating the same food in the same buffet resturant!!Brief Overview of Food  Drink:Breakfast - probably the best meal of the day, however you get sick of eating the same thing after a few days!!Lunch - The poolside resturant is hot and dirty, the food is the same every day, also the plastic cups are not washed properly.Dinner - Very similar food every night of our stay, the left over food from the night before seems to appear in the next days salads etc. The buffet room is very hot and uncomfortable. Food is generally of a poor cheap standard. Al a Carte Resturants - A REAL LET DOWN!!! The steak house and italian are not al a carte resturants (it is self service soup and starter - same rubbish food as main buffet). The resturants are based in the dirty poolside bar which is converted to resturants at night, the food is also very poor.The Caribe Grill is on the beach front is set in very nice surroundings however the food is again poor. Drinks - The majority of cocktails come prepared in big containers and not freshly prepared (tom cruise style) as we had at the Riu Tequila in Mexico. Beach - Really lovely, however no beach side bar so it is a bit of a hike to get a drink!!Entertainment - Funny and quite good shows!!! Disco - Rubbish, drinks are not included. Pools - Not very clean!!! Staff - 50% Very Friendly \/ 50% very rude!! Reception was always polite and helpful!!Room - beds are rock hard!!To ConcludeWe stayed at the Riu Tequila in May 2006 and it completly knocked spots of this hotel!! Having been to a Riu previously we expected similar standards at the Riu Bambu but came away extremly dissapointed.If you havent booked yet - don't!!! if you can afford I would recommend the Riu Tequila in Playacar Mexico to anyone.P.S - I am not a fussy person, just a typical young 22 year old trying to give a honest opinion. I hope this advise is useful to potential future guests.
