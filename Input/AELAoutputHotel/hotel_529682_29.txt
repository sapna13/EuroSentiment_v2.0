{"text":"Cheap and Cheerful We found Hotel Enza after searching for a budget option in Florence. This seemed like the pick of the bunch, and it certainly was cheap by local standards - √à√\u2020√ü?0 per night, with 10% discount for cash.The hotel is located on a quiet street in the north of the city, 10-15 minutes walk from the main station. Although the area doesn't offer much in terms of immediate entertainment, it is close to the market and you can walk to the Duomo in less than 10 minutes. To this end, the location is fine. There is also a superb trattoria a few minutes away, Trattoria Guelfa (Via Guelfa 103r) which offers amazing local food and homely atmosphere for good prices.There is no lift in the hotel, so be prepared to struggle up some narrow stairs to the first floor reception; then onto your room. The welcome was friendly, and we were led to a perfectly nice room, albeit somewhat dated and jaded. It was very clean, however, and had a good, large bathroom. It also had air conditioning, but literally no view (the window opened onto nothing). The reception area had some cosy sofas, books, and free internet access - as well as a selection of cold drinks for sale.Breakfast was a disappointment. Served in a very small area, you had to book a time-slot in advance. The food on offer amounted to nothing more than cereals and croissants. You could get a very nice fresh coffee made to your tastes, which somewhat made up for that, however!Summing up, Hotel Enza offered excellent value and the location, whilst not perfect, was good enough. For budget travellers, we'd certainly recommend it.
