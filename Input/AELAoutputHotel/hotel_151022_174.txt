{"text":"The HORROR! I have travelled all over the Caribbean and stayed in all kinds of hotels and resorts and never been sick to my stomach but this place had the most awful food (I have a hard time even calling it food) that I have had to endure. The buffet had food sitting out in the heat for hours with no refrigeration. The chicken was pink on the inside and the other meats were over cooked, the burgers were pre cooked and boiled... yes boiled. The a la carte restaurants were not much better other than the steak place which had nice staff and food that was kind of ok, someone should tell them that sliced cheese is not parmesan amongst other things though. The seafood restaurant was so bad that we took one bite of our appetizers and just looked at the burnt main course and walked out after being unable to get any lobster out of the shell and not recognizing the mystery brown fluid on top of the lobster. We asked for drinks 3 times before getting any and butter 4 times before it was actually tossed on the plate with attitude. The buffet runs out of food close to 9:15pm when they are supposed to be open till 10pm. We were told that they had no more red wine in the restaurant at 9:20pm. This may actually have been a blessing for anyone who actually likes half decent wine since it's beyond terrible as is the beer. I would have been happy to pay for good wine or beer, I'm not a big drinker but do appreciate a nice glass of wine with dinner or the odd beer on the beach. If you enjoy unsanitary conditions in your eating establishments, waiters who don't wash their hands after using the bathroom (yes I witnessed this), violent stomach cramps and diarrhea, then you'll love the restaurants at Natura Park!I should have known something was not right the day we got there. My room had a funky odour and the air conditioning worked when it wanted to. The bathroom was infested by ants and I saw quite a few cockroaches in my room as well during the week. The second day my electricity went out completely and no one at the front desk cared or did anything. The locks on the doors are pointless and anyone could just give it a kick and be in the room in an instant.The staff were so unqualified to work in the hospitality industry that I swear that they just hired whoever showed up. They were rude, lazy and dishonest. Room service takes hours to get to the room, usually after 3-5 calls. By the time it gets to you hot dishes are disgustingly cold and cold dishes have been sitting out of the refrigerator for hours. You have to go to the bars to get ice and then they wont fill up your bucket. It's an all inclusive resort right?... nope... the mini bar is full of stuff they charge for, including WATER!!! That's if they actually re stock it or if it even gets cold. Ask to talk to the manager and you'll likely be told he's taking a nap, seriously.Now for the good points...I need a minute to actually think of any. Oh yeah, the weather was fantastic however if they could have ruined that I'm sure that they would have. The grounds were quite well kept and the rooms were nice enough. The beach was nice but there was a lot of seaweed and try and find a lounge chair, good luck after 6:30 am. This is common though at many resorts.Well that's about all I can think of for the good. So all in all a terrible place that I could never ever recommend to anyone I actually like. I can't understand how anyone could ever give the Natura Park a good review. What a shame since it's in a nice location with great possibilities. Do yourselves a favour and go somewhere else and you'll never know how lucky you were to avoid Natura Park Beach - EcoResort  Spa, which is neither a Eco resort nor a spa.Wishing you a great vacation.
