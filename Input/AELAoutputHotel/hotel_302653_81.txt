{"text":"Nice hotel but needs a revamp We stayed at the Melia for 9 nights in July as part of our honeymoon and had an enjoyable time. The complex is quite big and you can get a little lost in it at first. The pool area is quite nice and has a bit of a jungle feel to it with all the palm trees etc. There are several restaurants in the complex which are not bad, but they do have very good buffet nights which are better value. The restaurant prices are extremely high, so it is much better for you to go to the 'Bali Collection' shopping centre next door which has nice restaurants for half the price.Reading the other reviews there were loads of comments about the damp. We figured it out!! When we got there we refused to stay in our room as the sheets were damp and the smell was disgusting. So we complained and they moved us to a bigger room where it was not as bad (but was still there). When we went into the room it was very cold and we turned off the aircon....the next day the damp was gone and the room was fine. When the cleaners came in each day they kept putting back on the aircon and we kept turing it back off!So if you have booked to go to this hotel remember to keep the aircon off!!For activites we recommend the 'Waka Land Cruise' which brings you in a landrover into the middle of the island so that you can see the real Bali, and we also went on a 'castaway cruise' with Bali Hai cruises (this was the best day we had on our whole honeymoon!!)
