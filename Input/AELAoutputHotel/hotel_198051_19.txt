{"text":"Recently renovated hotel in great location We stayed at this hotel in mid-May for a wedding we were attending in Paris. We didn't have particularly high expectations, but were very pleasantly surprised by the property.As others have said, the location could not be better. In the heart of St. Germain-de-Pres, just a hop skip and a jump from some of the livliest parts of the Left Bank. A short walk to Notre Dame and the Seine, too, as well as the Maubert Metro station. About as central as you can get if you want to stay on the south side of the river.As for the hotel itself, while the rooms are small, they all appear to have been very recently renovated with nice hardwood floors and bathrooms with modern fixtures and designs. We showed up with our 18-month old, and they put us in room 501, a room that seemed a bit bigger than those our relatives were staying in, and just fit the little portable crib we brought for our son to sleep in. Some relatives complained that higher-priced rooms were no bigger than average-priced rooms, but we had no such problems.Staff was almost universally great. One woman at the front desk was a bit brusque with us, but the man who was there most of the time was extremely friendly and helpful...spoke perfect English and indulged me when I tried my broken French on him. For the price and location, I think this is a great choice for a budget hotel in the heart of Paris.
