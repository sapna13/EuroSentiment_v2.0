{"text":"Good value hotel with large bedrooms We have just returned from a four night stay at this hotel and were very pleased with our choice. We booked through the Accor website and the fourth night stay was half price. The rooms are a very good size with a standard layout of a king size bed and a single bed. There is a type of screen that can be pulled over to divide the room. Some people might find the mattress a little hard but we had no problems. The toilet and bathroom are separate and there is a separate shower as well as a shower spray with the bath. There is plenty of storage and hanging space. There was a bonus of a kettle, microwave and fridge and small sink. However they only provide paper cups so would be worth taking your own cups and plastic spoons plus a few extra teabags and coffee! There is a small supermarket around the corner for stocking up the fridge!The room was very clean and once the window was closed we were not disturbed by noise from inside or outside the hotel. There is air conditioning but it was not that efficient.The reception staff were efficient and friendly and when we had a small leak in our kitchen area sink it was dealt with by the time we came back to the hotel that afternoon.You could have free croissants and coffee\/tea in the foyer but we used the Bistro Stressemann for breakfast, just across the road on the corner. Excellent breakfast served up to 4pm for about 4 euros. As to position, the hotel is pretty central, one stop on the underground to Potsdamer Platz, and walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie. There are also buses near the hotel for getting about. We bought a 3 day transport pass for Berlin, well worth the money and it also gave you discount to get into museums etc. Do visit the VanDeWi department store and the amazing food floor! We would recommend Potsdamer Platz for a large choice of restaurants to eat in the evening.
