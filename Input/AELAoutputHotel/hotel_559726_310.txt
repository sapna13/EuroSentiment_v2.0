{"text":"Good choice in Waikiki Our room on the 11th floor was small, but freshly decorated in a palm tree theme. Very attractive. Granite counter in the bathroom. Desk, microwave in a cabinet, little chest of drawers and a small closet. Nice to have a coffee maker, but the cleaning staff NEVER replaced the coffee or cleaned the pot. Made me mad every time I had to go down to the desk to get more. Had a nice little deck with two chairs and though the view was just of other highrises and there was always construction noise going on, it was somehow still pleasant to sit out there. We got an incredible deal through [----] that included the flight from Las Vegas to Honolulu and the hotel for 5 nights. I had booked for our friends as well and their reservation at the hotel was lost and they had to hassle that at the desk for 10-15 minutes. Finally gave them an inferior room on the 3rd floor. The continental breakfast is very lame. There's a basket with apples, oranges and bananas, some little muffins and a coffee maker. You have to find a seat in the lobby to eat. There's a coffee shop very nearby and Cheeseburger Waikiki a short walk away. Starbuck's is also walkable. We got into the habit of walking to the Shore Bird at the Outrigger for a really nice buffet breakfast with a great view. The lunch and dinner options are numerous even if you don't want to go downtown. Chart House and Outback are very close as are many little places to eat. We had other friends staying there that had a room with a bed and a sofa that made into a bed and that made their room much more spacious. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
