{"text":"Simply Beautiful The hotel was beautiful. The rooms were clean and the property is absolutely gorgeous. Taking the train around the resort was very exciting for our two little ones. We had a great time. The staff was very helpful and very friendly. We enjoyed our stay and would definitely return. The food was ok. The best restaurant is the Japanese. The rest of the food was just ok. So if food is not an issue than this is the place for you. It's not bad by any means it's just ok...The Dominican Food and Desserts were very good at the buffets. The restaurants were beautiful and this did not feel like an all inclusive resort by any means. The liquor was always flowing and the drinks were seldom weak. The house wine was even ok. The only problem we had with the resort was the Sol Melia Vacation Club. They make you attend a 90 min. presentation. They hunt you down, they call your room, they bribe you with restaurant reservations and gifts in order to get you to attend the presentation. I felt like we were being stalked after telling them 1000 times we were not interested. The whole family had to attend and my 4 and 6 year old were not interested. It was a waste of time for everyone. But the valets who work on the resort get a commision from the club if you attend and buy. Finally after 2 days of this we met one of the vacation club reps who was great and we explained to him that we were not interested at this time and felt pressured into the meeting He was understanding and we enjoyed his company during breakfast. We did not have to go through with the rest of the tour thank god. Overall it ws worth going, we had a great time and would go back. Hope this helped!
