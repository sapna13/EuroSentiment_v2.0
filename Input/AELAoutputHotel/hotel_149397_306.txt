{"text":"A week in Paradise! Traveled with a group of 28, 10 high school seniors and parents April 6 - 13, through Apple\/Cleveland. The only complaint would be cooler water and little water pressure at prime shower times, but the cool water felt good on sunburned skin. We heard of the fire before arriving and the staff did a wonderful job of compensating. Beach buffets on both sides of the beach with grilled hot dogs, burgers, steaks, chicken, pork chops, peppers, tomatoes, daily. We could also hop on the shuttle to Chopin or main buffet for wonderful lunches wtih all the fixings. Chopin was opened daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner as well as main buffet. The fire scene was boarded up, restrooms were still available on both sides of the beach as was a beach bar. Most people had to ask where was the fire? There was no ash, no smell, and little hammering, from where we found to sit near the beach or pool.  We tipped for our first drink each day and received wonderful, and quick service always. No one out of 28, got sick. We ate fruits, veggies, cheeses, etc. Our seniors wanted to disco so we went to Areito, beside the other Princess hotels, and had a good, safe time. Some enjoyed the Casino. Dinner privileges at the other hotel - Le Petite Fondue, was enjoyed by all. We also enjoyed walking to the other Princess Hotels for lunch at the Crepery and drinks and dips in their pools. We were welcomed by their staff. We also took a snorkeling tour and the Safari Jeep tour, both were amazing! Food and drinks were plentiful and great selection even for the picky eaters in the group. We enjoyed the night time entertainment and dancing with the entertainment staff each evening after the show.The Bavarro Princess staff goes out of their way to make sure that your vacation is a week in paradise!
