{"text":"Great Hotel I stayed here with a friend for a fortnight in June and honestly could not fault the hotel. It is situated in an ideal location, within walking distance of all of Sydney's main attractions. Darling Harbour, Sydney's nicest area is a half hour walk through the city centre. Hyde Park and Botanic gardens are 10 minutes away, The Rocks is a 45 minute walk, The Opera House half an hour and the town centre and CBD less than that. Also near the hotel is the lively Kings Cross area which never closes (although the hotel is located just far enough away that it isn't noisy) and many great restaurants and bars which Alan who runs the hotel was more than happy to recommend. In the two weeks we stayed the only time we used public transport was to travel out of Sydney once for the Blue Mountains and also to the airport. Even Bondi beach is only a 2 hour brisk and enjoyable walk from the hotel.The hotel itself far exceeded our expectations. A hidden gem of a hotel that could easily charge far more than it does (it costs less than some hostels!). It is small and friendly with lots of little extra touches in decor and amenities that make it just that bit more special. The reception\/lounge area is at once warm and friendly with a very nice atmosphere. There is a small bar and pool table which is nice if you are just wanting a quiet afternoon or night in, and a breakfast bar with cereals and toast to start the day. The rooms themselves are clean and nicely decorated, and surprisingly spacious for a small hotel.Adding to the friendly atmosphere of the hotel are the staff who are all incredibly helpful. The owner Alan was always offering us excellent advice for where to eat or places to visit, and him and the staff just added to our excellent holiday. All in all I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. Excellent for a short or long term stay, you would struggle to find a nicer hotel in Sydney, and especially not for the price of the AltamontChris ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1253,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1249},{"endOffset":1413,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1408},{"endOffset":1413,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1408}]}
