{"text":"Pluses outweigh minuses, amazing location The Hotel Plaza Mayor is a great value in an amazing touristy location.It is a half-block away from Plaza Mayor, 5 minutes or so from Sol, and walk-able to everywhere (from Palacio Real to Prado \/ Sofia), easily accessible from the airport. I stayed there in Jan. 07 for 60 euro a night, a good bargain imho. There are lots of places to eat nearby, I esp. liked a bakery on C. Mayor (La Mallorquina) and a chain restaurant called Cerveceria 100 Montaditos (near Sol, also on C. Mayor).In response to other reviewers. I was able to check in early (off season). I didn't have any problems with the heat, it was perfect. I didn't have any problems with the lighting, but I can see why someone would complain. Noise, as mentioned by others, can be a problem. If it's really loud outside, you can be bothered, but the street noises weren't that bad to me. In some rooms (like mine), the pipes can be very loud, i.e. you can be startled by your neighbor turning on their sink. The room was small, but still a bargain given the location \/ price, I think.The hotel staff was super, as were their email responses. There's a vending machine (a big plus to me) in the lobby as well as internet access for a small fee. There are several groceries nearby, and a supermarket near Sol in Corte Ingles (basement) and a real market down near Plaza d'Villa (on Mayor).All in all, a great bargain. May not be the place for a special occasion (i.e. honeymoon). The pluses outweigh the minuses.Oh, their contact info is info@h-plazamayor.com. ","annotations":[]}
