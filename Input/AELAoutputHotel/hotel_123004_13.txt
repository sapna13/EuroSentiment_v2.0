{"text":"Mixed Feelings, Overall Okay... Unfortunately, I don't have any photos of the hotel this time as I was traveling with a group and didn't spend enough time at the hotel. We were only staying at this hotel for one night. The location is very close to the Space Needle \/ Experience Music Project. Right out front is Aurora Avenue, a confusing intersection, and a long tunnel entrance. Driving around the immediate area was very confusing because you cannot cross parts of Aurora due to the tunnel entrance. The Denny Street intersection one block south is another very confusing intersection too. Other than the noisy confusing location, the hotel is a great location just out of the main downtown area and still close enough to walk practically anywhere downtown if you're up to it. We walked from the hotel all the way down to the Aquarium in a short period of time. The hotel has 6 floor and two elevators, both of which were VERY slow. We gave up many times and just took the stairs, even though we were staying on the top floor. They seriously need to put in some more dependable, faster ones. The hotel also has underground parking for $10 a night, but we did not use it. When you first enter the lobby, it looks a little blah...not much decoration for such a large space. The front desk clerks were very nice and helpful including Kaleena! She helped us arrange buses to and from the Mariner's game way on the other side of downtown. They even stored our luggage when we were not in the room and away from the hotel. On the ground floor, the hotel offers a nice warm swimming pool, but surprisingly, no hot tub. Just adjacent to the pool is the breakfast room which was very busy and was hard to find a table at times. The food was very good, just like most Holiday Inn Express's since they have the same menus.  The rooms were a little on the small side with the bathrooms being the smallest. Wow, I think they were the smallest bathrooms that I had ever used! The rooms were very clean though, nice housekeeping staff. Top floor rooms have a partial view of the city on the backside and the Space Needle on the front side. For one night, the rooms were fine. If you're not too worried about glitz and glamour such as the Fairmont Olympic and other 4  5 star hotels downtown, this place isn't too bad for the price. Everything in Seattle is expensive so we weren't too shocked at the over $100 price tag on the rooms. Compared to other hotels in the immediate area, this was certainly the nicer. It's a safe area and close to most attractions. Would I return, mmmm, probably not, just because there is such a wide selection of other hotels that I would love to try. It's just an average hotel in the middle of a very busy city.
