{"text":"Ask for a room facing away from the street I just returned from a weeklong stay at the Halcyon. I was combining a couple of days' vacation with attendance at a professional conference, and was looking for a reasonably priced place that was close to public transit and the overpriced hotel hosting the conference. The Halcyon was a good, but not perfect, choice, and I would stay there again. I had only a few problems:*The Halycon occupies the middle ground between the notorious Tenderloin and the upscale Nob Hill neighborhood. I was aware of this fact when I booked the room, and the night manager matter-of-factly told me that the blocks immediately to the south of the hotel were seedy but not overly dangerous. I'm an urban dweller who lives in a neighborhood that has a few rough edges, so I always felt reasonably safe, even when I was alone after dark. However, other solo female travelers might not feel as confident as I did.*My room overlooked the street. As a result, it was extremely sunny but also extremely noisy. The nightclub down the street, the fire station up the street, and the City of San Francisco's 6:00AM trash pickup and street repair projects made for an incredibly sleep-deprived experience; by the end of the week, I was numb with exhaustion. The next time I stay at the Halcyon, I'll insist on having a room that faces away from the street. *The bathroom showed its age; fussy travelers might find it unacceptable. The space between the tiny sink, which has seen better days, and the bathtub was so tight that I had to move sideways to get to the toilet. Despite these problems, the Halycon has a lot to recommend it:*The night manager, who lives on the property, was extremely helpful. He gave me a quick overview of the neighborhood and a city map when I checked in, and he cheerfully answered my questions throughout the duration of my stay.*The room was small, but it more than met my needs, and the bed was surprisingly comfortable despite being extremely firm. *I really appreciated having a coffeemaker, toaster, microwave, fridge, and dishes\/glasses\/cutlery in the room; there was even a supply of first-rate coffee waiting for me! My first day's exploration in the city took me right past a supermarket, and I came back to the hotel laden with provisions. Apart from a couple of dinners out with friends, I ate all my meals in my room--I saved money and stuck to my diet.*The bathtub--a huge clawfoot beast--and the shower curtain surrounding it were spotlessly clean. Soaking in that tub after a long day climbing up and down San Francisco's many hills really soothed my aching legs and feet and allowed me to reflect on the events of the day. By the end of my stay, I viewed the bathroom--even the battered sink--as quaint.*The wireless Internet connection (no additional fee) enabled me to stay in touch with work and friends, work on some of my own Web stuff, and plan excursions on public transportation.
