{"text":"Not Hot .. if You Can Avoid the Stay Please do so  We booked a room with two beds. Upon arrival, all goes well until my sister and I get to the room, this room only had 1 bed. We called the reception desk they told us they would bring a bed to the room, lord only know what they were going to bring us (a fold out?). During our wait we inspected the room, the bathroom looked old, the sheets seemed unwashed, the mattress was falling apart, the pillows didn't have pillow covers, discusting, there was one towel in the bathroom. We had a wedding to attend at the resort and to avoid being late, I went to the reception desk to try and speed things up. I got nothing but attitude and a reluctance to help, when I requested another room, the guy at the desk aimed his employee badge at me, as if that was supposed to scare me or something. The man's name Epilio. Epilio went over the the individual that set us up originally and told him, in spanish, take care of your own [--], i'm not fixing this crap for you. Knowing I understood every word. Juan, not sure about the name, he moved us to another room with two bed and pillow covers. At that point I had realized that if i didn't know the language, I would have been screwed. We got to the other room to find it tolerable, but did notice that the mini fridge had never been cleaned and the refreshments in it looked 20 years old. Went to shower and discovered there was no water pressure. I was forced to shower under a trickle of water.  I was happy I did not bring my son along on this trip.The beach is beautiful, if this is supposed to be a family friendly resort, I didn't understand why every one was top less. The hotel should post that kind of activity, since it is allowed around children. I know i didn't get the memo.The food was mediocre, We were careful on what we chose, there fruit selection was poor (no strawberry's, oranges, grapes etc) there salad selection was poor, all they had was lettuce. Whatever was at the snack shop was not at all edible. The activities were minimal, nothing to do, and what there was to do was an extra additional cost. The highlight of the evenings were the shows, Michael Jackson show and the Dominican show.I have always known the people of DR to be very happy and helpful, this is my first experience encountering the oppisite at this resort.
