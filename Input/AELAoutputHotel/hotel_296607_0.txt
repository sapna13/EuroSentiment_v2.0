{"text":"Great location!, Decent Hotel First of all amsterdam is very expensive, for example a standard pint of beer is 5 euros (not so bad back in the day, but now when the pound is roughly equal the euro, this is very expensive!). So for the cost of 160 euros each for 4 nights (mid week) was good. The hotel is located within 5 mins from central station (just across the street - just watch out for the crazy cyclists!!!). Clean and modern outside and reception (maybe updated from previous reviews?) Close (well within actually!) the heart of amsterdam. Room was clean, tidy, and spacious (absolutely no rats or bed bugs! - again maybe cleansed since prev reviews). Since the smoking ban ther hotel is no smoking (however next to my room 125, there was a door to a kind of unofficial pattio ,which was left open, where we smoked!) Staff were ok (sometimes a bit cold, but maybe thats the dutch for you?). A few points to mention, the mini bar is moderately expensive (2.50 euro for a mars or soft drink, 3 euro for beer - about a 200-300% mark up from local shops, although some shops were just as expensive for the drinks!), i ended up spending 80 euros on the minibar over a 4 night stay so not that bad - its holiday! Another thing is we wewre only given 1 key for a 3 person bedroom, however we stayed as a group anyway! Just to mention amsterdam in general i found very safe, Lots of police about, even the red light distrit is pleaseantly safe (you WILL be approached by drug dealers - just say no!), i was often by myself at night while i waited for my friends - had no problems wat soever! Overall good hotel, but amsterdam is very expensive, alot worse that london and other major capitals i have visited (madrid is very good!) so start savibg and saty at multatuli!!!
