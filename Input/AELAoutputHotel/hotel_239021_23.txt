{"text":"Depends on what you expect! Me and a group of friends stayed here for a 21st birthday trip to Amsterdam and were happy with what we recieved. Yes the breakfast is VERY limited but they serve the most fabolous chocolate milk. The staff are divided in half, one half are great and you can spend hours talking to, the other half are the total opposite. The location is a slight walk but in a quiet and decent area. There are no crack-heads bothering you for money around here. Wether or not you enjoy your experience here will totally depend on what you want from a hotel. most of the good hotels are based on the outskirts of the city anyway, its mainly only the hostels that are right in the centre, It isnt the best hotel by far but its certainly not the worst either. our friend were scattered around the city as there were limited places available and we payed the least and had the best hotel. Try the Eden or the Atlanta. Not stayed in these but look good for similar price range.The rooms arent very big but are warm. The shower was a death trap, changing from nice warm water to scalding within lighting speed. bath works no problem. Has a good lift, has a safe in the room.....Use it. We didnt mind the walk to places, it doesnt take long, plus lets you see a bit more of the city. i personally thought it was in a good position, it was a five minute walk to everywere, some have attractions near but others miles away.Has a t.v. that doesnt really work. But at the end of the day, it provided a safe environment to lay your head at the end of a night. if youre expecting the ritz then dont stay here, you get what you pay for... It may cost more but its the difference between a good and bad trip, ","annotations":[{"endOffset":223,"mention":"chocolate milk","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_milk"],"startOffset":209},{"endOffset":1070,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1066},{"endOffset":1070,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1066},{"endOffset":1070,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1066}]}
