{"text":"Overpriced and not trendy After much research and what we thought would be a hip and trendy area, we were very much dissappointed with the hotel and the area. Yes the entrance of the hotel looks like South Beach Miami but the rooms are not. Just to give you an idea of our taste, I'm 28 and my boyfriend's 37, we've traveled pretty much to all the top destinations internationally. We consider ourselves part of the trendy crowd and easy to please. We usually hit the new trendy clubs but also traffic sports bars and wine bars. From the pictures posted on the hotel's website I'd say the photographer did an amazing job but in real life the furniture looked like it was purchased from Ikea, small rooms with a small closet area, the restrooms - shower does not have a sliding door or curtain nor exhaust fans to remove humidity - basically you'll have to crack the window in the shower to let out the humidity and let in hot air, plus you'll end up with water splashing out of the shower and into the restroom. Big mess and I can assure you I'm pretty low maintenance, this stuff usually doesn't bother me but I was annoyed by how much we payed, I expected 5 star hotel amenities for that price. And lastly the pool was dirty and the nice view blocked by the dirty safety glass around it.Hotel food is overpriced, instead we opted for a hotdog from one of the vendor's on the beach, yummy and only $2.00 each, oh and they come with shoe string fries on top. My boyfriend and I found better options in Old San Juan. The best food and atmosphere was here in Old San Juan. Try Dragonfly or Tantra restaurants. We tried several restaurants in Old San Juan area and were never dissappointed, can't wait to go back to eat here. In Old San Juan you will also find nice nightlife, not chic and trendy but better than what the Beach  Water Club has to offer. Back at the Beach  Water Club - beautiful lounge and you'll hear hip hop and some salsa all night long, would be nice if they alternated the music a little. We tried out the hotel's lounge one night and the music was way too loud, lounder than a club, I asked if they could turn it down a notch and they said no, crazy since I noticed other patrons were annoyed by it too, I'm sure I was not the first nor the last to request this. Anyway their response was, they were trying to bring in people from the other clubs around the area, not sure why since the crowd was kinda young and rowdy - Spring Break crowd - the lounge has a rooftop but is open all around, basically their theory was play the music loud enough so that everyone in a five block radius can hear it and come party. The best club we found at the time was at the casino, even Tommy Lee and his buddies partied there that night. I think as long as the music is enjoyabe and you're with good company then you'll have a good time.Things I recommend to try while in Puerto Rico - While there we toured the Bacardi factory, very fun and even better with free drinks. We also did the rainforest, loved it. FYI - wear you're bathing suit under your clothes so you can enjoy a nice cool dip by the waterfall, you'll need it after the trek down to it. Things I liked about this hotel, only two - the beach is beautiful and the lounge has a great view. Overall I give this hotel a 2.5 stars out of 5 because of the lack of hotel amenities, overpriced for the quality, the staff is not very friendly with the exception of the boutique owner - he's a sweetheart. We will not be staying at this hotel again. This hotel is lost when it comes to which crowd they are catering too. I recommend this hotel to the Spring Break crowd.My advice - The best part of town to stay in is Old San Juan, rent a car and drive out to the beach since it is public. .
