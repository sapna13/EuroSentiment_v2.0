{"text":"Great Experience at the Radisson Read a lot of the reviews about the Radisson in San Juan, P.R. and many were negative. I got a great rate through Priceline for two rooms at $80.00 per night for each room. We were travelling with two friends and were looking for a nice motel at a good rate, since it was in the low season.Although apprehensive due to many of the reviews I had read about the hotel, I made up my mind to take them at face value and be open minded and not have unrealistic expectations. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!*Check-In was seemless and smooth. The clerk could not have been more kind, professional, or nice.*They up-graded us to mini-suites complete with a separate sitting room with an extra T.V. and bar area with a dorm fridge.* Housekeeping was wonderful-greeted us each morning as we were leaving and even wished us well on our last night and said goodbye due to she was going to be off on the day we were departing.*My room card got de-activated and I called from our friends room and maintenance came immediately and tried their master key to see if it was the lock and went down and personally got me new room key cards.*Hotel management staff were present each time walking the floors when we were leaving and returning to the hotel. They were obviously inspecting all areas of the hotel.*Beach was only 1 city block away!*Many great restaurants were within walking distance to the hotel. *Parking was plentiful- never had a hard time finding a place to park.*Upon leaving, we realized that we had left our backpack in the parking lot and we immediately called the hotel and they already had it at the front desk. *Would I stay there again- absolutely!Go to Fajardo and do the snorkeling excursion on the Traveler catamaran. The crew was awesome and it was the highlight of our trip. There was two other companies that were at each of the two locations that we sailed to. These take you to the bluest waters you will ever see. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":269,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":265}]}
