{"text":"If the W Chain Had Motels, it would look like this Lest the debate over this property continue, I join in the fray. I just completed a two night stay at the Clarendon. Overall, it was a very enjoyable experience--above all because I kept my expectations in check. In short, the Clarendon is a quirky, boutique MOTEL-like property, with a truly wonderful staff that makes you overlook--and forgive some of the problems you may encounter. At no time did I confuse (or attempt to compare) the Clarendon with the W hotel, or other up-market hotels or resorts (as others before have). But then again, I paid considerably less than I would have at such other hotels. Yes, the beds are wonderful (and perhaps are the same as used by Ritz, or the Four Seasons), the linens\/towels are high quality (certainly well above a motel), the bathroom was kitted with Aveda bath products, and the flat screen TV in my junior suite was nicer than the one in my home. These were the amenities I truly appreciated and which make the Clarendon better than a motel. However, the basic feel and layout is that of a motel. The size of the bathroom was awful. Not until the final morning did I finally get hot water in my shower; the rooms and hallways (though painted in funky colors and motifs) are disgusting concrete; there is only so much anyone can do with that. The air conditioning was a joke ( the temperatures were already soaring above 90 degreees outside and the room air conditioner could not keep up. I cannot imagine what it will be like in the Summer). If only the water in my shower was as warm as the air from the air conditioner. The restaurant and bar was closed during my 2 nights stay, and the workout rooms were dark and dingy. Finally, the staff is not set up to accomodate business people. The fax machine ran out of paper and I had to bring that to their attention when I did not get my complete document, another time when I had to send out a fax, even though I brought it down at 5am (which should have indicated some degree of urgency to get it out), the staff did not send out the fax for 3 hours, and finally, one fax that I received on my first day was not presented to me until checkout! The only reason I did not loose it was that I had just been presented my bill, which was ridiculously reasonable. You are not nickeled and dimed to death on phone calls or other service charges here. And as I said earlier, the staff is so nice, so helpful, and so eager to please (though they may fall below the mark), you cannot get angry at them. So, all in all, as long as you are not expecting to stay at the W hotel, or a resort, but instead are looking for a great central location, very reasonable prices, and some nice extras that make this property well above your typical motel, you will be content. The next time I am in Phoenix, if I can afford (or am willing to splurge for) the Biltmore, I will stay there. But if not, I will be happily returning to the Clarendon. I just hope they do something about the a\/c in the rooms. This is Phoenix, you know.
