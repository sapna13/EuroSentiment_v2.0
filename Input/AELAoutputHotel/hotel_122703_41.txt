{"text":"Average Hotel I stayed at the Grand Hyatt because it was conveniently located near the airport. I had a friend coming in town for a 3-day weekend. I got lost on the way to the hotel and the clerks were rude and uncaring, they kept telling me they knew where I was, but couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ direct me where to go. When I asked them to plug an address into one of the online maps to get directions for me, they refused. I was shocked and appalled, at the lack of customer service. The hotel is great as far as my guest was concerned. All she had to do was go to her gate since the Hotel is located inside of the airport. The rooms were okay, at best pretty average. The bathroom, from a female's perspective was really nice, I liked the separate shower. The maid service was terrible. The first day we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ need our room cleaned. The second day all they did was turn down the covers, they did not change the sheets. This was extremely disappointing. We had to call them to come back and change the sheets. We felt nickel and dimmed at every turn. They were charging 5 bucks for the water that we could have stopped at a gas station and bought for less than a dollar. It is disappointing to see the hospitality industry moving towards the pay more receive less mentality. I will not stay at the Grand Hyatt again; the service I received was sub par. I will not recommend this hotel to friends. There are other hotels just as close to the Airport that would be a better choice.
