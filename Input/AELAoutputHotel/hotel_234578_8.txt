{"text":"Great place, but don't use the phone!!! Before I forget, one word of advice for the Park Hotel (which probably applies to most Spanish hotels? not sure): DO NOT USE THE PHONE IN YOUR ROOM. They don't disclose this in any place, but you will be charged 60 euro cents\/minute for a local call. Yep, even if you're calling the restaurant next door. AND, I found to my dismay, even for calling a toll-free number. I had to change some travel arrangements with an airline, and called their Spain toll-free number. When I checked out, I was charged nearly 20 euro. Yikes. I told the management that they should make this clear in their phone instructions, especially because in the USA toll-free calls are always free, even from hotel phones. I travel frequently in Europe and have never been charged this much for a phone call. That being said, I very much liked the Park Hotel. Booked through Venere.com and was very happy with everything-- the price, the location, and the room itself. The staff was friendly (though I'm sure the guy at the front desk was silently cursing me while discussing the phone call charge). My room was very small, as a single, but perfect for me, very comfortable, with its own thermostat for A\/C, and super clean. I also appreciated the user-friendly safe in the closet, so I could lock up my passport and wallet during the day and only carry a bit of cash with me (I'd heard Barcelona was famous for pick-pocketing. and the second night a woman 3 feet from me on a main street had her purse snatched. That's when I decided to leave the valuables in the hotel safe!) The bathroom was huge and had a full sized tub, which was heavenly after spending four days in London in a hostel. Great TV, including BBC world and National Geographic. Wonderful breakfast- eggs, bacon to fruit and cereal. Walking distance to the old city center (and the beach, though I wouldn't recommend Barcelona's beaches), and the Estacio de Franca across the street (a beautiful old station, not scummy like some city train stations) makes getting to the airport a dream. Even if you arrive at Sants station, you can jump on the airport trian (C10) in the opposite direction and be at Franca in 5 minutes. A great find, highly recommended. Barcelona in August is another story... avoid it! The quality of the hotel was probably the best thing about my stay there. I'd love to go back during another season of the year.
