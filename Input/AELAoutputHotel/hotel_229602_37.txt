{"text":"Wonderful Hotel Booked this hotel based on Rick Steves Paris Tour Book. Very well located in the Rue Cler area. Very quiet location. We had a superior room on the 3rd floor with a view of the Eiffel Tower - lovely. When we checked in we mentioned Rick Steves Book and were given complimentary breakfast - saved money and was delicious. Room service of the complimentary breakfast was also included. The room and bathroom were a nice size for Europe and clean with very adequate air conditioning. It is not terribly hot in Paris but can be very muggy and humid so the air conditioning is welcome. Plus you can keep the window closed avoiding listening to the street noise. We spent 8 days there and were very comfortable. The rooms have an electric room darkening shade that is great. The only problem was that sometimes with jet lag we woke late because of the darkness. The staff was always helpful and internet access was free and very accessible in the lobby. The area has many restaurants to choose from and is within easy walking of the metro. It was also conveniently located to the #69 bus which traverses the city and all the major historical sites. We knew of this bus from reading Rick Steves book. The Eiffel Tower was about a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel and since it stays light out until 10:30 PM a late picnic at the tower was very nice after a long day sightseeing. Would definitely stay at this hotel again and thank Rick Steves for the recommendation.
