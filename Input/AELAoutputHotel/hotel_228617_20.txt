{"text":"Good hotel a bit far from the action We have just returned from an 8 night stay at this hotel, booked via Priceline for 30 UK pounds per night. The hotel is a fine 4* establishment with large well-maintained, clean rooms, professional staff and a reasonably priced bar \/ cafe as well as a couple more upmarket restaurants.Good points:- The minibar in our room had plenty of space for us to store our own groceries; air conditioning was efficient and not noisy; comfortable, clean beds with regularly changed sheets; large bathroom with decent shower and toiletries; secure safe in the room.Couple of minor irritants: no tea or coffee making facilities in the room; took three requests to get an iron  ironing board delivered; very limited television channels - the only thing in English was Eurosport - and many of the other channels were unwatchable due to poor reception.Main drawback: distance to city centre. It's about 6 miles away from where most of the action is. However, the St Marti de l'Erm tram stop is a couple of minutes walk away, which gets you to Palau Reial in about 15 minutes and from there you can pick up the excellent Metro Line 3. Trams and Metros are easy to use and very good value. Also from Palau Reial you can get onto the Bus Turistic - a fantastic tourist bus service which was a brilliant way to get our bearings of the city in our first couple of days. The books of discount vouchers which came with the tickets, particularly 2 for the price of 1 at Port Aventura, more than recouped the price of the bus tickets.
