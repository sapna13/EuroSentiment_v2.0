{"text":"LOVED the Globus I'm having a hard time understanding the bad reviews- my boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 days over New Years, and it was an absolutely wonderful choice. My only complaint would be that you have to walk up a flight of stairs to get to the lobby- but anyone reading this site would know that before they book. Also, the staff heard us come in with our luggage and rushed down to help us carry everything up. They also helped when we left.We booked a double superior room- I believe it was Room # 201, and it was wonderful. It was not tiny- I would describe it as cozy. European hotel rooms are not huge, so we didn't expect it to be. The room and bathroom were immaculate. The bathroom was adorable, with pretty mosaic tile trim, had the best water pressure ever (standing in the shower was like standing under a waterfall), and even had a towel-warming rack. The noise in the hotel was not excessive, and we never heard the club, even though it was supposedly on the same side of the hotel as our room. The windows had both glass panes and also wooden panels that, when shut, cut out all street noise completely. We never noticed any odor around the hotel.The area was not dangerous- it's just busy, since the central market is at the end of the street. We loved wandering around it. No one ever accosted us as we left the hotel, trying to sell us watches, as one traveler stated. The merchants are in the market, not hanging around the Globus front doors. There were lots of little restaurants and shops around.The staff was wonderful, and the concierge (I think his name was Nicolas?) was friendly and accommodating. He even pulled out a map and circled places for us to check out on New Years Eve, and described exactly what festivities would be taking place at each location. The breakfast room was cozy and inviting, and the man who ran it was impeccably polite. The food and made-to-order cappucinos were excellent.We also really appreciated the free internet service- that is NOT common! No, it's not wireless, but good lord! Is it so hard to bring an ethernet cable? We paid 8 euros for one hour of internet access at another hotel! The flat-screen, satellite TV was a great perk, too. At our next hotel, an expensive 4-star place, we had an old TV which barely got 5 channels to come in.All in all, our experience at the Globus was excellent. I will continue to recommend it highly to anyone going to Florence.HeatherCharlottesville, Virginia, USA ","annotations":[{"endOffset":946,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":942},{"endOffset":946,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":942},{"endOffset":946,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":942}]}
