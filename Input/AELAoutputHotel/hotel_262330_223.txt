{"text":"Great Stay Eventually booked this hotel through another website other then hilton, and saved myself a few hundered pounds. Being a hilton gold card member, I was expecting an upgrade to a higher floor but on checkin I was allocated the 19th floor. I was not very happy with this and I expressed my dissapointment to the checkin staff, who after about 10mins managed to upgrade me to the 46th floor. We had a one bedroom junior suite which was at the south west corner of the hotel. Ecellent views of the WTC and west to NJ and south. Could not fault the room, it was always cleaned and tidied to a very hight standard, and was very very comfortable.We never ate in the hotel, due to past reports decided to take the extra points, and use the deli just across the street, and, I'm pleased we did. You have a wide variety of choice and the service was very efficient. The hotel did not seem to mind that we brought breakfast back into the hotel to eat either.Had room service from the hotel on one occasion and that was very efficient and well presented.As you have probably read from other reports the hotel has great travel connections with the subway wherever you want to go. The 3 north bound subways can be accessed within a 2 minute walk from the hootel so no complaints there, and $24 for a week pass is a bargin the amount we used it.Over all a very enjoyable say and an excellent Hilton experience, would highly reccommend!!!
