{"text":"wonderful place for families The previous reviews go into alot of detail so I will not be that long. The Hotel as pple have said before is beautiful. I would suggest to fax or send an email requesting a renovated room and near the pool. They do try and honor the requests. The resort is big if you stay near the dominicana but if you are around the pool , the beach is only steps from the pool. There were lots of palapas and chairs so there was no need to reserve a chair.The weather was great just bring some bug spray for the night.The buffet and other restaurants except for the steakhouse are around the lobby. The food was great..Nobody got sick and while I was there they even had health inspectors examining the food. everything was top notch! The gourmet and the japanese were the best restaurants. The mediteranean was ok nothing to write home about. The best thing is that they have 6:30pm sittings so we took our 3 year old daughter to these restaurants and they were very accomodating. they have a kids menu at each one. The pool was great for kids..the kids pool was really small but because there are no steps into the big pool the kids easily swam around in it. At night they had a minidisco at 7:30-8pm which was great for the kids. the girls who run the kids club sing and dance with the kids on the theatre stage and they have a ball.as for shopping..don't buy anything but coffee and vanilla in the supermarket just 5 min. down the beach there is a big market where you can get everything for half of the price..All I can say is that we had a wonderful time and we will definitely go back. we have been to other resorts in Punta cana and this one was the best.
