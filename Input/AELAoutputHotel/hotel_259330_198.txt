{"text":"Can't Wait to Go Back Both my wife and I are first time √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√™arribean Resort√à√\u2020\u2022?travelers. Although we had nothing to compare it too√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√πe had a GREAT time. I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe all the negative reviews√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>If you want me to say the rooms are pristine condition and the food is the best I have ever tasted√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ºou will be reading a long time but who goes there to sit in your room and what do you expect when they are cooking for 2,000 that don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stop eating?Check in √à√\u2020\u2022?We arrived with a bus load at about 5:00 pm and were about 15 minutes getting squared away. It was a nice lobby and very spacious.Room √à√\u2020\u2022?We had a room facing the neighboring resort but if you went on the balcony and looked right, you could see the beach and the ocean. Some of the tiles were cracked and the trim in the shower was in rough shape and the holder for the shower head was hanging from the wall√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2020ut easy enough to live with for the 5 minutes a day we spent in the shower. One day we had very little water pressure but found out it was pretty much resort wide. Face clothes were sometimes scarce but if you asked a maid in the hall√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ºou would have some next time you came back to your room. Even if you didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ tell them your room number√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂hey just knew.Food √à√\u2020\u2022?The food was pretty good. I am a fussy eater but always had lots to eat. It was getting a bit old by the end of the week but the al-carte restaurants were good. Next time√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂√ò would go to the steak house every night!!! We also did Oriental and Italian and they were good..Entertainment √à√\u2020\u2022?This was great!!! Of course if you just want to sit there like a bump on a log√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√®t may be a bit dull but make the best of it and get involved and you will have a great time. We got there a bit early for the evening show and we were involved with the performance and games 4 or 5 times. Lots of dancing and some funny skits. The costumes were colorful and well done. You could tell the animation team was working hard and enjoy what they do. There was lots of activities around the beach and pool including games and dancing to get involved with.Beach. √à√\u2020\u2022?The beach was very nice and clean!!! Beautiful white sand and the water was clean in this area. You could walk for miles on the beach either way!!Vendors √à√\u2020\u2022?There is a plaza for shopping just outside the resort or you could walk 2.5 miles down the beach. On Friday, vendors were brought right inside the resort. They will barter√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√¥ome can be offended if you go too low though.Overall √à√\u2020\u2022?We had a great time. Remember it is a 3rd world country so don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go there thinking you are in North America at a 4.5 star motel. Make the best of it and have fun. Great value for what we paid. I am not sure I would want to be in the club. It is a beautiful pool but it is still under construction in many areas. The trolly ride is about 2 minuts and not nearly as far as I expected. I don't think there is as much to do there but it is very nice.
