{"text":"A very nice place to stay My girlfriend and I stayed at the Benjamin in April of 2007. The hotel is very nice indeed, with curteous and professional staff.Things didn't start so well. When we checked in, the staff member behind the counter (I didn't catch his name) was rattling away on the computer keyboard and barely acknowledged our existance. Fortunately, we were dealt with by someone else after a few minutes of toe-tapping.Our room was a one bedroom suite on the 24th floor and was, on the whole, very good. The suite consisted of a lounge\/kitchen( with a sofa-bed, microwave oven, office desk ,with fax\/printer and a large-screen LCD TV and hi-fi), bathroom and bedroom.All rooms were tastefully decorated and the bed was wonderfully comfortable. I liked the idea of the pillow menu - they even have a pillow with built-in speakers for your iPod!All of the windows in the suite were fitted with Roman blinds, several of which were broken - they wouldn't close. We pointed this out to the maid on our way out one evening. When we returned to the room, they were all closed. At the time I was impressed with the speed of resolution to the problem. Unfortunately, the following morning it became apparent that they hadn't fixed the problem - the blinds couldn't be opened!This issue was never resolved during our stay. Also, as an aside, I didn't like the marble used on the bathroom floor - it looked dirty. It was spotlessly clean, but the marble looked like it was covered in black smudges.We only ate in the restaraunt once - for breakfast. I can honestly say that they serve the best pancakes I have ever eaten!All in all, we were very impressed with this hotel. It isn't cheap, but then again what is in Manhattan?
