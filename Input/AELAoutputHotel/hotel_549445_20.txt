{"text":"Horrible Room-Deceptive Hotel First off, if you stay here, don't expect more than a YMCA with a face-lift. I'm writing this as i could not sleep, laying in bed in this boutique hotel.I'm a business person on my first trip to Boston and enjoy staying in boutique hotels to get the full experience\/culture of a city. Hotel 140 is in the same building as the YWCA....not good. I believe the property manager for the Y is the owner of the hotel.Here's the list of what I was surprised of:Upon pulling up, there's no parking in front of the hotel, no valet and noone to help you in with your bags. If you do double park, you could get a ticket, as it's a no standing zone. You can park in public lot, short walk from hotel. After I checked in (after waiting for an angry YWCA guest complain about the laundry room not being cleaned for a week) and took the private elevator up to my room, my room key did not work. I then proceeded to wait 15 minutes in a non-air conditioned hallway (80 degrees outside day) for the front desk to figure out a solution. They had to switch my room, since the first room was locked from the inside??After I got into my room, there was not closet!! The only closet that exists is VERY short (height-wise) - could not even hang my suit or a shirt, without it hitting the ground.Room size is ok, but no desk and some ikea looking furniture. I'm pretty sure these were rooms from the YWCA that they converted to a boutique hotel.There is no lock on the doors from the inside - bizarre.There is no turn-down service and there's a sign in the elevator that states the continental breakfast is no longer, as of Aug. 1.In one of the hand towels in the bathroom, there was a long blond hair (I'm a man with short brown hair).There were stains on my sheets - looked like ink. I wondered when the last time the room was cleaned.That's about it - DO NOT RECOMMEND staying here for the price. For $20 more per night, go stay at a reputable chain.
