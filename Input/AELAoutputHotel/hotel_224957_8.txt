{"text":"Too expensive for what you get We stayed at the hotel with a crew of 4 people. Overall the hotel is a nice place and has clean rooms. In addition, it is located in a good area close to Union square, right where we wanted to stay. However, for what you get in return the hotel is absolutely not worth the money we spent for those rooms. The service could be good if you could understand what the poor man was saying, and if he could somewhat understand what you are saying. I have stayed at quite a few hotels but never have I had the problems when checking in and out from this hotel. The check in took app. 30 minutes, which is a lot when the only only thing you want is to go to you rooms and rest. Also, the night before we were supposed to check out the man stopped us and wanted us to pay for our room because the person who were supposed to work in the morning didn√à?√¨t know how to charge a credit card. (This was at 1am). The breakfast, which you are suppose to get in the morning, is joke. When we reserved the rooms the guy told us that breakfast was included. What you get is a dry piece of biscuit covered in plastic (looks about 5 years old) and a coffe.To sum it all up. Nice-clean rooms, horrible serivce and staff that does not belong in a hotel. With the US$150\/night + taxes you can get a way better hotel than this. Even though they say that breakfast is included you will still need to buy breakfast somewhere else, which is another cost. I do not recommend this hotel to anyone, unless there are no other rooms available in the city...then maybe.
