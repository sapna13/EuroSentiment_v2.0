{"text":"Jump off the Clift Recently my family and I traveled to San Francisco to attend a family function in the Silicon Valley. Since we were only in the area for a long weekend, we decided to spend the first 2 nights in San Francisco. While previously we have stayed at the Fairmont and the Westin St. Francis, we decided to give the Clift a try due to a promotion that was being offered through American Express. Unfortunately our experience was not what we had anticipated. First, while the Clift is only 2 blocks from Union Square, it is not in a neighborhood where you want to walk at night. While San Francisco and for that matter, most major cities on the west coast have large homeless populations, such matter was most evident around the Clift. It seemed that at night you could not walk more than a couple of feet without bumping into a homeless person begging for money. In fact it appeared that some of these people were quite agressive. The hotel itself was obviously at some time an old apartment building or hotel which had been renovated. The lobby area is unique and clearly the hotel bar is a night spot for the single crowd. Unfortunately, the lighting is terrible. Such problem persisted throughout the hotel into the elevators and rooms. Our room was called a loft suite, but we use the word suite loosely. Really it was nothing more than an oversized room with a microsized bathroom. There was little lighting and the television was so small, you almost needed a microscope to see it. Moreover, you would have expected that a hotel with the purported reputation of the Clift would be luxurious. I would hardly classify it as a luxury hotel in the same class as the Fairmont. The staff was efficient, but certainly not friendly. We had to wait much too long to obtain our car and drop it off due to the fact that the staff was too busy handling the cars of patrons of the bar, obviously an important part of the financial operation. At over $50.00 per night to park our car, we expect priority service. Additionally, much of the staff wear earphones and dress like the secret service standing around and staring at everyone. I am not sure if these people are props in an effort to create a chic environment or just there to scare off anyone who walks through the door and may not be going to his or her room or the bar. All in all, I would not stay at the Clift again. There are too many more desirable hotels in San Francisco in much better neighborhoods and locations. As a side note, the hotel breakfast was great since it came with the room package, but without the package would be pricey. However, up the street off of Union Square is a restaurant called Sears. It is a San Francisco institution and I would highly recommend it for breakfast.
