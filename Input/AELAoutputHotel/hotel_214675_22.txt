{"text":"Never again!!! We booked though yourvacationcenter.com... it was our honeymoon but we had a budget to stay under but it was not that small of a budget... the travel agent really sold us on this place even though we wanted to stay at RQ waikiki beach. so we took her word for it and accepted the room... when we got there it was about 4pm. they said that our room was not ready yet and wouldnt be for another hour and a half... mind you check in is supposed to be at 3pm. so my husband and i figured we'd go cruise waikiki for a little bit maybe go grab a bite to eat. 2 hours later we return to the hotel and eveything is supposedly set. we wait about 15 mins to get onto an elevator (which by the way was broken for the rest of our stay), we get to our room, only to find the maid still creaning and doing a halfa** job none the less...at this point we were too tired. we just sat in the room and waited. The room smelled very wet and musty, the AC barely worked so it was a bit humid in there. the bed had some stains on the sheet and so did the bath towels. when you try and get service they dont give it to you, but when you dont want it ( for example maid service) they come into your room anyway! I put up the do not disturb sign cause i never trust maid service especially not at cockroach hotels like that one, but regardless we found that while we were away one day a maid STILL entered our room and threw away papers that i have been saving since our first day there... i called the front desk PO'd and they did nothing to help the situation. so i have no clippings to put in our wedding journal.... at check out they had the never to ask me if i would like to book a future stay...
