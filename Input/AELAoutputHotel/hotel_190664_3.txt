{"text":"Better than we expected disclosure - our stay was May, 2007, and I've been remiss in not posting thisLast Spring we did a 22-day Totalitarian Tour (Vienna, Prague, Berlin), winding up in Berlin for 10 days (which wasn't enough for this New Yorker to see everything).We wanted the following (in no particular order):central locationquietlargish roomgood servicegood room serviceOn all counts the Regent reached or surpassed our expectations.We arrived after a long trip from Prague, and everything was done from the first moment to make our stay comfortable. Fruit and chocolate in the room, replenished every day. Room service food very good, and at the time requested. Maid service well done, and porter too. It was almost like being in a 2nd home.The room had a side view of the Gendarmenmarkt square, which was fine - except for the corner rooms, none have a direct view (the square is catty-corner to the hotel, not directly across). There was no late night or early morning street noise, except for one night - and that was only a slightly tipsy crowd singing its way down the street - not so annoying for someone whose home is in Greenwich VIllage.As many have mentioned, the location is perfect for seeing Mitte, with excellent restaurants nearby. By the way, if no one has mentioned Fassbender  Rausch Chocolatiers, let me be the first. If you are or have a chocolate lover along, go - it's 3 blocks away from the hotel (opposite the SW corner of Gendarmenmarkt square) and be prepared for a chocolate shop unlike any other.Also - my wife doesn't trust hotel laundry and\/or dry cleaning services, but in this case she relented (we needed lots of it - don't do it in Prague) and was pleasantly surprised - as good as she remembered at The Regent in Sydney.When we go back to Berlin, it will be our home away again.
