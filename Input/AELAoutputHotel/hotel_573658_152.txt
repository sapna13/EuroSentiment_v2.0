{"text":"King of Suites! One of the main reasons for choosing this hotel for our trip to Toronto is the positive reviews it got, plus we got a really good deal from the site we bought our trip from. We got an excellent price for such a good hotel.Let's get the negatives out of the way first. The hotel is fairly new and it seems as though the staff may be still in training or not used to their jobs yet as they are a little slack. Don't get me wrong , everyone we spoke to was very nice and polite, it's just that the service could be a bit better. For instance we ordered breakfast on our first morning which never turned up, we had to call reception to find out what happened, however we did get our meal eventually - they did get the order wrong though.But these niggles are far out-weighed by the positives. Firstly, the room was great. It was spacious, and had all the mod cons you could want - fridge, washer-dryer, microwave oven and dishwasher. Secondly the location was great too. Their was a subway stop and streetcar stop right outside the hotel plus a lot of the downtown places to visit are walking distance and the entertainment district, which has theatres, bars and restaurants aplenty, is only a 10 min walk or quick streetcar ride away.Another nice feature of the hotel is that you can book one of their fabulous classic cars to take you anywhere in the vicinity ...for free! We took a rather nice Bentley to the CN tower, which was rather nice - I could've got used to that!Overall a great hotel and one where we would stay again. If they could tighten up the service it would make 5 stars.
