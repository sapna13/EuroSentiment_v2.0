{"text":"An oasis of comfort It was my first time at The Library - the husband's 4th or 5th as he's stayed there on business before. We stayed a week in 001Modern History on the 9th Floor and this elicits my only negative comment. Now, I know they were pretty full (and we had to be reassigned a couple of days before arriving from the single petite that the husband's daft business travel agent had booked for him!) but they did know it was our 15th anniversary and I just don't feel prominently displayed books on Nazism and the 1st World War, and portraits of fascist dictators and Neville Chamberlain above the bed really help foster a romantic atmosphere. But having said that all the rooms are pretty similar in decor, it's just the pictures and books, so having popped the gory war analysis out of plain sight I just tried not to eyeball Neville everytime I got into bed. Negatives over - the rooms are small and expensive, yes it's New York - yadda yadda yadda... BUT worth it for the comfort and joy of having a decent sized well-lit bathroom with actual surfaces that you can put things down on and the little extras like the cheese and wine or prosecco in the evening; cawffee and tea and biscuits on tap; and the communal spaces including a wonderful little outside roof terrace. Decent hot shower, good quality toiletries (love that scrub soap), robes and slippers, dvd's and takeaway delivered to your door, and the gloriously friendly, charming and informative staff (special mention to Igor and the lovely lady in the Reading Room studying child pyschology) - what more could you want from a midtown hotel? Okay so I agree with other posters about the comedy shower curtains (too short and they stick to you like wet tissue) and girlie issue - please can we have a full length mirror somewhere? Oops more negatives - I lied but that's positively it! Loved it here would be happy to stay anytime so I hope this review doesn't mean we can't get a room next time!! Oh and make sure you make time for a Hemingway cocktail in the bar...
