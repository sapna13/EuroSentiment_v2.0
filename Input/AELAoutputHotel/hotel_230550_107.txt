{"text":"Nice interior  I stayed here for 4 nights while in Berlin with work, and its a nice hotel and location is great if you want to see the museums.The rooms looks like they've been recently redecorated, and they are both clean and decorated nicely... its clear a bit of effort and thought went into the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor. Having said that, it was a little odd that the bath\/shower in our room had no wall, but a glass panel which was open to the room, but hey, open plan is great too.As the Park Inn is Berlin's tallest building, naturally the views are spectacular, although cleaning the windows more often would make this view more enjoyable. The hotel is in Alexander Platz, which is central and near a very convenient U-Bahn line that runs through the main tourist sites, although the square itself is soulless and lacking any charm. Plenty of shops in the nearby platz and in the Galleria Kaufhof behind the hotel. Check in\/out was all very efficient, and the staff are very friendly. The hotel also has a terrace on the higher floors (Floor 39, I think) and is an excellent and relaxing place to have a quick drink in the evening before planning your night-life excursions.Having said that, if you are an English speaker, there is only 2 English channels available in the room (both news!)... some kind of satellite or cable choice would have been great, especially for a hotel that advertises itself as international. I was also very disappointed in the lack of wireless internet, although wired internet (via LAN cable) was available in the room, but at a ridiculous cost.Personally, I don't think expecting free or affordable in-room internet access to those who need it is unreasonable.Overall, a great place to stay for comfort and cost, but you could probably do better finding a hotel in more pleasant surroundings than the very drab Alexander Platz.A few tips when in Berlin: Give yourself plenty of time to explore the museums, but if time is limited, the Pergamon is a must if only for the Istar Gates of Ancient Babylon. Museums open until 10pm on Thursday and are free. Check Point Charlie is a little bit on the touristy side (the checkpoint itself isn't the original, just a mock up), but the museum next to it is quite good. If the weather is good, a stroll in the Tiergarten is a nice way to spend the afternoon. A day U-Bahn ticket is a great and very inexpensive way to get around, the U-Bahn (and S-Bahn's) are very safe and clean - if you want to go a little further outside Berlin, get the three zone ticket (Zones A, B,  C), its not much dearer.
