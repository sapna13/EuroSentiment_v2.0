{"text":"Great time! BEWARE of the Roulette Game!!!! We had a great time!!!! If you go to the Casino STAY AWAY from the Mini Ball Roulette!! It is a total SCAM, we spoke to and heard of more than 8 couples that weren't warned and lost BIG. Obviously you sit at the table with the expectation of only playing the complimentary chips, however the smooth slick talking dealer is good at what he does and before you know it your only 1 point away from winning the jackpot but that 1 point doesn't ever seem to turn up. If you think you're not big gamblers and you won't be stuck in that position just be careful. We are not big gamblers at all yet we fell into the trap. If you do decide to give it a try make sure you count the numbers on EVERY single roll, the dealer counts very fast and we think he doesn't add them correctly.The resort has lots of things to do and there's always a bar open and ready to serve you. The food was great, we ate mostly at the buffet, however we did eat at the tex mex and italian style resatuarants which were both great! The beach is beautiful and be sure to take advantage of the snokling, you can see some great fish without swimming far at all! The rooms were ok... I would recommend upgranding your room... our room could have used a few upgrades but all and all the room was ok.
