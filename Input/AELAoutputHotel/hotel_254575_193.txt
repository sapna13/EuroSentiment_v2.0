{"text":"Liked it a lot!!!! We (Norwegian family) stayed at Luna  Simone from June 23th to July 1th (7 nights).We booked our rooms after having read so much nice about the hotel and the owners, and we were certainly not disappointed.The hotel was exactly as welcoming, clean, charming and well located as promised. We had one 3 bed room down under the ground, and one twinroom in the stairs down to the breakfastroom. Both of them were unbelievable clean. Quite simple though, but they had nice, clean bathrooms with plenty of water, nice beds, TV, and a fan which we never used. There were a water boiler there as well, and clean towels everyday. This is not at luxury hotel, but the charm and cleanlyness count up for that in every way. I have stayed in lot of luxury hotels, but never seen anything so clean. The breakfast was tasty, and enough to keep us full up for hours. The owners serving the breakfast were so nice, attentive and full of humour. As our kids sometimes didn't want anything else but toast, they were offering yoghurt and other stuff. Also the neighbourhood was really nice. Victoria Station only a few minutes walk away. We did'nt use the 24 bus everbody talk about, because we never managed to get a timetable, so we never found out which destinations the bus was going to. There were a lot of nice restaurants nearby (we tried 5 of them and were never dissapointed.) And are you going to eat Fish and Chips once while staying i London, choose the restaurant Seafresh, very nearby. We did, and it was a really nice experience. We will reccomend Luna  Simone to all people going til London, and definitly stay there again, We really hope they manage to keep up with the clean and friendly style, this is a gem!
