{"text":"Fantastic Resort for Families We found this resort a perfect place for familes. We have a 1.5 year old and were surprised to find so many ammenities for us. I would recommend this resort without any reservation for families like ours. The web site does not advertise the kid friendly aspects which were important to us. We stayed at the Reserve- gorgeous and swanky. Beautiful, impeccably maintained grounds throughout entire resort. Our room was fantastic, separate room for child, eating area, comfortable deck, huge jacuzzi- which is great post-beach. 2 flat scren tvs and dvd player in bedroom. They stocked our mini bar constantly with our favorites and we enjoyed the 24 hour room serveice regularly for fresh milk, whatever. Room service food not great for meals but for simple child friendly food\/snacks great. KidZone: beautiful facility: much larger than web site shows with huge outdorr play area, the staff also takes them swimming and on activities like face painting. They have nice nursery for naps, and are open until 10:00pm so parents can go out to dinner\/show\/etc. We had babysitter come to our room every night (Elizabeth\/Dulce), lovely women and we were able to arrange last minute with concierge. Kids pool awesome: four fun waterslides that were appropriate for 1.5 year old and older kids. Large baby pool. Staff gave us bag of beach\/pool toys when we asked. The kids pool also had awesome private family cabanas that we all chilled out in. Service great: constantly taking orders. Grill open close by for lunch\/snack. Picture five families hanging out in own cabana, adults drinking\/talking with each other, kids playing together: dreamy.The Reserve section is gorgeous. New and swanky; Ian Schrager\/W Hotels style. Much more beautiful resort than web site shows. We have been at top hotels around world and found this compared well. The grounds and facilities definitely. Although the staff is generally lovely, their first language is definitely Spanish and there can be things lost in translation. As we were warned, beware of time share sellers posing as Concierges. They don't work for resort, just there to solicit people for pitches. They are aggressive, as they make $50 per family in a poor country. You have to be aggressive too. We were nice for a few days, gently blowing him off, then I tired of him pressuring us and told him sternly No and that I did not want him asking us again. He did get the message and left us alone after that. He and the other concierges ended up being helpful making reservations, getting babysitters, having things replaced\/fixed, etc.Restaurants, better than can be expected for all inclusive. We like the new Latin restaurant Fuego, and found Italiano delicious for yummy pizzas and pastas. El Romantico despite the corny name had an excellent steak and lamb chops. We found Vento's menu intersting and creative and the setting beautiful, but the food was pretty rich and heavy for our tastes. We found Chinese decent and were shocked at the Japanese restaurant being good. We had low expectations as we eat sushi\/Japanese regularly, but even the sushi appetizer was decent. Don't order tepanaki fish- do steak or chicken. Gabi grill had gorgeous and huge breakfast buffet.Bars had large selection of top shelf and we found drinks very well made and strong.Re: service. We were there the week before Christmas before the rush, we found service outstanding; however resort probably overstaffed for influx of guests the following week. We also tipped well and I think word gets around. By giving a few bucks, you can be assured a prompt delivery and constant service. Our maid was great and cleaned our large messy room well and stocked our pantry daily.Beach beautiful. Private Reserve section real plus. GREAT beach service and better palapas than main beach- big adjustable beach beds. We found getting around to beach and main resort easy by train, staff would call for us or we'd just wait for the next train. No problem.
