{"text":"Worst hotel I've ever stayed at! I was so depressed when I arrived at this hotel. It's up a large flight of stairs--no elevator. The lobby looks nothing like the lobby pictured in the hotel's on-line ad. It is not nice. My room was the worst. It wass as small as a jail cell, tiny bed, one little chair, cabinet for clothes, tiny table. It is the smallest room I have ever seen. It smelled bad and they actually had an air freshener on the window ledge to attest to that. The view was the back of a building--reminded me of a tenement on the worst side of New York City. The bathroom was so small I couldn't even move in it. The room was dirty. There were hairs, not only on the bedspread but even on the sheets. The place literally gave me the creeps. I immediately went out and found another hotel where I stayed for the rest of my visit in Florence (6 additional nights) but I had to stay here the first night or lose my money. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone for any reason. The only positive is the young man who runs the place is really a nice guy. He was helpful in getting me a reservation for the Academia before I arrived and gave me the lay of the land when I arrived. However, honestly, the place was dumpy and dirty. Oh, they also offer breakfast and they bring it to your room because apparently there isn't a room where we could all eat together. I kept envisioning that I would receive bread and water because my room seemed like a little cell. Needless to say, I didn't stay for breakfast so I never found out what breakfast was like.
