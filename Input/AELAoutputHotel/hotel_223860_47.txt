{"text":"Perfect For Christmas We took a family vacation to this resort for the Christmas holiday (2 parents  4 grown kids in our 20's). When we arrived we were warmly greeted by doormen  bellhops. The entrance was incredible  very welcoming. I am a self-described hotel snob and I was pleasantly surprised by how wonderful the resort was. The rooms were very clean  restocked with towels twice daily (morning  turn-down service). It was quite expansive, but just enough to feel like you had your own space. There were many little nooks where you could curl up with a book or take a nap in the sun  no one would know or care that you were there. The lobby had a nice bar  plenty of couches  tables to play card games on well into the night. There was live music every night - my only complaint is that they should have played later than 10 PM! I would recommend the Starbucks or Blue Sage Marketplace for breakfast. Although you are still going to pay $2 for a cookie, they are the only munchie place in the hotel. If you like healthy food eat at the Spa Bistro. It is open to everyone even if you don't use the spa. The food was very good  quite refreshing - - $9 for a healthy hamburger, not bad. We did eat at the Blue Sage restaurant for dinner  was not too happy with the service. All the other restaurants in the hotel were a bit out of our price range. I would recommend the Desert Ridge Marketplace across the street (nice walk, or catch the shuttle every 1\/2 hour from the hotel). Although, it may look like a mall, there are not that many shops, but there are plenty of restaurants! We at at the Yard House. If you like beers, they have 84 on tap!!! They even put on our Packers for one of the football games!All in all, this would be my 1st pick of hotels if I was ever back in Phoenix. Contrary to some of the reviews on here (that had me a bit nervous before I went), this hotel is not business\/conference centered. Yes, they have wonderful facilities for these events, but outside of that, it is all vacation  relaxation. If you go - have fun  check out the sunrises over the mountains - breath-taking!
