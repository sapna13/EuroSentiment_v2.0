{"text":"Not as bad as some reviews make you believe After booking our stay at Gran Melia, I started reading all the bad reviews posted here, and got a bit worried. However, it's definitely not as bad as others have mentioned. One caveat - we were there during the low season, and the resort was virtually empty. A rental car is an absolute must if you're staying there - there's nothing within walking distance but a golf course. Location: The resort is located about 20 miles east of the airport, on a little peninsula. The location is great if you want to go to San Juan (30 min), rain forest (15 min), Fajardo (30 min) - as long as you have a car.Finding the hotel: It's so new, GPS (or Google Maps) does not have it's street address, however, as you take Route 3 east from San Juan, there's a huge sign pointing to the hotel. Parking:Parking is not free, and on weekend night there are a lot of locals who come to the casino, but we never had problems finding a spot (or parking right alongside the drive if there were no spots).Check-in:There were two employees checking people in, and it took us all of 5 minutes to check in. The do put a hold of $150 a night on your credit card as a safety deposit - never seen this anywhere else. We asked for a room close to the main area and parking, and were placed in bungalow 16 - a 100 yard walk from the pool and very close to the main area and parking.The room: Very nice - roomy, marble floors, nice furniture and art, decently comfortable beds. All rooms have private balconies or patios (depending on the floor). The only issue was the towels - it seemed that every day we had one less than before, and they did not replace the hand towels at all - just took the dirty ones away... Resort amenities: The only amenities we used were the pool - nice and clean, the gym - it's super hot in there - no A\/C it seems, the casino - has an ok selection of machines from 5c to $1 and several tables, and the beach - full of seaweed as it is a nature preserve... Food: Restaurants at the resort are expensive as many reviewers have pointed out, so we had to fend for ourselves. For breakfast and lunch - go to Coco Sweets Bakery - it's at the intersection of the road that leads to the resort and Route 3. Wonderful staff, 70 cents for a cup of excellent coffee, $4 sandwiches, and great pastries. For dinner - if you want real Puerto Rican food and ambiance - go to Liquillo Beach - you can see a long strip of shops along Route 3 a few miles east of the resort - these are all bars\/restaurants. They may not look like much, but the food is out of this world and it's cheap. Go to the last one (#60) for the best seafood on the island - try their whole red snapper.Staff: Most of them were very nice and friendly - especially security guards by the bungalo area - their job is so boring, they like to chat with guests - they are a great source of local info. The guest concierge desk staff were also helpful - they have info and directions for most local attractions.Conclusion:A nice hotel if little things don't bother you. We had a good time exploring the surroundings since there's not much to do at the resort itself.
