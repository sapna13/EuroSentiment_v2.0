{"text":"Simply Bombastic! Four Seasons Resort - Sayan, BaliFirst Impression\/Lobby - The Four Seasons Hotel and Resort Sayan in Bali is the epitome of warmth, beauty and style, all at it's best. Walking the long bridge from the drop-off center to reception, looking at the jungle all around you transports you to a different place, physically, mentally and spiritually. Gone are the crowds and the hassles of normal day life, here is the peace and serenity that makes a place so special. I've described many places as having a warm welcome but Four Season Sayan takes it to a whole new level. From every person we saw it was a beautiful, truly heartfelt welcome. Of all the places I visited in the world, Four Seasons Sayan knows the art of making a person feel welcome. It simply and easily just comes from their heart.Villa - The Sayan Villa, of which there are only two, was to be my home for the next few days. The ultimate in luxury, the Sayan Villa was tucked away at the edge of the property offering total seclusion and privacy. The large bedroom, with its huge glass doors that opened to the extra large deck and pool below, was decorated with an understated elegance. A large bathroom with twin sinks, giant-sized soaking tub, indoor and outdoor showers and over-sized storage\/dressing room, just added to the comfort of the villa.The pool, located just below the massive deck, could not accurately be called a plunge pool. If this was a plunge pool then any plunge pool I have seen before should be called a foot basin. On top of that, the view from it was spectacular. On the lower deck were the lounge chairs for sunning and a grass covered daybed; just the right place to escape the mid-day sun. My own slice of heaven here on earth.The outdoor living area was expansive. Two tables for dining, one small round four-seater and one larger, rectangle six-seater. The covered open air living housed the six seater as well as a couch perfect for sipping champaign and listening to the nature all around you.Restaurant - Since the Sayan Villa was our own slice of heaven, we did not have much incentive to venture out to the restaurant. But, in the name of research, we booked a table at the resort's restaurant, Ayung Terrace Restaurant, for the Taste of Asia tasting menu dinner. (click here to see the menu) Not surprisingly, the dinner, the wine, the evening were all exceptional.Room Service - In a word, bombastic. From our traditional American breakfast and casual late lunch, to our from the menu dinner and special, custom, four-course, romantic, candle-lit dinner; each and every one was better than the last.Overall Impression - Four Seasons Resort Sayan is a must when you are in Bali. The people alone make it worth the stay. Beauty and peace envelope you from the moment you arrive and surround you until you leave. Even after you hare gone just closing your eyes and thinking about it brings the feeling back.
