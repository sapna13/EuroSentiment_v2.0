{"text":"amazing hotel, perfect for any holiday\/ honeymoon we have just returned from bali for ten days for our honeymoon and have to say that the melia benoa hotel was a perfect choose. the staff ( dewa, chocolate and natalia ) made our holiday so much fun, everyone in bali and this hotel are so friendly they made our stay very special and we will definately be returning soon. the hotel is very nice and although some parts need to be updated slightly, in whole the hotel is brilliant. my husband and I are very picky eaters but found plenty of food to eat whilst at the hotel, of which was very good quality. bali is a beautiful place to visit and you will never be bored as there is so much to see. you do have to be careful with taxi drivers and get a price before you get in but they are all polite and very helpful. we could not have asked for a better honeymoon and have already started saving for our next visit. if you would like to go for a day trip then talk to wayan who can be found on the beach at the front of the hotel. he took us all around bali and told us lots of the history of the island. he is alot cheaper than booking through your tour operater and will take you to all the places you want to see. you will find that on the beach there are alot of people trying to sell you clothes, jewellery etc and they will follow you but if you are not interested then you have to just tell them no and carry on walking. when we arrived we found these people and the people in the art market very hard to say no to but they will understand if you do not buy anything. we recommend that if you are considering a holiday then you should try this hotel as you will not be dissappointed. we really enjoyed our honeymoon and cant wait to get back there.
