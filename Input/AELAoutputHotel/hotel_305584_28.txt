{"text":"Ok I Stayed in this hotel for 2 nights in July, booked by my company since it was just around the corner from the office. In general the hotel was fine for the location and price paid. In regard to my negative comment below, i think i was just unlucky based on my 1st room experience and from other reviews. If I hadn't have had that, I would have probably given it 4 as the rating.Hotel is located about a 15 -20 min walk from the start of the main area (top of La rambla), and also short walk to metro. Positives- Free internet connection (though I could not get into our work from the connection, which I have found to be a problem at the occasional hotel (something to do with there settings). butif you just need the internet for surfing etc, it is fine- neat  comfortable room (though a little small, but I was hardly in the room anyway)- safe in room- Quiet (as long as the people next to you are quiet, since you can hear between the rooms quiet easily, but I was lucky that both sides were quiet from about 10pm onwards). I also had a room facing the inside of the hotel, to ensure quiteness- good Shower, aswell as a sep bath (also with shower head)- Nice breakfast- AirconditioningNegative- I was made to change rooms, since they told me the water from my room was leaking into the room below. So I had to move, which was a pain to pack everything up etc. Also I was only given the reason for it, after I asked on a number of occasions.- new room I moved to had a number of hairs (and I am not talking from the head area), in the bathroom, including one, caught under the lid of the new shampoo!
