{"text":"eh... beautiful facility, ok service, too many New Yorkers We arrived just before the President's Day Holiday -- although the physical location is wonderful, it is a hike from some of the villas to the pools or restaurants. A tram that is supposed to run on a regular basis doesn't...ah yes, island time.The good -- the location\/beach rooms were spacious with comfortable beds, luxurious bathrooms Bar service (with tipping) resulted in excellent service with many premium brands available.The good -- childrens programs kept kids occupied with a range of activitiesThe bad -- upscale restaurants were totally booked or taking reservations at 10pm (fine for us, not fine for families)There was even a sign on the concierge desk that stated that restuarants were fully booked until further notice. Interesting concept since you're not supposed to be able to book reservations until you arrive on the property!The bad -- New Yorkers everywhere who wanted things NOW.People claiming poolside cabanas who never appeared to use them. It's a quick direct flight to SJU from all the metro airports -- that's good and bad.The ok -- food generally was ok -- buffets had some variety. Service was adequate, but uninspired.Casino was small but never crowed while I was thereAll in all, for an all-inclusive we didn't pay for (company trip) it was alright but I would not spend my own $$ there. There are better choices but at the time we were there, it was the only all-inclusive on the island. I've heard that other Sol-Melia resorts (such as Costa Rico) are far, far better.
