{"text":"Good location but so-so place Stayed here for 2 nites in June 2006. This hotel advertises itself as SUITES at 1 King West. I think this is false advertising. My husband  I had a very nice ROOM at a reasonable rate for downtown Toronto, but it was by no means a suite. It was actually one room with a very small bathroom plus a counter with a sink , a microwave  small frig on the counter and a small dishwasher  small washer  dryer under the counter. It was nice . . . but I guess when I hear the word suite I think of more than one room - - - usually a bedroom separate from the living area . . . something like Embassy Suites offers.This was a strange place. We had a terrible time just finding it!! There is no name or address on the front of the building! You have to drive around on a side street to the back of the hotel.When we arrived in our room it was very warm. After looking all around for the thermostat we found that is was BEHIND a very large combination closet\/TV armoire. We could not see it to adjust the temperature! We called the desk to see if maybe they had an answer or another room for us. After only 15 minutes the Gen. Manager  a big security guy appeared at our door and moved this huge armoire over about 12 inches so we could get at the thermometer. I have to give the manager a plus for that. This was a nice place but I do resent the fact that its rooms are billed as suites.
