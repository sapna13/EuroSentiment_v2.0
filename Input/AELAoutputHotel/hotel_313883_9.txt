{"text":"Great place to relax I spent a week at the Tropical Princess with my Mum in July and we both had a great time. We went for a week of relaxation and that's what we got.The buffet restaurant was great with a different 'theme' every day (e.g. Mexican, Chinese, Italian etc) and the waiters were all charming. The other restaurants didn't seem as busy as the buffet restaurant and we stuck with the buffet as there was so much variety. The beach is lovely but on one day the water got a little rough. However, if you turn left out of the hotel on to the beach and walk for 5 mins you reach a really calm stretch of sea. The grounds are kept immaculately clean by a huge team of gardeners and the rooms are very spacious and clean (with no bugs of any kind!). There are 3 large outdoor pools which are great for families with kids, or for a dip after a day on the beach. There is a small gym with 2 treadmills, 2 rowing machines, 1 stepper, some weights machines and free weights. It opens at 8 so we got there at that time everyday to make sure we could get on the treadmills. There is also a beauty salon where you can get lots of different treatments. I could not recommend this place more highly if you simply want to relax on a beautiful beach. However, if you are wanting to see something of Dominican culture, you might want to go to the North of the island where there seemed to be a bit more going on.
