{"text":"Disappointing especially after the rave reviews, but well located Having read the rave reviews of this hotel on Trip Advisor, we were very much looking forward to the pure luxury of staying here for 3 nights during a 3 week trip to the states. On reflection this was one of my least favourite hotels, especially considering it was one of the most expensive. Having stayed in eleven hotels in the last 3 weeks the weaknesses of the Argonaut included:1) Very slow check in - not ideal at 2am 2) Despite the huge room, a tiny bathroom, no separate shower and no side space to store your things, can't think why they didn't proportion the room a little differently3) I'm sure 12 year old boys would love the decor but I wasn't too keen 4) I only tried breakfast (twice, foolishly!) but I think it would be safe to say that the restaurant is disappointing. The breakfast choice was limited compared to many other hotels, very expensive, slow and inept service and not particularly nice food. 5) The staff were not very helpful, they managed to lose our dry cleaning which was eventually located but I was blamed for the error!6) We paid for a bay view but didn't get one..7) I had big problems getting onto the wirless internet, and when I did get on it was very slow. I did however manage to remedy this by using my t-mobile account and logging onto the starbucks network I could pick up from next door!8) Unhelpful and in one instance, incorrect advice from the conciergeHowever that all said it is fantastically well located right on fisherman's wharf and the doormen were extremely helpful (and offered far better advice than the concierge). Their helpful and happy attitude was the hotel's only saving grace in my opionion!If you are staying here and want a good meal - breakfast \/ brunch is great at Jonies, just up the steps and a good lunch \/ dinner can be found in the restaurant directly opposite the hotel.
