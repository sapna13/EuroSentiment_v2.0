{"text":"Don't go - we were robbed!! My girlfriend and I booked to stay at the Galeria Plaza for our 5 days in Mexico City, based on reviews here on tripadvisor. Our initial impressions were spot on the reviews - good location, clean, modern. However our stay turned into an awful one, half way through, when we had MX$6000 stolen out of our room. We arrived at the hotel at 2am, after a near 24 hour trip from England. We put our valuables (passport, cash, keys etc) into the safe in the room, although the safe didn't have a key. We woke up the next morning and headed straight out, forgetting to ask how to get the key for the safe. As soon as we arrived back later that afternoon, we got the key from the front desk and promptly locked the safe. Then, when we went back into the safe the next day to get more money out, MX$6000 (US$600) were missing!We reported it to the front desk immediately and they were as good as useless. They refused to accept that it had been taken, and said they simply asked the maid if she had seen anything and she said no. It took us 24 hours to be able to speak to the manager, who wouldn't help us initially, and even suggested that we were making it up. In the end, he said that all that they could do was escort us to the police station. They couldn't have been more unhelpful and even tried to make us pay for the phone call to our insurance company!All in all, this could have been a nice stay, but it was a disaster. The hotel were dreadful in assisting us. I urge you not to stay here with the thought that if this has happened once, it could happen again.
