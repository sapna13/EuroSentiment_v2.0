{"text":"A bit like staying in IKEA I recently stayed in a 3* room with my husband on our Honeymoon. From reading other reviews we knew the hotel was going to be a bit different and on the arty side.We enjoyed staying at the hotel and liked the room, it was very clean and practical for a short stay. I was glad that the room we got had a separate bathroom, rather than one of the 'fold out' feature bathrooms which I had read about. The bathroom was a 'wet room' (had a shower with no curtain so the water went where it fell) but was designed in a practical way so not everything got wet.The room had shutters rather than curtains and overlooked the water, so on a sunny morning the room was lovely and bright (once the shutters were fully open) and the view was appealing.The location of the hotel is a short tram ride from the centre and the trams are frequent. If you liked walking, you could easily walk into the centre. We choose not too, as we toured Amsterdam by foot when we reached the centre. The area around the hotel is fairly quiet, it looked like it was a business area which went quiet at weekend and in the evenings.The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful and the whole place had a young and modern feel to it. My husband thought the interior of the hotel was designed in the same style as some of the stuff you see in IKEA, several areas where very open plan. ","annotations":[]}
