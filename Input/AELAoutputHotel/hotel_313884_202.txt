{"text":"best all inclusive resort ever first do yourself a favor and don't even bother reading the review by LITTLE BUNNY 06 ,MONTREAL .my husband and i stood at the PUNTA CANA PRINCESS june11 to june21 and totally loved it . Last year we went to St.Lucia and stood at the Sandals resoert, well let me tell you we loved that resort alot , but the Princess topped the Sandals resort .We thought that the Princess was all the five stars that it claims it is. The place is so clean and beautiful . everyday and all day long you would see workers and staff keeping up with the place, and a great job they did. As of speaking the language well we don't ,granted my husband is portuguese there may be a handful of words similar , but as for me i'm german born american citizen . so we would ask some phrases mostly used and learned them before we got there. but i did not thing there was a problem if we didn't know something in their language and spoke english .they would also do their best to understand what we were saying.what travelers have to remember they are poor people thry were born there work their butts off, they should not be expected to speak our language nor anybody elses.oh and by the way the food is great , there are so many selections at every seating wether it was breakfast, lunch, or dinner.all those critics that say not much of a selection or not too much food or even the vegetarians who complain about no selections,all i have too say is were the hell do they go to eat to get satisfiy their hunger.you mention it and i pretty much think they had it. i will leave you future travelers with a heart warming thought .you need to remember your going to the caribbean, this means be on vacation enjoy the view the people and learn to relax , you will get your drink and your will get your food and your room will be cleanned and made up by a maid. just smile and relax greet the people in whatever language and they will smile and greet you back in their language and they are there to please you however thay can.LOVE SABINE , GO TO THE PUNTA CANA PRINESS!
