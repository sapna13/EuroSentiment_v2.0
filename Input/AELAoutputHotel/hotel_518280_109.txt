{"text":"Swim up bar! We stayed at the QT based on the reviews of this very site. I was somewhat apprehensive as it was touted as a unique experience, but upon arrival I liked it. It's simple, the rooms are small and oddly designed. The staff was more like a convenience store staff than the typical hotel staff that will do anything to make you happy, yet I didn't have a major problem with it.The swim up bar is awesome, but also leads to the negative aspect of this review. After a night of drinking way too much, we went to our room where it all came back up. In the morning we cleaned up the mess the best we could and even left housekeeping a $20 tip with a request to mop or do something to get the smell out of the room. When we came back later that day NOTHING had been done about the smell and yet the tip was gone. The floor hadn't been cleaned at all, let alone mopped. I was shocked at the dishonesty. Then, before dinner I called the front desk and appraised them of my disdain and they promised to take care of it. I came back from dinner and still nothing.On the up side, it has the most comfortable bed I've probably ever slept in.Conclusion:For a hotel in this price range, you would expect far better housekeeping service. That aside, it was a fun place to stay right off of Times Square in the middle of Manhatten and who can beat a swim up bar. ","annotations":[]}
