{"text":"Nice hotel but with some blunders I stayed 2 nights at Executive room of Conrad Singapore and found issues :- The rate we booked was SGD 440 ++ per night. When we checked in, we were told that it's the rate for single occupancy only. Another SGD 50 per night was charged if it's for double occupancy. Fortunately we are the Hilton member, it's waived. - It's worth to pay a little bit more to stay at Executive floor as it provides ABF, afternoon tea and evening cocktails daily. Food tasted good and service was great during the these period. But when I was there at 9 pm, no one was willing to serve me as they were busy for breakfast preparation. I needed to go to the reception to ask for a drink.- Room was spacious (room 2618) but I found mold all around the shower box and marbles on the floor. Temperature was a nightmare - I turned it to 28 degrees but I was still freezing. - There's an electric upgrade during the first night of stay. I was told that electric supply would be interrupted and internet was out of services after 12am (mid night). When I got shower at 1145pm, all the lights were shuted down for 10 seconds without any notice. Also, I found no hot water for shower were supply in the next morning. - No wall socket provides at the bathroom, and there's one at the working desk area. I needed to use the hair dryer and recharge my mobile at the mini bar (there's one for water boiler). It's definitely not enough for the business traveller. Apart from the above issues, I still think it's one of the best hotel in Singapore, staff at the reception, restaurant, lounge and concierge are excellent, pleasant and helpful. If Swissotel Stamford charges SGD 360++ for Grand Room, I definitely switch to stay at Conrad as it's much better.
