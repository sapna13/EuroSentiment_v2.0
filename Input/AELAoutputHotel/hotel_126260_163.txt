{"text":"Fantastic Hotel! Amazing view - beautiful rooms - top service! We have just returned from a short stay at this hotel and it was every bit as good as many other Trip Advisor members have said - absolutely superb and excellent value for money for the quality of the hotel and being in New YorkI looked at all the rooms whilst there so will comment on the differences which would have helped me make my decision when I was bookingFirstly we had a normal hotel room in the end that was upgraded on the night to a corner suite - it was very very good for $345 per night - very spacious - extremely clean and well appointed - very traditional in decor - remember to ask for a west side Cathedral view - the main hotel rooms are on the first 38 or so floors with the exec lounge on the 39th floor - the exec lounge is fantastic - very classy and elegant with excellent presentations throughout the day - as good as any of the Ritz carlton lounges we have stayed in and with a fantastic view being on the 39th floor - our room was on the 20th floor which was fine until I saw the view from the Towers Rooms!! Huge picture window on our 20th floor room with an amazing viewThe Towers Rooms have a separate entrance and a choice of traditional or modern decor - I preferred the modern one - the rooms were fantastic - all the latest amenities and beautiful black marble bathrooms - latest look beds and linen and latest plasma TVs (although our room on the 20th also had great facilities and plasma screen!) If you have the extra approx $200 per night to spend then it is worth it as these rooms are beautiful and the one I was shown on 47th floor had the most amazing cathedral and towards the river view - simply breathtaking - very luxurious - my favourite towers room though was the junior suite because the bathroom was so fantastic! Again all beautifully done in black marble but the junior suites have huge walk in shower cubicle that the others rooms done have as well as a large (not double) bath - I loved the junior suites but not sure how much they were - the proper suites were amazing but in all honesty even if we could afford them they are a bit too big for a short break!The staff are superb at this hotel - room service was fantastic even at 2am when we arrived - we will definitely be staying again at this hotelIt is in a superb central position within easy walking distance of the main attractionsThe public rooms are a little bit dark and my only suggestion would be for some more inviting bars and public rooms in the main hotel lounges as they are all a bit dark - the Gilt Restaurant however looked very good and I think has a michelen star!I havent seen rooms of this standard and size in New York at this price - although still expensive I think this hotel represents excellent value for money - I just wish it had an indoor pool and spa like the peninsula and some more attractive main lounges and bars and then it would be 100% perfect but that is being very very pickyThank you to all at the hotel for a fantastic stay - we will be booking for December 08 shortly!
