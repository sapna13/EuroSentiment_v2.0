{"text":"This Hotel is Certainly A Number 1! Stayed there for 5 nights. This hotel is the best I have come across in all my travels. The rooms were very comfortably but what is more important, the hotel has thought of everything that a traveller would need to feel at home and well-looked after. The room has a Cisco Smart Phone and all one needs to do to ask for service or help is just to press one button. The SMART operator functions like a one-stop service personal for everything - from laundry, to food, to setting you up for a quick checking out etc. SPA is just excellent and the gym is 24 hours. I have stayed in many hotel and I always have issues with the opening hours of the gym. They normally start at 6.30 am and there isn't enough time to get in an hour of exercise and then be heading out for a meeting at 8.30 am unless I skip breakfast. The concierge provided boxes, sticky tap and strings for packing - something a traveller who is doing some heavy shopping would need. The room was also very well thought out. There is excellent range of free beverages, the see through glass bathroom gives the room a sense of space. The room we were at was on the 27th floor and it has a panaronomic view. The whole place smells clean and good. The hotel is just next to Langham Place a shopping centre with lost of retail space and food! It sits on top of the Mongkok station and I think one can't ask for more in terms of location. Food around the area is readily available and Electronic, Sports and Ladies Market just a short walk away. ","annotations":[]}
