{"text":"Loved Dream, GoTravel - not so much We booked our trip here with GoTravel. That would be my only negative. GoTravel advertised great flight times on there website, but they ended up changing them 4 days befor our vacation. We had to fly home at 1am in the morning (with 3 kids) and book another day off work (I've heard they do this a lot). Unfortunately, they tell you there is nothing you can do about it...so in the end we decided to suck it up and go with the flow. We did the 4 1\/2* wildcard, so were to find out where we were staying when we got there. When we go to Punta Cana and stood in GoTravel line they informed us that we were staying at Dreams...but...they had no room for us the first night so we had to go to Sunscape for one night. We had decided to go with the flow...we were on holidays. Sunscape was a nice short ride from the airport, so the kids were in the pool by 1pm and enjoying the sun. Sunscape made the BEST margaritas I have ever had and their service was AMAZING. The pool could definetely use some upgrading and the beach was very crowded, but we were only there for one night. The next morning we put on our bathing suits, packed up and took a cab to Dreams (the GoTravel rep was no help with this, we were really left to figure it out on our own). From here on in the trip was AMAZING, we had a very exciting cab ride to Dreams, lots of passing and honking (which my husband and 3 boys thought was a hoot). When we got to Dreams our rooms weren't quite ready, so we headed for breakfast and the beach. Everything was beautiful. When we our rooms were ready we were pleasantly surprised that they had upgraded both of our rooms to honeymoon suites in the Preferred Club (yes my 13 and 15 year old had their own jacuzzi on the balcony and King Size bed). The service here was awesome, for our inconveniences they also gave us $100\/room to use at the spa (so needless to say Mom enjoyed a half day there). My youngest (5 years) loved the Explorer Club and the soft ice cream stations at the bars. A great resort for kids, lots of games and acitivities. The food was good, no one got sick at all. Lots of room on the beach but if you want a chair by the pool be up before 8am or wait until the afternoon. We had a great time in the end, the flight back was a little painful though!
