{"text":"Unbelievable!! Paradise - What else do you need. We have just returned from a 7 day stay at the hotel. It is pure paradise.Yes the hotel may not be up to date compared to say the Grand Hyatt which we visited, but, it has a very special feeling about it.We stayed in a Regency Club room which was great and a little more upto date than a standard room.The room was immaculately clean and room service attended twice a day to change towels and turn down the bed.All the staff were very pleasant and helped with any problems.The gardens, swimming pool and beach were all to hand and were spotless (they even raked the sand on the beach!!).The hotel is in a superb loacation with restaurants and shops right next to the hotel (turn left out of the gates for better restaurants). The restaurants outside are very cheap (fillet steak meal √ä√£¬¢3 and gorgeous. Beer and shorts are cheap and wine is expensive). The hotel meals were very good and slightly more expensive but still cheap compared to UK.We recommend a visit to Kuta for some shopping (taxi fare no more than √ä√£¬¢4 for the 20 minute journey, prepare to barter with the taxis outside the hotel). Kuta has some amazing bargains for very good copy designer goods. My Wife was in heaven. Make sure you leave some space in your case because everything is soo soo cheap!!! Be prepared to half what ever they want for any goods you buy. They expect you to barter so shop around first to get an idea for prices.We did a free trip to the Grand Hyatt at Nusa Dua and felt it was a little too modern for our tastes. The Bali Hyatt was more laid back and friendly. Already booked for next year!!! Can't wait... ","annotations":[]}
