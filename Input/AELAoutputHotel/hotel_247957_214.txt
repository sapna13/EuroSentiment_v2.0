{"text":"Great resort and loved the beach Well we made it! All 13 of us. We had a blast! Airport pick up went great, asked them to stop for some cold cervesa which they did....check in was effortless....I am an owner and the rest came as guests and referrals, so it really went smooth. All of our rooms were ready at 1:30 when we checked in. Our room was a 1 bedroom suite overlooking the swimup pool bar...awesome (bldg 14). The rest of the gang were in either building 14 or 15 so we were all close. They all like their rooms, some had minor issue that were easily resolved. Like any resort there are some things that people like and some things people aren't so hot on....we've been to other AI resorts in DR and in Mexico. I've come to realize that you just can't compare DR to Mexico...totally different life style etc. So with that said.....I'm going to give you my opinion. I loved this place. Yes it's big and spread out, but I like that feeling of not being overcrowded. Besides...exercise never hurt after leaving the buffet! We used the buffet in the main building and the one by the beach. I liked them both. On a scale of 1-10 (10 highest) I'd give the food a 7-8. but like any place....a buffet after 5 days is boring, not to mention 7 days or more of it. But hey....like I said...I never went hungry! Loved the pizza place, but laughed if you ordered olives on the pizza...they had the pits still in them...so be careful! We also really liked the taco place....the shrimp tacos are nummy! We spent time at the lobby bar and they were great......Juan Carlos at the beach bar was our buddy however. Our group prefered the beach over the pool.....the pool was wonderful, we just are beach people. Some in our group did the parisailing and loved it. 4 of us big girls got on the banana boat....what a hoot. I'm sure they could hear us up and down the beach laughing....until we got dumped off. that was interesting....trying to have a 110 lb guy in the boat trying to get us big girls back on the banana....I laughed soooo hard. at one point I thought we were going to pull him in the water with us! The weather was great...only rained a little bit nothing to dampen the trip. We did the Montser Truck Saffari....we didn't like it. It was very educational, but that wasn't what we thought it would be....and 8 hours was just way too long. I've heard since then that the Jerasic saffari is much better. And what can I say about Steves! We had a blast. We had to go several times in fact....Met both Mikes  Steve. Bought some of the NEW Steves corner bar t-shirts too! Did some shopping in that area....as other posters have said...you must barter with them. I bought home my usual suitcase full of goodies! We are morning people, so unfortunately we never saw a night show...heard they were great however. The beach....totally awesome, this has to be the best beach that I've ever been to, totally enjoyed it. The service was a little slower than I'm used to in Mexico, but again it didn't effect my trip. Would I go back.....YES. The resort and the people of Punta Cana were very friendly and welcoming. I tried my limited spanish.....made one guy really laugh...so not quite sure what I said, but he got a kick out of it! HEY....I also met Scooter from Canada! If you have any questions please PM me and I'd be glad to help. I'll post my pictues as soon as I figure out how to attach them.
