{"text":"Decent rooms in questionable n'hood, but terrible front desk clerks The Hotel by itself was not bad, though located in a questionable neighborhood, but the front desk staff is just terrible. Here's the sequence of events - I register at the front desk and then go up to our room only to find that our keys don't work. So I walk down and the clerk reissues another, without even an apology. I go back up again and find out the Fridge\/MW we asked for was not available in our room. I go back down, again, and the clerk (with an unforgettable name of 'Junior' and a very unprofessional attitude) says that only the King suites had them, despite what the Hotel website says. It's almost as if you are in a East European Student Hostel and not a 'business-traveler' hotel as Holiday Inn Corp positions ts 'Express' brand as. I then ask for a King suite since we were promised a Fridge\/MW, but he says that they don't have any available. I insisted that with a child traveling with us, that was an absolute necessity, and after about 10 minutes of back and forth, surprise, surprise he miraculously finds one! He then asks me if the earlier room was clean and if we had used it (we didn't even have time to unpack!!) and then asks that I return the keys to the earlier room immediately, which involved another trip up and down to get my wife's key. I almost decided to quit at that point. Anyway we were tired from a long flight and decided to stay. So after a total of 3 trips back and forth from our room, we finally settle down. The stay in the room was pleasant enough, though by the second night one of our keys stopped working. I decided not to bother asking for a replacement again.I work as a Marketing Manager for a large Travel distribution corporation, and plan to follow up with Holiday Inn corporate with my issues regarding unprofessional staff at hotels carrying their brand.
