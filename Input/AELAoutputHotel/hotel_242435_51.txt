{"text":"Absolutely LOVE the Hyatt Regency Waikiki!! I just came back from Hawaii (Honolulu) and we stayed at the Hyatt Regency. It is an absolutely beautiful hotel and in the best location. It literally takes about 30 seconds to walk from the hotel lobby to the famous Waikiki beach. The rooms are comfortable (albeit the view was not great...overlooked rooftops and a parking lot), and the cleaning staff is very nice. Actually, the entire hotel staff was welcoming and helpful. Inside the hotel, there is an Expedia tours, Hertz, and Budget car rental stations where you can go to book same-day tours or rent cars, etc. which is very convenient. They have an amazing spa that overlooks the beach and ocean. We took hula dancing lessons in the spa ($20 per person and is offered on Tues\/Thur\/Sat) and had a wonderful time. I love this hotel...no doubt I shall stay again!!In terms of tours, we booked the following excursions:1. Pearl Harbor: booked through the Home of the Brave Tours and not only did we visit the USS Arizona memorial, we also toured the Home of the Brave Museum which has a nice selection of WWII memorabilia. The tour guide (Kelly) was professional, friendly, and very informative2. Horse-back riding at Kualoa Ranch: amazing experience; the horses were mild-mannered and well-trained. The view overlooking the ocean, lush trees and Chinaman's Hat was amazing. The staff is super, super friendly!3. Hanuama Bay: definitely should visit as the water is as clear as can be and there are lots of fish to see if in the deeper part of the ocean4. Germaine's Luau: highly recommended; the tour guide (Georgie) was professional and hilariously entertaining. The show was not very long but the quality was good. This was also the most reasonably priced (less than $100 unlike other ones that are available). It is large (~500 people) but did not feel out of control...it was like having a backyard party...with 500 of your closest friends...sort of!
