{"text":"Ideal in all respects We chose the Sofitel because of its location and the reviews on this site. We were not disappointed. First, the location is ideal for virtually everything. The Mall is only about 4-5 blocks and all sights -- from the Capitol to the Smithsonian are walkable as well if you're fit and like to walk. We were lucky with the weather so only took the Metro or cabs in the evening. As for the hotel, it's extremely comfortable and the service is excellent. From the front desk, to the concierge (Andrew is great!) to the door staff, everyone was warm, friendly and extremely helpful. The rooms, as described, are smallish, but very well outfitted and in no way cramped. We had asked for and got a corner room, so we had windows and light galore, which was nice. We've stayed in lots of hotels, including Ritz's, which we love, but this competed on every level and was one of the cleanest places I've ever seen, with virtually no signs of wear and tear anywhere. The gym was well-equipped and kept immaculate, with fruit and headphones there for the taking. A great coffee\/tea service every morning in the lobby added to the sense of overall comfort and service. All in all a great place to stay and my number 1 choice in Washington for the future. Last year we stayed at Dupont Circle at the Palomar, and while certainly a nice hotel, this beat it on all respects, especially location.
