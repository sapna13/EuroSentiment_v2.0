{"text":"Our favorite family vacation spot We stayed at Copamarina for 5 nights after staying 1 night in San Juan (2\/20-2\/26). We will skip San Juan next time and go to Copamarina straight from the airport as it takes only 2-hour drive. We brought 7 years old and 3 years old, both loved the pool, kiddie pool and play ground. We did not choose All Inclusive package and that was the right choice for us as we saved $1000 over food and activities that we did not do. My husband did scuba diving twice (2 x $90), and I did Bodyderm spa massage ($80), and still saved that much money. We were disappointed that Alexandra restaurant was horrible. I ordered Oriental shrimp and the sauce was totally disgusting - believe me, any Chinese restaurant in your home town can do better. My husband ordered some Italian-like dish with pasta, and we agreed that nothing was fancy. Alexandra was supposed to be fancy with lots of $$$, but food is not worth the money at all. We drove to neighboring town and had much better dinner there. We stayed in Garden View room, but it was a bit small for our family. We looked at the Superior Garden View room and it had more space and looked nicer. Our Garden View room did not have a bath tub (just shower), but we were told that we just needed to ask for it as some rooms have bath tub. The resoft is relaxed and laid back, and stuff were friendly to make us feel comfortable. Overall, we liked this resort and want to go back again.
