{"text":"Excellent Hotel Would highly recommend this hotel.Firstly it is in a great location a five minute walk from Times Square and all the shops along Fifth Avenue.The hotel itself is very clean - the staff are helpful and the room was big particulary for New York rooms .The bathroom was huge !!!!!New York itself was amazing and we really enjoyed our trip.We flew out with BA the flight was fine but i have to say having flown to America wih Virgin since - i would pick Virgin next time.A few tips - you can buy a pass for the buses from the street vendors, do haggle for them though. These work on a loop system that go around all of New York stopping at each place of interest. They are open top and great in the summer. On our first day we got on the Bus and just stayed on for the whole route ( 2 hours ) to get our bearings and to understand where everything is. You see some great sites and are able to get on and off whenever you want to.Naturally there is lots of places to eat. We went to the Hard Rock Cafe and even found an indian restuarant 5 minute walk from our hotel ! Abercrombie, Tiffanys, Gucci and Trump Towers are all very close also on Fifth Avenue.Note if you want to go to Rainbow Rooms, even in the day we werent allowed in in jeans but genererally everywhere else was casual dress.We went for 4 nights and found this to be just the right length of stay we got to see everything we wanted to it was tiring but well worth it.We booked the hotel and flghts seperate and Expedia were really reasonable for the hotel room - 100 pounds per night per person for an upgraded room. It is very easy to get a taxi at the airport and the hotel reception booked our return car for us. It was around 50 dollars.We would love to return to New York and would stay at this hotel again.
