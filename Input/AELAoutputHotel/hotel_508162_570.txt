{"text":"Absolutely Fantatstic- Holiday of a lifetime! Dreams Resort Punta Cana and the Dominican Republic as a whole offered my boyfriend and I the holiday of a lifetime! When we arrived at the airport, the atmosphere was extremely relaxed and the people were friendly and very happy.On arrival at the hotel, there were approx 25 other guests waiting. This was rectified by numerous staff manning the reception desk and we got served straight away and offered a refreshing welcome drink by a friendly member of staff. The reception staff were very helpful at all times throughout the fortnight.The rooms were immaculate, we had no problems at all. A lot of the time we did not use the safe and left credit cards, cash and mobile phones out on the table. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ITEM STOLEN! The cleaning staff were friendly helpful and very honest!The food at the hotel was top notch and offered something for every palate. Nothing was too much trouble for the chefs or waiters\/waitresses and drinks were constantly refreshed. We tried the Oceana, Sea Side restaurant, Mexican, World Cafe, Chinese and Italian restaurants, and we could not have faulted any of them.The pool and sunbathing area was fantastic and a lady constantly refreshed all bathers with frequent drinks and fresh fruit, which was very welcome in the hot sunshine! The entertainment at night was brilliant, and the dancers are a credit to the hotel. The hotel even catered for an American football game in the sports bar and provided big screens, food, and drink to keep the yapping Yankies happy, but still this was not good enough. We took a trip to Suona island and loved every minute of it. Our Rep at the hotel was the most helpful and friendly Rep (Sharon VIP Travel) ive ever encountered. She was very open and honest about all trips and was very approachable and knew everything about the island having lived there for 5 years.Overall the only thing I could say that slightly spoilt our holiday was the constantly loud, abnoxious, Americans\/Canadians who took over the complex and constantly moaned about everything and belittled the other visitors. However we learnt to ignore them after a day or two and did not let them ruin what turned out to be our holiday of a lifetime.We would definitely go back, in the process of booking for next year to the same hotel. My boyfriend has been to the Dom Rep before and stayed in another 5* hotel and it did not compare at all the Dreams. We also spoke to a couple at the airport who stayed in another 5* hotel on the island and they did not have half of the perks that we enjoyed, they didnt even have room service. Dreams is 5* luxury and fulfills all expectations.
