{"text":"Excellent value for such a popular location For $275 a night this property was a good deal. We had a Superior Deluxe on the second floor. The railroad car shaped room had adequate space for the two of us and our luggage. But as their website clearly states, this is a converted 5 story brownstone with no elevator and the stairs are quite narrow and steep. If one of the attendants carries your luggage to and from your room, be sure to tip him well. He will have earned it. The bath was clean, but tiny..no sharing. The shower was a separate glass brick enclosure around the corner in the sitting area. The bed was extremely comfortable and our room facing the back was very quiet. The central air worked perfectly but it was nice to be able to open the window for fresh air. The sitting area was spartan with a small round table that barely held a laptop and the lamp. The 2 metal chairs could have used cushions, but at least the the free wireless was very fast. Each morning one of us would fetch a muffin and coffee from the kitchen downstairs and both were fresh and tasty. Everyone on the staff was courteous and helpful and it was great to have someone at the desk 24 hrs. If you are comfortable with B  B's, you should like this place, and although it is not particularly botique or plush, it does have character. When 2 and 3 star hotel rooms that week (before the NY Marathon) were going for $500, it was a find. And having Balducci's and the Chelsea Market at opposite ends of the block added to the experience. With superb flights to and from Seattle on Jet Blue and excellent towncar service from\/to JFK by Carmel, it was a wonderful 5 days. And we saw Xandu on Broadway twice. Go, you'll love it.
