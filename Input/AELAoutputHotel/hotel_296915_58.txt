{"text":"Prizeworthy This was a two-day surprise visit to celebrate our engagement and overall we considered it a wonderful choice. The location is perfect - literally just off Plaza de Catalunia but in a relatively quiet street. The hotel has a more boutique feel with modern, understated decor, a truly fantastic roof terrace with lounge-about chairs, and stylish rooms that, although not huge, are beautifully decorated. The food in the bar was of a very high quality and a reasonable price and staff were always courteous.I opted for the romantic package on the first night and we arrived to find a bow tied around our door, champagne on ice, and rose petals scattered across the bed and in the bathroom - always goes down well with your newly elected fiancee!My only criticism would be that on two occasions the service from staff left a little to be desired - the girl in the restaurant got our order wrong completely (missed one item completely and gave us another dish we hadn't ordered). And on the evening I needed an ironing board I was told one would arrive in the room in 10 minutes. 30 minutes later it hadn't arrived and on phoning I could not get a response. Eventually I went down to reception and was told I would have to carry the ironing board and iron up to my room as they only had one person on reception at that time. Not a major issue but when you're paying four-star prices you perhaps expect a slightly better level of personal service. But then again my experience of Spanish service, in hotels and restaurants, is that they are generally more relaxed than in England, so maybe this slight upset isn't anything to pay much attention. Overall I would recommend the hotel highly - the staff were incredibly friendly and there's a fantastically relaxed atmosphere which really sets you up for your stay in Barcelona. ","annotations":[]}
