{"text":"Fabulous Family Resort! Our family of four stayed at the Rio Mar this past week, during Teachers Convention break, when the kids were home from school. It was a quick three-day break - Thurs - Sat. - with my 11-year old daughter and 9-year old son. My husband and I were delighted with the accomodations (perfect for a family); the activities (great family pool, adult pool and beach); and great restaurants (the right cuisine for adults and picky-eater kids). Most importantly, the service levels for this type of resort was outstanding! We were delighted with the can-do attitude of everyone from the waiters and housekeepers, to the managers who checked that everything was satisfactory. How can we make your stay more enjoyable, was a phrase I heard often. Although we were looking foward to a little rest and relaxation (I finished two books in three days - and enjoyed a hike through the Rain Forest), we were pleasantly surprised with how pampered we felt. The rooms were clean and well-appointed with amenities, and we never came back to an unmade room. Our room always had fresh towels for all four of us, and the sheets were crisp, comfortable and clean. The view of the ocean was delightful, as was falling asleep to crashing waves. It was pouring rain on our last evening, and I was afraid that a packed hotel restaurant would mean uneven service - but again I was delighted to find our dinner excellant and the service prompt and reliable. The Puerto Rican specialties for my husband and myself was delicious, and our kids delighted in juicy hamburgers and mac n cheese. The breakfast buffet was robust, and well-priced. ($6 for the kids' breakfast buffet - I hate paying full price when my 9-year old only wants a bagel, cereal, orange juice and chocolate milk!). I would strongly recommend the Rio Mar to our friends. Quite frankly, I was surprised at the mixed review that this resort has earned. We travel as a family at least 6 times each year (mini-vacations and weekends), and this was among the best experiences we have had this year.
