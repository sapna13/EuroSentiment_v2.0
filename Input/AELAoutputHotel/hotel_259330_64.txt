{"text":"bring the bug spray ok..well we go to our room and thought it was pretty nice, I have to say the place is nice on arrive. Ist night everything went ok. Must tell you if you never did a all-inclusive before you MUST book your dinner when we get in. Reserve all resturants asap you cant get in with out a reservation. 2nd night walked into the hallway and saw a big roach..YEs a roach. I know we are in the islands but i really prefer not to see them. We went into our room put on the lights and saw 2 more in our bathroom. Ok thought it was the norm for a island. As we tried to sleep that night we where watching some tv and another one ran across the screen...Well thats it! I cant sleep anymore. Next morning I went to the front desk and told them of our problem, they apoligized and told us someone whould come and take care of the problem. After returning from the beach we entered our room to the smell of bug spray. I forgot to say but my 6 year old was on this trio with us so had to smell this great smeel. That night went well no bugs. Next night they came back. Called the front desk and told us someone would come up asap. We waited and waited finally my daughter feel alseep and knock knock at 11:30 a housekeeper comes with a can of spray! Same smeel that we smelled before. We told her thats not gonna work. Next day back to front desk they said a extermanator would come soon. Well ok then but our stay is almost over. better late than never. Also be prepared to get harrased every morning after breaskfast my friend they will say trying to get you to by timeshares and jewerly. If you dont have the correct change they dont want to get you money back. I would return to punta cana but have to find a better place to stay. Sorry! ","annotations":[]}
