{"text":"Good overall deal We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights part of our honeymoon trip of Hawaii. Check in was easy - we checked in a bit early but they still had a room for us and were able to accomodate us. We had booked a standard mountain view room. It seems they had set a side a room for us but she then realized we were on our honeymoon (it was in the hotel notes) and the room they had prepared for us was two double beds. She offered us that or a room on the 31st floor but it was right beside the elevators. I took the one on the 31st floor b\/c we did want a king bed. The elevator noise was not that bad - sounded almost like a light thunder - and I am a light sleeper and it didnt bother me. We got an ocean view and it was amazing - looking right at Waikiki beach (i should mention I am a Hilton Diamond member so hence the upgrade). The rooms are small especially the bathroom! They are tiny and the shower is pretty small (no tub). But it was clean and modern. Our room also had an empty fridge so you could put stuff in there - we got 2 water bottles every night.We got access to the executive lounge and got free continental breakfast. The executive lounge was in the basement as they are apparently remodeling the other one. It was OK - Ive been to nicer lounges but alse to worse ones (ie Hilton Kauai). The breakfast was decent and exactly what I expected. Free wireless was available in the executive lounge - but I also manged to get free wireless in our room - so we didn't pay for internet at all during our stay. They also served appetizers from 5-6pm? or something like that - it was OK and was good to have a snack there.Overall, I thought it was a good value stay. We paid about 160 per night - it was very close to waikiki and we were able to walk everywhere. I was pretty happy with our stay and had no issues. ","annotations":[]}
