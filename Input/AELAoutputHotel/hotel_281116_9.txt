{"text":"Was an interesting experience.... overall good value!! We booked this hotel through Otel.com. They seem very effiient and also give you extra discounts off following hotels that you book through them.The rooms were extremely comfortable but even though it was situated off the Gran Via, it was pretty noisy. (I am a light sleeper though.)Free minibar would have been very welcome had it been advised at check in. Was also not aware of the free Wi-FI!!! Very good that these services are included in the price, the hotel just needs to advertise them as complimentary!The prostitues made interesting viewing when we came in from a club night out!Incidentally, the hotel is situated close to some great bars, restaurants and shops and also the gay area, La Chueca.One restaurant called the La Pescador on Calle de las infantas was pretty good. It is classedas a Tapas bar and we ordered 5 Tapas.... they came as HUGE plates and despite having huge appetites, we left a lot of food. Great value though lol!!!The breakfast in the hotel was varied and classed as American. One thing the hotel really does need to do is find a way of keeping the hot bacon, eggs and sausage hot as no matter when we went down for breakfast, the hot stuff was not!!!! They also need to get rid of the blonde kitchen assistant!!! She was very rude and reminded me of many staff I had dealings with when I worked in Spain as a rep\/manager! All the other staff were absolutely wonderful and could not do enough.... especially on reception.Overall, very recommended! Thanks specially to the reception staff, their knowledge and desire to help was a huge assett to the hotel!!!
