{"text":"4 carribean stars European couple spent 4 nights at Rio Mar from April 12th-16th. Booked trip through Expedia. First time to Puerto Rico.Rio Mar is very expensive for the somewhat mediocre standard. The whole resort is of usual 4 star carribean standard, but service\/management is of higher quality than in 'spanish' carribean places.We got a free upgrade from resort view to ocean view, in main building. Write them in advance.Room was alright - almost nice, but not great. Bathroom was roomy, however, the handyman must have had 10 thumbs and no ruler when doing the installations\/tiling.Floor cold as ice, conditioner noisy and could not do heating. On positive side there were no mosquitos\/bugs on this time of the year. :)Great bed! The problem with Rio Mar is that you have to pay for what-ever move you make. 25 USD for breakfast buffet, plus some times the waiters add 15% gratuity on the bill.15 USD per day for wifi in the room.20 USD per day for parking for rented car. You do want to rent a car to get around. Valet staff have the slowest 'walk' I have ever seen.Food and beverages are quite expensive, e.g. 5 USD for local beer and 10 usd for cocktails which arent all that. A good lunch or dinner for two will set you back 100 usd plus wine\/alcohol.A dinner in the japanese restaurant scared us off from eating anything else than breakfast in the resort. I cant recall having tasted more bland sushi\/rolls\/salads anywhere else.Pool-area was nice, but sunbeds were only good in the adult section. Not enough sunscreens. 150 USD for renting a poolside cabina\/tent-roof per day - crazy!The iguanas were funny - suddenly running down the palms - even moved around near the pool. Do go for iguana feeding at 11.00 - especially if you are childish or have kids.The beach was nice too, but somewhat windy. Surf probably too big for kids younger than teenagers. The beach could look a lot nicer with better sunbeds, sunscreens and decor, but as it is now, its not attractive to lie there.You need a car to get out of the resort. We had diner at Richie's app. 1 mile up hill to the right. Fantastic view, friendly service and very nice food. Generous portions.The best food we had was at La Parilla app. 10 minutes drive on eastern beach. Perfect seating for having dinner and watching the sun go down. Really nice food, with a good local touch, but huge portions. Friendly service and reasonable priced. Many regulars. Probably a busy area in week-ends. Dont get scared off by the local touch of the many kiosks there. Do drive up El Younqe rain forrest. Fantastic to drive uphill through the jungle, great views, water falls, fantastic nature. Unfortunately, it was raining cats and dogs when we were there, so we didnt go walking on the tracks.
