{"text":"A relaxing vacation We were at the Excellence for our honeymoon from Sept. 16-23rd - we arrived here after staying for a week at the Majestic Colonial Resort where we got married. The good things about the Excellence:- Adults only- A quiet, relaxing atmosphere with a day time entertainment team that was friendly without being too loud or obnoxious. - Two pools - a long pool running parallel to the beach with lots of shady spots, and an infinity pool that was nestled among the hotel rooms and very quiet. - Lots of rafts to use in the pool- 8 restaurants with no -reservations required, room service included, no wrist bands- Top shelf name-brand liquor and even a few brands of American beer to choose from- An ecological park with nice walking trails and two very friendly talking parrots that provided entertainment when we were missing our pets at home- The staff looked happy, they really tried to speak English, and it seemed like they enjoyed working there. The okay things about the Excellence:- The beach is very pretty, with sand that looks exactly like soft brown sugar. The waves were too rough for swimming most days, and although there is a sign that tells you that you can walk 325 yards down the beach to better swimming and snorkling, we were reluctant to do this since it's off resort property and we didn't trust that it would be safe. - The food was probably good for Dominican standards, and average by Canadian or American standards. You have to give them credit though for the effort they put forward and for their ability to provide the caliber of food that they do in such a poor country. Very good selection. Things we were disappointed with:- It was our honeymoon, and although it said so on on our trip documents, they did not acknowlege this until we asked for a honeymoon banner to be put on our door, and we were never even offered the romantic dinner that is part of the free honeymoon package. - On our last day there, it rained for the whole day and there was nothing to do - the animation team finally came into the main lobby and started interacting with the guests. - We didn't like the spa - of all of the resorts we have been to, it was probably the least appealing.
