{"text":"Terrible Cancellation\/Reservation Policy -- Book carefully I have been relocated to Amsterdam for work for 6 mos and my company booked me in a room at the American Hotel in Amsterdam for 8 days while I looked for an apartment to rent.Overall, the staff at the hotel was great and location central (albeit touristy) but they tack on lots of little extras. A subpar buffet breakfast costs 21 Euros (after making the mistake once I walked down the street to Bagels and Beans and ate much better for 4 Euros), basic internet access costs 17 Euros a day and I had problems with my eithernet connection.However, my main issue with the hotel is that after you check in you can't change your reservation. So, as luck would have it, I found an apt and moved in on my 5th day in the city. I let the manager know 24 hrs in advance that I would be leaving 2 days early, however, apparently once you physically check in to the hotel you can't change your end date. You can change the length of the reservation after you make it but this has to be done bfore you check in. My company was obligated to pay for the two days that I didn't stay there -- and they could have easily re-rented the room as it was a national holiday and 3 day weekend.Additionally, two colleagues for work were coming out for a week for work and our work travel department booked them in the hotel as well (I have since told them not to put people there). Based on my review, my co-workers tried to cancel their reservations at the American Hotel 3 weeks in advance of their arrival date and they were told that if they cancelled they'd have to still pay the full amount for their stay (over 1600 Euros each). So, apparently you can't cancel a reservation in it's entirity as well. You can only alter it (which is what they did -- changed from 8 days to 1 day and will be moving to a nearby, nicer and cheaper hotel) . Apparently these details are included in the fine print when you make a reservation, but I have never heard of such an inflexible reservation policy and haven't found another hotel in Amsterdam that has such a policy in place.So, a word of warning, if you book at this hotel make sure that you are 100% confident in your dates and book trip insurance in case you have to cancel and are charged the full amount ","annotations":[{"endOffset":461,"mention":"Bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":455}]}
