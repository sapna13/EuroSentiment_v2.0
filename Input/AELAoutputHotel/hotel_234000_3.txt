{"text":"Nice hotel My husband and I just stayed at the Holiday Inn Frankfurt Airport North last Saturday night (May 10, 2008). I booked the hotel online after reading reviews and looking at the hotel website photos. Although I wasn't thrilled about paying 11 Euros to park in addition to the room bill, that seemed common with German\/Austrian hotels. The hotel is located close to the airport (about 10 minutes away), but it is in a nice, quiet, wooded area off the road. The check-in was quick, and because I had joined the Holiday Inn club, we each got a free drink (beer, sparkling water or juice). The room was labeled an Executive Double. It was large with a king-sized bed. We had a view over the Biergarten, which was nice. The bathroom was large with a full tub. The only problem we had with the room was that the air conditioning didn't cool the room much. It was okay since it was early May and it wasn't very warm out, but it would have been a problem if the weather was warmer. The room had complimentary sparking waters and juices, as well as some small treats. It also had a tv (with English and other channels), a pants presser, a coffee maker (which is unusual), a desk and an alarm clock. Very nicely stocked. My husband used the gym and commented that it was small and some equipment was not working, but it was nice to have something. The Biergarten was wonderful! We had dinner and some beer that evening and met some fun fellow Americans. The breakfast buffet was the best we had on our trip, even better than nice ones offered by hotels costing nearly twice as much. It was huge and had a great variety. The lobby had two computers with internet access, but we did have to pay for 45 minutes worth (for 5 euro, I think). Overall, this hotel was a very good value, and it was more than I expected. Definitely join the Holiday Inn club online, which only takes a minute. It was a nice place to stay on our last night.
