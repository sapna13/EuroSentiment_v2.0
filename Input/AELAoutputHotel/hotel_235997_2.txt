{"text":"Initial fiasco, but good ending I chose this hotel based on the overall good reviews and of course because of the great location. I was a bit hesitant because of the one bad review by a seemingly quite unlucky guest at the hotel regarding some room 28! The stay started not great when they offered us room 28! Upon mentioning the review, the hotel manager promptly switched us to room 25, which was just a couple of doors down and facing the same area, which actually ended up being a very nice partial view of the Duomo.The problem started with going to the room, which was suppossely ready and finding that the luggage of the previous guest was there and the room was still not clean. Exactly as the bad review stated. After this, I chose to chill out and hope for the best and actually (without any complains on my part to the management), we got quite close to it given that I have only paid just over √à√\u2020√ü?00 via an online website.The room, once cleaned was actually clean and charming. I found the hotel odd distribution to be a plus and there were plenty of nice common areas to sit down, have a coffee or simply connect to Internet via the free wifi connection (at least free for us). The staff was polite and helpful at all times.In summary:Best: Location, staff and charming and quirky layout of hotelWorst: Really, they need to work on the logistics of room cleaning before offering to new guests ","annotations":[{"endOffset":494,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":490},{"endOffset":1071,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1067},{"endOffset":1071,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1067},{"endOffset":1071,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1067},{"endOffset":1071,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1067},{"endOffset":1071,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1067},{"endOffset":1111,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1105},{"endOffset":1111,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1105},{"endOffset":1111,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1105},{"endOffset":1111,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1105}]}
