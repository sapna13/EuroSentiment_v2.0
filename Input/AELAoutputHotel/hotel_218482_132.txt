{"text":"Awesome Holiday just returned last night from a weeks stay at the catalonia..march 15 thru the 22ndAWESOME ROOM \/ SERVICE \/ BEACH \/ ACTIVITIES and met alot of great people from all ages!!!! we spent alot of afternoons around the poolbar area...when the sun was out and beating down on you its a quick way to cool off...the food in the main restaurant\/ pool restaurant was so\/so...aka lots of repetition but hey we didnt get ill so thats alllllllll that matters...:O)we tended to eat breakfast at the main restaurant but found lunch was better at the restaurant by the pool...the pizza, tacos\/dip, chicken area by the pool had food that filled you up if you were tooo hungry to wait for supper of just wanted something to snack on during the daywe stayed in building 5 ...short distance from the beach\/pools and a little futher from the main restaurant lobby...but didnt find that walk really thatttt long... 'welll...ok...one night after the disco closed it did seem far...hahahawe totally enjoyed the beach to the max....if you go left off the resort you can walk quite a fair way...hubby and i would usually walk every morning for about an hour n' a half in one direction picking up shells n' dodging waves as they came in sometimes with seaweed....*whispers...we also brought a sandwich or two made while we had breakfast in the restaurant and would wrap them up in napkins to feed the beach dogs...apparently nobody owns them...but they sure looked for us every day and would often spot us before we spotted them...hahahathe seaweed in the water for the most part isnt that bad...but when the waves receeded we werent too sure what was 'ticklin' as the wave left the beach and the 'stuff' brushes over\/past your feet...we had excellent weather except for a few days when a storm came in...and mannnnn did the waves change and get stronger!!!!.... they ended up taking a few of the palmtrees into the water that were along the shoreline... and sand bags were added to stop the restaurant between the royal and catalonia area from flooding due to the wave surges...the next morning the 'shade huts' looked sooo funny... due to all of the sand coming in with the stronger waves? the tables that were usually waist high on the pole under the shade huts were now just below our knees...thats how much sand got 'dumped' on the beach!!!!we couldnt really walk the beach for two days due to the waves but by the third day it was alll ok and we were able to resume our morning walk down the beach...didnt buy anything at the 'market' to the right of the resort...same ol' stuff we got last time we were in the dominican so didnt feel the need to bring anything back anyways...however others said there were great deals to be had on the paintings...:O)i think the vendors that the hotel brings in on friday night could be a little less pushy and lower their prices by 1\/2...their prices were alot more than the market down the beach...almost triple the price...oh well...maybe the hotel takes a share of their sales so they have no choice but to up the price...:O(we brought paper\/pens\/cosmetics\/toys\/candy for our maid and that left with a few bucks each morning always brought a smile to her face...it was sooo funny the next morning she would try to tell us what her three children thought of our gifts from the day before!!!!as for the restaurants... we didnt eat at the steakhouse but heard it was ok... we traded that dinner card in for another night at the japanese restaurant which was EXCELLENT...the garlic shrimp was soooooooo full of flavour my mouth is watering at the memory!!!!we also enjoyed the french restaurant... i loved my lobster tails and hubby really enjoyed his two bacon wrapped filet migons...we also ate at the mexican...nothing special other than you could get a coronna there... but in all honesty? i think for the most part we didnt enjoy it as much since we have mexican restaurants at home so a burrito is a burrito no matter where you eat it...other people though from germany LOVED it...said they had never 'tasted' mexican food before so there ya go...:O)all in all we wouldnt hesitate to return to the catalonia...the resort itself with its surroundings is a strong 4 star...however the 'food' aside from the specialty restaurants would only be a three...:O( ","annotations":[{"endOffset":584,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":579},{"endOffset":1289,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1281},{"endOffset":1289,"mention":"sandwich","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1281},{"endOffset":3929,"mention":"burrito","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Burrito"],"startOffset":3922}]}
