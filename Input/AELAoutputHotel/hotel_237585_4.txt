{"text":"Wonderful Experience I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. Make a long story short, I was stuck in Amsterdam for a few nights and had to find a place to stay, so I just walked in the hotel and I was lucky to find a room with Hotel Aalders. The hotel is in a residential area of the city, but very close to everything, museums, parks, shopping area, restaurants, train stops, etc. I felt safe to walk by myself.I stayed different room each day. My first day, I stayed in a small room, however, it was a perfect size for me. As I saw in someone√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ review, you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ come to Amsterdam to spend too much time in your hotel room, so the size of the room didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ matter to me. My second day, I moved to a big room. It was too big for me, and I could switch the room with someone else, but again, the size of the room was not a big deal to me. In both room, I felt comfortable. The rooms were very clean and neat. Breakfast was included in price. There was a plenty of great choice. Laundry service was available. The reception was open 24 hours, and the hotel entrance was secured. The receptionist held my luggage after I checked out. I had some errands to do near by, so being able to leave my stuff was super helpful for me. There was a bar\/lounge, so I spent some relaxing time and chit-chat with other travelers. There was a free computer available in this lounge, and this made my life so easy. The greatest experience in this hotel was, all of the hotel staffs (including house keepers) were very helpful and friendly. As I mentioned in the front, I was stuck in Amsterdam for the personal reason (lost my passport and couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fly back), so I had no choice but just had to stay there. First it was very difficult for me, and I actually cried for a few times, but I could change my attitude positive, because of the hotel staffs. They were so helpful and warm hearted. They listened to my stories and could comfort me enough. That was what I needed, especially when I felt so alone and nervous and stressed out. I truly felt that they cared about me.Overall, the purpose of my stay wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ so great, but staying the hotel was wonderful experience. The price was very reasonable with all services. If you want to stay in an at-home-style of accommodation, Hotel Aalders is the one. I recommend to other people and would love to visit them again.
