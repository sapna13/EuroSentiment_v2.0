{"text":"Pleasant mistake! I stayed here for one night in November 2007. On my arrival to Sydney, after 24hrs of travelling, I arrived at the Best Western Azure Apts. Unfortunately, there was an error on the Wotif booking site where I had my confirmation but the hotel didnt receive theirs, thus, no hotel room for me (see my review, Shaky start but nice stay for Best Western). Best Western immediately called Simpsons nearby, to see if they had a room to accomodate us  they did. Although it wasn't in the BB itself, it was right next door in an apt. building. (I don't know if its part of the BB or a separate business because I didnt see it mentioned on their website) The apt. was immaculate. It was a contemporary styled one bedroom apartment w\/a small complete kitchenette,  nice view. Nicer than the room, were the staff. The owners were beyond pleasant. Keith had made us feel very welcome from the moment we arrived. He showed us around  took the time to map out what we could do, where to eat, or what market to go to if we wanted to cook in our apt. The tropical, brick paved entrance was beautiful. There was what I think was a reading area or den, and an area where one could use their internet (free). Though we weren't officially booked w\/Simpsons, they were kind enough to offer us breakfast the next morning when I had stopped by to use their internet. Their breakfast area was a beautiful, bright  airy room; exactly like their website pic. Their breakfast was basic but good; breads, fruits, juices, cereal, fresh coffee. Satisfying.We had a wonderful conversation with one of their staff members (Marie, Maria?) from Columbia. She was such a sweet woman,  when we had mentioned that we would have loved to continue our stay there (we were due to go back to Best western after our 1 night stay), she immediately spoke w\/the owner to see if we could be accomodated. Unfortunately, they were fully booked. We really enjoyed\/loved this place. From the pics on their site, would haved loved to actually stay in one of their charming BB rooms, though the apt was quite nice. I understand we all have different tastes, but if you're expecting luxury  pampering, white glove style as you're accustomed to, then by all means book those types of accomodations. But if you're looking for wonderful, home-style  personal charm, with wonderful personal attention, then Simpsons is the place to be.The location- nice restaurants, close to the Royal Botanic Garden (about15-20min, walking) which was beautiful! An extra 15\/20mins would bring you to the CBD. ut if walking isnt your thing there were buses  many taxis to hail.All in all, wonderful place  would definitely return.
