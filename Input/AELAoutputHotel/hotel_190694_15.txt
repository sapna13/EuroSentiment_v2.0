{"text":"Sheer opulence Stayed in the Hotel Adlon for three nights and it was bliss.Firstly the location is fantastic, right next door to the Brandenburg Gate. As soon as your taxi pulls up at the hotel you know you're getting service and that nothing is too much trouble. The hotel lobby is exquisite with a big water feature consisting of a tower of black elephants which survived the hotel when it was badly bombed during the war. The lobby area is also utilised as a posh tearoom with a fantastic array of fancy cakes on display and the bar area. To add to the ambiance there is a constant stream of men playing a grand piano in the balcony area. Refreshments are not cheap but well worth it just to soak up the atmosphere and they do give you plenty of nibbles as well.Once checked in, the girl behind reception actually showed us to our room. Unfortunately, despite asking for a non-smoking room we were taken to one which was obviously not. We were then shown another room which was ok. The rooms were also very opulent, (which doesn't always follow in hotels) with huge comfortable beds and a fantastic bathroom. No mod cons spared. Separate shower, bath, two sinks, dressing table. Getting ready to go out was a joy.The hotel features a couple of restaurants, one being a michelin star eatery. We decided to give this a whirl and the food was certainly different - canapes of fox!! Again the ambiance of the restaurant which was no more than a small circular room with a huge fire and spectacular views of the gate outside lit up was amazing. The food was delicious and it was obvious that both the chef and the sommelier were experts in their trade. As with everything at this hotel the cost of the meal was not for the faint hearted and todate it is probably one of the most expensive meals we have had but the memories will stay with me for ever.Breakfasts were also sumptious and no complaints there. The hotel also features a health spa which isn't really my thing but it is supposed to one of the best. All in all, this hotel has to be one of the most luxurious I have stayed in but it does come at a cost. Having said that we got a great deal for this hotel as part of a city break so it is worth looking around to see what prices are available.
