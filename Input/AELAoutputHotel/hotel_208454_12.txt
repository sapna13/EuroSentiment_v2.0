{"text":"Great for a first timer to NYC I was really surprised to find a package deal on Expedia that included a hotel ranked (by Tripadvisor) as third in New York.The good:(1) The location is absolutely superb. You capture the essence of NYC as you are jammed between 5th Ave and Broadway - Times Square is two blocks away.(2) The gym is great, with plenty of machines, free weights and towels. Another good feature of the gym is that it is open 24\/7 via the swipe access card used for your room.(3) The bed is awesome, and there is lots of warmth in the room with controllable heating \/ air conditioning. I did appreciate a window that opened as well, as sometimes the cleaning staff sprayed an awful 'air freshener' that made the room smell stale and off.(4) The front door men are very genuine and helpful - and extremely knowledgeable. Make sure you ask them for help or direction if you are unsure - and then remember that they deserve a tip at the end of your journey.(5) Power shower and big bath - always bonuses when you spend the day walking the streets.The little things:(1) The rooms are decent size and well appointed. The decor is great - although I still can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work out why we had a picture of the Eiffel Tower in our room!(2) Bath robes and extra towels are a nice touch. The so so:(1) There is not much of a view from where we were, but that was ok - you are in New York. If you want views go outside!(2) The desk service and concierge are ok. Nothing special - nothing bad - just run of the mill...I would stay here again, but only for the gym and the location. Other than that, I would look for somewhere cheaper.
