{"text":"Great Hotel - for Certain Travelers This is undoubtedly a great hotel, but there are some issues to consider before booking. We stayed for four nights just before Christmas, for a strictly tourist visit. We received extremely professional and friendly service. When the business center computer was in use, the concierge set up a laptop. The breakfast staff was especially friendly and efficient despite the many guests at this time. Quality and variety of food at breakfast was also excellent. This hotel avoided the overly huge and opulent lobby of most hotels - and put the money into nice rooms instead. The bedroom and bathroom are both large, with all modern amenities. Separate shower and bathtub was nice. We especially loved the indoor pool and spa area - for us a real plus. The light jazz music in the friendly bar was perfect after returning from a night out. Here are things to consider: I had trouble changing my online reservation, so I called and received very friendly service from the reservation clerk - and AUD$20 per day lower price than the online booking offered for the exact same room. The waterview rooms are indeed waterview, but over some industrial docks. If you're looking for the iconic view of Sydney Opera House from your room, this hotel does not have it. The walk to The Rocks tourist area is 10-15 minutes - not bad if you're only doing it once or twice, but if you want to visit there many times. . . . All in all, a great hotel, but at this price, some of these things - most related to location - may make you think twice.
