{"text":"Another Great Visit We needed to overnight in Seattle for 2 days enroute to a Mexican cruise, traveling from Alaska. We booked a 2-queen room at the Airport Best Western Executel, and as soon as we picked up our bags at baggage check, (5 large...plus a large stuffed penguin) I called and the hotel van came to whisk us to our hotel. So nice to have the friendly van driver take charge of our bags at the end of a day of traveling.Although it is not a brand new place, I like this hotel. It is clean, friendly, quiet√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√πireless access, plus the van will take you anywhere within a couple of miles. The exercise room, indoor pool, sauna and Jacuzzi are always wonderful and almost always empty. We had the whole area to ourself for an evening swim, sauna and spa tub visit. Lots of towels, and it was spotless.And now, since they have just completed a remodel, it has a attractive, restful almost Asian d√ã√\u2022√ñcor, minimalist but lovely. Plus they serve a terrific deluxe continental breakfast, with that Seattle tradition- delicious coffee. Not the Ritz, but a nice place to stay. I always check it for availability. I have several favorites in the airport area. This is probably number one. For less than $90 including all taxes. (about 11% in Seattle I think)The van driver took us to a local restaurant( his recommendation, terrific!) , and then came when we called and picked us up.When we entered the lobby, if they were not helping a guest, we were greeted by name, each time. (Even though the hotel was completely full.) We were offered a wake-up call, even though there is an alarm clock in the room. Wireless reception was good in the room, and we heard very little outside noise.The price is very reasonable, and there are many amenities usually found at a much higher end property. I highly recommend this place. However, be sure to get reservations, as it has been discovered. When we returned to Seattle 3 weeks later we needed to get a room because of flight delay, and guess what...it was full. On a Sunday afternoon.
