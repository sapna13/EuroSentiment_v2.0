{"text":"Superb business hotel I recently had the opportunity to stay at this great hotel. Opportunity I should say as some-one else offered to pay. As a self employed business man, budget is always a concern, so when the offer came in, I could not refuse.The rate of S$ 530.00 (Euro 265.00) per night is not something I lightly overlook when making accommodation decisions. I must add, this rate gave me access to a Club room overlooking Scotts Road and access to the lounge for breakfast (excellent) free all day coffee and tea and afternoon cocktails and snacks.The location of the Grand Hyatt is equally excellent within reach of all major shopping malls and convenient for business.One evening I dined at Mezzanine, possibly one of the most interesting and unusual restaurants I have been to, with a large variety of food choices and great service. It is in essence a six star food court and an absolute must should you get to stay at this hotel, or if you choose to stay at another hotel, pop in, you will not be disappointed.The guest room I stayed in had a bed room and lounge area with a large bathroom. The lounge boosts a BO tv set, a good work desk with power adaptors built in and broadband internet access. The latter is expensive and hotels in Asia still need to catch up with the USA on free internet. Not a big ask I would say, if you pay Euro 265.00 for the room, internet could be thrown in.The staff is very good, friendly and helpful. it is also good to see that expat management acknowledge you (Mezzanine manager and the Exec Chef). it makes you feel welcome, even if it is a nod, a smile and a prego.I wholeheartedly recommend this hotel and should I make enough sales, I will become a regular.
