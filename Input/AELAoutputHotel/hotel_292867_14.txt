{"text":"Loved CCP Punta Cana If you are looking for the best staff on earth CCP Punta Cana is the place to be. The staff especially the animators were friendly and extremely accomodating. The overall quality and cleaniness of the rooms were average, the mini bar was stocked with soda  water. I'm a bit picky when it comes to food so to me the food wasn't all that great but there was an abundance of food so you will not go hungry. My husband loved the food as did my 16yr old and her friend. We all at one point suffered stomach cramps\/diarhea(can't avoid this if you are from the U.S.) read Dept of State Background notes for Dominican Republic or anywhere you travel outside the US to get reccomendations on shots or preventive meds to take before going abroad. Everyone we met from the U.S. had some type of stomach ailment but it doesn't last long. Most of the tourist were friendly with the exception of the Germans\/Italians they were snobbish and they were extremely territoral but we didn't care because the area of the beach that they seemed to take over was soooo boring as with the area that they commanded in the buffet area. The theater was entertaing and the disco was lively.Overall, my experience was great., I felt safe (plenty of security) my (16yr) daughter and friend were free to roam the resort without my husband and I worrying . I highly reccommend spending the extra $$$ to upgrade to VIP, free massage, rum and cigars, motorized sports and internet access.Would I go again? yes indeed, I'm booking a group of 20 for next year ","annotations":[{"endOffset":276,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":272}]}
