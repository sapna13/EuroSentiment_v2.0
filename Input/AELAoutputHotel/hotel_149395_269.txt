{"text":"OK The hotel is very old and i think it needs some upgrading, especially the safe in the room :) The bed linnen i actually hated, because it is never ironed and the housekeeper constantly put the pillow case inside out. The covers were dirty and so were the curtains in the room (they actually smelled). I have no idea when was the last time they washed them. The room is big though, which is nice, but something was always missing, like a towel. So i had to constantly ring the house-keeping do get what i needed and what should have been in the room in the frist place. There is a coffee machine in the room though, which is great :)The beach is the best feature of the hotel, its flawless. The only thing that really annoyed us were mini cars that they used do move around the hotel. It always smelled of diesel and made so much noise, day and night, which is extremelly irritating. You couldnt take a walk along the main road to reception without your feet, literally, turning BLACK...It's strange, because you would imagine it being a quiet place but there is traffic there, literally. Everything else in Paradisus was ok, I dont think its THAT good, Like i said it needs a renovation. I have seen 4 star hotels that were much better...Maybe i am just too picky, who knows. I hope everyone else will like it and enjoy their vacation more that we did. Good luck ","annotations":[{"endOffset":589,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":583}]}
