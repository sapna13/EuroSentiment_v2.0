{"text":"Good Contemporary Design I stayed at the St. Regis for several days in mid-November based on the recommendations of some colleagues who travel to SF frequently and told me about this new hotel that opened this year. My usual place is the W, which I stay at about 2 times a month, which is just down the block. Positives: The hotel's lobby area is excellent. The design is contemporary but warm, and makes you want to congregate. I would rate the overall friendliness of the staff as generally good, though not overly exceptional for this type of hotel. The reception area did tend to get backed up and did not seem properly staffed. The hallway decor and color scheme is nicely done. I was happy with the size of my room, on the 18th floor. A control panel controls the drapes, which is something I just saw last month at the Royal Riga in NY. No problem connecting to the WiFi signal in the room. Rain showerhead in the shower is a nice touch. The lighting seems about right. The desk is generously sized and a good work space for business travelers; the desk chair is also very comfortable. Negatives: The quality of the room service food was simply horrible. I ordered the chicken caesar salad, which is something that should not be difficult to prepare. The chicken was terrible -- dry, hard and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours. I was so offended by my dinner I walked around the block to a nearby Chipotle and bought a burrito. The closet space is also very small -- and there is little shelf space for clothes. No coffee in the room, nor is any offered in the lobby. Also, although there is a nice 50 HDTV flat screen in the room, it does not get any HD channels, which was perplexing. Finally, the speakerphone on the control panel does not work well -- I usually had to pick up the handset to talk.
