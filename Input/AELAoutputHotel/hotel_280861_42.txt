{"text":"Cheap n Cheerful! Having read the reviews before I went I was anticipating the worse and hoping for slightly better. I was never expecting luxury in the first place, considering the price paid, and really just wanted somewhere to use as a base whilst exploring the sites of Barcelona by day and the bars by night! Firstly the position of the hotel is great, literally a few steps to the nearest metro, on the main bus route to sites such as the Gaudi Park etc and walking distance to Ramblas and the Port. The trade off I guess is that it's on a busy road - but that means it's good for people watching from the street cafe!Secondly the staff were friendly and helpful - both reception staff and cleaners.Thirdly, the room was clean and a good size. The view wasn't great from the balcony (just the back of another building) but I wasn't planning on sitting on it for long with so much else to do. The beds were comfy and the aircon worked well. The shower was brilliant - always plenty of hot water and powerful spray. It was cleaned daily and the towels were changed regularly. The fact that we had to cross the car park to get to it was no problem as the area is only small and well lit at night. The only problems we had, and there are always going to be a few niggles, were that where the hallways were tiled you could hear every flip flop step when your neighbours came and went from their rooms. Also the lifts were a bit temperamental - sometimes they didn't want to open the doors until you'd gone up and down a few times, but we found that if we helped the internal doors to shut properly then they were fine. All in all I'd say this was an excellent value for money hotel that is suitable if you're only looking for somewhere as a pit stop, are on a budget and aren't daft enough to expect miracles.
