{"text":"Good times Overall, we had a great time at Excellence. This was my husband's first time at an all inclusive, but my second. I don't want to say it but I am feeling like if you've been to one all-inclusive, you've been to them all.Positives: GREAT weather, awesome beach, polite people (excluding some of the guests), good entertainment (Michael Jackson, Chris Blizzard shows, to name a couple), good drinks and food (though it did NOT agree with my husband and me for some reason), nice sports bar with fun games.Negatives: Stomach cramps from the food, difficulty finding desired available seating and floating mats at pool, mosquitoes, sometimes difficulty understanding the people there who don't speak English.Advice: We brought about $100 in ones and that seemed more than enough, gave a dollar here and there for tips. Bring bug spray. If you want a covered seated area in the pool reserve one with your towel or article of clothing by mid-morning. Don't be rude though and just grab one for the novelty of having one (same with floating mats) and then be gone all day. Only one morning we 'reserved' a covered bed. We were gone a few minutes and someone had the nerve to move our stuff and claim the bed as their own. There were empty beds a couple down so we took one of those instead but not before removing the person's stuff who stole our original bed and then someone else came along and took it- isn't karma somethin'? lol! The beach area, especially to the left when facing the ocean, has LOTS of covered areas to sit.
