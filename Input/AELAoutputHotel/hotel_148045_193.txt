{"text":"Dated and Faded - NOT a 5 Star! I am sure at some point this place was a beauty, but is was very dated and tired. I came with my husband and two step-kids - 12 and 13 -so not looking for super luxury. The prices were heavily discounted for this time of year - $159\/night for a garden room (we took two rooms ) - but at full price, this place would be a disappointing. Full disclosure-when I travel only with my husband in the Caribbean, we tend to stay in what I consider lovely places-Jamaica Inn and Biras Creek are two of the last places - so I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expecting their level of comfort and service. But an $18 pizza (see below)? We were in the unrenovated section and had a Garden Room with great views of the golf course and countryside from the 2nd floor. The room was very large but the bathroom, although huge, was dated as was the decor.There is a private island for sole use by the guests. The island was a cool concept with a ferry getting you there in less than ten minutes, but the place is CRAMMED with chairs, cans of drinks laying by chairs by day's end (perhaps brought in by people who were not suppose to bring their own food?!?!) and a restaurant with marginal, overpriced food. The main issues - Overall Decor-Paint peeling everywhere, chairs by the pool are old with caked on dirt and need to be replaced - the whole place looks like it is hanging on by a thread. They are doing many renovations so hopefully in a year or two, they will be back up to speed. Restaurants-OUTRAGEOUSLY overpriced with very average food. The one exception was The Strip House which was expensive but very good food, presentation and service with a decent wine list.Internet Access -The internet service was down the whole time we were there (we needed to get on for work). We left our laptops at home since we were told we could access the internet for a fee. For a hotel this large not to have internet access in this day and age is nuts. They let us use the computers in their back offices but this was very inconvenient.Check In-They have a check -in time of 4pm and they were still an hour late - so 5pm check-in and the hotel was empty (according to the guy checking us in!).Kids just need a pool and a beach so they had fun but I would not recommend this place for a couple - too many kids and no intimacy.I wish I had better things to write but I wanted to give an honest opinion. The Management, who tried to help us with the internet issue, were very nice but seemed overwhelmed.
