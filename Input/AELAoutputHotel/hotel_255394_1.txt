{"text":"Very pleasant stay I recently returned from my Sydney trip and want to write my review while the experience is still fresh in my mind.After more than 20 hours of flights, I arrived in Sydney in the early morning jet-lagged and tired. After inquiring, I was directed to a bus outside that took us to the Central CityRail station free of charge. From there, I took the CityRail to the Kings Cross station. It turns out the Holiday Inn is less than a 30-seconds walk after getting out of the station. Really could not be closer or more convenient.It was 1030 in the morning and I was expecting to just drop off my luggage and returning later to check-in. Kimberly, working the front desk, immediately checked and told me that my room was ready for me. What a surprise and without prompting on my part. Also without any prompting from me, she asked if I would like a late check-out as late as 2 PM. Wow! Then I was asked for my newspaper preference in the morning. Maybe from a 5-star property but I didn't expect this from a Holiday Inn.So I checked in to my room at 1030 AM. Even though my room was only on the 2nd floor, I had a nice view of the Harbor Bridge and the Opera House. I imagine the view from the upper floors would be even better. Definitely get a room with the harbor view rather than the street view. Later that night I heard noises and looked out the window to see a fireworks show near the Harbor Bridge. Another nice bonus surprise.The room itself was spacious and clean with modern furnishings. If I want to nit-pick, the carpet had some stains. O\/W I was pleased with everything else.I went downstairs to look for the business center and could not find it. Went looking down the wrong hallway and asked a cleaning lady who then walked me all the way to the computer terminals, she didn't just give me directions or point to its location. How's that for service. It costs A$5 for 15 minutes (or 30 minutes, I can't remember now).There was a small gym in the hotel but ask for the free pass to FitnessFirst that is located kind of kitty corner from the hotel. It's part of a chain of fitness clubs in Australia and has a nice variety of equipment. It's less than a minute walk from the hotel if not for the slow signal at the intersection.There was a restaurant in the hotel which I did not try but it looked nice. There were plenty of eating places nearby and with the CityRail station essentially right underneath the hotel, you could get all over the city easily.The hotel is close to the club area of Darlinghurst but I felt very safe. It's a bit more crowded and rowdy at night. Families with young children would likely avoid that area anyways. The immediate area surrounding the hotel and the short walk from the hotel to the CityRail station is perfectly safe for families.Every one of my multiple interactions with hotel staff resulted in prompt, friendly, courteous service.Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend.
