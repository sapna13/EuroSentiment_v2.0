{"text":"Resort was very nice but make sure you bring your own FACE CLOTHs! We ( all 22 of us) stayed here between april19-26Upon arriving we were suppose to be at the beach but got put in the club which was great cause the rooms at the beach are dark  dingy  the rooms at the club were nice ,clean  very bright.. we wanted rooms pool side but got put on the woods side on the bottom floor which i didn't feel safe at all..some of our patios doors didn't lock..The food terrible...i lived off pizza which was very good  their pasta  their breakfasts were really good to.The stuff in the mini fridge is very expensive..your only allowed 3 pop a day  one big bottle of water  if that water is not gone they do not give you a new one..NO FACE CLOTHS!!! you got to bring your own..only limited to 2 towels a day so we had to steal them off the maids cart.The bartenders are very nice..the last couple days into our trip they closed down our pool bar at 5:00 so the bartenders from there could go to this new bar they opened up..its like a big ship.. which drinks are not FREE..imported liquer at  $7.00 a drink..IMAGINE when i can go to the pool bar 2 mins down the way  get freee drinks..we had no hot water in the afternoon some of my friends had no power in the afternoon..BEWARE .. maids will let you in your room with out checking to see if you are the one really staying in there..if you lose your key..example- my friend was drunk  he got the maid to let him in his room but it wasn't his room  there was a couple in bed..they were very surprised...so make sure your doors are locked!!The disco is very good but watch out for the locals!!The Bavaro beach is fantastic!!I wouldn't go back this to this resort .. there must be something better!!
