{"text":"Exceeded my expectations LOCATION: The hotel is located quite centrally on Pitt St, about a seven minute walk to Pitt St mall and a two minute walk to Circular Quay (near the Opera House and The Rocks). The closest train station would be Circular Quay and the next one after that would be Wynyard. THE ROOM: We stayed in a standard room with city views and a king size bed. The d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was surprisingly nice and quite stately. The bed was extremely comfortable and there are some nice black and white framed photographs of the harbour bridge. There is in-room broadband internet access at $9.95\/hour or $19.95\/24 consecutive hours. There is also an in-room safe and tea and coffee making facilities. The TV wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ flat screen although there was a wide selection of cable channels available. There is also an iron and ironing board in the wardrobe. The bathroom was also very clean and included a hair dryer. It was well-stocked with products from the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬¢romatherapy√à√\u2020\u2022?brand and there was shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and moisturiser (all with lemongrass) as well as facial soap and body soap. It was impressive that the Marriott is environmentally conscious, like other hotels, and allows guests to select whether they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° like to have their linen and towels changed daily by indicating so with a card placed on the bed, etc. SERVICE: Check-in was very fast and the front desk staff were friendly. I found that the concierge on the particular night that we stayed didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem to keen to help, however. The Marriott has an √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬¢t Your Service√à√\u2020\u2022?button on the phone so you no longer have to AMENITIES: There is a relatively large gym with free weights, weighted equipment, treadmills, bikes, rowing machines, etc. but the equipment is rather outdated and the gym provides a water fountain but not bottled water for free. There is also a pool and a spa as well as a sauna. I believe there is a business centre but we never used it. IN-ROOM DINING: The $35\/head breakfast price is outrageous so we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ actually eat breakfast here. We did, however, have in-room dining. The hotel has a policy that the room service is free if it takes more than 45 minutes to deliver. We ordered room service and were told that it would be about 30 minutes. It arrived after 17 minutes, which is quite impressive. The quality of the food was very good, albeit expensive.
