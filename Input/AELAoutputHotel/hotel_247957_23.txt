{"text":"Just a perfect vacation, loved it...:) We stayed at the Occidental Grand Punta Cana from July 3 until July 17, and just loved it. We didn't experience any of the bad things from some of the other rewiews. Me, my husband and our two children,age 4 and 6 arrived around 6 PM after a long flight from Norway. The check-in was done 5 minutes after arrival...should mention that we took a taxi from airport instead of buss, so we were the only people arriving at that time. We got our room in building 11. The room was old and not so nice, but it was clean, and that was most important. We didn't come here to stay in our room anyway.The resort is just beautiful, well-kept and very clean grounds. The pool-areas are very nice, the pool is clean.The beach is just stunning, and we spent most of the days here...After two days I just went to the desk and asked for an upgrade of our room, we knew there were nicer rooms at the hotel than the one we had. No problems at all...we got a new room right away, in building 26, closest to the beach. And this room was like coming to a new hotel. It was so nice...The food at this resort is good. We loved the breakfast-buffet and the beach-buffet. The only negative was that it was really hard to get seats in the A la-carts.. We tried the steak-house, it was ok, nothing more... But the Mexican was very,very good...the food and service was just outstanding...The pizza and taco places upstairs are also safe choices...All the staff at the resort was very nice and friendly with us,and they just loved our kids. We didn't leave the resort much, just a trip to the Manati Park...what a waste of time...don't spend money going there...really boring park.We really loved our stay at this resort, the weather was perfect all days.We will most likely return to this resort again soon...:) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1407,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1402},{"endOffset":1407,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1402}]}
