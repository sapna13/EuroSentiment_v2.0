{"text":"I have never been to a place where i felt so welcome and invited I have never been to a place where i felt so welcome and invited, the staff treated us with respect and kindness.This was my first trip ever. When we arrived to the resort, my mouth droped it was beautyful. The bus ride getting the was short and comfterable. I had dectied on this place after readind review after review. And i shure made the right decision. Ill start with the food. NO and i mean NO reservations needed for the a la cart resturants this is a total plus.I foun the food to be a little greasey at times but for the most part good 4 a la carts 2 buffates, no need to rush to get something to eat there is always a table somewear. there were 5 bars and the wait to get a drink well there was no wait. The thing that impressed me the most is the fact that the entire resort except the wasrooms and showers HAS PUIRAFIED WATER, so dont be afred to get that extre ice cube or glass of water with your dinner I was'nt.I think we had one of the LARGEST SAND BEACH OF ALL THE HOTELS, and this was somthing out of a post card. night life a little quiet thins seamed to shut down after midnight, but if you wanted to keep going all you had to do was step on to a shuttle and go to the casino or disco and thies were open till 5 am. The disco was loud but I liked the music it had a bit of dance mixed with cariben sound.The rooms looked just liked the broshure bee nice to your maid we got 6 pellows and extre water and pop. when you get to your room you will get 4 bottles of booze i mean a 40 0z 2 26 0z and a mickey plus 3 stogies.pretty cool. I am 30 rys old and I had the best time I think I could have I did not party much ,but took in a lot of RR. You still have 24 hr drinks yes rum and beer as well as fried chicken, hotdogs and hamburgers so if you want somthing to eat at 5 am go ahed. daly actives were good tenis, archery, vollyball, darts,pool volyball. lots to do. This was not the cheapest for me but It was one of the best moment of my life I WILL GO BACK WITH OUT A DOUT.I hope this gives you a little more in fo and thank for reading ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1795,"mention":"fried chicken","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fried_chicken"],"startOffset":1782},{"endOffset":1819,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1809},{"endOffset":1819,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1809}]}
