{"text":"Great Hotel Experience Stayed at the Silver Cloud in Lake Union from Sunday June 24th to Wed. June 27th. We arrived at approximately 2:30 pm. We had reserved a lake view room and were given one on 4th floor, however the view was not good...had a great view of a tree! There were no other rooms with a better view to move to at that time, but the desk clerk asked if we could wait a few minutes until housekeeping was finished cleaning and they could give us a room with better view. Sure enough about 10 minutes later we were given another room with a really good view of the lake. The clerk was very pleasant, answered all our questions about the hotel, shuttle service, etc. We used the shuttle service each day. It left about every 20 minutes. They took us where we wanted to go in the city and we just called to be picked up when ready to return to the hotel. The room was over sized, very clean, comfortable beds, really good lighting and liked the vanity outside the bathroom. Free WIFI in the room plus free business center for printing our boarding passes for return flight. Complementary coffee and a variety of tea available at all times. Nice complementary continental breakfast, with very comfortable seating area with view of lake. Cons: Minimal...no 'true' balcony and railing outside the window did not feel secure. Parking spaces were narrow...but, there were plenty of spaces available so was easy to get slot with no one in adjacent space. It was difficult to find the hotel. There is no sign showing when approaching from the interstate side. Only after passing and realizing we had gone too far, we made a u turn and the sign was very visible coming from that direction. These really are minor complaints. All in all, I highly recommend this hotel. I will defintely stay here again if return to Seattle.
