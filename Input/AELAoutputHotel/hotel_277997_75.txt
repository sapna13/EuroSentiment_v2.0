{"text":"Great views of Phoenix My husband and I stayed at this Hilton 5\/31-6\/5\/2007. The hotel is located about 20 minutes from the airport and we found it convenient to everything. Upon driving up, a very friendly bellman met us and showed us where to check in. We were given a room in the mountainside suites. The hotel property is laid out up a cliff, so very spread out. I would not agree with the person who said to park first, then check in. Unless you are in the main building, you will need to drive to your room as many are on the cliff. Our room was in building 21 on the fourth floor. It was conveniently located near the work out center and another small pool. We liked the area as it was quiet with great views of Phoenix. The suite was fine with a nice balcony. There is some deferred maintenance in the room and around the property. Nothing drastic or anything that bothered us. We are Hilton Honors Gold members and got breakfast coupons toward the buffet. The coupon covers a continental buffet of yogurt, assorted pastries  fruit. For another $4 you can add omelets, bacon, frech toast, etc. It was a great breakfast buffet! (the bacon was fabulous!!) The pools were nice with cool water and a whirlpool with warm (not hot) water. We thought both were kept at a nice temperature. The concierge recommended a fabulous Mexican restaurant nearby called Via delosSantos. We ate there 3 of our 4 nights in Phoenix. It was delicious! Try the calabacita fajitas. YUMMY!! We would recommend this nice 4 star hotel.
