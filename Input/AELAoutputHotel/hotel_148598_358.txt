{"text":"Westin Rio Grande not up to par with other Westins Just came back from a 3 day stay at the Westin. Check-in was good, we got upgraded to an ocean suite, but the room was ok. The bathrooms not up to typical Westin standards, very old, not very modern, and they didn't even have the double showerhead. The next morning, we were woken up at 6:00 AM by construction on the roof which was directly above us. We called front desk several times, and no one could explain what happened. Finally later in the afternoon, I called the manager who found out they had construction right above us. We were satisfied after he comped the night, but I still don't understand why they would give us a room underneath construction when there was so much availability in the hotel or why they would start constriction so early, people are on vacation and the last thing they want to do is wake up at 6 AM.The Food was drab, service at Marbella worse. It took me 25 minutes each day to get coffee by the wait staff. One day a gentleman next to me offered his pot after i asked the waitress 5 times for coffee to no avail (she finally brought it over right when they closed for breakfast). The Italian restaurant however, was fairly good with top notch service. The hotel grounds are somewhat old and tired. The pool area is somewhat nice, but i noticed a lot of mold on the cushions. Also, although one pool is the adult pool, there were tons of small children running around, jumping in, and causing a lot of noise, this was definitely not enforced. The beach is ok, the ocean very rough and the sand is a dark yellow (not the soft sand found in the Caribbean or on other parts of the island)The location is not that great either. yes it is across the rain forest, but There really i nothing else in the area, and you are pretty much forced to stay at the resort if u don't have a car (fyi, if u have a car other than the one u can rent from the hotel, they charge u $18\/day). We were pretty bored in the evenings, even thought we did go to the restaurants and casino (seemed very empty)As a side not, i am still having problems with the hotel bill. I was charged a different amount that the one i got at check out. i think i have gotten double charged for breakfast but we are still trying to figure it out.
