{"text":"IB Punta Cana is GREAT! First let me start by stating that we have traveled to the Caribbean numerous times and always stayed AI resort. IB Punta Cana is a great resort with few issues. Our room was in the 600 building. Very clean, no smell, nice balcony, great A\/C and ceiling fan. Some people indicated problem with ants in their room but we never saw any in our room. Bathroom was large (Hand held shower would not stay in place which was a little problamatic but not a big issue.) Mini fridge was stocked daily with beer, pop and water. Housekeeper also left a gallon of purified water for brushing teeth. DO NOT DRINK THE TAP WATER! Our maid would place fresh flowers in the bathroom everyday and would make funny little creatures out of towels. Nice touch. Word to the wise - don't count on fresh wash cloths each day. Seem to be in short supply. Towels were changed twice a day. The grounds are nothing short fantastic. Very well groomed. The lawns almost look like a golf course. Had to arise early each a.m. to reserve a place near the pool under a cabina. We were told that this is a no no, but everyone was do it so we followed suit. The beach is really great and so was the water. Did walk down to the vendors a couple of times and found a few great bargins. The hotel shops are very expensive since the owners must pay a high rent each month, so they pass it on to the customers. Food at the buffet was not the best (we have had better) but one will not go hungry. The breakfast was the best wtih eggs to order, ample pastries, fresh fruit and juice and coffee to kill for. We ate at the Frecnh, Steak House and Oriental. All were extremly good. The Steak House is outside on the beach. So your table and chairs are in the sand. This was a different but pleasant experience. Some what romantic. During the lunch hour, the Steak House becomes a snack bar with buffet salads. Hot food consited of fish, chicken, hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, numerous salads and desserts. We spent a lot of time in the P.M. at the Lobby Bar and had a wonderful time. Drinks were very good. We also took insulated mugs for day time use at the pool\/beach. The evening entertainment was rather lame and at times hard to understand due to language barrier. Since we are smokers we ate in the smoking sections and had great service from the waiters each day. Actually, we were treated like kings and queens. The staff at the resort are all very friendly and helpful. Will we visit this resort again? Yes - Hopefully in May 2008 if the price is right. We flew out of Chicago on US Air 2000. Note: Two checked bags per person not to exceed 50 pounds total. Arrival and transfer to the resort went very smooth and did our departure. There is a Wendy's at the airport. At the bar we paid $12.00 US for two bottles or Corona beer. Too costly! If you like to snack I would suggest taking some snacks with you since they are very expensive in the gift shops. Not one peson in our group got sick from the food which was great. Looking forward to returning in May of 2008..
