{"text":"Highly Recommended! Excellent Service  We found a $198 winter deal for Hotel 41 At Time Square on the web and decided to spend our first night in Manhattan in this hotel. The price was considered a bargain for Manhattan during the December holiday period. We arrived in the evening in the middle of heavy snowy weather. The doorman was extremely good in helping us unloading our luggage and taking us to our room. Going in the hotel resembles entering a night club than a hotel, with retro dance music resonating from the restaurant on the ground floor. However, unlike a typical club, the front desk staff member was extremely friendly. The lady warmly welcomed us to the hotel like we were part of the family. There were free magazines at the front desk (including TimeOut √à√\u2020\u2022?a must for any NYC stay), newspaper provided, plus complimentary water for the stay, and free DVD hire if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel like venturing outside for a movie. Breakfast is also included, with a good quality selection of pastries, bagels, and breakfast drinks.We stayed in the standard double suite. The room, as expected for a boutique Manhattan hotel, was a lot smaller than the typical standard hotel room. However, with the high ceiling and excellent interior design, we did not feel claustrophobic. The room was also very clean and fresh, and the bathroom appears to have relatively new amenities, with glass shower panels and modern mixers in both the shower and the hand basin. The hotel also provide guest with an array of Aveda bath products for you to use, too! It is like a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áudget√à√\u2020\u2022?hotel with luxury.The staffs were very attentive. We were about to walk outside for dinner and realise it was snowing heavily. The lady at the front desk quickly pullout two hotel umbrellas for us! They were also very helpful when we were enquiring about nearby restaurants and how to go to point A to point B through the subwayIt is an excellent place to stay if you seek convenience and excellent staff service. It is situated in Time Square in midtown, so it is close to everything, including food, cinema, theatre, and night life. Each √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√álock√à√\u2020\u2022?in Manhattan is not too far from each other, so if you are like us who prefer to walk, the hotel is less than 10 blocks from Herald Square where Macy√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and the Empire State Building stand. Shopping heavens 5th Avenue and Madison Avenue (go to 5th Ave and walk towards the 50s streets for all the luxury goods) is also 10 blocks or so away. Otherwise, the subway station is 2 minutes walk away. Ask the knowledgeable front desk staffs if you any questions.Do book well in advance √à√\u2020\u2022?we were keen to stay there again but it was booked out for the rest of the month!
