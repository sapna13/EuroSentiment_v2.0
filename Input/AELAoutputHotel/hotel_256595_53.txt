{"text":"Great Location! I was very excited to visit Sydney for my 10 year anniversary. I worked long and hard to review hotels online. After careful review, we choose Swissotel. The hotel was okay. The location was great! Very central and close to almost everything. You are very close to Darling Harbour and about 15 min walk to Circular Quay and China Town. We stayed on the executive level but the room wasn't that big. However, the bathroom were nice and spacious. Great tub and seperate shower. Turn down service every night. Breakfast was included in my room rate and the food was pretty good. I was glad I upgraded to include breakfast. Another great thing about this hotel was that it was a block away from the Sydney Tower which is where I had reservations for my anniversary dinner. I didn't plan that, it just worked out. The beds are firm, but I hear most hotel beds are. Although we were on the 22nd floor, you could hear construction noise. Unfortunately, they started work at 6am. Remember that you are in the city so it's not going to be uber quiet. Friendly staff and conceiarge was very helpful guiding us. Gym equipment was adequate. There was about 3 treadmills, some bikes and eleptical machines. It had weights and benches too. Overall, I would recommend this hotel but if I returned to Sydney, I'd want to try a different one.Also, you have to take two lifts. The one from the street with take you to level 8 which is their lobby. Not much of a lobby though as their bar is right there so there were no chairs to really sit on. Then you take another lift to the rooms. It was annoying but it was alright. Enjoy your stay! ","annotations":[]}
