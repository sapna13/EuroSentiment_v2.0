{"text":"The Excellence was excellent! We just returned from the Excellence - we stayed March21-28.I was a bit nervous after reading some reviews before leaving. However, after our stay I am actually surprised at some of the poor reviews.The ride to the hotel is no different than any other island ride I have ever been on fast and bumpy - that is how they drive. It took about an hour. The room and the grounds were spotless. The beach was perfect. There were plenty of chairs to go around at the pool and the beach.The drinks were fine. The beach and pool side service was great. The workers were all helpful, not all speak English but they try to help you. Tips are not expected but are greatly appreciated. There are no tip jars or envelopes.Keep in mind you are not in America. Their version of American food or any other food may be a bit different. It is their culture to be dressed for meals so don't expect to go to a restaurant in your bathing suit and tank top guys - girls need a coverup. Long pants for dinner for the guys. The girls usually dress sundresses\/skirts\/capris.I saw a few mosquitos - literally 3 half dead mosquitos so I had no problem.The resort is on the atlantic side of the ocean, so it is rough and red flagged daily - walk to the right of the beach and you will be able to swim in the ocean - it was great.To the left of the resort there are vendors selling their goods. It is quite an experience - to be fair we looked at everyones shop, bought what we wanted - bargained for the best prices too. Be sure to go to Nancy's shop in the back. Did I mention the pool? It goes forever, you can just float around all day and it is spotless.The entertainment was fine.The bed is a bit hard - that would be the only downfall.No kids! Yipee (I have 3 myself) so the break was greatWe had a great time and will return - hopefully next year. ","annotations":[]}
