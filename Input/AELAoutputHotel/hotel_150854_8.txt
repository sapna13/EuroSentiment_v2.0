{"text":"One Of The Best This was our 9th trip to D.R. over the past 5 years.THE RESORT was the smallest we have visited and found it to be one of the best. What made is great was the employees. After a few days they all became friends and sadisfied our every need. When my wife and I went to the beach Roberto would get of chair pads and set up our loungers for the day.THE BUFFET hit the spot. We never ate at any resturants. The buffet had theme night every night and the selections were always fresh and plentiful. At first we were not sure the assigned seating and seating time was a good idea, but, after two days the staff would greet us, pull our the chairs and get our wine.THE BEACH Whats to say. The beach is the greatest. I live at the beach in Delaware and the Punta cana water is clear, warm and relaxing. You can walk for miles. The beach bar was central too. THE POOL, My wife and I would vist the pool in the afternoon to watch and get involved in the activities.Dont miss the managers party .ROOM SERVICE only used it for morning coffee. Coffee would be delivered within 10 minutes.AGAIN this resort was one of the best my wife and I have visted. We only met one couple from the USA, and all the guest were friendly and seemed to be enjoying their vavation.This is one resort I will return too.
