{"text":"Clean, Fun and Different\/Not all Family Reunions Are Bad When I got to the hotel it was so nice because it's decorated with alot of greek looking statues. My favorite was in the lobby because there are some giant chairs like for a king to sit. My family and I took turns taking pictures sitting on the chairs. I will say that that the place was crowded. I know that my family reunion was there along with some other reunions that were staying there. The staff at the front desk were nice, I felt bad for on of the ladies there though because another guest s was yelling at her, but it was nice to see that she finished with the other guest and was still able to smile and be nice to me. Another thing that bothered me was the way some of the people from the other family reunions were acting because since there were so many different families there, it made us all look bad. I mean there were people complaining about the hotel when they were the ones causing the problem. I like the hotel, we play mini golf and basketball. My kids and I even got in the pool before we left. I am planning on going back and staying there when we go down for Christmas break. I really like the hotel and my kids loves it. If you plan on visiting and have kids, pack up some energy cause you will need it between the mini golf, the basketball court, the pool and the game-room. ","annotations":[]}
