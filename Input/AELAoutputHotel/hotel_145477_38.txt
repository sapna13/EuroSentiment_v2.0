{"text":"Not that bad... A group of us (eight total) returned from Miami last night where we stayed at the San Juan Hotel on A1A. We weren't expecting much after having read all of the horrible reviews about blood and bugs all over the place. In fact, I brought my own sheets and pillowcases and never even used their beddings! My friends, on the other hand did. We had a total of three rooms and had no problems with any of them!Let me get the cons out of the way first: The rooms were not elegant at all. The carpet in the hallway was filthy and there were a few stains on the carpet in just one of the rooms. The rooms are pretty small and contain 19 TV's that have only about 12 channels. The bathrooms are dated and the sink is very small. The water pressure in my shower was so great that it almost took the skin off of you, while my buddie's water pressure was not much more than a drip. Those are all pretty feeble complaints but I thought I'd throw them in. Here are the pros: The bedding was clean and I DIDN'T SEE A SINGLE BUG IN THE FOUR DAYS I WAS THERE. There are decent sized refridgerators in each room that work great. The A\/C was cold and there were even ranges in the room to cook on (we didn't use them). The front desk staff were always curteous and more than helpful. Javier, the night clerk, arranged to have a few of my friends picked up in a limo for free (obviously he gets a kick back from the expensive restaurant that the limo takes you to). The only way the location could be better is if you paid an extra $200 a night to stay ON the beach across the street. It took about two minutes to walk to the beach and we were surrounded by excellent clubs, places to eat, and shops. If you are a younger couple or a group of friends looking to explore South Beach and aren't too concerned with the amenities of a hotel, there is not a better option in all of Miami. I'll probably try to get something a little swankier when I go back with my wife, but my friends and I all agreed that if we do another trip to South Beach with just the guys, we're going to stay at the San Juan again.
