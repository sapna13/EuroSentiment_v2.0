{"text":"Does what is says on the tin We needed a room for the night, in transit from Auckland to London, for the 2 of us and our 18month daughter.We wanted somewhere central  not too expensive.The reviews here were helpful and I emailed their info@ address, but as I didn't get a reply, I emailed Wes directly.He could not have been more helpful  gave us what seemed like a good deal on a 2 room suite.The hotel is just off Union Square, as are a number of more poncey hotels  there are loads of shops, restaurants  diners very close by. As with every US city I've been to, there were a few mildly deranged beggars and god botherers on the street corners, but the immediate locale and Union Square itself felt safe.The lobby is small and pleasant, with a couple of sofas and a free PC terminal for web access in the corner.The luggage gadgee and check-in staff were helpful, as we were too early for our room to be ready.The suite was small, but perfect for our needs - it was on the 14th floor at the back, so relatively quiet. The bedroom had a queen bed, a chair  TV unit. The lounge had a sofa, chair, desk and couple of tables, along with a large TV and a fax machine (!). There were also two bathrooms, one for each room (so the lounge can be used as an extra bedroom with a put-up bed, or cot \/ crib)There is free wireless access, which was fast and useful.All in all, it's a good solid 3* hotel in a central location and is good value, particularly if Wes gives you a deal.
