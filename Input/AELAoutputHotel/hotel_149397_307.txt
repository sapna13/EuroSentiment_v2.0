{"text":"8 out of 10 Rooms:The rooms were beautiful. They had tons of room and were cleaned daily. This place was unique because the resort was not set up like a hotel... you felt as if you were in your own condo. It was also great that your fridge was stocked daily!Staff:The staff was great. They were all VERY friendly, from the grounds keepers to the managment. My wife and I decided to tip as much as possible, even though it is all-inclusive. These people work for very little money and a buck brings a huge smile to their face. We even tiped the grounds people. Food:When people say the food is different... they are right! The morning buffet never changes, which sucks. I pretty much ate pancakes and bacon every day... but I worked with it. I recommend taking a trip outside of the resort to the other Princess hotels to eat there. It's different and much better. It does take time to get your food, but this is because they are short staffed. Just be patient... you're on vacation. Also, be sure to make reservations for dinner two nights before you want to do. If you don't foget it... you'll once again be eating at the buffet.Beach:BEAUTIFUL! They sweep it daily. Be sure to get up early to reserve your beach hut because they go fast. If you do reserve it, please stay with your beach hut. I found it very rude how people would reserve the hut, leave, and not come back for several hours. It clearly states if it is not in use for over 30 min. it is up for grabs. Remember... be respectful! Oh... bring plenty of sun tan lotion. I recommend to start with 50 spf for the first couple days. Relax, be patient, have fun, be merry, and enjoy yourself. Remember... you are on vacation.
