{"text":"Wonderful honeymoon experience My wife and I stayed here for our honeymoon, and the stay definitely contributed to our fond memories of our week in Paris. As HHonors silver members, we just stayed in a regular room with king bed on the 5th floor, but the accomodations were surprisingly large by European standards and everything was very clean. We requested an interior room overlooking the courtyard, and it was very quiet. The bed was a little hard by our standards, but we were so tired from sightseeing that we fell right asleep. We really enjoyed the location of the hotel, as it was close to a Metro stop (Courcelles), several restaurants, and a nice park (Parc Monceau). If you head down a block, you can see the Arc de Triomphe down at the end of the street, but it's mostly foreign embassies and other housing around the hotel, which kept things quiet. The bathroom was a bit on the small side, but the stand-up shower was awesome (excellent temperature and pressure).The staff made us felt welcome from the moment they opened the door for us, with excellent English spoken, and the concierge that we worked with a lot, Gregory, was extremely accomodating and was even able to mail a package to a relative for me. Upon arrival a beautiful rose bouquet was delivered to our room with a note from the customer relations woman, and later in the day a half-bottle of champagne and strawberries with creme fraiche and pistachios were also sent up.The room service menu is great, and the prices reflect it too. On our last night we ordered the beef tenderloin and had a gourmet meal in our fluffy bathrobes finished off with some delicious creme brulee. We also ate at the hotel restaurant, Le Safran, and the staff was very courteous and even put up with my attempts to order with whatever French I remembered from college. The breakfast items aren't great considering the price, and each morning when we headed to the Metro stop we stopped by a little boulangerie (Mi-do-re) close by and picked up fresh croissants and eclairs to get the day started.Though it was definitely expensive, the hotel was a nice place to come back to at the end of a long day. It made a special time even more memorable staying here and we'll definitely return in the near future.
