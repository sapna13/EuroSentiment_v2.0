{"text":"Have been to better This is going to be the worst review that I have ever written about Punta Cana as it was my 6th time down. We are the type of people who make a party where ever we go. We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from January 29th - Feb 05. Check is was a nightmare. Knowing ahead that we would have a 4 hour wait for our rooms (12 of us went - wedding anniversary) we had a nice lunch and walk. We went back at 3 and waited over 2 more hours for our room listening to other people say that they were even shipped off to other hotels the previous day because they were over booked. I had contacted the hotel before hand explaing that one person in our party did not walk to well and needed to be as close to the beach as possible. He was in the furthest building and it was like pulling teeth to get him moved. We were moved to block 5 with ocean view but the shower knob was broken, the safe did not work, but we did not care. In comparison to the other beaches surrounding this resort, yes, it is very nice. BUT, I have seen nicer in PC. There is NO snorkelling right off the beach off the resort. Reading previous reviews I was hoping this was wrong as we like to snorkel every morning after breakfast and were not able to do. It is ALL stired up sand, no matter how calm the wind. We did have beautiful weather every day, only 20 minutes of rain the night of the Superbowl.The staff are unlike anything I have seen down there. The animation staff were great!!! Bring them candy and you will be their best friend. Most of the bar and resturant staff had no personality and we are used to becoming best friends with everyone down there. We are the type of people that drink with the bartender, get him drunk and take over his job while he tries not to fall off the bar stool laughing his head off. There are SO many rules here for the staff they cant have fun.The resturants are all good. We usually dont do the a la cartes but for some reason we did them all here and preferred them over the buffet. SHOPPING: Here is the best tip I can give you with 6 years of shopping there. If you go to the beach and turn left you will walk about 10 minutes and come accross a BUNCH of shops, all who run onto the beach to bug you non stop. BUT . . . . . . . .SHOPPING  IMPORTANT: IF, you go to the beach and turn RIGHT, walk just past block 6, (through the volleyball court) literally, and you will see 1 shop there only. They have everything you could want, the prices are WAY better and they are really nice. If you see a lady there in her late 40's, she owns the shop. Please tell her - the girl who bought the small GUITAR and gave her pizza sent you. She is so nice and one of the nicest shops I have ever been to. She does not speak the best english but she usually has someone there who does. Everyone in our party shopped there and I know more people would if they knew about it. Everyone just thinks they get the better deals if there are more shops to chose from but that is not the case. The pool bar is rowdy but fun, usually someone dancing on the bar.Could not really find a place to hang out at night to party like we usally do. Not a lot of english speaking people vacationing there.Cigeratte smoke EVERYWHERE. (except the a la carts) Even the non smoking in the buffett stank. I am not a person to lay on the beach for more than 30 minutes a day but could not find a place where it did not stink of smoke.Play the all games on the beach that they do twice a day, if you win you go on the stage for a bottle of rum. The games are fun, especially the cooking one. Even if you dont feel like it you will be happy once you played.The bike tour is fun, very short but interesting.I am sorry if I have discouraged you. Things that bothered me may not bother you but I am not usually bothered.
