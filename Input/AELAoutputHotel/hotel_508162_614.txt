{"text":"AMAZING WEDDING AND PHOTOGRAPHER We stayed at Sunscape the Beach before the official change to Dreams from Dec 1 - Dec 8. We were married there and brought 50 guests along with us. Check in went well for everyone in our group besides our own. Our honeymoon suite was not ready and did not have an ocean view due to the unknown construction of the buildings closest to the ocean. We were eventually relocated to a honeymoon suite in Building 9 which was closest to the lobby and had a distant ocean view. Building 9 was also closes to the wedding gazebo which actually worked out well the day of the wedding. FOOD - was good favorite restaurant was Mexican and the lunch buffet at the oceana is very good. POOL - was wonderful plenty of floats to go around. The beach was nice but the week we were there it was a bit too wavy, to the left side of the beach it is much calmer and not rocky.BEST BAR - was next to the Wedding Gazebo we were there nightly especially to see the BEST BARTENDER EVER - JOSE LUIS, Jose was very friendly and welcoming, we requested him to bartend at our wedding and he was great!CONSTRUCTION - was fully underway during our stay. On the walkways throughout the resort tile was being laid in a very haphazardous way, which made it difficult to walk through the length of the resort especially at night when not well lit. They could have gone about this construction in a much better way for it made walking dangerous. We were assured that the construction would in no way be noticeable throughout our trip..that was a bit of an understatement. THE WEDDING - went flawlessly we had a perfect day. Our wedding coordinator Juliana did a great job making sure everything was the way we wanted it. We had the wedding at the Gazebo and the reception on the terrace in the lobby beyond the Himitsu Restaurant (this was our second choice Dreams terrace was of course under construction). The terrace was decorated beautifully. The food was excellent. The DJ was awfull he refused to play the music we had brought and requested and continued to go with his own selection after multiple complaints.PHOTOGRAPHER - the day befor our wedding we were notified that the resort relaced their existing photo company, PHOTO SOUVENIR with another company. We had heard great things about PHOTO SOUVENIR and had requested Fran as our photographer. Juliana was able to still get Fran to come and do our wedding photos, THANK GOD because he is an excellent photographer he knows the Dreams property inside and out because he has been doing weddings there for years. He was actually acting as wedding coordinator half the time because he knows the process here so well. We couldn't have gotten through the day without him. I highly recommend using him as your photographer and not the photographer affiliated with this resort as they are new and do not know the best pic spots. Their website is [-]or email at [-]they had a great package deal.Get Fran as your photographer and Francois is the videographer, they are a great team!!!
