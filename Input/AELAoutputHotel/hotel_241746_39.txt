{"text":"A hotel to avoid - a very poor stay. I stayed in this hotel last year  had a very enjoyable stay and recommended it to many friends. I returned to Florence to the Hotel Botticelli but my what a fall from grace this hotel has had. I stayed for six nights and during my stay we had 3 days without hot water so we had to endure cold showers, not what one looks forward to in an Italian summer.I had the mistake of making use of the 12hr laundry service for two shirts, I was a little surprised to find that the items had not been cleaned on my return that evening... in fact the staff forgot to send the items for cleaning and was told the laundry would be back the next morning. Next morning arrives and guess what? no laundry! Eventually, two days later my two shirts that I was promised would be cleaned in 12hrs arrived back, I was happy at this stage to get them back at all!!Some of the staff were generally helpful but failed to tell us on the day of our departure that a 24hr general train strike was in operation in the Tuscany region as we booked a Taxi from the Hotel to the train station... For me this was the last straw as the train station staff advised us that all the hotels in Florence were made aware of the industrial action.Florence is a fantastic city and I will no doubt be back, but I won't be staying in the Hotel Botticelli  would recommend that people avoid staying here.
