{"text":"great stay at Jurys in Boston! We stayed for one night for a little weekend getaway in Boston. We chose Jurys based on the TripAdvisor reviews and weren't disappointed! What a lovely hotel, and the people who worked there were super nice and accomodating. We got a fantastic deal through one of the discount hotel websites, and when we called to ask if we could check in an hour early or so, they upgraded our room to a deluxe. The room was very nice, spotlessly clean and attractive, the bathroom was good-sized with very nice amenities, there was free internet access and a flat-screen T.V. The beds were super comfortable. There was a fair amount of traffic noise from outside our window (we had a room facing Berkeley Street) but I consider this just part of staying at a hotel in a city. The public areas are very attractive and kind of quirky, with lighting overhead, on the stairs, and on a waterfall wall next to the stairs that change colors from green to blue to purple to red, etc.There are very unusual gas fireplaces covered with sparkly stones (I know it sounds odd, but it looks great!) The trash containers near the elevators had a bowl of potpourri on one side ! We ate dinner at Cuffs, the bar on the lower level, and had a great meal of sandwiches and fries, with two awesome desserts which I would highly recommend (a trio of ice creams in cups made of thin cookies and a blackberry creme brulee). Prices were very reasonable.We had breakfast in the Stanhope restaurant, and it was very good, too (pricey, though-- if you don't order either the full or the continental buffet, where the beverages are included, watch out for the prices on the juices and coffee!).All in all, it was a great stay and I'd love to stay there again!
