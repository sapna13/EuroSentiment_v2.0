{"text":"In dire need of renovation As most other reviewers observed, this hotel is very conveniently located. Barcelona has an awesome metro rail system over which the Barcelo Hotel Sants is located. Hence, you can get to the Airport, the beaches, La Rambla, Sagrada Familia, Montjuic, The Barcelona Aquarium and just about anywhere else you wish to visit in the City without any hassle at all. It's a great thing for two reasons. First, you will want to spend as much time away from the hotel property as possible. Second, the hotel charges a whopping 24.00 euros per night for parking. This is not a place to chill. Our room was very disappointing other than the surcharge-free wireless internet access. The mattresses were deplorably thin and hard. Moreover, while the bathroom was cleaned each day during our 10-day stay, the mildew remained. Additionally, there were pieces of hardware missing from the shower fixtures. Likewise, although we met guests from the U.K., Scotland and Ireland while there, the only television channels broadcasting in English were news stations. Hence, we endeavored to exhaust ourselves before returning to our room at night so that we could go straight to sleep and rise early to go out for the day.Finally, the one meal we ate in the hotel's restaurant other than breakfast as well as the breakfast buffet that we had three (3) times or so were extremely over-priced.The staff was pleasant but not pleasant enough to inspire us to return or recommend the Barcelo Sants to others.
