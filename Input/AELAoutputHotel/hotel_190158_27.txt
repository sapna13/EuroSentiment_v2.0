{"text":"Great Value with a Great Location! LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! Hotel Carlos V is in the heart of Madrid! We had a nice size room for three people - two twin beds placed next to each other and a small bed\/ sofa for the third person. Bathroom is large for a European Hotel, nice shower with lot's of water pressure and hot, hot water. Staff was wonderful. Our room was noisy due to the late night parties, people walking the streets, and there is construction next door, adjacent to our room. El Corte Ingleshas a wonderful Christmas display and the singing went off every hour.It was noisy but it was so festive that it was a part of the delight. We stayed for 7 nights and got a great rate though a Travelocity- hotel and airfare package. At El Corte Ingles, the department store across the street, you can go to the basement floor and there is a supermarket. You can purchase jamon ham, cheese, bread, fruit, chocolate, snacks, drinks etc. There is small refrigerator in the room stacked with mini bar stuff, we removed some of these items(with permission from the staff) and placed our items in it. The hoteloffers a coffee pot with coffee and tea but you must ask for it.Although they advertise satellite TV, the only English speaking station is international CNN which repeats their programming very often. There is a community computer that you can use with access to the Internet. I would highly recommend going to price fix restaurants offered usually in the afternoon. For a price fix of about 10 Euro youhave a choice of beverage)(wine, coffee, soda, etc) 2 course entrees and a choice of dessert. Great Value! Madridians rarely go to sleep early, so there are always someone walking by the hotel at any time of night. No Auto traffic on the street where the hotel is located so you do not hear any motor traffic except delivery trucks at night, butpeople talking and celebrating all night long! I would recommend a twoday Madrid Vision pass. There are two routes which you can hop off andon the bus. They give you head sets and speak in at least 6 different languages. The Airport shuttle was fine but if you do not have much luggage you can easily take the Metro and save a little money. Enjoy Madrid!
