{"text":"sublime and magnificent Stayed at The Pen for 3 nights last month and it was fantastic. We booked the Rolls Royce transfers from the airport and were treated like royalty all the way. There were 3 staff waiting outside The Pen to greet us as the chauffeur has phoned ahead of our imminent arrival. We were shown straight to our room even though we had arrived at 0730 well before normal room availablity times. The room - a deluxe courtyard view was fantastic, I had requested a high floor so we had the best of the both worlds: a room in the original building and a superb harbour view. It was my partners birthday so we were greeted in the room with a bottle of champagne on ice and a birthday cake in addition to all their 'standard' extras.We had afternoon tea in the lobby but timed it wrong as there weren't any queues to jump being a resident!!! Cocktails in Felix to watch the Sound and Light Show was a letdown as it was full of local expats and totally lacked any atmosphere.We booked a massage and spa session and it was the best ever: a sauna with superb harbour views, an ice fountain to cool you down and a crystal steam room which was out of this world. The massage that followed was equally superb and the whole experience was worth every penny.Admitedly when you're in the lobby area you feel like one of the many tourists but when you walk to the lifts and press the button as a resident the experience changes dramatically and nothing is too much trouble......a wonderful hotel.....best city hotel ever ","annotations":[{"endOffset":700,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":696},{"endOffset":764,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":761}]}
