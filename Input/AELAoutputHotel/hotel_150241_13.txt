{"text":"Worst Hampton in All of the America's I am a Hilton HHonors Diamond Member with more than 100 stays per year at the Hilton Hotels, this hotel was the worst hotel that I have ever stayed at, the place seemed like it was from the 1960's, the beds were horrible, the staff's attitude was very conflictive, this hotel should be priced at around $59 per night and not at $189. What a disgrace to Conrad Hilton; the pool, the carpet, the paint, the beds; were all dilapidated. My family and I decided that after a few days, it was time to move on, at which point we advised the hotel and they were insulting by saying Well, guess its time to go home, because Puerto Rico is expensive, and I responded with NO, we are moving to a real hotel, like the Embassy Suites; once we arrived at the Embassy Suites, the hotel manager personally took care of us and gave us the Diamond Member treatment. For a difference of only $20, our family was able to recuperate from the dreadful mistake of staying at the Worst Hampton in All of the America's. This hotel is probably ok for the flying crew; as they are only in for a night, but not for families. My kids had a wonderful time at the Embassy Suites with a Cascading Waterfall and water toys to pass several hours; also the breakfast and food was far superior to anything served at the Hampton. At the Hampton, the cafeteria or area serving food, closed at around 9p.m., what a disappointment. No more stays at Hampton Inns, neither in Puerto Rico nor anywhere else. ","annotations":[]}
