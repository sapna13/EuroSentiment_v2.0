{"text":"Hushed Elegance at the Royal Hawaiin We stayed at the Royal Hawaiian in July of 2006. When we arrived, we were upgraded from a garden suite to an ocean suite, Room #2 Oahu. It was on two floors, had two beds and two bathrooms and two televisions. The master bath was very large and had a jacuzzi tub. It had a lanai that overlooked the pool and the Pacific! The view was spectacular. The dining was also excellent although a bit expensive. The seafood buffet was wonderful - all the lobster, crab, oysters, shrimp and clams you could eat. Plus there were so many other dishes I can't remember them all. The luau was a bit expensive. Grab a seat in the Mai Tai Bar which is wonderful and watch the luau from a distance! Also, be sure to visit Duke's which is right next door. The Hau Tree Lanai at the New Otani Kaiman Beach Hotel is a great place for breakfast. Eat under the same tree overlooking Sans Souci Beach that Robert Louis Stevenson did. The nearby Cheesecake Factory is a good value, but it is very crowded. Go early.Be sure to park your car in the garage. It will cost $15 a day, but it is cheaper than the $25 valet parking. The concierge was very helpful. Rent a car if you have more than one guest; it is cheaper and faster. It is easy to get around once you master the one way streets!Be sure to go to Pearl Harbor to see the sights. Go early! I mean like 6:30 AM unless you want to spend the whole day there. The Iolani Palace and environs was interesting. The Dole Pineapple Planatation was okay but the drive to the north shore was more interesting. Go to Diamond Head and Hanauma Bay. The scenery on the windward side of the island is spectacular.We would sightsee most of the day and then return each afternoon to swim at the Waikiki Beach right in front of our hotel. Then we would enjoy a glass of wine overlooking the ocean on the porch of our room.We wish we had more than a week. I would return to this historical grand lady of a hotel anytime!
