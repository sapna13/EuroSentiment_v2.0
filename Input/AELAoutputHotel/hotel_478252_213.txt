{"text":"Good Resort We stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe from 4\/1 - 4\/8. We booked through BPUSA which is the resort's website. I had no problems booking, although I was booking two rooms and requested they be in same villa and they were not. This posed no problems however. I read reviews on Trip Advisor and was a bit concerned. If you have booked a trip and are worried based on reviews, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be. This is a huge resort and you are not going to get individualized attention but you should lack for nothing. We had to have a ground floor room due to my husband's recent ankle injury and I was worried about bugs, there were a few but not many and I have been to multiple Caribbean resorts and have had many more. The rooms are spacious and clean, maids did a nice job but you might want to leave a few dollars every day to get that extra attention.You will not go hungry. There are two buffets with decent food and quite a few of a la carts restaurants. Book your a la carts right away, they are the way to go. We dined at the Mexican, Mediterranean, Japanese and the Steakhouse and all were wonderful. The only problem I had with it is the time regulations involved in the restaurants. They open and close promptly at the stated times and when you are on vacation it is nice to have flexibility. Once you understand there are no variations on time you will do fine.The entertainment is fine. I enjoy participating in all the resorts have to offer and think this resort is a little slow paced for my very active family, albeit there may have been more going on and we were not aware of it due to the size of the resort.If you are thinking of booking this resort and have any difficulties with mobility I would suggest you look elsewhere. While I thought this resort was great, it is hard for those with any disabilities to move about. My husband broke his ankle a few weeks before our trip and thank heavens I rented him a knee scooter to get around, otherwise we would have been in a world of trouble. I hope this review is helpful to those who are booking or have already booked. It really is a lovely resort to stay.
