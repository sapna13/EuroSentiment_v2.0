{"text":"Can't wait to go back to Punta Cana! We had a great time at Club Med Punta Cana! This was our first time there. We left on1\/27 after having been there a week. My wife and I went with our 8 and 6 year old and had a great time. We will likely look to go back in coming years. Here are my thoughts:Overall: They do a great job. The grounds are fantastic. The beach is one of the nicest I have ever been to. Just a notch behind Turks and Caicos but pretty darn close. White sand and calm blue green water.Activities: Tons of stuff to do. Volleyball, ocean kayak, trapeze, rollerblade. Food: It is ok. Definitely not gourmet dining but they do a good job. No one in our family had any GI issues with food or water.Rooms: Its typical Club Med. A small clean simple room. A\/C worked ok. They did a good job cleaning it every day.Bugs: They fumigate each night. I would still make sure to bring some Off as we got bit the times we forgot to wear it. CDC recommends Chloriquine for malaria but my guess is that few people do this. We did.Communications: Both my Cingular and Verizon devices worked. Get international roaming before you go. They have a wifi hotspot in lobby which works well or you can use their pc's. Camp: They do a wonderful job with the kids camp.Convenience: Barely 10 minutes to the airport, it could not be any more convenient.Guests: When we were there it was 60-70% French. Everyone seemed nice. A Bon Jour or Bon Suar goes a long way. Most of the staff spoke english. Nudity: The Europeans definitely like to go topless. No problem here although the saying most people look better with their clothes on definitely applies. Cigars: Guys come Tues and Friday night and set up a stand by the main bar. A guy comes that actually rolls the cigars. Fun to watch. They sell Domincan and Cuban cigars.Airport: One of the nicest small country airports I have been too.
