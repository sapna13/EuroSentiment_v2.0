{"text":"A Great Hotel in a Central Location Myself and two girlfriends stayed at The Tulip Inn Dam Square for 3 nights in November, thanks once again to the positive reviews on Tripadvisor I booked a lovely hotel which was central to everything in Amsterdam, just what we required.Arriving at Schipol airport we came through arrivals and walked straight to the railway station just follow the signs, to take the train to Amsterdam Central, really easy, trains run every 20 mins, you get your tickets from a yellow ticket machine (3 euros and 60 cents one way) then the train journey takes about 15 mins. When you exit the railway station be aware of the trams and of course the bicycles which are everywhere.We walked from the station to the hotel which took about 10 to 15 mins with cases, just head to Dam Square, the hotel is easy to find.On arrival we were checked in really quickly by nice staff and then shown to the lift to take us to the floor our room was on. I had requested a quiet room on a high floor with 3 single beds and this was just what we got. The room was clean and of a good size with heating and duvets on the extra long beds rather than sheets, there was coffee making facilities, tv and a nice size bathroom with a walk in corner shower and soft towels, there was also a hairdryer. This is the cleanest bathroom i have seen in any hotel i have stayed in.The room rate included breakfast in the lovely breakfast room which was never busy but always had plenty of food on offer, you had a choice of tea or coffee which was brought to your table, you then served yourself to cereals, fruit juices, cold meats, cheeses, yogurts,rolls, toast and fresh fruit, a great leisurely start to the day without feeling you had to rush.There was also a bar in the foyer of the hotel, not that we used it as there is so many bars to choose from just outside the hotel especially St Pauls bar and restaurant which is 2 doors away from the hotel, very relaxed atmosphere with nice food. The other bar and restaurant i must recommend is one we found close to the red light district called Het Karbeel in a street called Warmoesstratt, an excellent find with attentive staff and a wonderful menu, we ate here two evenings out of the three we were in Amsterdam. The cheese fondue was mouth watering as a starter and the king prawn was too die for. Both nights we spent over four hours eating our meal, nothing was rushed and we felt totally relaxed, the glass of Port at the end of the meal was the icing on the cake.This was a great city break, nice hotel in a central location just what you need without having to spend a fortune. I couldn't fault the hotel at all and would recommend it.
