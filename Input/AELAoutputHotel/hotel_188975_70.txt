{"text":"Best Hotel in the World I have stayed at many of the top hotels in the world: the Peninsula Hong Kong, the Oriental, the Four Seasons Hotel New York, Peninsula Bangkok, Amanwana. These are just a few. I have stayed at many of the top hotels in Paris. I have also stayed at half of the Four Seasons properties around the world. I usually do not write reviews on tripadvisor, but after reading the latest review which is so outrageously wrong, I felt that I needed to write my review.In my opinion, the Four Seasons George V is the world's best hotel and the world's best Four Seasons hotel. ROOMS:I stayed in a large expansive Deluxe room that overlooked the Marble Courtyard. The room was tastefully decorated as if it was the residence of a French nobleman. It was tastefully decorated in Louis XVth design, but had all of the wonderful amenities of a Four Seasons hotel: sound proof rooms, high ceilings, very soft beds, a large expansive marble bathroom, and Bulgari bath amenities.SERVICE:Service is what truly sets apart this hotel from others in the world. The service puts the George V in a category of its own. The service from the staff was effortless and impeccable. The perfect balance between formality and familiarity. The service was truly genuine. They made you feel that you were a valued and important guest to them, and that a perfect stay was something that they wanted you to have. The people are truly amazing.Every single department was consistent and excellent. The concierge is excellent. With a staff of 50 concierges, my requests were answered at all hours.DINING:Le Cinq is truly a magnificent restaurant. Le Galerie is a wonderful place to have breakfast.I plan on returning very soon.
