{"text":"A great vacation! If you need a fancy resort with a lots of high-end touches this isn't the place for you. If you're looking for a fun, relaxed, casual holiday then you can't go wrong with the RIU Bambu. The beach is absolutely amazing with more than enough loungers for everyone. One big thing I noticed on a very long beach walk was how much cleaner the RIU beach is compared to other resorts(the Iberostar complex next door).The rooms are small but clean. Yes, they do need to be renovated but I didn't spend much time there. The mini-bar is great and is replenished every two days.The food was very good. The Colonial buffet was great. The hot food was very hot and the cold food was cold. This resort cares very much about food holding temps. There wasn't any fancy seafood like losbster, crab, or shrimp but you won't go hungry. We tried all three alacarts. Only the Caribe Grill next door at the Palace Macao is worth the extra effort.The bartenders and Animation staff were all super. They were all extremely friendly and wanted everyone to have a great time. The RIU Bambu had the best Animation team of all the resorts I have visited. I also noticed the resort management were much more friendly to resort staff and guests than other places I have been. The Monster Truck tour is excellent. It's a whole day tour but worth the time and the $85. You get to see how Dominican's really live. A big difference from the beach areas. My guide, Jose Lito was the best excursion guide I have had while on vacation. Take candy and pencils for the children. Give some extra to the Hatian kids, they need it more. The 2 hr. snorkeling tour by Scuba Caribe was also good.
