{"text":"Spectacular! We booked this trip through BJ's wholesale Club..and boy did we save $$$. It cost us $120 a night, and we had a free night for our six day stay. Loved loved loved this resort.The rooms are spacious and clean. Awesome bedding and views.The pool area is excellent, we were on east coast time, so we were up at 7am at the pool daily and had it to ourselves or shared with one or two others till almost 9:30. There are three pools and the fun lazy river. The pool area was never overcrowded in my mind, and had plenty of people to serve drinks and food.We ate at Meritage, Blue Sage, and Just a Splash. We loved all of it. We thought the mixed drinks at the pool for $10.00 were a little pricey for our taste, but hey we didn't have to leave the pool or resort to get to it. We found that going across the street to the Desert Ridge Marketplace and other local restaurants was more fun and cost effective. Our faves: Jalapeno Inferno (Scottsdale Road-5min), Sweet Tomatoes(Desert Ridge Marketplace 1mile), and Islands (Desert Ridge Marketplace 1 mile). If you go to the movies and keep your stub Sweet Tomatoes will give you 15% off your bill.There are a ton of stores in the Marketplace to keep you busy. We also went to the Fashion Square in Scottsdale about 13 miles away.We headed to Williams, AZ about three hours away for the train ride to the Grand Canyon, we don't have children so this long long day trip didn't cause an issue for us.My husband played golf there and loved it as well. This time of year it's 67.00, and he played at TPC Scottsdale (5miles away) for $47.00. Very cheap for excellent courses.We would totally go back the place is awesome!!! My only issue is that parking is forever away, that's why I'd say 90% of the visitors use the valet service. We didn't use it...but oh well we got our exercise. ","annotations":[]}
