{"text":"Good hotel in great location I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and didnt have one bad thing to say about it from beginning to end. I booked it through their website (and emails) they were very quick in responding with my queiries. It is within 3 mins walk from Maubert-Mutualite underground station but we walked to most places as it is so central-you can be infront of the notre dame within 5 mins. The check-in staff were always very polite and curteous to us helping us with any queiries. Having stayed in a few hotels in Paris i am well aware that rooms can be quite small and misleading however this one was different i was pleasantly suprised to see the size of our bedroom (room 32) and a large bathroom. It was clean, spacious and comfortable. We had view over the road, i am usually a light sleeper but didnt hear a thing al night.We had the breakfast at the hotel one morning, buffet style including bread, cheese, ham, cereal, jam, pain au chocolat, croissants etc. Waitress was also very polite. Check-out was again very simple, polite and friendly they even asked us how we had found our stay.If i came back to PAris i would not hesitate to stay here again, you will not find such a hotel in such a location at this price. Im sure it wont be long before the proces go up.There are also plenty of bars,restaurants in this area and you are 5 mins from the Latin quater and from Notre Dame.
