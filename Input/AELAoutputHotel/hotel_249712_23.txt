{"text":"Solid, but not spectacular I got a very good rate on this hotel recently for a 1-night stay. Keep in mind, that good rate is a relative term in NYC, but the rate was very fair. While there was nothing bad about my stay, this location didn't quite live up to the quality level and reputation of the fine Westin brand.On the plus side:-Great bedding, towels and amenities that are trademarks of Westin-Quiet room, with no noise bleeding through from halls.-Starbucks coffee, good in-room safe and nice quality televisions.-Polite reception by a very courteous, professional staff-Loved the double-headed showers!The minuses on this property are primarily in terms of building condition and design.-My room had a significant number of wall scratches, carpet stains, and little chips on furniture that simply didn't feel luxurious.-Some pretty hefty fees to use internet connections and weight room that discouraged me from trying either.-No robes in rooms, which is different from other Westin's I've stayed in.-a loose lamp fixture that was affixed to the wall. Again, not a life or death deal, just unbecoming a luxury business hotel.-Business center, which I only looked in, seemed incredibly crowded and squished.While I would definitely stay here again, as the beds, great location, and friendly staff make it a competent and comfortable night's stay, I just feel like this hotel can push itself a little to raise its true luxury reputation. A few new room furnishings and going through each room to make sure everything is fastened tight and all the t's are crossed would make a big difference.
