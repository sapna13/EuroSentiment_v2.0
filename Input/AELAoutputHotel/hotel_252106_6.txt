{"text":"Perfect stay Booked the Swissotel after reading reviews on TripAdvisorand it really stood up to the expectations.The hotel's Location is Great.its located just on top of the the Underground station Ku-dam U-Bahn station , and 3 min's walk from the Zoo-station central rail station.it sits on the Ku-damn avenue,which is the shopping street of berlin.tons of fashion shops and other malls,restauraunts, bars and much more , all in your neighbourhood.The hotel itself and the room , is all very elegant , and very clean.in our room we had a nice large bed , both bath and shower (extremely clean and convenient)we had a Lavazza coffee machine in the room which we enjoyed and used daily.theres a digital safe , hair dryer , iron and ironing board , minibar fridge. , 3 phones so you can answer even if you're in bed or in the bathroom.there's also a workign desk with a comfortable chair , and another armchair with a coffee table by the window.the staff are freindly and helpfull.all was really well.its definetely more a buisness hotel than a vacation oneas you wont find a swimming pool , or spa , etc...but for a good place to sleep and relax in your room its great.I disliked the fact that although its a 5 start hotelwhich means prices are not cheap, (we paid $185 night without breakfast)Internet connection (wireless or wired) is an extra charge at around $16\/day(they do provide free computer use with internet access at the lobby , but if you want to use your own laptop you have to pay)other than news channels, the TV only had german language channels, no BBC , SKY , STAR , or other english channels to enjoy, which could have been nice.breakfast , at $25 per person was ok... nothing special , and I cant say it worth the price, as breakfast outside would have cost a fraction of that and you could have actually have 2 full meals in a standard restauraunts for the same price.for safety reasons , the room hasnt got windows that you can fully open, and we could have used more air , and less hot environment.the room was cleaned well and linnen changed daily.complimentry fruit and cold water at the front desk.overall we enjoyed and recommen this hotel.
