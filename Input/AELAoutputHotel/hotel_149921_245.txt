{"text":"mixed review A group meeting brought us to this hotel during the third week of January. I was a bit concerned about the stay having read previous reviews which were very mixed. First the bottom line. We have a very nice stay at the hotel but the room quality is definitely a potential issue. We arrived in the early afternoon and were assigned a room in the newly renovated tower. The air conditioning did not work well and there was no way to change it (preset at the high 60's F). The toilet leaked around the base, the balcony door had no lock, and there was a strange wire protruding from the floor by the balcony door. We were given a different room and everything was fine. As noted by others the beds are wonderful. This time the air conditioning (still preset) worked fine. The flat-screen TV was a nice touch. The remainder of our stay from a room standpoint was fine but you shouldn't have this kind of issue with a multi-star Hilton resort and if we'd arrived later in the day our room options would have been more limited. Food at the restaurant and elsewhere in San Juan is expensive unless you stay away from the restaurants frequented by tourists. You can easily spend $50 per person without drinks. On the other hand, I did grab lunch on the run at the Subway across the street one day for around $8.00. All in all, the location is not bad (a short cab ride into old San Juan) and aside from the initial room issues, I have no complaints. But....for the price and the hotel name we shouldn't have had the problems we did. Would I stay at this hotel again? Probably not since there are many 'name brands from which to choose.
