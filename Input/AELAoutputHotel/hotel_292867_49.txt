{"text":"nice hotel...not a place for people with disabilities!! Hello...My friend and I stayed at this resort for one week (women ages 26 and 42). When we arrived we were given a room with one bed but had reserved a room with two double beds...it took quite abit of talking to get a double room. My friend is recovering from a car accident and is not able to walk the stairs or great distances. This hotel has NO elevator even though it is three stories. NO availibiltiy of a wheel chair for use...but they do have ramps beside the major buildings..There is alot of walking needed to get from point A to B but you can catch a mini bus if you wait long enough. There is not alot of food for the vegetarian as most dishes are meat\/fish based. Most times I could not find someone in the dinning room who spoke enough english to tell me if the dish I was interested in had meat or fish..beware of the lack of labeling for the person with allergies. The pillows were absolutely terrible!!!!!!!! I think they used the old towels to make pillows as they were so lumpy. This is a difficult resort to go to if you only speak english. If your a single woman ...well thats another story!!.....the staff that work by the pool flirt and proposition you so much you are ready to scream by day 3. But overall my stay was nice...could have done without the all firting to have some peace.
