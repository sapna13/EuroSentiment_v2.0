{"text":"DONT GET MARRIED HERE!!!!! I had 18 friends and family accompany me to the Grand Oasis Punt Cana Dec 4-11th. I was supposed to get married there (my fiance and I broke up before the trip , so we turned it into a family vacation) THANK GOD I did not get married there as I would have been VERY upset. Our problems started at check in. As an anniversary gift, my friends were going to upgrade to a suite. They didnt have that available. They put us in building 10. This is the new area. So new in fact that after a long night of drinking we woke up to hammering, drilling at 0800!! I then asked them to move us, as that was unacceptable. If they are not done that section, they should not have people stay there. We then all moved rooms to buildings 3 and 7. Those were o.k. Through out our week the power went off atleast 3 times, the maids went on strike, there were no face cloths, no beach towels, they charged me $22 for a local call, the list goes on and on. They were so unorganized, I cant imagine how a wedding would turn out. They told us we could get married on the beach, but there wasnt really any good place where they could have set it up. I dont know why they would say that they have wedding packages. All in all, we made the best of our trip. When we initally booked it a year ago, reviews were good, and it was listed as 35th most popular hotel. I would NEVER tell friends to stay here. Half of our group was there for 2 weeks, and they stayed in a great hotel the first week. They all said the Grand Oasis was terrible, the beach wasnt as nice, the staff was rude. We even met some flight attendants the night before, on our flight home, they stated they will not be staying there anymore as the flight company needed to have certain standards. For the price we paid, we totally got ripped off!! If you get a cheap deal, it would probably be o.k, but dont even consider getting married there!!!! ","annotations":[]}
