{"text":"absolutely the best Having travelled extensively on both business and pleasure i can honestly say this is one of the best if not the best hotel i have ever stayed in. The location is great - walking distance from the city centre, raffles and all the major attractions. the rooms are big and beautiful, spotlessly clean and so are the pool and reception areas. The bars serve great cocktails and snacks. The breakfast buffet is without doubt the best i have encountered. yes it has all the usuals western style but all with a quality i have never come across before - fresh, plentiful and varied. But you can also choose from the japanese, chinese or indian buffets - mix and match. and it is all being cooked fresh in the open to view kitchen so its always piping hot. but such interesting and varied dishes. the bread staion has just everything and the fresh fruit covers a whole counter with tropical fruits i have never come across as well as all ones i am used to. they will even freshly squeeze a fruit smoothie for you from any combination. If possible the dinner buffet is even better - do NOT bother eating outside - we tried it one night and regretted it. The starters include huge prawns, oysters, crab and every kiond of meat and sushi as well as super fresh salad. Main courses are again set out on counters by nationality - the indian dishes are to die for or you can have your personally chosen ingredients stir fried with the most wonderful stock, or chinese or japanese as well as good all western joints, chicken etc. But the thing that puts this hotel above all others is the service. from the minute you walk through the door a myriad os staff are ALWAYS on hand to answer your every need - in fact they often ask to help even when you dont need anything. changing the duvet from my bed (too hot) into a sheet and blanket setup was done rapidly and without any reluctance. i was always greeted at the restaurant by name (how do they do that?) and escorted politely to a table. the bellboy even raced me to the lift to press the button. even the reception staff approached you with a smile as you neared rather than the usual frosty attitude as you try to get their attention. the pool attendant stopped what he was doing immediately to ask if i needed any help as i appeared in the pool area. i felt cosseted, cared for and cared about. i cannot praise this hotel enough. in singapore do not stay anywhere else.
