{"text":"Great location, good value I stayed at the Tulip Inn Dam Square for 10 nights in March\/April. Overall, it was a positive experience. The hotel is in a perfect loction, regardless of what you want. With 3 tram stops within one block of the hotel, you can get anywhere quickly. All major attractions are within walking distance if your willing to walk 20 minutes or so. Its on a quiet street with a few bars (hit the one on the corner) and other attractions. For those interested, there are 2 coffee shops right accross the street (10 yards maybe) and the main RLD as well as a second are minutes away by foot. The location can't be beat. The room was clean, small but reasonable size, with a comfortable bed. I had a little mold in the shower, but otherwise the bathroom was fine as well. Staff is friendly and helpful. Breakfast is good depending on your expectations. Tea, coffee, milk, OJ, a few cereals, rolls, other pastries, a variety of cheese and lunch meats, and yougart. I enjoyed it, but did find myself just making sandwhiches each day. If you want a full hot brekfast, there is plenty around the area. Worth noting, I did have some problems with them recognizing I had paid for my trip using an large internet travel site. It was eventually resolved, but not after a big scare. If you book over the inet and prepay, make extensive efforts to get that clarified before you leave. Also, the internet is a bit pricy (5 euro per 1\/2 hour) and the access is in the loby. The rooms have data ports, but they appeared to be disabled. Cheaper internet is in the local shops, but if you want it in the room, this isn't the place for you. I would consider staying at this hotel when I go back to Amsetrdam. I wish it had in room internet access, but otherwise, relly enjoyed my stay.
