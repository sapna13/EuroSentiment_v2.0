{"text":"Not Great My wife and I spent the week before Easter at the resort. Was there on a company retreat. Weather was not great, windy, overcast and at times rainy. The resort was ok but far from great. Its actaully divided up into several different areas that are spread out across their property...really spread out. We stayed in the part of the resort down by the Marina. Rooms were fine, nothing special but clean and nicely appointed.Would suggest that you get a room on the top floor at the marina so that you get high ceilings, and one thats on the corner so that you get an extra window. Each room had a DVD player and a nice LCD tv. (Had to unplug the DVD video cable from the tv to get the tv to show channels and the remote was missing batteries when we got there.) The rooms each have a balcony which was great for sitting and having a glass of wine at the end of the day. I suggest buying a bottle\/and or snacks at one of the many general stores instead of the restaraunt\/bar..The rooms each have fridges that you can use to put what ever you buy.- but no snacks or drinks were in the room. (these could have been removed by my company ? )The draw back to the marina was that in order to get to the main part of the hotel you needed to take a tram up from the seaside level the top level, then walk a long hall way to an elevator to the main hotel...sound like alot ? It is. The positives are that you are down on the water and by the water park and the boat that takes you to the resort's private beach island. If you are up top, it takes a long tme to get to these attractions.In short, the resort was ok, good for a company event as it has everything a big company event needs, but its really lacking in charm, charater and the layout leaves a lot to be desired.
