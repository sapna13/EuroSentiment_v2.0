{"text":"great stay at the battery park ritz we stayed 3 nights at the battery park ritz - club floor - harbor view room (had booked a city view but was upgraded - the hotel was not terribly busy). We had requested a room near the club lounge and that was also accomodated. We love Ritz club floors and this was no different - as it is a smaller hotel than some RC the club level staff would bring drinks rather than you fixing one yourself (though wine was available on as self service basis some of the time). we arrived mid-day and our room was available (we'd asked for early check-in) and again, because the hotel wasn't too busy- requested and received a late check-out on Monday. The location is great for lower Manhattan and also steps away from the number 4 subway line (lex av. express) - which has stops at Grand Central station, 86th street (a 5 minute walk to the met museum of art) and 59th street - for Central Park and shopping along 5th avenue). We enjoyed the quiet of the battery park area in the evening - we spent the evenings in the club lounge - our daughter made friends with some other kids staying on the club floor - so we hung out with the other parents in the lounge. Rooms quite nice (I think a little smaller than some R\/C) but new - so there is a separate bath and shower. Small but nice gym with a great view. We did some in-room dining - typical but good. Would absolutely stay here again when visiting New York.
