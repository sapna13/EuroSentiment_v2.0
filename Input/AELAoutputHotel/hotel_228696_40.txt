{"text":"Will definately go back I booked a weekend break for my boyfriend and myself as a Christmas present, previously booking another Hotel and after reading the reviews cancelled my booking and we stayed at Le Littre instead after reading the good reviews. This Hotel is lovely and like the other reviews state down a nice quiet side street so not noisy like i would have expected from a Hotel in the centre of Paris. The reception staff all spoke very good English and were extremely helpful. We stayed on the 7th floor and i was nicely suprised by the room. It was a good size for Paris hotels and had a balcony with a view of the Eiffel tower. The bathroom was lovely and was brand new which was even nicer. There were white towelling dressing gowns aswell for guests which i thought was a nice added extra. The breakfast in the mornings was very nice with a great choice - bacon, eggs, sausage etc which my boyfriend tucked into but i couldnt resist the coissants and jam and fresh fruit salad. Cereal was available aswell with yoghurt and meat, cheese and bread etc. The Hotels hot chocolate in the morning was delicious (and very addictive!) The Hotel is in a good location, just far enough out of everything that it isnt packed but in good walking distance to all the sites. We didnt use the Metro or RER often and chose to walk to all the sites, we estimated we had walked approximately 10-15 miles per day but it was lovely just strolling around and taking it all in. On the times we did use the underground systems we had no problems at all and found this very cheap. The Hotel was happy to recommend restaurants and tours and we had a thoroughly enjoyable stay in Paris. We will definately use this Hotel again when we go back.
