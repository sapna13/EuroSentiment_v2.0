{"text":"THE BEST WEEK OF MY LIFE IN PARIS We Stayed at the Elysees Regencia in PARIS on May 5-11th.Let me just say that this Hotel is in the PERFECT Location...One block from the Champs-Elysees,...5 minutes walk to Arc de Triomphe....At the other end of the street,is where Princess Diana Died,...15 minutes from the hotel in the other direction is Eiffel Tower....We walked all over Paris everyday for the week we were there,And i LOVED IT!! Most things are within walking distance...just wear comfortable shoes. :)The Hotel itself was Beautiful from the Outside,and very Clean and modern on the inside.I rented the Double Deluxe Room on the Fifth Floor and i was Very HAPPY.The Room had plenty of space and was very clean.Not Much storage area for your clothes,but who Cares,Your in PARIS!! We found ourselves not in the Room much at all anyways....We were out and about from early until late at night.I swear that city never sleeps :) People out very late,just enjoying the city and weather.Tried room service and the food was Great....I have no Complaints about this wonderful Hotel....The Staff is Very Friendly and Helpful and they speak Great English.I will be staying there again next year for another week.Couple of tips....Bring an alarm clock,The room didn;t have any clocks in the room,but i did recommend it to the manager when i Left....and I do not Recommend Using the PARIS SHUTTLE that is online (Parishuttle) Although they where on time when we arrived in Paris,When it was time to leave Paris to go back to the Airport...The driver was late,Then we had to pick up 4 other couples and by the time we Got to the Airport and checked in,We had to run to the gate because they were boarding our Flight.I will definitely take a taxi next time.I Wish everyone that has never been to Paris a Wonderful trip like we had....It was a week in my life that i will never forget.By the way,Don;t worry about the language barrier....Most people in Paris spoke some english.HOTEL ELYSEES REGENCIA Is Tops in my Book and i Recommend it to Everyone.....Have a great time everyone.I LOVE PARIS!!!
