{"text":"Neutral - ok but you can find a better place The good:The property is beautiful with lovely gardens. There are two pools, two tennis courts, a climbing wall and a playground for young kids. There are two restaurants on the property. The people who work there are very friendly. The apartments are comfortable and it is lovely to sit outside on your veranda to enjoy the birds chirping.The not so good:There are two areas on the beach through which you can enter the water. Otherwise, there is too much coral to make it safe to enter. The water is nice but choppy. The beach is hard to run on even though it is 3 miles long as the brochure tells you. Other than housekeeping, there are really no services in this hotel. They say they have tennis raquets, bicycles and kayaks that you can use but they are so limited in numbers that you really don't get to use them. It would be better if they rented them out to you so that they would have them available. Many of the units are owned and used by locals who bring everything with them and it seems like the hotel feels that there is no need to provide the typical amenities that tourists require.The distances on this part of the island are very big so you are kind of stuck here unless you want to drive 1 hour plus to go to another town or beach or rain forest. There are no restaurants outside of the hotel to speak of and the local supermarket is kust so so. We went to Rincon which is about 1 hour from this hotel. There is more to do there and it is closer to the southern coast where the waters are calmer and there is a lot more to do so that might be a better bet. ","annotations":[]}
