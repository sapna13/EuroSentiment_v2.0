{"text":"Good hotel, great price We stayed 2 nights at the University Inn while vacationing in Seattle. We've stayed at many different hotels in Seattle over a number of years and chose the University Inn this time for its price and high rating on tripadvisor.Overall, our stay was positive. I wasn't wowed by the UI, but it has a nice location in the University District, a free continental breakfast, and the price is excellent compared to other Seattle hotels. Our room had a nice view of downtown (in the distance) which was a bonus. We also took advantage of the free shuttle service the hotel provides and spent a morning downtown shopping. We were the only ones in the shuttle both ways and the driver was on-time and friendly. The continental breakfast was fine, better (more options) if you actually go downstairs rather than fill out the form for them to deliver it to your door in the morning.Our only complaint was that despite being gone from 9am to 2pm one day our room was not cleaned until we made a request at 3:30. We ducked out for a walk and when we returned it was cleaned, but it feels like a hassle to have to do so. Strangely enough the following morning a housekeeping staff member knocked on our door at 9am wanting to clean our room when we were just getting out of bed.We've stayed in nicer hotels in the Seattle area, but also paid considerably more. We've stayed at their sister property just up the block, the Watertown, and I think I prefer it because it has a larger lobby and breakfast area plus tables outside. All in all, a good stay and the perfect pick if you want a solid hotel without the inflated Seattle prices.
