{"text":"Excellent location. Enjoyed our stay at Royal Magda Etoile Hotel. My wife and I chose this hotel for our Paris vacation, based on tripadvisor reviews. We were very pleased with our 6-night stay at Royal Magda Etoile Hotel during the last week of June.Sidebar: We took the Air France bus shuttle from Charles de Gaulle Airport to Arc de Triomphe. Extremely rough baggage handling by Air France shuttle bus staff, resulted in the zipper of our suitcase being badly damaged, despite the suitcase being in perfect condition after overnight travel from Toronto, Canada, to Paris, with stopovers in Montreal, Munich and Rome, on various airlines. This damage rendered the suitcase not being able to be properly closed, as the slider was completely removed from the teeth of zipper. While this may not seem like the end of the world to readers, this was not a good start to our trip, given that we were traveling elsewhere in Europe, the week following.The hotel is a very short walk from Air France bus shuttle stop. We were greeted at reception desk by Yohan, who was very helpful. Upon learning about our misfortune, he summoned help to repair the zipper on our suitcase. Sassy (hotel maintenance) immediately repaired the zipper, in the area right beside the lobby. One would never have known that it was ever broken. When offered a small token of our appreciation, Sassy very graciously declined, saying it was his pleasure to help. The hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ owner, Mr. Destouches, happened to be in the lobby at the time, so we made sure that Sassy√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ service was duly recognized. Upon our insistence, Sassy very reluctantly accepted our envelope. As well, I had brought my laptop on our trip. Without hesitation, Yohan offered to lend an Internet cable and voltage converter for our entire stay. From the time of our arrival at the hotel, to after check-in, the staff at this hotel, turned our unfortunate start (though not related to the hotel whatsoever), into a positive. For this, we were thankful. Other staff (Juliet, head housekeeper) was helpful. Soukri, at reception in evening, always welcomed us with a warm smile and conversation at the end of our busy day.The location of this hotel is ideal. Everything is within a very short walking distance - Metro station, from which one can travel virtually everywhere in Paris; Arc de Triomphe; restaurants; caf√ã√\u2022√ñs; retail, convenience and grocery stores; and coin laundry (thanks for the local map and directions, Yohan).Our room was small (which we knew beforehand from reading reviews), but a great value. It was tastefully decorated and modern, in very good condition, very clean, and air conditioning worked. Our bed was comfortable. The desk allowed for use of our laptop, and free in-room Internet connection worked perfectly. We bought an international phone card externally, and used the in room phone, which worked well to make calls to Canada. We made good use of in-room safe, as well.Overall, we would recommend this hotel to those traveling to Paris. ","annotations":[]}
