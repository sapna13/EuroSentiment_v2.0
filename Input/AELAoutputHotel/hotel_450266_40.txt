{"text":"Overrated. We just came back from Bravo Beach Hotel. While we had a great time exploring Vieques, Bravo Beach itself was an extremely disappointing experience. Do not stay here. I had read great reviews from Travel  Leisure and Conde Nast and arrived with high expectations which were not at all met. We stayed in Room 5 which had a pretty view, but that was about it. Our comforter had holes in it, the sheets didn't fit on the bed, the tv didn't work, and dust was everywhere. The bathroom is completely run down and the shower does not stay consistently hot. We ran out of bath products early on and they were never replaced. The hotel itself is also run down and located in the worst area of Vieques (Isabel Segunda). There is no beach access as marketed, and the infinity pool shown on the website is located in the restaurant - no one swims in it. The staff was also unhelpful (despite what we've heard in other reviews). They don't provide beach towels (you are supposed to take the shower towels located in your room). And we rented snorkels for a day to find they had not been cleaned from their prior use (even though they were located in the main office). The restaurant at BBH is decent as is Mr. Sushi which is also located on the premises (the guy who runs it is great), but neither stay open past 10. To compensate for that they have an honor bar...however, it has taken over by the staff at night and they are not welcoming to the guests staying there.With that said, I would highly recommend that you stay at either Inn on the Blue Horizon or Martineau Bay if you are going to Vieques...you will have a much better overall experience.
