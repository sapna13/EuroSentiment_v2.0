{"text":"Lovely Hotel! We just returned from a wonderful week in Paris staying at the Aviatic Hotel Saint Germain. What a lovely hotel! I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe not written a hotel review before, but I thought I should share our great experience. We chose the Aviatic based on TripAdvisor reviews and were delighted with our room--a superior on the 5th floor. The superior was roomy by Paris standards, charmingly decorated, and included a nice sized bathroom with shower and tub. Wonderful amenities included adjustable AC, room in the fridge for our own bottle of wine, bathrobes, in-room safe, and great water pressure. The room and bathroom were spotlessly clean throughout our visit.The staff could not have been nicer. We were greeted in English and given a map, directions to attractions, and transportation advice, such as getting a Carte Orange one-week Metro pass. Over the course of our stay, we received ready answers to our questions, always in good English, from the different persons staffing the reception counter. Everyone was polite and helpful.The elevator is very small but was useful for getting luggage up to our room. We often used the circular staircase to come and go.The hotel's location is ideal on a quiet street very close to transportation. A Metro is right around the corner on Boulevard Montparnasse, and several other Metro lines are nearby as well. It's only about 10 minutes to Gare Montparnasse (we took the Air France bus from CDG to this train station and walked to the hotel). The breakfast room looked nice, but we chose to save a few euros and eat down the street. Boulevard Montparnasse offers many dining choices, and boulangeries and small supermarkets are also nearby. We especially liked the little shops (pastries, take-out, fresh fruit groceries, etc.) up the street on rue Notre Dame des Champs. For a wonderful dinner, don't miss the Chez Marcel bistro on rue Stanislas. While located in the 6th arrondissement, the Aviatic is closer to the 14th than to Boulevard Saint-Germain. However, it's an easy walk north to this bustling area and to the Seine. This hotel was a very good value. Previously my husband stayed in the 6th at a similar hotel for twice the rate, and his accommodations were not as nice. We would definitely stay at the Aviatic again.
