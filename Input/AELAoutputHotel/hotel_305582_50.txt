{"text":"If you're gay - stay here I was nervous about staying in a gay hotel (even being gay) but it was really a great experience. Although the clientele was mainly gay, it's relatively small and in a big city so you don't feel completely saturated by it. Located steps away from most of the gay life (bars, clubs, saunas) it's also really centrally located in Barcelona as well. The hotel itself is really well designed but not 5 star. More boutique style luxury. Rooms were really clean and modern with great beds, ample closet space, good bathrooms and many rooms have small terraces or window enclosed breakfast nooks overlooking the city (ask for one of these). The breakfast buffet every morning was extensive and delicious (and included). The staff all spoke English and were really nice and helpful (although for directions - use a map - I found myself lost the way they described how to get places and barcelona is a tricky city to navigate). There is a nice rooftop bar with great views and a tiny little pool (think big hot tub size) and a small weight room. The restaurant was nice and in the lobby but I didn't eat there. They have a small drag performance in the lobby one night a week but it's very tame and only gets a small crowd. Not really a hotel to meet people because it's a big city and there's no central gathering spot really, but on the mezzanine are two computers with free internet for guests to use (great feature) and you can meet ppl here as everyone is vying to get online. If you're gay and appreciate a modern design hotel, this is the place to be.
