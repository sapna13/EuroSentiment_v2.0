{"text":"Best $ for $ Trip I've ever Taken Let me start by saying my wife and I have been to some of the nicest hotels at popular vacation spots and I would like to think I know whats nice. From the Four Seasons in Maui  Phoenix to other top rated spots. I found the Excellence a outstanding 3-4 night getaway. The grounds are spectacular, full marble furnished lobby that lights up at night under candlelight and torches. As you pass through the beauiful lobby area, you move out back to the gorgeous pool\/beach area. The pool is a awesome lagoon style that seems to go on forever. You can hop on a float mat and leisurely float around in paradise and pickup a beer at the swim up bar along the way. The pool deck is surrounded by many chairs, cushioned beds, and luxury shaded cabanas. If you like tennis ask for Rolando the tennis pro. He is a great teacher and will simply volley with you if you wish.The beach is probably the nicest I've seen. It tops Maui, and any other Caribbean beaches I've been to. Not a rock, shell, seaweed, or any other crap that you would find in US beaches. Smooth silky sand everywhere. The waves are a blast to play in if you venture about 50 yds out. The staff is fantasic. They come around non-stop offering drinks, food, fruit and anything else. I thought the food was great. I didn't have a bad meal there. The French spot, Chez Isabelle is not a restaurant that you would expect to find at a all-inclusive. Nothing short of fine dining. Chateaubriand, Rack of Lamb, you name it..all fantastic. Even the wines that were included were great Chilean wines. I was shocked to see all the top shelf booze that they provided. I was expecting your typical all-inclusive cheap no-name booze. I was thrilled to see Johnny Walker Black Scotch, Bombay Sapphire Gin, Absolute\/Stoli Vodka, Canadian Club...is goes on and on. The local beer Presidente is awesome, even a Bud Light if you wanted. The spa was great. I didnt get any services, but used the great Whirlpool and hot\/cold plunge pools\/steam rooms. Top notch all around.Our room was nice. Very large and a stocked mini-bar that we loved. Tons of bottled water, no issues with water at all. Im left scratching my head, wondering how they make any money with what we paid vs what we consumed. We paid about $675 USD for 2 people for 3 nights, and the flight was about $260 for direct non-stop from JFK on American Airlines. We booked on American Airlines vacations website. Check the various online booking sites to see who is the best. 3 hour flight from NYC was so easy and the bus ride was fine. I have been to some of the best hotels around the world, and I can say this place is the real deal. Any negative reviews are a sham and sour grapes. I was in a beer chugging contest on the Friday night..I clearly beat my opponent in the final round (after several early rounds) and on top of that, my opponent ran to the toilet to puke immediatly after finishing his beer, yet after all that the contest organizer awared the 1st place to him.....no idea??This place is great for couples..not so much for singles.
