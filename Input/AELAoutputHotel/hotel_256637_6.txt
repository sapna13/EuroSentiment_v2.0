{"text":"Abova beyond My wife and I spent a week in Sydey and booked this hotel with Starwood points. Positives:-Excellent location: literally in the center of the city; on Hyde park, walk to waterfront, Opera House, old part of the city, harbor bridge, aquarium and chinatown. 1-2 blocks to all shopping, in the center of the business district, so-so many restaurants to choose. 20 mins to Bondi beach and zoo.-Clean, Modern and Elegant: rooms were excellent size, very modern and clean, restaurants and bars in the hotel were top notch. Free high speed internet.-Staff were helpful, kind and curteous: exchange money at the desk w\/ no fee; provided maps, directions, tips for sightseeing.TRUE STORY: after a long day of touring (walking) we didnt want to leave the hotel, but really felt like eating chicken schnitzel (saw it while touring); the chef actually made it for us while the restaurant was still closed and served it at the bar so we could have a view of the park. on top of that, the chef customized the rest of the meal to our taste (chips, rocket salad). its not like we were VIP's- we booked with points!TRUE STORY: A bottle of water went missing from the mini-bar, and when we told them we didnt take it, they removed the charge without a fuss. (This actually happened to me with a lousy Snickers bar in Florida, and I had to see the manager about it!)Negatives:-Honestly, none. No kidding, my wife wants to move to Sydney now...
