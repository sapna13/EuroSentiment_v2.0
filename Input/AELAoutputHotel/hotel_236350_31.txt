{"text":"Wonderful stay - highly recommended This is a truly fantastic hotel with great service and a great location, just minutes from Piccadilly Circus and Trafalgar Square.The room was large and well furnished. The hallway of our room was larger than some hotel rooms in London! The room itself was spacious with a desk, couch, coffee table and very comfortable king sized bed with plenty of open floor space. The bathroom was also quite spacious, with a large stand up shower, plenty of counter space, numerous plush towels, robes, comfy slippers, a hair dryer and Hermes toiletries. There was enough room for a roll-away twin bed for our daughter, although we had brought our own portable crib for her. Which leads me to another great point about the Sofitel: excellent service. Upon arriving in the room, I asked that the roll-away bed be removed and that the mini-bar be emptied so that we could store food for our daughter there. Two separate people arrived to take care of each issue, each within 5 minutes of our arrival. They were quick and polite in doing their tasks. Additionally, later in our stay the stopper in our sink became stuck and would not drain - again, someone from maintenance was there to fix it within less than 5 minutes with speed and courtesy.The room was smartly designed with a single switch by the door that turned off all the lights and an electronic version of the do not disturb or service please sign - quite ingenious. Numerous other nice touches abounded √à√\u2020\u2022?umbrellas, good storage space, wireless internet, a flat screen TV, etc.We had dinner from room service one night during our stay and were pleasantly surprised by how good it was.
