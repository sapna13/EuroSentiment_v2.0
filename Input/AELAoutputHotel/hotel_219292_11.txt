{"text":"Wonderful Wyland! We stayed at the Wyland for 10 Days from November 18-27, we booked our room through their every third night free, free daily breakfast and free room upgrade special.We were very impressed with the modern decor and friendly staff. We checked in late and were given a free double upgrade. We had room 421, in the main tower above the lobby area. This room was on the top floor of this portion of the building, it was fairly quiet. It had a outdoor entrance overlooking the pool and front of the hotel, we also had a city view from our balcony overlooking Kuhio Ave. Our room was spacious with a king size bed, kitchenette, air conditioner and more than enough room for storage. The free breakfast included either a free coffee, tea, bottled water or POG juice as well a 1 free breakfast pastry. We found that it was enough to start our day, but neither of us are big breakfast eaters. The free internet access in the lobby was great, we usually used it in the morning so we rarely had to wait for a computer to free up. The lobby got pretty noisy in the evening because of the bar, but we were usually out or in our room so it didn't bother is at all.The main pool area is beautiful, the pool was a little cold, and the hot tub was not hot, but we rarely used it, so it wasn't a issue. There is also a saltwater pool in the second tower, but we didn't have time to check it out. The chill room was also a great touch, the massage chairs were great after a long day out.We had a rental car for the last three days of our trip so we used the valet parking, everything we read said that the valet fee was $25 a day, but we were only charged $18 a day with unlimited in and out service, so that was a nice surprise.Over all we were very happy with our stay and would recommend it to anyone.Anyone making complaints about this hotel obviously has unattainable standards and would probably complain about anywhere they stayed. Honolulu\/Waikiki is a small, highly populated city, the land is limited, so all rooms are on the smaller side, but who goes to Hawaii to hang out in their room? And anyone who lives in a major city will easily adjust to the outdoor noise, if you live in the suburbs you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l probably find it noisy. If room size, noise and crowds are an issue for you, may I suggest you look into one the other Islands.
