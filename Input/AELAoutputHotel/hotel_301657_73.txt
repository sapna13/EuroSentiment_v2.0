{"text":"Nothing but the best I've stayed twice at the Park Hotel Tokyo. The first time was ver recent to their oppening and I had a hard time with the taxi driver finding the place, but the second time (one year later) was smooth and with no problem (the first time I was there, they were still building the roads to get to the hotel, buit now everything is fine).What I like the most about this hotel, that I always recommed and I'm happy to see that jumped up to the second best choice in Tokyo for TripAdvisor users is):1) The location: is perfect, because at the ground floor you'll find the metro connections to almost anywhere worth a look in Tokyo2) The friendliest staff you can get (I've only been to another hotel in Tokyo besides this one, but the staff is just a 10\/10.3) The shows at night. Once you get to the hotel at night you'll find some show (piano playing, a chorus line, some music) at the ground floor. You can have a drink while watching the free show, and that's just perfect4) The japanese restaurant at the groun floor is as best as it gets. Please, try the shasimi if you're into raw fish because it's excellent.5) The place itself is awesome. The lobby is somewhere around the 40th level, and the look up to the hotel from the looby is breathtaking.6) The spa might not seem big but will do the job just prefectlyOn the downside is the size of the rooms that are quite small but who care when you plan to stay in them just to sleep. Besides, the views are just amazing.So, in all, it's the perfect hote in Tokyo for the price. I've been to another, more focussed on the western taste and didn't meet the expectation as well as the Park.
