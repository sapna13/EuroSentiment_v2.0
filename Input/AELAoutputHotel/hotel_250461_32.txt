{"text":"Great Hotel for Tourism Jolly Hotel Vivaldi is part of a well respected Italian chain of worldwide hotels. In Berlin, the hotel is a perfect choice for tourists. The rooms are large and well maintained, with turndown service at night. My only complaint with the room was the shower \/ tub combo did not have a shower door or curtain, rather a small glass partition which allowed water to splash all over the bathroom floor. This problem I have seen througout Europe in other countries, so Europeans must know how to take a shower without spraying water all over the place (I assume).The concierge staff was very helpful and spoke many languages, including English, German and Italian. The location is perfect, with the Unter Den Linden and Brandenberg Gate within walking distance in one direction from the hotel, and the Museum Island including the Pergamon Museum (my favorite) in the other direction. Also if you continue past the Museum Island on foot, you will come to the Hackensemarket area which has a glut of trendy restaurants and lounges within the yuppiefied Mitte district. It is a perfect way to start out your night with a good meal and maybe some live music. The Hotel is across the street from the Friedrichstrasse S and U Bahn station, making it perfect to get around the city. Plus if you want to take a trip out of town (such as to Dresden or Prague) there is a Deuteche Bahn office in the Friedrichstrasse station as well.Overall an excellent stay over the New Years celebrations in Berlin and I would definitely stay there again. It lives up to the American standard of hotels such as Marriott and Hilton. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":29,"mention":"Jolly","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Jolly_Cola"],"startOffset":24}]}
