{"text":"Really Relaxing Very nice hotel and grounds. I found it to be very clean and never saw a bug anywhere. The beach was so beautiful and relaxing. We spent most of our time at the beach and in the ocean. The ocean was warmer and quieter than the pool. The pool area is loud and has many activities. I went there to relax so I found it very annoying, but my husband enjoyed it since he doesn't like to sit around. I found the food to be not so great. There were many choices, but I believe that they catered more to European taste.By the end of our week stay I was really ready for healthy food at home. Definitely not for the low calorie diet. I came home with a flu bug and my husband with a rash. We both went to the doctor when we got home and were told it was from the food. Our biggest gripe was that every time we called for bottle water, towels, a pillow, etc. they never came. One day we called for extra towels and waited 2 hours then went to dinner and asked the front desk again and then went back after dinner and called again because they never came and still never got them. If you want anything to your room... get it yourself from a maid standAlso we had a broken lock on our slider to our patio and asked several times at the front desk and they never came. I enjoyed my relaxing time on the beach, but would not go back. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":25,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":21}]}
