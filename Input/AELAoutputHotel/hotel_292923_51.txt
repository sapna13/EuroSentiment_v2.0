{"text":"Pleasantly Surprised After reading the reviews we were a little concerned with the booking we had already made at Oaks Maestri Towers. A friend and I stayed there for two nights 11-13th December. We called prior to arriving, requesting a high room, with a view. We also mentioned it on checking in. We were pleasantly suprised when we entered our 2 bedroom apartment on the 21st floor. On the ground floor was a toilet and hand basin, and an open plan living area, with a good sized kitchen, lounge and dining area. There were full length windows that looked out over Darling Harbour. The balcony was only small but sufficient. As we are both smokers it was imperitive that we had somewhere to smoke that didn't mean we had to leave the building. The downside was that there was no table on the balcony, only a couple of chairs, but because we were so delighted with the room, we didn't worry about it. Even though on the 21st floor it was still a little noisy outside on the balcony, but very quiet inside the apartment with the doors closed. On the next level were two bedrooms, the master one had a king size bed with an ensuite that included a bath. The second bedroom had twin beds, and there was also quite a large bathroom. It was all very clean and in good condition. The lifts were fast, although we initially had some trouble operating them with the keycard, and there was one in particular that didn't seem to want to work for us at all, so we tended to use the second one. We found the staff very helpful and friendly. We also used the hairdresser across the road which we really have to recommend. It's called the Shooting Star and we both booked in for a wash and blow wave prior to going out for a dinner engagement. The head massage we got, while our hair was being washed, was worth the $30 alone, let alone having a blow wave afterwards! If I go back to Sydney I'll be going back there just for another head massage! Would highly recommend the Oaks Maestri Towers, but I do think making a point of requesting a high room is paramount.
