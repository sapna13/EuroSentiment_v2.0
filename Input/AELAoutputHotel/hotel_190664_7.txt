{"text":"A lovely gem After a 30 hour flight I have to confess to a tiny bit of initital disappointment with the Regent. I had read that you should request a room with a view over the Gendarmenmarkt. I emailed and phoned the hotel to request such a room, but when i arrived I was told my room was not in the right price bracket to have such a view. It would have been helpful if someone had replied to my email to let me know this, rather than disappoint me at check in. The room I was given was pleasant - it had at least a partial view of the Gendarmenmarkt, but it was a bit tired - 1980s sage green carpet, pale apricot walls and gold taps in the bathroom. (One other quibble which I will put now so as not to end on a negative note - outrageously expensive computer access - I wish hotels would learn that the what they reap in profit on this, they must lose in annoyed guests.) Once I had a decent night sleep though I could begin to appreciate the Regent's other benefits and I forgave them for the decor. The Regent is in a fabulous location - on a quiet side street in the old Eastern bloc - perfectly located within walking distance of all the major sightseeing centres. I had worried that this part of town was a little removed from the heart of the city - the Kurfurstendam - but after visting that side of town I felt that we had definitely made the right location decision. The Regent is walking distance to the Brnadenburg Gate, to Checkpoint Charlie, to all the major galleries and museums. There is the Galleries Lafayette across the street and several beautiful high end boutiques minutes from the hotel. The service in the hotel was very impressive - complimentary shoe shine each night; a book mark left on a book we were reading; bowls of chocolates left every day and a box of chocolates left as a farewell gift. The doorman was particularly friendly and it was a pleasure to come back to the hotel at the end of each day. It is a relatively small hotel so the overall feel is one of calmness and tranquility.
