{"text":"Second time in Palace Yes we had a great time at the palace, was ore seconde time.You will finde a quiet resort this time of the year (was same last year in Sept.)At the beach you will have for each 20 seats, same at the pool site.Between 2 and 16 Sept. we had 30 minuts rain on the beach and 30 minutes during one excursion.Food: very good lots off choice on the buffet, and there are more places toe eat tryout La Pina on the beach.Service: we hade a problem with safe, went to PR. and problem was solved in 15 minutes.PR. sits in reception area she is dressed in red, easy to find.Room: ask for block 5 or 6 the are very quiet, newer and close to the beach.If you miss a towel or whatever in the room ask the cleaning lady you find them whole day working in your block.Mini bar filled every day.Cleaning room√à√\u2020\u2022?.I give 8\/10.Beach√à√\u2020\u2022? You want belief what you are seeing, and very clean, water is warm if there is not to much wind, bring snorkel whit you.Getting sick:I know you can get sick from tap water.If you get sick of the food it das not mean that the food is bad, it means that your stomach or intestines are not used to the food at your vacation country. People do eat things on vacation that the not eat at home becors the want to try it, and mostly the eat to much of it.Same problem with drinks I never have coconut at home , in DC we drink gallons of it together with other drinks.Think also about the ice cubes, the fruit ,snack, the temperature, climate etcetera......My wife is sick every year for 2 or 3 days wherever we go on vacation,she has week intestines. So don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ blame always your hotel.Of course if the hotel serves only tomato with sprout and you have to eat it for 2 weeks you will get sick.My advice, eat everything the serve but eat or drink not too much and do not get stressed, stress works on your stomach.Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mind my writing errors, English is not my mother tongue (its Dutch) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":21,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":15},{"endOffset":59,"mention":"palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":53},{"endOffset":59,"mention":"palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":53},{"endOffset":59,"mention":"palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":53}]}
