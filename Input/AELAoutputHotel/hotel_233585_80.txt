{"text":"Friendly hotel in a fantastic location We booked the Hotel Duquesne Eiffel for a wedding anniversary long weekend. Having realised the transport strike was in full swing we thought this might put a downer on our trip but it wasn't a problem at all. We got the bus from CDG airport to the Arc de Triumph (13 euros each) and with a half decent map we walked the rest of the way which took about 25mins and was very easy.On arrival at the hotel we were given our key to room 46, a superior room, and some local information, mini bar pricelist etc. The room was pleasantly decorated in lemon and blue with french windows that opened inward to reveal a fantastic view of the Eiffel Tower. The bathroom was spotles with a 3\/4 bath and great shower. Good hairdryer too which is quite unusual for hotels. There was also a french window in the bathroom too. The double bed was very comfortable and the heating was very good too, which was a god send because on the sat and sun the weather was very very cold. There were some markings on the wallpaper particularly where the cases would go but overall the room was very clean and tidy and not too small either.Beer in Paris is very expensive. Bottles are 25cl and in the bars cost around √ä√£¬¢3.50gbp and around double for 50cl. Heineken seems to be the popular brand. The prices in the hotel mini bar were probably as cheap as u would find, 25cl bottle of Heineken being around √ä√£¬¢2 a bottle. We didnt eat breakfast in the hotel, We did try the breakfast at the Ecole Militere brasserie down the street which consisted of orange juice, large coffee, french bread and either fried egg with cold ham or scrambled eggs. The cost was around 8 euros. There are lots of cafes and restaurants around the area. We ate at the champ de mars which was very good. There is a great hot food stall, next to the carousel by the Eiffel tower. The hot dogs and fries are delicious.Paris is very easy to get around. All the streets are well signposted and you can literally walk anywhere, weather permitting. The ecole militere metro is a couple of minutes walk down the road if you want to take the tube.All in all we had a lovely time. Paris is a lovely city with lots to offer, and the staff at the hotel Duquesne Eiffel are very helpful and friendly, and for a 3* property, pre refurbishment, i rate it highly. I will definately be returning to both Paris and the Duquesne Eiffel as soon as i can ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1278,"mention":"Heineken","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken_Premium_Light","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken"],"startOffset":1270},{"endOffset":1278,"mention":"Heineken","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken_Premium_Light","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken"],"startOffset":1270},{"endOffset":1278,"mention":"Heineken","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken_Premium_Light","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken"],"startOffset":1270},{"endOffset":1406,"mention":"Heineken","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken_Premium_Light","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken"],"startOffset":1398},{"endOffset":1406,"mention":"Heineken","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken_Premium_Light","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Heineken"],"startOffset":1398},{"endOffset":1593,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1587},{"endOffset":1607,"mention":"french bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Baguette"],"startOffset":1595},{"endOffset":1884,"mention":"hot dogs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_dog"],"startOffset":1876},{"endOffset":1894,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":1889}]}
