{"text":"Very pleasant resort - Food below average This resort is clean and peaceful, nice landscape, huge pools with nice beach towels. (there is a resort fee\/day that is not included in your initial booking price)We had a room in the east wing with partial ocean view which we did not request and were happy to get.Corridor rooms to go the your bedroom looks old but bedroom itself is clean and very nice appointed. Large screen TV, good bed and linens. Bedroom and bathroom has tiles so it really clean. We were given extra towels every night.No need to buy internet connection, as it is free wifi in the lobby (they also a free internet cafe) which you can also get in the patio or in your room if you are facing or close to the lobby (if not you can buy a connection in your room).Staff is very courteous.Casino is small but will entertain enough if you like this sort of games.The only negative side of this hotel is clearly the food, but my husband and I came to the conclusion that it's not only in the hotel but Puerto Rico itself.At the hotel food is way overpriced but that's usually the case in hotels. The problem is there was nothing good at all. The little shop by the casino were providing much better sandwhich or yogurts and fruits than any other restaurant\/cafe at the hotel.Lunch : salads at SeaBreeze are fine - no stomach problems, Burgers or fruit plates at Tiki Bar by the beach as well.Someone mention Richies (a restaurant outside the hotel) it's all frozen food and it did not tasted any good. We all got sick ! The view is wonderfull though.The restaurant at the country club was a joke but very well maintenaned.Lats thing : do bring a lot of spray or cream to protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially in the evening.Overall a very pleasant stay, but next time I'll bring some food, or I'll know how to dine on a fruit diet.
