{"text":"Great lovely hotel, Great location, Highly recommended We are just back from our trip to Italy, This was our third time in Italy, since I love this country, I chose Hotel Londra because of good reviews I read in Tripadvisor and for it's closeness to the train station and all city attractions. Hotel Londra in Florence is a very good hotel, near the main train station (Santa Maria Novella).We had asked for a triple room, Our room was a very comfortable one with clean and comfortable beds and a modern and clean bath, you could make tee or coffee in the room with diferent choices of tee and cofees put in the room free of charge.you could also have access to high speed internet either in your room or in the lobby, of cource free of charge. Front desk staff were very kind and friendly and they spoke a fluent English, They were very helpful. the guy who first showed us to our room spoke fluent English and was a very knowledgable man. The breakfast was great and contained all what you could expect from bacon and eggs, good sausages, ham and cheese to fresh fruits...And last but not the least, The location was convenient to visit the historical center by foot. we saw all the wonderful beauties of Florence by foot. To go to Pisa you only had a short walk to the train station and you find yourself at the foot of the leaning tower. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe got a great holiday and I want to return in Florence√à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ fantastic! I highly recommend this hotel to all those who want to have an unforgettable stay in the lovely city of Florence.
