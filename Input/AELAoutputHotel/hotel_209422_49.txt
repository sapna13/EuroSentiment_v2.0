{"text":"NIce looking hotel, but I couldn't sleep We stayed at the Hilton Prince Kuhio for our first night in Hawaii after landing at the Honolulu airport. We arrived late, and the valets seemed busy (as they did at all times during the stay) but accommodated us.Check-in was smooth and polite, the lobby decor was very nice, but the elevator and the hallways to the rooms were hot. Inside the room, the decor was very nice although the room was smaller than I had expected. It would appear that the air conditioning runs on a motion sensor, so the room was very hot as well. I cranked the A\/C as high as it would go.I hadn't slept at all on the plane, was tired and ready for some shuteye. Unfortunately the A\/C took several hours to catch up to what I would consider a reasonable sleeping temperature, and the smoke detector flashed every 60 seconds or so, lighting up the room with a strobe-like quality.After a night of barely sleeping, I woke up and had a shower. I'm 6'5 and banged my head on the shower ceiling, but I suspect this wouldn't be an issue for most people.The best part of the room is the TV. As mentioned by others, it is a big beautiful LCD that is recessed into the wall. This is the only hotel I've ever seen where the hotel TV system actually runs in high definition with several local and satellite channels in HD. They also have a panel beside the desk where you can plug in your own computer or DVD player (VGA, DVI, Component Inputs plus 8mm audio jack). I travel alot, and this is the best hotel TV system I've come across.In summary, the Hilton Prince Kuhio is a very nice hotel with modern decor. It is located a very short walk from Waikiki beach. My wife liked it, but the bottom line for me is if a hotel can't manage to get me to sleep then it's not a good hotel. I will not personally be going back.
