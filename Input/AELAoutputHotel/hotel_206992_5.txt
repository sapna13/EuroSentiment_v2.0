{"text":"Good value for money After much trawling the web looking at various hotels and not knowing Madrid at all, I was really pleased with having chosen this hotel. It is very central and withing walking distance of loads of places you are likely to want to visit. It is situated right beside the Sol metro station but on a pedestrian street. The double glazing on the windows is excellent and our room was incredibly quiet in terms of outside street noise. We did however hear the people in the next room laughing and talking but they were being quite loud and it was only a one-off so it didn't bother us. The staff were helpful and the reception was open 24 hours so you could come and go when you liked. We didn't have breakfast there but just got something at various local cafes. The hotel is in a really good location in terms of tapas bars and restaurants with a good selection just a 5 or 10 minute walk away and if you feel like bit of clubbing, the Madrid Club, Joy, is just a shimmy away in the same street. The famous Labra bar where the Spanish Socialist movement was started, is directly behind the hotel and well worth a visit. The room itself was just what you need - not overly luxurious but not totally functional either. Nicely decorated with fresh towels and beds made up each day. Hairdryer in room, along with bath and shower products. No mini bar or tea\/coffee making equipment in our room however. Highlight for me has got to be the hydromassage whirlpool bath. Mmm, bliss after a hard day's pounding the Madrid streets.
