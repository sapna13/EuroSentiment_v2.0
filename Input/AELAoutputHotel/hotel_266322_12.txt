{"text":"Mid Century Modern Desert Oasis The Clarendon hotel perfectly embodies the desert modern aesthetic that I miss so much about Arizona and (parts of) California. I lived in Arizona for seven years before moving to New York City and then Boston. I still come to Arizona for business and when I do I stay at the Clarendon. I wish we had something like this on the east coast. The decor is modern and in perfect harmony with the surroundings; it all just feels right. The rooms are well-appointed and comfortable and it's the nice touches like the big flat-screen televisions, the comfortable beds, the very creative and artistic curtains and the quirky selection of snacks in the rooms that make this place really stand out.In addition, I think this has to be the best value in Phoenix. Not only is it fun and unique but the prices are extremely competitive and they're centrally located; close to everything! On top of this, the pool and water wall and lighting are simply amazing. It sets a tone that cannot be beat. I haven't been to the hotel since the opening of the roof top bar area, but the bar and restaurant at the lobby level are also very awesome. This is the type of place where you want people to meet you because it is simply beautiful and your friends will think you have great taste. Admittedly this hotel may not be for everyone, but if you are a fan of Dwell or DWR this is the place to be in Arizona.
