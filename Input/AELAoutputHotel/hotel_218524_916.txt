{"text":"A VERY Relaxing Resort Stayed at the Excellence from the 4th of August until the 14th. Overall a very nice and relaxing resort... The staff really are amazing and will go out of their way to help you out. Being that my wife and I usually stay at 5 star resorts, we were not too impressed with the food though the Filet Mignon at the Grill was awesome ....If your looking for a party place... this is not the resort for you... if your looking for a beautiful relaxing holiday, with no spring breakers to jump cannon balls in your face all day... this place is perfect. I like to jump the odd cannon ball here and there so this was a small letdown ... :-)While here, we shopped a little at the huts on the beach... look for  Daniel Boon ... he has some great deals... Tell him Mike from Canada sent you and he will know that you can't be ripped off... Daniel asked me to send him some leather flip flops so if anyone is going.. I am sure he would so appreciate this... (size 10) he is a very hard working nice young man !!Overall a great place to travel though 10 days of relaxation started to wear me out... I prefer the option of partying off the resort once in a while so Mexico it will be next time. Christina and Rob for NJ - Enjoyed our time with both of you.... send pics soon..... and Rob - watch out for that BRUGAL Eh !!!!Mike ","annotations":[{"endOffset":106,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":102},{"endOffset":1007,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1003},{"endOffset":1007,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1003}]}
