{"text":"Beautiful Resort My husband and our 2 kids (4 and 7 years old) stayed at the Bahia Principe from August 6-13, 2006. We usually travel for 2 weeks and regreted that we only stayed at this resort for only 1week. We had the Club Diamond Package and we were very pleased with the services. We had the check-in on the bus on the way to the resort and that saved a lot of time, as many people were on the bus with us. Our room was big with 2 double beds and a sofa. The room was located in the centre of the resort, villa 31 111. We were close to one of the 3 pools. The resort is huge and is very clean. They do have buses that come every 1 minute through the resort. Thank god, because the weather is hot and with small kids, is hard to walk a lot. Every night we had clean beach towels and chocolate delivered to our room. We were very surprised, as we never had that anywhere else. We didn't have any beach towel cards, as later we found out, other guests had. There are different packages, like premier, hacienda, gold and diamond(which we had) and the services are different. We talked to a family that stayed in the same villa as us and they never received any chocolates. The big pool is very crowded and you need to get there early to get lounge chairs. We stayed at the pool close to our villa which was great because it was reserved only for the club diamond and hacienda guests. The beach is beautiful, the water is nice, but with some seaweeds. We had a lot of waves and wind and our boys preferred the pool better. The buffet restaurant is big and has a lot of variety foods. We didn't have any problems, or get sick. We were very pleased with the food and the service. We had 3 reservations at the A la Carte restaurants. The Italian restaurant wasn't that great. The service was very slow, for some reason. We waited one hour before our soups were served. Our kids ordered a pizza with cheese and ham and received pizza with spinach and salmon. The server appologized and told us to wait 10 more minutes for another pizza but the second one was a pita stuffed with ham and cheese. My husband ordered pork which he didn't like. I ordered the chef's special, lobster, which was pretty good. The French restaurant was amazing. We had the fillet menion, and chicken for the kids. The service was great and the food was very good. The Medeterranian restaurant was good as well. The service was great and the food was also good. The evening entertainment was a bit boring. The kids shows were ok from 8pm-9pm., but the adult shows from 9:45pm-10:30pm were not that great. We will definetly return to this resort because of its cleaness, and friendly staff.
