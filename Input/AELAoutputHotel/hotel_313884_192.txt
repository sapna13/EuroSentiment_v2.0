{"text":"how about english as a 2nd language Where do I begin......Well besides being bumped off our flight from JFK and losing our luggage for three days, after day 3 it was ok for my first all inclusive trip.Suggestion................................My suggestion would be to have the hotel assign a person to help guests (BILINGUAL WOULD BE A PLUS) for special situations like arriving at the hotel with no luggage. I do understand that it is not the fault of the resort, but alittle compasion goes along way. Possible have a LOST LUGGAGE WELCOME BAG which could possible include toothbrush\/toothpaste, deordorant, razors and maybe a couple of tee shirts (with Punta Cana Princess advertising of course). After travelling ALL DAY and checking in with no bags, we ended up going into the Gift Shop and purchasing 2 toothbrushes, a small tube of paste, 2 razors and a small thing of deordorant and it cost us $26.00. Since the front desk could not help with our baggage situation, I had to contact AA bagage claim in Punta Cana. This venture involved purchasing telephone cards and paying $2.00 for a outside line every time I made a local call. Fifteen calls later (@ $2.00 a call = $30. + the two telephone cards at $10) , I finally was able to locate my luggage and it was delivered Tuesday morning. Other than that, beaches were beautiful, service was good, food, well that's a whole nuther story. They should also hire an entertainment director. We shuttled over to the sister hotel for that cuz ours wasn't too great.The room was beautiful. Never saw the gym or jacuzzi (probably someone at the front desk could have mentioned it at check in).ALSO....never new there was a refrigerator in the room until day 4. (oops....something else for that front desk to do).All in all, a good trip. Probably would go back to Punta Cana but would try another resort. ","annotations":[]}
