{"text":"Location, Location, Location If you want easy access to the hottest attractions in New York and a great hotel into the bargain then The Hilton Times Square is a great option. The front of the hotel is very unassuming and you could walk right past it if you weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ looking for it. You check in to your room on the 21st floor (I think) as the first 20 floors are occupied by the movie theatre next door. This hotel is always busy and I found it difficult to get a room with a great view, but for the amount of time you will spend in your room it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really matter what your hotel looks onto, as long as it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ offend. The reception staff is not the best that I have ever encountered nor are they the worst. I found the room to be spacious in comparison to other New York hotels. My advice is to book your room on the Hilton website where if you are willing to pay for your stay up front without chance of refund you can get greatly reduced prices and even a better room cheaper than most of the online travel websites. In New York, you only spend sleeping time in your room so there is not much more I can say about the hotel as I was out all day and all night, like the city, never stopping. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother with eating at the hotel, there are too many other places to go, but avoid ROXY√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©? diner at all costs √à√\u2020\u2022?expensive for not much and they are very rude about tipping. Also, steer clear of using super shuttle for a transfer to the hotel, one of the worst experiences of my life. The bundle people in a tiny van and chuck your luggage about and are rude about it. If you, like me, love the theatre and are not worried about where you sit you can get greatly reduced tickets from TKTS, which used to be located in Times Square and has moved temporarily next to the Marriott Courtyard across from the Amsterdam Theatre. Also, for the most sought after tickets you can enter a lottery outside the theatre. For example Wicked does a lottery, which you enter at 5:30pm and is drawn at 6:30pm. You can reserve 2 tickets and if you win, they are only $25 each for front row. Even if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ win you can chat others waiting and the atmosphere can be quite fun. Note: I tried 5 days in a row and no win, so don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ waste your time if you are a pessimist. Anyway, I hope you found this helpful and remember if you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care where you stay don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pay through the nose for this hotel, there a few other budget hotels round about. Keep your money for shopping. ","annotations":[]}
