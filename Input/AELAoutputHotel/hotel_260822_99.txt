{"text":"Perfect stay at Perseo We stayed at Il Perseo at the end of our two week stay in Italy. While it was not Italian in decor it was such a great surprise. The hotel was recently renovated and everything is new in the rooms and bathrooms. I loved the soothing and modern color schemes. While it was the least expensive hotel we stayed in (140E\/nt) it had the BEST beds. Very comfortable. Also great to have wireless internet in rooms and the flat screen with at least two english channels (BBC and CNN International) was so appreciated. The bathrooms are small, but they make the most of the room with decent shelf space and it is so clean. The internet pictures on hotel website are accurate.The owner is a delighful woman and everyone who worked there was very helpful and friendly. They made museum reservations for us through email before our arrival. The location down the street from the Duomo, as many have reported, is just the best. So convenient to everything. We never needed a cab. I'm almost afraid to give this such a glowing review, because when I first made our reservation about a year ago, this was a little known gem and now it is near the top of trip advisor and I'm guessing prices will rise. The ONLY problem we had was on arrival -- we had a rental car and thought we could drive up to hotel, unload our bags and then take car back. This was not possible; the street is so busy and no place to park, although our cab that brought us back just double parked and unloaded us, we just didn't have enough time to do that and check-in!
