{"text":"Please don't stay in this hotel!!!!!!! The facilities are not bad. The service is terrible specially for those paying with US dollars. Europeans have a different treatment. The food is horrible and boring. They repeat the same menu day after day. If what you have in mind is to have a taste of Dominican food you may forget it. Turkey and mashed potatoes with some mediocre sauces is all what you are going to see. The restaurants are awful and it's a hassle to make a reservation in any of them. Lobster is not included, you have to pay 35 dollars per person to eat one lobster, and shrimps are not even known there. On the other hand, there is a constant harrassment everywhere you go. If you walk through the lobby, some hotel staff people would try to sell you a package for next time, and no matter how strict you are in telling them you are not interested, they will keep bugging you until the moment you are finally and happily getting the heck out of there. If you go to the beach, the entertainment staff won't leave alone not even for a minute, they want you to dance, to play games, there is not peace in that place. If you try to walk somehwere else you will run into someone else trying to sell you something. I had a horrible experience. I saw people as sad and disappointed as I was. I really discourage any of you to visit this hotel. If you have a family keep in mind this is a topless pool- beach hotel. ","annotations":[]}
