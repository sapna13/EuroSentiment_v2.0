{"text":"Very nice resort Went for a 4 night weekend on Jan. 17th. Was skeptical after reading some of the reviews on here, but I was pleasantly surprised. Granted, the food was in fact expensive, but that should be expected for a resort like this. Seems people are expecting Applebee's prices at a 5-star resort, not going to happen. Regardless, we found ways around this thanks to many helpful reviews on this site.The first thing we did was rent a car at the airport. As many posters have mentioned, this is a MUST. We got a car on travelocity for $98 for four days. Trust me, you will end up paying more in cab \/ shuttle fees if you don't rent a car. The one thing I didn't like was the PR drivers, they are the worst Ive ever seen. Be careful. After renting the car, we stopped on Rte. 3 at Amigo's, which is a grocery store like any other in the states. Ended up getting breakfast, snacks  beer for four days - bext decision we made. We would have paid out the ear for food at the hotel.Upon arrival we were treated nicely by the staff  checked in right away. We didn't get an upgrade because we booked through a thrid party, but they did give us a room with a King bed and partial ocean view which was nice. I highly recommend booking through skyauction.com - we ended up getting the room for $170 per night (includes all taxes  fees), which is about 50% off the rate on orbitz or travelocity. The only thing I didn't like was teh parking - it was $15 per overnight stay, but you have to get the ticket validated at valet each time you leave the garage.Another thing to be aware of is the fact that it rains a lot in PR. It rained the first day, so we ended up going to the El Yunque rainforest that day which was great. Again, you'll need a car to get there unless you want to pay the resort about $40 or so to take you there. The trails  sights are free if you have a car. Be sure to check out the La Mina falls - take the Big Tree trail to get there.The second day was clear outside, so we did a snorkel trip. This was the hilight of the trip. I recommend going on the spread eagle II trip (do an internet search for spread eagle puerto rico). It is lesser known than many of the other snorkel boats there, as was in evidence that day. We had about 25 people on a huge catamaran, while many other boats out that day were packed with what looked like 60 or more. The cost is $75 per person and includes snorkel gear and an all you can eat lunch. Best value on the trip. They take you to a secluded island off the east coast, and tropical fish eat out of your hand. It was great. Again, you'll need a car to get there as it is about 15 miles from the resort. The resort can take you snorkeling, but it will cost you a fortune.We hung out at the resort on day 3, and it was great. The beach is nice but don't expect a white sand beach of say Aruba. It was nice nonetheless, and the water was clear  warm. Also, the resort grounds are as people here describe - picture perfect.As for food, we ate at many of the restaurants folks here mentioned. Richie's is a must, but go just before sundown for an amazing sunset view. We also went into Old San Juan one day which was nice, reminded me of the French Quarter in N.O. a bit, but hilly like San Fran.Overall, I would highly recommend this place, but go in knowing that if you plan to eat at the hotel, it will be $$$. And don't play the slots in the casino - they don't pay.
