{"text":"Lagoon Tower I am a Hilton Grand Vacation timeshare owner. This was my first trip using my points which was very simple to book the stay. We stayed seven days at the Lagoon Tower. Employees were very nice and helpful at all times. They had a lot of activity and tour information available for the island of O'ahu at the concierge desk. They personally called the places and helped you schedule your tours. We did the O'ahu Nature tours. They have about 12 to choose from, but we choose to do only 3. They take you to the best places in O'ahu and give you a lot of information about the island. We visited the most beautiful beaches, waterfalls, gardens and views there is to see. Since we had an idea of what the island consisted of we used our free days to do our own sight seeing. we rented a car and revisited Lanikai Beach, the best beach in O'ahu. Very private and the sun rises in between two tiny islands. Upon our arrival we went straight to walmart and bought plenty of snacks, drinks, wine, beer, etc. Since the room had all the essentials needed to cook, we had dinner at our patio that overlooked the beach. We watched the sun set every night. There is a great place to have breakfast called Eggs and Things. It is about a block away from the Hilton and the portions are Large. Both times we went we shared our entree and had plenty of left overs. I am looking forward to future trips. ","annotations":[]}
