{"text":"As Always Excellent Stayed here in Nov 2007 and returned again for my birthday last week. This is now my third stay here.Three of us in one room. I have not been the one to stay in the extra bed but my friend who did said it was very comfortable. Rooms at front of hotel overlook the main road and have lovely little balconys so I suggest if you don't want to be woken by the school as I have read in other reviews you ask for a room at the front of the hotel.The hotel staff are very accomodating and friendly. As it was my birthday whilst I was there, my mum contacted the hotel arranged for a bouquet of flowers to be delivered to me. The hotel arranged everything and got a beautiful bouquet from a florist on Las Ramblas, even packaging them up for me with so that I could take them home on the plane, rather than leave them behind. Couldn't have asked for anything more. Flowers were stunning and the housekeeper did an excellent job of sorting a pot\/water etc for their journey home. Bottle water is provided free - they even sent a large bottle to our rom at 4am one morning on our return from our night out and did not charge which we were pleasently surprised about.I recommed you book the breakfast in advance for 8euros as this cannot be faulted.Will only ever stay here when visiting Barcelona and I recommend to many people. Excellent hotel, location great and the staff are very helpful - all for a price I feel is good value comared to other hotels in Barcelona. ","annotations":[]}
