{"text":"Shuttle-Great Perk! I booked this hotel for an overnight get-away with my best friend arriving from Victoria, BC on the Victoria Clipper ferry. I live in Calgary and searched for hotels that were reasonably priced, clean, safe  near the Pier 69 where the Clipper arrives, which is actually 6 blocks from the Space Needle. I was quoted $135 US which was their discount rate by booking on their own website.With 2 ladies traveling alone, the complimentary shuttle to downtown was such a bonus since it was safer than taking cabs. I had asked about shuttles at most places I inquired as this would save us lots of money and Francisco, our driver, was so very helpful and friendly! It doesn't mention the shuttle on their website, which I believe is such a wonderful bonus and it should be listed. The main Comfort Inns reservations line didn't know if it had a shuttle and we also asked if they had in-room hair dryers - to both, they said No when actually it was true. The reservation lady offered to have her supervisor call the hotel directly to inquire about the shuttle and they quickly found out that it was available but that it wasn't advertised on their site. TIP - book your shuttle times in advance as we missed out the next morning to have one take us downtown for shopping (wasn't free until late aft. when we were leaving) and took a cab instead as it's on a appointment-basis only every 1\/2 hour until 8 pm at night. This saved us $ by not booking a hotel in the expensive areas of town by the Pier so it was well worth it.Our room had 2 queen beds on the 2nd floor overlooking the roadway (last room past the ice). With the window open, it was noisy but the glass was so thick that we didn't hear any road noise at all. The microwave and fridge hidden in the TV armoire was a nice touch too. The bathroom was very nice with amenities and the offer of free toiletries is thoughtful as well. The continental breakfast with waffles, cereals, oatmeal, lots of beverages etc. was such a nice change from the usual muffins  fruit! My friend and I definitely enjoyed our stay at the hotel and didn't see everything in one day (love the free transit area downtown) although Pike Place Market (6th floor is the best with the most gorgeous, affordable flowers  the Pike Place Pub downstairs was great-order the halibut  chips and wash it down with their own brewed beers) is a definite must-see as well as Space Needle of course (TIP-found great tourist t-shirts for $5 in front of the Space Needle)! Next time I go to Seattle to see the great Seahawks or shop at Victoria's Secret (not in Canada-pity!), I will definitely stay at the Comfort Inn and Suites in the Emerald City!
