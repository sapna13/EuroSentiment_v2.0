{"text":"Great Family Vacation! My family just returned from a week at the Copamarina. This is the first time I am writing a review on trip advisor, largely because I chose the property based on trip advisor reviews. I hope this is helpful. Also, I travel a lot for business and have stayed at many outstanding resorts, so I think I'm a pretty good judge of things.The Copamarina was a great choice for us -- my wife, 10 year-old son, and 6 year-old daughter. It is a beautiful property with grounds that are immaculately maintained and located in a visually stunning part of Puerto Rico. We have stayed on more exotic islands and this area in SW PR rivaled many of those places. We are an active family. My kids are outstanding swimmers and athletes, and we were active the entire time with great activities. Obviously, with young children, their enjoyment largely dictates the quality of the vacation. They never wanted to leave the resort! We did not do the all-inclusive, though next time we will. The area around the hotel, after the beautiful forest ends, is largely poor and there are not many good restaurants. The food at the property restaurants was good, and sometimes very good, but not great. But certainly much better than anything else around. How good? One night, the former Governor of PR sat at the table next to us. I assume that means its OK!Part of what makes this place great are the people that work there. The staff( Wilmer, Irving, JJ, Lisbeth, Rosa, etc.) are amazing and made us and our kids feel totally at home. Meet these people and befreind them -- they added so much to our experience! The activities are something off of the Discovery Channel. The pools are beautiful and inviting. Also, of major importance to us, the beach stays very shallow for like 50 yards out, which is a total stress releiver when traveling with a 6 year old. A lot of how much you like a vacation is about expectations. So to level set yours about the Copamarina -- it is not a super luxury hotel in any sense of the word. It's funny -- I almost don't want to say too much and make this place too popular! But I want to be honest, because trip advisor helped us out. If you're looking for a Four Seasons experience, you will be disappointed. There was a couple there who were bemoaning that it wasn't nearly as nice as Fiji or Hawaii. Duh, it's Puerto Rico! But if you are an easy going family looking for a fun week in a beautiful caribean resort, you'll dig this place.
