{"text":"Wonderful Hotel Library My husband and I visited New York for a week in mid-July for his birthday, and to see the New York's Art Commission's Waterfall exhibit.After investigating many sites and collecting a lot of information, including reviews from TripAdvisor's travelers, we decided on The Library Hotel for its location, east midtown Manhattan, just two blocks from Grand Central Station, great restaurants and ambience, as well as convenience for the subway.After reviewing the Library Hotel's website, I called their hotel directly to book the type of room and location I wanted, and to have any questions that I may have had answered right away.The Library Hotel has a theme of a library, hence the name, and each floor has a subject; ours was Philosophy. Books were everywhere, and we wished we had much more time to enjoy the hotel's facilities.The staff at The Library Hotel were outstanding, wanting to help us with maps, restaurant reservations, etc. and even though we had done a lot of research ourselves and had our time in New York planned out, they made it very easy to accomplish everything we wanted to do - especially, as we were there during the 98 - 102 degree heatwave. We travel a lot, and the staff in this city hotel made all the difference to our stay.We booked a queen size room, on an upper floor, which was beautifully appointed, and the bathroom had a tub\/shower combination, which the tub was really appreciated after pounding the concrete streets all day in 100 degree heat. Whilst the room was not overly large, we were very comfortable, and the air conditioning responded instantly to our wishes.Included in the price of the room was breakfast, which, whilst no hot food was provided, was excellent and filling with a large variety to choose from.From 5:00 p.m. - 8:00 p.m. complimentary wine and cheese was served, and you could help yourself to as much as you wanted.There were two rooftop patio-bars, which looked lovely, but we never had the time to sit and enjoy them.Madison and Vine is a new bistro attached but separate on the ground floor of the Library Hotel, and we had read mixed reviews about it, but we had dinner there the night we arrived in New York, and had excellent service and food.I would certainly stay at the Library Hotel again, for its location, facilities, and wonderful and helpfull staff.J.
