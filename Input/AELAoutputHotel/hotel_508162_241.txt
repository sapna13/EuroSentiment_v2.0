{"text":"Great Time at Dreams POunta Cana My daughter and I stayed at Dreams Punta Cana from June 28 - July 4, 2008. Our accomodations were in the Preferred Club, building 6. The resort is beautiful and well maintained, but what makes this resort stand apart from the rest is the staff in the Preferred Club section, building 6. The Preferred Club staff is, by far, the best that I have encountered at any resort (and I travel frequently). Check in with Ricardo Narvo was quick and easy and we were in our room in minutes. The rooms are spacious, clean and well appointed, even the bed was comfortable. Daily; Vanessa Disla, Jorge Polanco, Yan Le Guillou, Magalis Rodriguez, George and Bertilio greeted us with bright smiles and a cheerful hola and provided us with any assistance that we needed. Although the entire staff is great, it is Vanessa Disla that stands out as the best! Vanessa consistently provided us with attentive service and went out of her way to assure that our vacation was special and memorable - which it was! Vanessa made sure we enjoyed every aspect of our vacation - and even had a plate of chocolates delivered to our room one night and on the last night had a plate of confections delivered to the room with Have a nice trip written in chocolate on the plate. Vanessa provided us with the best service that I have ever experienced at a resort. And - I must add that George and Bertilio are the best bar tenders in Punta Cana.In addition, because we are repeat guests of Dreams Resorts (first time at Punta Cana), we were treated to a special dinner at the El Patio restaurant, which was wonderful and made us feel extra special.If you go to this resort, the Preferred Club is the way to go! The Preferred Club has a private lobby which provides use of free internet service, DVDs available for use at no charge, pool\/beach towels available without the towel card, continental breakfast and afternoon snacks and a private bar. There is also a private section of the beach for preferred club members that has fabulous beach beds along with great lounge chairs and thatched huts for shade. There is wait service on the beach. But the biggest reason to stay in the Preferred Club - is that you get the best staff on the island to assist you with your vacation needs and questions.The resort and grounds are well maintained and beautiful. The pool is fantastic and you will want to stay in for hours. The beach is nice, there are a lot of rocks in the water that you need to watch out for, but the sand is soft, breeze delightful and it is a quiet place to relax and unwind.The restauranbts and food are good. A la carte restaurants and no reservations required (there is also a buffet restaurant if you prefer). The spa and spa services are also very good - I would recommend the hot stone massage. The jacuzzi, hydro massage and showers are great in the spa's wellness center.Overall, the resort is a great place to go. You have the choice of either R  R or lots of activities with the entertainment staff. There is always an activity going on, whether it is volly ball, aerobics, water polo, dance lessons, ping pong comnpetitions or crazy games such as water balloon fights. The Core Zone is great for all ages with pool tables, air hockey, fooz ball, archery and even mechanical bull riding.The only downfall is the air conditioning system - so if you do not like it hot - do not go in July - go during cooler months. The air conditioning in the rooms did not work well, but the ceiling fans allowed you to sleep in comfort.I would definitely recommend this resort - but stay in the Preferred Club section and let Vanessa, Jorge, Yan, Magalis, Ricardo, George and Bertilio spoil you! They will make you feel like royalty during your stay.
