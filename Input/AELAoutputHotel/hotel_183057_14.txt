{"text":"It was nice, But I booked my stay and was pleased with the location. It's right in downtown Toronto, close to the Eaton Centre.I arrived very early due to my flight and my room wasn't ready. That's ok. It was the day after American Thanksgiving and a huge holiday weekend. So I went out shopping and visited the Tim Horton's close by.I returned a few hours later and sat in the lobby. My room still wasn't ready, but I was too exhausted to go walking more. A couple came in just checked in and got thier room right away. I was confused and told  Oh they have a different type of room. When I wanted to check in, I said  Please, just a room, I'm exhausted.I got a room within 30 minutes of this and the room was ok. Note to self, check BOTH tv's when you get into the room. The 2nd tv didn't work. The room was nicely sized and a good price, especially with the exchange rate being what it was.My room was right next to the elevator, but I really couldn't hear that. What I did here were men working in the hallway outside my room while I was trying to nap. The privacy please tag was on my door.The Internet was loky. I had to call three times to have the situation taken care of. The in room coffee maker didn't work. Which again, no big deal since there's Tim Horton's across the street. But still its the point. I found the front desk clerks condescending, especially when I asked about the airline check in.If you're looking for a centrally located hotel, this is ok. But there's a few other hotels up Yonge Street and off Carleton I plan on checking out when I come back.
