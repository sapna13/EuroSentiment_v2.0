{"text":"Unbeatable price for location Stayed for two weeks. Can't find any hotel cheaper than this for its proximity to Central. Love the free shuttle every morning that brings you right to Central\/Admiralty. Weird that the hotel doesn't post info on this service on its own website. I'd expected a hostel-like accomodation given the price, so was surprised to find full set of toiletries, coffee\/tea making facilities in the suite. The harbour view suite is 280 sq ft, definitely much larger than the 4star hotels I'd stayed in over at Kowloon. Great pillows, sheets and towel quality.Service is at its extreme. Conceige staff are wonderful and helpful. Housekeeping very professional even over the phone to my greatest surprise. The carpet in the suite is always very clean despite its age. Room service speedous. As for reception, only one Joe Yau is a fabulous service staff which great smile; other counter staff tend to be expressionless, impersonal and cold. But efficiency is there. Beware of the swimming pool. Stairway that one wld think lead you to the pool area actually lead you right into a foot washing area on your final step without any warning of no footwear. Very illogical. You have to love the quieter part of HK to like staying in Mid-levels. Not suitable for tourist who like to stay right smack in shopping district and have a restaurant right at your door step. Getting back to hotel is a hassle if you carry loads of shopping harvest, unless you take a cab. Its location along Robinson Rd is known by all cab drivers. The adventurous can take numerous buses available (from Wan Chai, Causeway Bay) to Caine Rd, and take 2min of the Mid-Levels Escalator back to Mosque St and walk 5min to hotel. Along Mosque St, you will pass by a takeaway only Pizza shop that makes amazingly thin crust pizza with great variety. Free delivery available.
