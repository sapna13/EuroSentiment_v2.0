{"text":"What a little gem of a hotel! We have stayed in Amsterdam many times before, at a wide variety of hotels, but this was our first stay at the Nadia .....and it won't be our last! From the very onset of our stay, the hotel staff were very welcoming and friendly and really couldn't do more for us. We arrived early so our room wasn't ready but the Nadia is more than happy to look after your belongings until your room is available. Be advised, like many hotels in Amsterdam, the Nadia has very steep stairs and no lift, but once again the hotel staff insist on carrying your cases up and down any stairs for you, making life much easier. Remember to leave your cases at the bottom of the stairs when you first arrive (reception is on the first floor) and they will collect them for you.The hotel is very well situated. It is directly across the street from Westekerk (near Anne Frank's house) and trams stop there regularly throughout the day (although Amsterdam is best experienced by foot - there are some great finds down the little side streets) It is a few minutes walk to some of the best shopping areas in the city.Our modest room was very clean, comfortable and had everything we would need for our three night stay. Breakfast (breads cheese, cakes, croissants, yoghurt, juice and tea or coffee) takes place in a lovely balcony breakfast room where again the staff are very helpful and friendly. We celebrated our first wedding anniversary while we were there and the staff left a beautiful bouquet of flowers for us - we believe it is the touches like this that make a hotel stand out amongst the rest and helped to make our stay so enjoyable. When we next plan a visit to Amsterdam we will phone the hotel directly for their special deals as advised by the hotel staff. A lovely hotel and great value for money.
