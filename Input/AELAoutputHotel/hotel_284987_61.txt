{"text":"Great experience although room for improvement My husband and I stayed at this resort for the second time to celebrate yet another wedding anniversary. First time we stayed at a Royal Service Garden View Jr. Suite; this time we stayed at a Royal Service Garden Villa. I must highlight that the accomodations were extremely beautiful, very comfortable and clean. Living area, outdoor gazebo, private pool in the villa, nice king bed, 2 tv's, great dressing area  closets, huge enclosed shower and indoor jacuzzi and lovely outdoor shower we will mimic at home!When we got to the room 2 hours after our luggage was delivered to the room, the A\/C was not working. We called for help and 10-15 minutes after someone came and fixed the problem. The buttler services are great. Our buttler, Mario, was top notch. He quickly catered to our requests which were ice (several times), wine glasses, a corkscrew and take my husband to the parking to retrieve something from our car. I noticed that on all dining venues there are small pretty flower arrangements on the tables but the flowers at that moment, were some kind of a white orchid which smells so pungent that inteferes with the food experience. At all times I had to request waiter to remove it from the table. I noticed in some instances that although we were receiving excellent service, others were not and I think it could be because we were wearing a distinctive wristband that ID'd us as Royal Service guests vs regular room guests. I think everyone should get equal quality of service.During our 2nd night, the fire alarms in the room went off more than 3 times and it was at 3am when finally operator answered and explained that this was being caused by guests who had already been intervened by Security. Must be true as they never went off again. Room service was quick but food can improve - at least the temperature. Soups and desserts were very good, entrees can improve.Tempo restaurant was very nice, impecable service, good wines. I would decrease light intensity in this restaurant to make it a little more intimate just like the Nami. Lights are too intense and you feel like you are in a store window. At Cafe Soleil the items at the lunch buffet should be identified as there are items that if you are not familiar with, will never know what they are. I served a chicken breast with a sauce that turned out to be jalapeno sauce. Hated that one. I am allergic to many things and having food identified with little signs, would have made my lunch time a lot easier.The check in and out process at the Royal Lounge was good. A couple of things charged from the mini bar we did not consume, were immediately removed from the bill. Be careful, if you pick up something from the mini bar just to see it and then put it back, if this takes 30 secs or more, your bill will be whacked for it automatically. Watch out.The music at the Wet Bar at the main pool was too loud! If you want to realx and read a book, this won't help.But overall, the experience is good and plenty of opportunities to relax. I had a company event there on July; booked approximately 90 rooms and only had one minor complaint of one guest waiting more than 30 minutes to check in on Royal Service. That's it.WIll definitely return for company events and private stays.
