{"text":"Five star experience. We stayed five nights and six days and booked a harbour room through their Internet. We also booked airport pick up, used their concierge, exchanged money, checked out their gym, ate at their restaurant and used room service and dry cleaning\/laundry. 1. Airport pick up: the driver was on time holding a paper printed with the guest's name outside the baggage area. We got the exact car that we wanted and it had two cold bottles of water and cold towels ready. 2. Check in: we were greeted right after we got out of the car and escorted to the room. Tea and fresh fruit was waiting. Our room was on the 20th floor with harborview. Luggage arrived quickly. 3. Room: floor to ceiling windows, extra amenities like emergency flashlight, umbrella, two robes, two slippers, complimentary bottled water daily, Molton brown toiletries, bath salts in tub, loofa scrub, some office supplies (staples, hilighter) room, night light. High tech lighting controls as well as privacy indicator. There was an indirect view from the bathroom due to the glass wall. Two toilet paper racks in bathroom, three phones (one in bathroom) a tub and a shower and one sink. 3. Concierge: excellent service and we used them to book a few tours (malacca was a good one but tiring, raffles tiffin, night safari riverboat, flyer). Money exchange was a breeze with them4. Dryclean: they found a button missing and insisted on paying for it. Price is high but expected. They returned our clothes the same day despite dropping it off at lunch. Laundry was neatly folded in a basket with a flower on top. Clothes were in plastic (not wires) hangers in the closet. 5. Room service: brought a table with food kept in a warmer. Arrived in 20 minutes and picked in five. Great selection of Indian,American local cuisine. 6. Location: across from the esplanade, attached to marina mall, walking distance to merlion, singapore river but we used cabs to go everywhere which was cheap. It was too hot to walk. 7. Food at The melt. Get the breakfast rate or it could be pretty pricey. We came in 10 min before closing and they extended the closing time. 8. Gym with cold towels water and techno equipment. Overlooking pool Spotless. 9.Customer service was their strongest asset. Always with a smile and anticipated our every need. No worries was their motto. Concierge walked you out after calling a cab. Housekeeping was excellent with attention to details. Change in throwpillows during turndown Amazing. Everyone knew our names. Minor quirks (which might just be me): wifi is not free,(30 sgd\/day or 20\/12 hrs 15\/ 6 hrs etc ) it is free if you booked the club lounge. My pet peeve was that the hair dryer was attached. With that view I would have loved to move around. No flat screen tv but with surround speakers. Overall the best experience we've had in Singapore due to both the view and customer service We have tried the ritz and the four seasons (comparable customer service) but mo has both. We would definitely return. Suggest: try Singapore flyer, night safari, riverboat 30 min trip, malacca only if you have time, sentosa cable car, images museum, chili crab with man toux bread (east coast seafood).
