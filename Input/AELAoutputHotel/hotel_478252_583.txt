{"text":"Gran Gran Gran Principe!! My boyfriend and I spent a week at this resort and loved every minute of it!! We were very satisfied with the food, the service, and the overall environment. I read many reviews before going to the resort and I was a little nervous due to some comments about below average food and some cases of food poisoning - personally I think that the only people who got a little ill were the ones who spent countless hours in the sun without sunscreen (bring lots we went through 3 bottles and still got tanned) and then drank a little too much the same day - this is not the resorts fault.I also think that some people went in with the impression that they should be fed their meals on a silver plater and be bowed to at every step - although in our opinion the service was amazing the staff at the resort are attending to over 1500 guests and if they miss a plate on the way through, well then suck it up!Our favorite part of the trip was the offsite tour called the Bavaro Runners - this 1\/2 day or full day (we did the 1\/2 day and it was perfect) takes you to different areas to show how residents of Punta Cana live. This is a humbling experience - should be a mandatory trip to all those who feel they didn't receive the so called service they feel they deserve. We were truly grateful for even being able to take a vacation after seeing how some people live every day.All and all - we would absolutely go back - we met many wonderful people, tried some excellent food and chilled out on the beach. A perfect vacation. ","annotations":[]}
