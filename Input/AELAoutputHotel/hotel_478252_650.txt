{"text":"Relaxing Trip - My Take I visited the Dominican on June 5-11 with my boyfriend. Overall the place is very well kept and the service it great. Here are my opinions on the various points.Room- Awesome. Spacious -cleaned and stocked daily. Was on the first floor and really have no bug complaints.Hotel Grounds- Beautiful. As everyone says extremely well kept and groomed. Resort is big but not as enormous as the boards make it out to be. We were all the way in the premiere section (furthest from the beach). All in all it was probably about 2.5 city blocks to the beach- a nice walk. But, yes the trams run very frequently for those who wish to not walk on vacation.Beach- Beautiful. Relaxing. There is some seaweed but really not bothersome. Had a few days of waves and a few calm days and both were great. Really enjoyed watching all the activities on the beach that the resort does like the constant volleyball action or beach aerobics.. still cant get that song out of my head... Pools- Nice. Very warm water. Didnt spend really any time here as we go the Caribbean for the beach!Chair Problem- Was actually not at all a problem. We slept in every day till 10:00am and got to the beach by 1030-11 and never had a problem. There were plenty of chairs and shade as the beach has a ton of gorgeous palm trees that provide ample shade. The pools didnt look bad either. I actually did see signs posted about not saving chairs. Know this has been a problem for others but really at this time it was a breeze. Drinks- They were alright. Had a few drinks that weren't terrible but by the end I was sick of them. Think this is an area they could do better. Service- Very accommodating. All the help seemed to go out of the way to help you. Most spoke English or understood enough to know what you were saying. Aside for one or two servers in the Bavaro lobby bar, found all the employees very nice.Food- I am not a picky eater and generally like to try new things and eat almost all foods. I have to say though this was the big area of lacking. It wasn't so much of a taste issue but more of a freshness issue. The food just was not fresh. It was very evident as both my traveling partner and I got pretty sick. for a couple of the days. We had only been drinking\/ using bottled water so it was not from that. Also, felt the alla carte restaurants were somewhat of a rip off in that it was really only served your entree that your ordered. The appetizers were still in a buffet style.Overall- the resort is beautiful and its a good value for a nice trip. I would just be cautious with what you eat and drink.
