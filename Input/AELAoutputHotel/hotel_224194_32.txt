{"text":"Good Value This property had such varying reviews and comments, I was very nervous. I think it comes down to your expectations and the price. We've done the high end Caribbean, and were attracted by the very reasonable in-season rates? That's where I take issue with all the complainers. Our experience was positive, and we have stayed at some nice resorts. The property does show signs that it is in transition, you could argue that it is tired in some respects, but I found it to be completely acceptable given the nightly rate. The staff were all friendly, and very helpful. They have some areas closed off for renovation, but this was not obtrusive in any way. We upgraded to an oceanfront room for an extra $50 and felt it was worth it. The view was directly to the ocean and horizon, and the surf sounds made for pleasant sleep. The room itself was nice sized, particularly the bathroom. It is not a $500+ room, of course, but for the price we paid to stay at Martineau, we had no complaints. If you are a perfectionist about your room and need pristine, buffed out amenities, you shouldn't be bargain-hunting. What I particularly liked was that it was very quiet during our stay, and easy to go from the room to the lobby or swimming pool area.The pool is a typical resort pool, we didn't really use it. The pool bar and restaurant is average. The beach is small but came in handy on a day we were short on beach time and just wanted to chill out on a lounge chair. Not crowded and again the surf sounds were pleasant. Also, the general lanscaping between the beach and the resort makes it more private and low key.The restaurant is OK for breakfast. We elected to go into town to Roy's coffee house. We really liked the atmosphere there and the owner is a great guy. We also passed on Paso Fino for dinner. It appeared pricey and the room was usually empty, and lacked the fun ambiance you can find elsewhere. There are much better dining options if you have wheels (bbh was my favorite). A nice bar atmosphere is at Inn at Blue Horizon. In Esparanza, the sunset is nice from the top porch of Bananas.We learned that some of the restaurants have undergone changes as far as chefs, and the ones that were previously very good have suffered somewhat. I think there are some fun dining choices on Vieques overall.If you stay at Martineau, you need a jeep. We rented from the place across the street and had no problem. This gives you the freedom to explore the beaches and get around the island. Watch out for horses and cows!The beaches are undeveloped, except for state park like picnic tables and trash cans. Blue beach was one of the nicer. I think the beaches are somewhat overhyped on Vieques. I liked them, but think they are a bit oversold in most reviews. Snorkelling is better elswhere in the Caribbean. Esparanza is a lively little place with a picturesque waterfront.We did Bio bay and enjoyed it very much. Overall, Vieques was memorable but it is better for a more independent and adventursome traveller. It is much less expensive than the rest of the Caribbean (rooms, taxis, whatever). The people are very friendly and generally welcoming. It is not a clean island, and their is a good amount of litter. The other issue that continually came up from local people was the amount of petty theft on the island. We were continually warned about items being stolen from our Jeep. This was reported a few times and caught us off guard a bit. If you like to explore, and enjoy local Puerto Rican flavor, it's great. If you prefer easy access to the beach, being pampered, and having your cocktail served to you in a lounge chair, you should look elsewhere. I doubt I'd bring my younger kids to Vieques. It's a little rough around the edges and there a just simply better Caribbean options.Some of the boutique hotels looked interesting, bbh (Bravo Beach Hotel) and Inn at Blue Horizon. We didn't get to see Haciendo Tamarindo but that gets excellent reviews. For us, Martineau met expectations that were set somewhat lower to begin with.
