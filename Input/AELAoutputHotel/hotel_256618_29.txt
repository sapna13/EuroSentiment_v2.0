{"text":"Excellent hotel - unbeatable location  My wife Chrissy  I stayed twice at the Sydney Park Hyatt on our recent holiday to Australia arriving on 5th July to the 10th of July and 1 last night of the 17th of July. The holiday was to get off to a bad start at London Heathrow with the cancellation of our flight on the 3rd July due to a security scare, BA managed to get us on a Qantas flight the next day but despite flying √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Æirst√à√\u2020\u2022?we spent the first night in Terminal 4 Baggage Reclaim vainly trying to recover our baggage. On arrival at Sydney we were advised the luggage was not on board. Imagine our horror in that we were arriving the evening of the 5th July to the Sydney Park Hyatt in clothes that we had worn for 2 days already. My wife Chrissy and I have nothing but admiration for everyone at the Park Hyatt in that we were greeted warmly and the Concierge Team of Cameron, Chris, Andrew  Patrick swung into action immediately day  night seemingly chasing our baggage through Qantas Baggage Services. All the way through our stay we were addressed with our names without prompting  after 4 days in Sydney my wife Chrissy was reunited with her luggage. Needless to say that the Concierge Team never gave up chasing my luggage  despite moving on to Lilianfels in the Blue Mountains for 2 nights  The Beach Club in Hamilton Island for 5 nights. On our return to the Park Hyatt we were greeted with an immediate update on my baggage status from Cameron in Concierge. Never before in our stays in hotels of all standing has my wife or I experienced customer satisfaction  attention to detail as shown by these guys. As to the hotel itself, the bell hops are very dutiful  attentive, greeting us by name on both initial greetings  subsequent greetings during the stay. They were very prepared to organise a taxi which was a past reviewers concern. Daniel on reception initially checked us in with a relaxed but efficient style that was very much appreciated after what we had endured the previous few days. We were shown to our Opera King Deluxe Room 212 which definitely had the wow factor, Daniel showed us round the room facilities finally retracting the main curtains and sheer drapes electronically revealling the signature view of the Opera House, fantastic. The bed must have been 7 foot wide  it was extremely comfortable, supportive  good for your back, it was without doubt best bed we had in Ozzie. It was nice to wake up, turn over  take in the view from the bed viewing through both patio doors as the Opera King Deluxe Rooms have 2 patio doors  balconies. Breakfast is taken in the main restaurant with views overlooking the Circular Quay  the Opera House, on weekends a buffet is provided, on weekdays hot meals are waiter service. A good choice is also available in cereals, fresh fruits, danish pastries, croissants  toasted bread of various kind plus cheeses  hams  fruit juices. Restaurant manager Lucinda oversees the restaurant extremely well catering both business people  holidaymakers. Lunch  Dinner in the hotel provide an excellent array of choices including vegetarian options which if for some reason other choices are required Lucinda or the Concierge Team are only too happy to discuss on your behalf with the chef. The rooftop pool in spring, summer  autumn time provides a pleasant location to cool down  unwind with bridge views, although in winter the temperatures may prove too challenging, it was for us anyway? The spa provides all year round facilities  is located in the roof top area. It should be appreciated that July 2007 has provided the coldest winter month for NSW  Queensland for many years, our time at Hamilton Island was affected by colder than usual weather also.General Manager Marlene Poynder can be congratulated for running an exceptional hotel; her management style certainly seems to get the best out of her management team  staff alike. She can be found most mornings in the breakfast room talking to clients  reviewing facilities, she is a lovely lady. Our time at the Sydney Park Hyatt was above expectation  on both stays in the holiday (we returned for 1 last night immediately before returning home); without doubt we would return to this hotel again when we are next in Sydney. We would also look to have the Opera King Deluxe rooms again as these do seem to have the best views  square footage per AUD.
