{"text":"Fantastic Wedding and Vacation Thirty one of us travelled to the DR for a wedding during the first week of November. The hotel chosen was the Grand Pallidium Bavaro. Having stayed mostly in Mexico before we were looking forward to the change in venue. We were not disappointed.The tour provider was Air Transat and our party had ben upgraded to imperial Club. The rooms were great and featured a huge bathroom with large Jacuzzi, double sinks and a separate shower. The only problem?? And is seemed amazing to me that with the great room, well stocked mini bar, and the excellent maid service that the pillows in the room were tiny sponge pillows and only two of them. Not a complaint..just a surprise.The beach was fantastic. I could only get up early enough once to get a palapa at the beach as most were gone by 6:30. A lot easier to get space at the pools, which were also nice.The hotel had great wedding facilities and the day went off withouht a hitch. Wedding planner was there to ensure there were no problems. Okay the horse was sick so no carriage ride. Again that was handled with ease.The staff were all friendly, well trained and always there to help out when needed. There was always a friendly Hola from the maids, bartenders and even groundskeepers, of which there were many.Since every review shouldpoint out any negative aspects there was one. To be safe we ensured we booked the ATV tour with the hotel and when we did we were told that was lucky since you can't trust the beach salemen. We were assured the equipment was fairly new, in good running order and the tour wourd be fantastic.When we got there we found that they had booked so may people that all machines would be be used and had only 4 or 5 employees for this large group. Even before we left the complex 3 machines were already breaking down with many more to be fixed during the tour. Some of the ones which didnt die sent smoke billowing through the countryside. If we go to the DR again this tour will not be part of thre trip.Other than that we loved the trip, the hotel, the people and one more thing...STEVE'S BAR. Try to make it there for the ice cold beer, Carla and Leticia, the servers and to spend a bit of time with people outside the resort.
