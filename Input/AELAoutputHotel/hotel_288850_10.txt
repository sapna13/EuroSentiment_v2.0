{"text":"Excellent ... For an airport hotel (Take your own Ethernet cable !) Aiport hotels are well known for being awful. This one is not, though it is on the otherside of the airfield to the airport so buget 15-20 minutes to get to the terminal at least. The rooms are modern, well appointed, quiet with aircon and you get free wired internet in room. One wrinkle with this is that you have to either bring your own ethernet cable to plug between the wall socket and your PC, or traipse back to reception (who don't mention this on check-in), who will lend you one after putting a refundable deposit on your room in case you make off with their cable at checkout. This is just weird - the hotel is not cheap and what you get is worth paying for, but bearing in mind that 99.5% of guests are there on business and you have to ask why they would do this to guests in the first place and not just leave cables in the room like every other hotel on the planet ? There is secure underground parking at the hotel which had pink lady parking bays near the hotel entrance which I thought was a nice touch - even though it meant I had to to park further away ! Overnight parking was 20 euros. I arrived late and didn't get to try the food, but the restaurants looked busy and there were several. All in all, expensive, but well done and I would return - just take your own ethernet cable.
