{"text":"Ugh! Won't come back for the second time We booked this hotel w\/o reading much reviews. Then after reading all the negative reviews, it was already too late to change. So we decided to go with it and hope for the best. The hotel lobby is nice, spacious, airy as mentioned by other posters. The ground and facility are well maintained. Staff is always cleaning. Beach is gorgeous, we'd definitely come back to Punta Cana for the beach (stay at a different hotel thou). Now i'll go to details of the negatives:Food: Only 2 a la carte restaurants to choose from for each day. I think they alternate those 4 restaurants. D'oriental is supposed to be the best but it wasn't at all. Foods were tasteless and bland. The decor wasn't great either. We tried the Italian restaurant and foods were bad as well. Chicken and lasagna were very dry. Basically, food and services were cafeteria standard. On our last nite, we went to the Lobster sea side restaurant (it wasn't in the all-inclusive package. It was $45 per person). We both ordered lobsters and they were great. The restaurant ambiance was very nice. This is what i think all restaurants and their foods should be like. Room: AC wasn't working. The room was musky and floor wasn't clean. We saw ants everywhere. Once, there were some on the bed. They did come and sprayed the room but it didn't help much.Bathroom: The tub was disgusting. Overall, i don't recommend this resort at all. ","annotations":[]}
