{"text":"Conrad is good Stayed at the Conrad Hong-Kong twice for 10 and 9 days in July and August 2006. The hotel is currently renovating the rooms located in the top floors (above sort of 55). The old rooms have a greenish design (did not stay in one of these but was offered one with bay side view) and the renovated rooms have a very pleasant yellowish design. So, finally we selected non-renovated room on the executive floor for our first stay and a renovated room for our second stay. The non-renovated have standard TVs and furniture as you can see from pictures in other posts, and the renovated rooms have new furniture, including a flat-screen 32'' TV, and a separate DVD player that's particularly pleasant if you stay for long as you may want to just go downstairs to the mall and pick up a DVD to watch from Hong-Kong records. Rooms are very well isolated from noise enabling a very quiet sleep no matter what, the air-con is non-intrusive, and the marble bathrooms are very pleasant with double sinks and a toilet behind a door that closes. Staff are very pleasant, and as mentioned in other posts, service is top notch at this hotel. Examples include airport pick-up (charged), tea immediately upon arrival and possibility to view and choose your room (I guess that only applies to gold and diamond hhonors members). We also tried the restaurant on the 8th floor, which despite being very pricey deserves its reputation of best italian in Hong-Kong.
