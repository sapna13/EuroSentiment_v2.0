{"text":"Great Hotel After some searching on Trip Advisor, we decided to book Condes De Barcelona for our five day stay there. We were not disappointed. The location is fantastic. almost exactly ten minutes from the ramblas, so it's near enough to walk, but not close enough so that it's dangerous. There was a great buzz in this area, without it being too loud or crowded. Approx. three minutes walk from two different gaudi buildings, a pile of restaurants, and lots of designer shops (we're a family of four women and one unfortunate father, so this went down well.)The Hotel is in two parts - the old and the new - but you wouldn't really know the difference, they're both bright, airy and modern. Our rooms were in the old building. They were spacious, and not too loud even though they were right by the street. Air conditioning was great. Beds were SO comfortable, The pillows were also great (I know that sounds a tad odd, but they were). Bathrooms were also lovely, spacious too. Plenty of hot water and towels, shampoo, conditioner...etc. Plenty of space for clothes and even a little safe for your valuables. We had two rooms - one with a double bed, one with two singles, and each had a little balcony.The staff were wonderful. When we arrived at the hotel, we went into the new building (which has a green staircase), but were told that our rooms were in the old building, because of the noise levels caused by renovations. This threw us slightly at first, but the old building was about ten seconds away, and and far from old. (this one has a stone staircase) There's lots of space to sit down and relax in the lobby, and even a baby grand piano which - much to our delight - we were allowed play during the day. Brekfast in the morning (in the new building) was lovely. A nice buffet table, so you could pick and choose whatever you wanted from rashers to fresh fruit.The terrace in the old building is just lovely. It has bar service, and you can see the city at night - but also into the rooms across the street. I'd watch out for that if you're ever staying in the new building.Price wise, we thought it was expensive - But well worth it, because staying there was a real treat.So what's wrong with it?The swimming pool, which we nicknamed the sitting puddle.It's tiny. 9 X 13 feet. The solarium was 20 X 30 feet. This really made no difference to us, because we spent most of our time sight seeing, but if you want an actual pool, this place doesn't have it - at least, not in the old building.Just one last thing, it's as cheap to get a taxi from the city airport to town as any other way - √à√\u2020√ü?3 for four of us. Good value!
