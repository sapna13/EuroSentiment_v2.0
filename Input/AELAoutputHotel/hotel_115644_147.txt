{"text":"Excellent Boutique Hotel! Having previously read the reviews on TripAdvisor, I felt quite confident on booking this hotel, and I was not disappointed. We arrived following a long flight, and a sharp introduction to driving in San Francisco (don't!) - we had a simple and very friendly check-in and were straight up to our rooms (which as we had requested were close together).The location is fantastic.. a short walk to the main shopping area, and easy (right outside the hotel) cable car connections towards Fishermans Wharf.The rooms were recently refurbished, and nicely decorated. Excellent walk-in closet, the bathroom was a little small - but thats hardly a problem! I thought it was great that you could plug your MP3 player into the radio, so that you could listen to your own music. And the nice touch of a pot of sweets was lovely!Coffee\/Tea were provided in the hotel lobby free-of-charge so you could just help yourself whenever you fancied one - again a nice touch.Off-site parking is available on Sutter Street (quicker to walk to than drive to!) but none-the-less ideally placed. They also do valet parking there if thats your preference.The only downside really was that there was no AC, and the rooms can get a little warm. Yes, you can open the window, but it does get quite noisy with the cable cars... however after the first night I found I could get used the cable car bells, however the emergency services are not quite so quiet!!!Loved the little bar in the hotel.. only thing it closed at 9.30pm every night we were there... thats pretty early. I believe Friday  Saturday nights it is open later. Drink selection is pretty good.Overall, we had a great stay, and we would certainly return to the Chancellor if we find ourselves back in San Francisco.
