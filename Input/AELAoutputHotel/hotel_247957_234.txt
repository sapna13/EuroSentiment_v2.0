{"text":"Expect the worst and hope for the best!! We are 2 30 year old females from NYC traveling for 5 days for rr. The trip total with airfare and insurance came to about $800 each. Great price, 3 hour flight. We were looking for the best price possible, and were not to worried about the rooms since we knew we wouldn't be in the room a lot. If I was traveling with my husband I would stay in a nicer, better reviewed hotel. The nicer hotels were pricing out about $1200 pp, so this was a much better deal for us. The hotel was ok. The pool was great, the buffet was good. The resturaunts were yuck, except for the tacos and pizza. Home Rum wasn't bad for junk food. The drinks were not so hot. They don't know how to mix drinks, and put grenadine in everything! The coco locos were great (but 5000 calories) and the Presidente beer is good. Staff was great to us, spoke English, but we spoke some Spanish to them. Learn some Spanish phrases before you go. It's so rude to just start speaking English to someone in a Spanish speaking country. If anything, learn to say Hello, do you speak English? All of the male staff was in love with my friend and I, so if you are females going beware! They were harmless (we think) but be very careful. I think in a better hotel they would frown upon the staff flirting with the guests.Room was not great but the AC worked well, the maids cleaned everyday, and when they forgot to leave towels they brought them up right away. We had no problems except that the room wasn't really pretty. It wasn't disgusting...Beach is so incrediable!! The highlight of the trip. We went snorkling through the hotels service. It was $25pp and they took us to a reef. Very fun, 1 1\/2 hours, not too many types of fish but we enjoyed it very much.We heard the excursions in PC aren't really worth it. It takes a long time on a bus to get anywhere and then the excursions themselves are not that great. PC is great is you just want to hang on the beach, but no do much else. That is why is it is so much cheaper than the other islands in the Carribean. Overall I will go back to PC but I think I will try a nicer hotel next time. We did have a great time, the Occidental was enjoyable.Have a great time in PC!
