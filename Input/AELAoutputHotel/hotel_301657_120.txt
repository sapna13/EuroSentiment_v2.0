{"text":"Nice, but not great We previously stayed at the New Otani and if it's true that the design of the trendy Park Hotel is much more contemporary, it also has a soulless tourist park feel that almost put us off.The location is good but not great - yes it's connected to a metro station but you have to walk about 10 minutes to get there. It's mainly a business district so there's nobody around at night or during the weekend which explains why the restaurant choice is somewhat limited to small lunch joints. We resorted to using taxis (600 JPY for the first 2km - it actually makes sense if you're a couple and not sure where you're going exactly).Even though we got there at 12:00, we had to wait 1 hour for our room and were not even offered a drink at the bar (not great when you're jet lagged and just want to go to bed).The room was pretty small with not much space left for luggages. The deco was nice though and the view was amazing. The bathroom amenieties were nice and the shower very powerfull, although they ask you to close the door as the steam might trigger the smoke alarm (?!).CNN and BBC World were the two English speaking channels on offer.We had breakfast through room service (about 5,000 JPY, crazy expensive!), nice an quick. We also had the buffet breakfast, which was served in the lobby bar and felt a bit like a train station cafe.Yes, everybody speaks English, including guests (mainly American, English and French - not a native in sight...) but what you gain in convenience is somehow lost by the impression that world-class Japanese customer service has been replace by a not so attentive one.That said, they didn't hesitate to give me some headache pills after a crazy karaoke night, lent scissors to open gadgets packaging, were always prompt to bring iron\/ironing board to the room and the mini-bar was well stocked.All in all, nice enough stay but we'll try something else next time.
