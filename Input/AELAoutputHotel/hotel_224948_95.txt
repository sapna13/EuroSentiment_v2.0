{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Kids Room, Great City... A great classic and classy hotel. The service is outstanding. The atmosphere is luxurious, and extremely kid-friendly in a city that is not really kid-centric. We were lucky enough to book the Kid Fantasy Suite for my kids (ages 9 and 11) with an adjoining King room for my husband and I. While there is much more the decorators could have done to make it a true kid fantasy room, it made my kids feel like they were special. Bunk beds, bean bags and nightly milk  cookies -- what more could a kid want?! (Well, a pool would have been ideal, but they didn't mind too much).The restaurant in the hotel, Bob's Steak House, was fantastic. A little pricey, but typical for the city and the food was worth it. There are several outstanding restaurants within an easy two block walk of the hotel.We were there over a long weekend, and it seemed many cafes and smaller restaurants were closed for the weekend, or had very limited hours. (The closest McDonald's was completely closed on Sunday -- not a big deal unless you have a 9-year-old craving a Happy Meal)But the location was great in regards to the ease in getting to public transportation. Also, there are a ton of things within walking distance -- China Town, the Ferry Building, Union Square.The service at the Omni is wonderful! Everything from the front desk staff to the housekeepers to the room service attendants. I could go on an on about this hotel, but to simply summarize: if you are going to San Fran, stay here!
