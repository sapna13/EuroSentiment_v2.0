{"text":"So Modern! This is an amazing hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?it took me hours to actually leave my hotel room! The Grand Hyatt is full of modern, technologically advanced details that I hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seen elsewhere! I kept playing with all of the switches! The beyond flat screen TV was great, the blinds have a 100 options (semi-transparent, black, etc.) that changes with a switch on the bed√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ headboard  the bathroom has a fantastic wet room! Not technology driven, but equally loved was the in-room tea bar. Amenities are superb  the staff is efficient  highly accommodating. The concierge translated my entire to-do list  addresses into Japanese for me so that I could flash my cards to the cabbies. I was there as the last leg of an extremely long journey  had all sorts of wardrobe issues. Within a few hours of checking in, they had done my laundry, dry cleaning, fixed a button  polished my boots! Room service was also fast  had lots of great options.The location in Roppongi Hills is probably convenient for most people, as there are lots of tourists around  tons of restaurants. However, I found that I had to take cabs everywhere I was interested in going. Within the complex are all sorts of businesses, such as a museum, shops  restaurants (inc. Starbucks), so this is handy if you are short of time or may have bored companions traveling with you. Hotel is pricey, but I was there on business. If I return for pleasure, I may choose to stay at Cerulean Towers instead due to price  location.
