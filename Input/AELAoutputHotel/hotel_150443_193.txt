{"text":"February break The previous negative review has prompted me to respond. My college age daughter and I planned a short visit to Puerto Rico for her well deserved February break . We chose the Condado for its proximity to the airport and the fact that we would not need to rent a car, and, the price was right. Also, we took a nonstop flight from Boston and we were basking in the sun in no time at all. First, always do your research before you choose a hotel. Yes, the beach is public, and very small, however, it's not a surprise if one actually pays attention to the information provided by the hotel and tripadvisor. Before we left, we emailed the hotel to ask for a renovated room. It was lovely, clean and quiet, looking out over the ocean. I researched a couple of restaurants and checked with the professional and helpful concierge, Jean Pierre who would either agree or suggest another choice that my daughter might prefer. He would make the reservation and when we appeared at his desk, he would escort us to a taxi and give the driver the address. Delirio's, Dragonfly and Pikayo were all different and delicious. For breakfast, walk down the street and sip your tea or coffe at Hacienda Don Jose, where you can have eggs, toast, and OJ for around $5.00 or simply order tea and toast and read. It's a tiny neighborhood cafe where the windows open up over the ocean. (TripAdvisor idea, of course)..The Condado is really trying to please....and by the way, there is construction all over San Juan...a necessary part of keeping the city revitalized and beautiful. And, always take some time to do your travel research...it's so easy .
