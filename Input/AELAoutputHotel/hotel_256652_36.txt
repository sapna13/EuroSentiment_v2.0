{"text":"Great Hotel My new wife and I stayed here at the start of our Honeymoon for 4 nights. Overall we found the accommodation, staff, facilities and location to be excellent.Upon an early arrival at the hotel, they were able to allocate us an upgraded room, several hours before our due check-in time. We made use of the spa, restaurant and bar, as well as taking advantage of the expertise of the concierge, as recommended by a previous review, during our stay and were more than happy with all of these aspects of the hotel.The rooms are of a good size with excellent bathrooms. We were not able to detect any need for improvement in the decoration of our room as some previous reviews have noted and can only assume that they were unfortunate in their experiences. The bed was extremely comfortable, and we especially appreciated that each night the bed was turned down, and cold bottles of water were left on each bed-side table with clean glasses. A nice touch. Additional nice touches came in the form of a welcome plate of fruit and a note from the hotel manager wishing us a pleasant stay on our honeymoon.The location of the hotel is great for access to both Darling Harbour and Circular Quay, both about a 5 minute walk away.Whilst breakfast was by no means a cheap affair, the overall value of the hotel that we experienced was high and we would certainly stay here on our next visit and would happily recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a boutique style, well located hotel in Sydney with excellent customer service levels.
