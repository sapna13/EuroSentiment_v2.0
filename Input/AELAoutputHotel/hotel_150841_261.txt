{"text":"The Perfect Honeymoon My new husband and I went to Iberostar Bavaro for our honeymoon and it was absolutley perfect!! This was his first time traveling out of the country. Despite his initial nerves, the beauty and serenity of this hotel quickly calmed his nerves. I had visited Punta Cana two years prior to this trip and was slightly dissappointed with the trip. For this trip, I did my research and found Iberostar Bavaro to be the best bang for the buck. The ride to the hotel from the airport was smooth. Check in was great and we were able to get a room with a beautiful view of the pool. The room was pretty much sound proof; noise from the pool was not an issue. Every day our maid left hibiscus flowers in our room. Our room was always made up by the time we were back from our excersions. The food was wonderful. It was not as bland as other buffet style all inclusions. There was always something to eat, even if the themed night was not food you typically ate. The main buffet was always a good choice. We ate at the steak house, Cajun restaraunt, and the Gormet restaraunt. No complaints. The pool lunch buffet was delicious as well.I highly recomment the excersion to Saona Island and the Safari Tour over any other. We also went on the personal speed boat\/snorkeling tour which was a blast. The catamaran ride back from Saona Island was wonderful and we even saw flying fish. The beach that they take you to for the Safari Tour is breathtaking. This is their off season. The whole area is extremely busy from December through March. We loved going during the off season. There weren't to many people, we never had to fight for a beach chair, pool side chair, or dinner table, and we were able to make a few friends whie having our own personal time around the resort. I highly HIGHLY recommend Iberostar Bavaro to anyone and everyone. We will definately be back. ","annotations":[]}
