{"text":"Beautiful views, so-so service, 'cruise-shippy' First off, I should make a disclaimer...we're not resort\/cruise people; we love small boutique hotels and tend to be a bit biased against big resort properties. Still, I think we could both see the virtues and faults of the Caribe Hilton (and this was only 2 nights of a 2-week Carribean vacation). We picked it because I have oodles of Hilton points from business travel and we were attracted to the location between Old San Juan and Condado, the two areas where we were considering staying.The hotel gave us a very nice ocean-facing room with a balcony (perhaps because of my diamond status with Hilton.). The room was clean and seemed recently renovated. The beds were extremely comfortable. The A\/C was way too cold, and despite changing the thermostat, it only seemed to stop cranking out cold air when we turned it all the way off. The view of the ocean, Fort San Geronimo, and over to Condado was spectacular. The hallways, on the other hand, had a fair amount of peeling paint, etc. Perhaps more renovations are on their way?The setting is beautiful... a scenic beach (on a lagoon, not the open ocean), lots of palm trees, a curvy walkway along the ocean's edge, etc. Adjacent Fort San Geronimo added a nice touch to our view. Too bad it seems to be permanently closed. Despite the beautiful location, the overall atmosphere is way to cruise-shippy for our tastes (shuffleboard, etc.). As soon as the sun came down each night, the bar (located in the open-air lobby) featured a loud lounge singer and back-up musicians whose Vegas-meets-Carribean sound echoed throughout the lobby and outdoor areas).The location--which we had predicted would be a key positive aspect--was in some ways minus. Although it's between Old San Juan and Condado, it's actually a bit far of a walk to either, requiring a $20 taxi (for about a 2 mile trip?!!) to get to most restaurants and nightlife. The sheer size of this sprawling complex--a plus for many, I'm sure, was a bit of a minus for us. It made us feel a bit detached from the rest of the city.The service was mixed. While we were waiting in the long Hilton Honors check-in line, a helpful staff member directed us to another check-in location, at the HHonors tower (named as an attempt to make us feel special, I suppose). The service was incredibly slow at the bars and restaurants. We ordered food service on our first night. Don't do it! Our chicken quesadilla was late, cold, flavorless, and overpriced. The executive lounge had a great view, but was packed at breakfast and the staff couldn't keep up with clearing dishes and replenishing supplies. They also cleared all of the food out immediately at 11 am (closing time), which we found particularly annoying since we had spent the last 15 minutes chasing down staff to replenish the already near-depleted supply of food as well as bowls and plates to put the food on.The concierge was very helpful in providing us info and restaurant reservations. The turndown service was also a nice extra--not something I've found at most Hiltons.We'll probably pick somewhere else when we return to San Juan, but wouldn't be totally adverse to staying at the Caribe Hilton again to save money by using Hilton points (We were not particularly interested in the other Hilton family hotels in San Juan, since they are all loacted in Isla Verde--near the airport, an area of less interest to us.). The comfortable room and beautiful setting were the main plusses. I would not plan to have any meals there, though.
