{"text":"Doubtful I'd return I stayed at the Park Shore 2 times in the last year.My first trip, I went alone and was looking for a safe place in a convenient location. I booked City View room  got what I paid for...They offered plenty of toiletries and I had lots of space - both in the room, bathroom, and closet. The condition of the room was fine.. it was clean, although I did opt to shower with flip flops on.My second stay, I went with friends, and we upgraded to an Oceanfront Room. Well, I was disappointed by the fact it wasn't truly an Oceanfront Room. The balcony that faced the ocean didn't even open... it was just for show... The view of Diamond Head and daily sunrises was nice, though. The room was smaller than the previous one I had stayed in, which was weird... and the bathroom was so tiny. We couldn't even put all of our toiletries in there because there wasn't enough space. The toilet was rusted... and when we checked in, there was still stuff from the previous guest left there [bathingsuits still hanging up in the bathroom...] I was also disappointed they stopped giving out bath  body works bath products.The location is really ideal, and the price you pay can't be beat. Suggestions would be to actually have true beach towels instead of bath towels.Hotel staff could use some major improvements; with the exception of Lawrence - what a fantastic employee!! I really can't say enough good things about him!I'd be hesitant to stay here again, it'd really depend on who I was going with  how much my fellow travelers are willing to spend. This is NOT the place to go to if you are looking for luxury  loads of amenities and perks.Lulu's - Mike, the manager is wonderful. The food is good, but limited. Hans' surf shop is fantastic! Everyone who works there is really great  helpful. Very friendly and a lot of fun. ABC shop is incredibly convenient and has everything you could need.Take the bus for $2 to Diamond head  pay $1 to climb it. Go earlier in the morning to avoid heat. If you're just looking to see part of the island, take the free shuttle to Hilo Hattie.
