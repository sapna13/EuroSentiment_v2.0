{"text":"Beautiful resort, however, lacking quite a few things. We just returned from our stay at Grand Bahia Principe Punta Cana. We had a wonderful time, since the weather was absolutely perfect. The hotel's grounds are kept very well as well as the rooms, however, here are the cons to this resort:-The food is TERRIBLE! We did not even have one good meal in any of the restaurants or buffet. Since most of our time was spent by the beach and pool area the only option for lunch was the snack bar. The snack bar consisted of stale pizza, some salads, and leftover chicken. I would NOT recommend eating in the snack bar. You are better off taking the trolley back to the lobby and eating in the main buffet area or just skipping lunch totally. We skipped quite a few meals.-The gym was a joke. I happen to exercise daily and I woke up the first morning to walk to a gym that was severally undersized for a resort of this size. They had 2 treadmills and 1 was broken. They had a total of approx. 10 pieces of equipment. There were 2 trainers present whom were using the equipment opposed to allowing the clients to use them. They actually put there towels on the machines to show they were in use. I decided to just exercise around the resort. -The safety deposit box needs to be paid upfront in order to use it. They did not tell us this. We went back to the lobby and paid the 18 dollars US. We went back to our room and the safe still didn't work ,we had to have a technician visit our room 3 times in order to fix the broken safe that never wound up fixed. -If you want a good seat by the pool make sure you are up at 6am in the morning to claim your territory. These people are up real early with their towels and belongings already on the chairs way before breakfast. I find this to be ridicolous. They should put a policy in place that you can not claim your space before you even open the pool area.-The Japanese restaurant was a joke. The chef didn't say a word to us at the hibachi table...he just cooked the food and threw it on our plate. They need some training if they want to act like a Japanese restaurant. **Dont bother eating here** or going out of your way to make reservations in any of their specialty restaurants they are all the same. Most of them are also buffets.-All the liquor in the resort is well liquor...real cheap..the kind that gives you a headache in about a minute. I didn't drink more than 1 drink the entire week. Pros:-Very pretty grounds and kept very clean.-Shuttle service is very frequent to take you around the resort.-Great excursions around Punta Cana. We took advantage of the ATV tour and Snorkeling and enjoyed both.-Pools are kept very clean and they are spacious enough to enjoy a nice swim. They are very refeshing and cool.-We enjoyed the SPA services..the SPA is very pretty and the after sun treatment was excellent.I hope this helps.
