{"text":"Very nice, but a bit dated We stayed at the Intercontinental for four nights, and had a great time. The hotel was clean and beautiful, although the room decor was a bit dated. The bed was super comfortable, and the pool and beach were clean and well maintained. The staff was very accomodating, but the best part was that they left you alone. I have been to resorts where the pool area staff hovered around you and asked if you needed anything every five minutes, but here they were visible and available, but left you alone for the most part. The beach was clean and not too crowded. The surf was a bit rough and there was a bit of an undertow, but it was fun. Just watch out for the stinging urchins! We did not eat at any of the hotel restaurants, but we did get room service and the food was just okay. We got the continental breakfast in the lobby each morning and took it down to the beach, which was great. The coffee in the lobby is so good! Overall, this was not a bad hotel, and I'd stay there again if I ever go back to San Juan. Just be sure to ask for a room overlooking the pool and ocean, since the view on the other side is not so great. Also, be aware that the hotel (and in fact all of the Isla Verde area hotels) are very close to the airport, so you will hear jets taking off and landing all day. If that will bother you, you may want to try Condado or one of the other parts of the island.
