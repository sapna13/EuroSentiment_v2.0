{"text":"A great find! Like many of you I found this hotel on Tripadvisor and have no complaints at all.The paperwork stated check in was from 2pm, we arrived in Barcelona at about 10am and went directly to the hotel to leave our cases and go for an explore before the room was ready.Upon arrival at Constanza the friendly receptionist said our room was ready and we had been upgraded to a suite. The room itself was immaculate with patio doors leading onto a terrace with table and chairs. (I have stayed in other Barcelona hotels, all of which have been dearer than the Constanza, but none of which met the same standards)The reception staff were always willing to help whether it be with suggestions on where to eat, and they were also more than happy to keep our cases in a safe room when we checked out of the room as our flight was not until the evening.Breakfast was as you would expect in any European hotel of this standard. ie coffee, juice, croissants, cheese, meats etc. Not 5* but quite sufficient.Even if you spent a great deal more on your hotel you would be hard pushed to beat Hotel Constanza. Only 5-10 mins walk to Ramblas and Barri Gothic so the location could not be faulted, and as others have stated at least you could get a good nights sleep which would not be the case if you stayed in a hotel on the Ramblas.Value for money alone it has to be given a 5 out of 5. Highly recommended!
