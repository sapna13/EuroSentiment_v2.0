{"text":"Sunny vacation near a nature reserve We stayed at the Blau Natura Park from Dec. 30\/07 to Jan. 6\/08. We are a professional couple in our early thirties. I will break up the review into sections to help.THE BEACH - Natura Park is on a section of the beach that has nice white sand. The water is clear but does have quite a bit of seaweed in it that also washed onto shore. There are many boats in the vicinity that sometimes make noise and odours. However, walking north there is an expansive nature reserve and the beach here is beautiful and water is mostly clear. There is also good snorkeling at this part of the beach. Downside is that there are obviously no beach chairs off the resort.THE FOOD - The food was good. Many options at the buffet. Sufficient choices for vegetarians and health-conscience. We did not get sick. The buffet is better than the a la carte restaurants. The beach buffet is better than the main restaurant for lunch. All night burgers\/hot dogs\/fries is also available.THE RESORT - Very nice looking and well kept. Many tropical birds throughout in man-made lagoons. The room was sufficiently clean and did not smell. The beds were also fine and were clean. Everything is in short walking distances. They were at capacity the week we went and they were not prepared. They frequently ran out of dishes at the buffet, food items, towels and restaurant reservations. The beach was also packed and they did not have enough chairs for about half of the week.SERVICE - About 75% of the service staff is either rude or indifferent. Of course there were exceptions. Although I do not expect the hotel staff to speak english, I was surprised at how little English was understood. Basic words like cup, ice, towel, toilet paper, shower and lime were not understood. I just made an effort to learn the spanish words, but it was a challenge to communicate. We had a problem with the mini-bar where somebody was taking items and we were getting charged. But we complained to our tour rep and it got fixed. We also had an issue where we were not told that it would cost $3 everytime we picked up the phone, even with a phone card or collect calls. We challenged this and the fees were cut in half.OTHER - I did not use the pool myself but it looked clean, was large and had a bar. Tennis courts were available and were in good shape. Entertainment was on the cheesy side. Very little imported alcohol and no drinks that require a blender to make. We did a Outback excursion that costs about $100 a person. It was okay, but I would not recommend it unless you really want to see some villages, the mountains and areas outside the resort. The coffee and cocoa plantation as well as the authentic Dominican restaurant did not look genuine, rather they seemed assembled for the tourists.Overall, I would return to the Blau Natura Park but I would not go at peak seasons.
