{"text":"Fabulous, especially the service! Unless the Sheraton completely restaffed their hotel between my stay and those of the negative reviewers, I cannot understand in whom the complaints regarding service are founded. Every employee we encountered was cheerful, helpful, and genuinely glad to be of service. When our taxi pulled up to the drive, the doorman, Tetley, welcomed us to Sydney and the hotel with beaming energy and was equally as friendly and cheerful throughout our stay. Check-in was pretty standard, but at least there was no wait, and our bags were sent to the proper rooms (we had two rooms on different floors). The Executive Club Lounge staff was superb. Cameron, Anders, and the entire Club staff were warm and helpful, eagerly calling restaurants to secure reservations and pulling up menus for various eateries. Food and drink service were good as well. Lobby Concierge Mike (I think that was his name...) recommended a great low-key, no frills Thai restaurant that served the best soft-shell crab I have EVER eaten. And I could never forget the housekeeping attendant from the 18th floor (I can't remember her name, though). Aside from keeping the room clean and bathroom amenities restocked, she was one of the nicest and friendliest hotel employees I have ever encountered. I found myself having conversations with her on a daily basis where she demonstrated a genuine care and interest in her guests that is rarely experienced. As I am about to begin my assessment of the room and facilities, I remember now a manager\/supervisor in the gym and spa who took it upon herself to lead my family and me on a tour of the fitness facilities when it became evident that we were first-time visitors - she was truly lovely. The gym featured Life Fitness-brand cardio equipment with individual tv screens, as well as a few weight machines, free weights, a couple benches, and two spinning bikes. There is an indoor pool and whirlpool with breathtaking views of the park and city. Locker rooms had separate men's and women's saunas and steam rooms. All in all, a nice gym, but nothing spectacular (except with regard to the views).The rooms are comfortable and modern in style. The Sealy beds were a nice break from dormitory-quality mattresses in other Australian hotels. The down comforter was heavenly, and the sheets soft, though not 100% cotton (they are a 50\/50 poly-cotton blend, which I thought I would notice but didn't once in bed). There is a desk and small sofa with a checkerboard table in each room, as well as a Philips-brand tv (27 or 30 inch, flat-screen though not flat-panel). Bathrooms are done in rich wood and black marble - beautiful. The separate shower was excellent - tremendous water pressure. Lastly there is a more than amply-sized walk-in closet in each room, which was perfect for us (traveling with huge duffel bags).My only complaint is with the soundproofing in the walls. I could hear numerous conversations from the adjacent room as well as from the hallway. To be fair, these were probably louder than normal guests, but they were still audible. This wasn't an issue for two of the four nights, but it could pose a potential problem, I guess.We didn't order room service or dine in the restaurant or bar, but the food on the club level was very good. It was nice to have a hot breakfast waiting for you every morning, and I am such a sucker for eggs, bacon, and roasted tomatoes. Afternoon canapes were primarily Asian-themed (dumplings, sushi, et al.) and good, as were cheeses and cured meats. Not a great drink selection, but they WERE pouring champagne and James Boag Premium beer (my fave). The restaurant and IRD menus were VERY pricey, but the lavish dinner buffet was half-price (or discounted in some fashion) with Starwood membership at least.In all, we truly enjoyed our stay and would love to come back were it not for the steady devaluation of the American Peso, er, Dollar. This would be our pick in Sydney without question. Fabulous.Oh, just remembered, a great amenity is the FREE internet access in the lobby for all guests. Also, check out the bar on the second level - it's beautiful.
