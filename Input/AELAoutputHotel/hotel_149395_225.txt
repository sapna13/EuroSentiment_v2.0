{"text":"Excellence May 8th - 13th, here's what you need to know... Just back from Excellence Punta Cana, May 8th - 13th. We had a great time, the place is awesome. The previous reviewer is absolutely correct so I won't rehash her great review. Here a few tidbits which we found out (sometimes the hard way).1. Airport Transfer - We booked our trip through Orbitz and did not select the transfer option. We ended up having the resort book a cab for us which was $60 each way for two. Probably could have saved some money with a tour operator. By the way, The DR charges $10 to come into the country (cash). Allegedly, they charge $20 to leave, but nobody ever collected ours.2. Calling the States - Here's where we got screwed. If you have Verizon, you can get a signal and be charged roaming. Otherwise, you can call from your room, at $4.00\/minute. There is another option, a toll-freenumber where you type in your credit card number and they connect you. DO NOT USE THIS! I tried multiple time to ask at the desk how much this was, and got blank stares. I figured, it's got to be cheaper, right? We got back to the states and found out that this was about $7.00\/minute. In addition, our card was suspended due to suspicious activity. We're still trying to figure this out. The other option is to go to the internet cafe and rent a phone. This is a cell phone which rents for $5\/day and then calling card are $10\/21 minutes. I wish would we have done this. I also wish somebody would have told me this, instead of which waitress they absolutely loved......3. Internet access - Buildings 6-14 have wireless access and you can also get on the web in the main lobby. But, do your relationship a favor and leave your geek box at home!4. Swim up Bar - My favorite part. Building 6-7directly face the swim up bar and therefore, make it easy to go to the bathroom. They are also close to the lobby\/restaurants, so it might be worth requesting.5. Tipping - I tipped a couple of bucks to the maid, bartenders, and waiters after a good meal. Be warned, the service at some of the restaurants is S L O W, particularly Agave, but hey man, you're on vacation. If you can catch the minibar guy, give him a couple of bucks and he'll change out the Presidente with Bud Light, and Red Bull.6. Beer - I hope you like Presidente. It's not bad, especially after 10 of them. It is really the only beer you can get, except at the Martini bar and a couple of others, where you can occasionally find a Bud or Bud light.7. Restaurants - You can find this elsewhere. I will say that by far, the best restaurant is the French Restaurant. Men have to wear pants at all except the Grill. Leave your cargo pants at home big guy, you're 30 now.8. Miscellaneous - You can swim up to the grill and ask for nachos. Get up early and snag a primo spot by the pool. Play beach volleyball. Go horseback riding (the free one) but don't count on ANY instruction. Also, they try to sell you stuff at the end. Go to the huts to the left on the beach. Tell the hustlers that you're going to see Nancy (that way they'll leave you alone) and she will give you a deal on stuff. About 1\/2 the price as within the resort. Cigars seem authentic. If it's your anniversary (like us) tell them ahead of time. They will have champagne in your room and give a couple other percs...I heard the shopping excursion was a rip off. Um, duh.9. One word of caution, I don't know what would have happened if we got sick or needed medical attention, there is a doctor around, but it would be a scary place to need some healthcare.10. The casino is a scam, and not very fun. At least losing is Vegas has a certain oh well, it's Vegas feel.We had a blast and have nothing negative, except the phone thing, to say. Have fun!!!!!
