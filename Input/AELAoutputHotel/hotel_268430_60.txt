{"text":"A Nice Place To Stay. Good Value Recently spent 5nights at the Marriot Courtyard Isla Verde.while attending a convention \/meeting at the Ritz CarltonHotel next door. I should prefice again, my major reason forchoosing the Marriott was its proximity to the Ritz Carltonwhere I knew I had to go each day at 7:30AM for meetings.Frankly, I couln't stomach the $475+ per night conference ratewhich my group was given for the Feb high season. So my$240\/night rate saved me about $200 a night. I was very pleasedhowever, with this resort which is on the same beach\/as theRitz Carlton\/Hoel Casino a brief 3 minute walk down a commonsidewalk. As in typical Marriott fashion my room king\/sizefaced the ocean with a small balcony with wrought iron tableand 2 seats. This was an upgrade which they offered me atno additional charge when I checked in. Maybe because Iam a Marriott Rewards\/timeshare owner. The room wa perfectfor business with a small refrig (free daily water bottles),free internet hook up, large flat screen TV with cable, pull outsofa\/bed couch with chairs in room. Daily room service withdaily replenishing of toiletries., small coffee pot\/ with Puerto Rican Cofee, and Herbal Tea bags in bathroom. I had a complimentary Rum drink at the bar. I did not eat at the restaurant as I usually like to try local ethnic food\/restaurants when I travel. There was an Ice Cream Parlor on site whichmany of the kids seemed to enjoy. Never went to the casino,beach was nice with hammocks, pool with swim up bar, quietlocation. I could walk down the beach from the Ritz Carltonto the Marriott, again same beach front property. Of coursethe Ritz Cartlon is very delux with beautifull grounds, pool,never ate there other than in conjunction with conference,and would be a fabulous place to stay for a special occassionor if money is no object, but the Marriott more than met myneeds. I ate twice for lunch and dinner at a a localCuban Restaurant Metropol , a short walk, down the road,and across the street ( take care crossing what is a busyroad to get to the restaurant). I thought the food was excellentand a great price\/value. For dinner one night had Fresh Snapper,with Cuban Beans\/rice, plantain, flan, Virgin Pina Colada, freshgarlic bread, with tip came to about $25.00. Excellent servicelocal Puerto Rican\/Cuban Food. Do'nt be afraid to takethe A5 bus which stops nearby for $0.75 cents one waytakes you into the bus terminal in OldSan Juan where you canget off and take the free Trolley around or walk the streetsto El Moro and other sites. The bus will take you through the local areas of Isla Verde, Condadda, etc and you will seewhere the local people live. The bus seems to run aboutevery 15-20 minutes until maybe 8-9:00pm at night. I tookduring the day and may once at about 7:00PM back to hotel.You will travel with the local people but there were other non-natives like myself on the bus. A cab will cost you about $20.00one way, and you can alway's find someone who speaks English, so you can save some money with the bus.My only comment about the Isla Verde Courtyard Marriott,Ritz Carlton is that you will feel like and you are very closeto the Airpot. I would have to disagree with others thatthe location is noisey, and although I couln't see the planes1 or 2 nights I felt like a plane was either landing or takingoff in my room. The flights seem to stop about midnight. soif you are there strictly for vacation\/leisure you might wantto look around for a quieter location. Feb is a great timeto go, weather in the 80\/s, very low humidity, ocean watercomfortable, nice evening breeze, loads of sun and littlerain, brief sec shower here or there at most, .
