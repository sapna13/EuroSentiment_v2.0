{"text":"Lovely Stay Great Value My husband and I had 3 nights here on the second leg of our round the world trip. We booked directly with the hotel and took advantage of their third night free deal with a free upgrade. Our room was on the 15th Floor and had a lovely partial seaview and kitchenette. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed we have ever slept on with a very comfy memory foam topper. The room was a little small but had everything we needed including internet cables for our laptop, and we particularly enjoyed having breakfast on our lanai reading the complimentary newspaper. We ate lovely pizza for lunch at the pool which as previous reviewers have said does not get the sun in the afternoon. We were glad of the shade in the afternoons having spent our mornings in blazing sun on the beach. We lazed at the pool in the afternoons eating otter pops,reading and jumping in the spa. The Wyland is in a great location for shopping and is only a 5 minute walk from the beach. We visited the sister hotel the Outrigger on the Reef and particularly recommend the bar and Shorebird Restaurant for lunch or dinner. They have an open air grill where you cook your own dinner and fab seaviews. It was so good we went back twice and was much better value with better service than the renowned Dukes. Make sure you book the Shorebird in advance, or you could have a wait for a table - every night we were there at least 10 or 15 people were hanging around waiting for tables. We really enjoyed our stay and if we are in Waikiki again will definitely return to this lovely hotel.
