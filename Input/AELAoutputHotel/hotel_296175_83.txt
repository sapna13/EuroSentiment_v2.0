{"text":"My favorite little hotel We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights during out trip to Italy. We absolutely loved this hotel! The location is excellent being so close to all the major attractions. If you are planning on taking some tours... the ArtViva\/Original Florence Walking Tours (a great tour company) is literally steps away from the front door of the hotel. When you arrive at the hotel, you have to climb a flight of stairs to get to the elevator (probably the only negative I can think of). There is a intercom that rings up to the front desk... they will send someone to greet you and help you with your bags. The front desk\/lobby area is very inviting. Fabrizio greets you when you walk into the lobby. He is extremely helpful with booking tours and transportation, and can also help with restaurant suggestions. The rooms are very nicely decorated. Each room has a laptop with internet access, a playstation 2 (video games and DVDs can be borrowed for free in the lobby) and a TV with english channels. The bathroom is updated and very clean. The air conditioning is strong.There is a small dining room next to the lobby where a breakfast bar is set up every morning... breakfast includes pastries, rolls, ham, cheese, cereal, yogurt, fruit, juice and coffee. There is also a happy hour every night (we didn't have a chance to go).I thought this was a great hotel... just so pleasant and nice. If I go back to florence, I would definately stay there again.
