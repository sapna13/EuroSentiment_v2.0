{"text":"Vey nice SummaryI visited 8 days with my wife in May, 2008, garden view room. This is a wonderful resort, and I would DEFINITELY recommend it. If you read a review with negative here and there, pay it no mind. This is a great place with good facilities, food, and service. The only negative thing I would mention is that they close the beach for swimming periodically. I think this resort gives perhaps the best overall value in the Caribbean, and certainly the best of anywhere I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been. RoomWe stayed in the garden view room (which we always call the dumpster-view!). After seeing everything, I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ recommend upgrading to any of the excellence packages or swim up rooms. The standard rooms are so nice, and you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get that much extra. The room was quite nice. It was spacious, tilled, and had a king bed with a Jacuzzi. No bugs, clean, in good working order. AND THE ROOM SAFE WORKED. This is my pet peeve with resorts, when you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ lock up your stuff. We got cute towel animals, which my wife loved. There was lots of complimentary toiletries and stuff. Maid service was good no problems with towels. PoolGorgeous pools. Very clean, very large. Bar staff wanders around and takes drink orders both at the pool and the beach (as well as delivering pizzas!). There are bars and bathrooms everywhere. Lots of shady spots. They have pool rafts too. Plenty of beach towels which they leave out, you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sign for them. The only problem in the pool area would be the usual: undisciplined fools (guests) running around trying to reserve things for the whole day, ridiculous. FoodThe food blew my wife and I away. We are not hard to please, but still, the food is amazing. First of all, they only close one or two restaurants during slow season, which they rotated, so you get to try them all. I have been to resorts that close 2\/3 of their resorts completely until busy season. So on our trip they had two restaurants for breakfast; one small one and a very large elegant buffet. The set up was about the same for lunch. These buffets are pretty awesome, like caviar etc. Then dinner is from five or six ethnic restaurants. We thought all the food was very good, although here and there we talked to a couple less enthused about a particular restaurant. BarsThere are bars everywhere and the drinks are stiff. They have a nice drink menu if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e like me and can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think of anything to order after a while.BeachThe beach is very pretty with lots of caba√Ç??as and hammocks and lounges. As I mentioned above, servers come around and offer drinks and stuff. The problem with the beach was they closed it for swimming about half the days we were there. They do this because it gets rough. There are calmer areas a short walk from the resorts, but to get to them you have to navigate some pushy hawkers (vendors). They are gorgeous and calm once you get there though. Enjoy your trip!
