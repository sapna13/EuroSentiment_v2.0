{"text":"Idyllic and Relaxing We spent 2 nights here at the start of our Honeymoon in October after our wedding in Kuala Lumpur. From the airport pickup to checkout, we couldn't have asked for a better start.We arranged for the hotel to collect us from the airport. The car was waiting with iced towels and bottled water, which was most welcome after the busy flight from KL. Upon arriving at the property, we felt like royalty. We were given orchid leys and guided to some armchairs on the veranda overlooking the sea. This is not your average check in process. One of the staff then escorted us to our private villa, making sure to point out the amenities such as the restaurants, pools and spa. The villa was amazing, with it's huge private pool and outdoor dining area. Inside was a nicely decorated bedroom and huge bathroom.The only problem was mosquitos. Leaving the door open for even a minute lets in hundreds of them. We ended up having to ask housekeeping for extra coils and bug spray to keep them under control. But to be honest, once they were gone, it did not detract from the experience at all.We had dinner at the restaurant on one of the nights. It's expensive, but the service is impeccable. The next night we made reservations for the Kecak dance being held at the amphitheatre on site. The reservation was actually for a barbecue buffet, with the table set up around the edge of the theatre. It was a sublime way to see the show.Breakfasts were at the cafe onsite too. The cafe overlooks the beach and is a nice way to start the day.On one day, we ventured out of the complex. We tried walking to shopping areas of seminyak, but after only a short distance, the heat and sun got to us and we flagged down a taxi. Luckily they are plentiful around Seminyak. Things are definitely cheaper outside, especially food. If we had more time, we would have liked to have gone out to some of the restaurants nearby.Definitely a great honeymoon spot. It never felt crowded, and the staff were all very friendly.
