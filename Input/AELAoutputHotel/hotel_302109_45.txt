{"text":"Stunning.. Stayed here for 3 nights in June 2008 on a stopover to Phuket..As it was part of my honeymoon i emailed the hotel prior to let them know and on arrival we were met at the airport (i had booked a transfer in a hotel car prior to arrival) and infomed that we had been given a complimentary upgrade to a 1 bedroom Suite in the Valley Wing (i had booked a tower wing horizon club premier room to start with)..Check in was brief and carried out in our suite by our personal butler and we were informed of all of the benefits of the Valley wing itself, too many to mention here.Complimentary champagne was available on tap at any time of the day or night in the valley wing lobby along with numerous sandwiches etc and breakfast was taken in the private summit room although we tended to opt for the line restaurant (great food and impeccable restaurant design). On a couple of nights we had cocktails in Blu, the bar at the top of the tower wing with great views over singapore.The pool area was great and generally quiet with pool staff tending to our every need.Ignore some reviewer's comments about the location of the hotel, it is about 5 minutes walk maximum from Orchard Road and taxis are everywhere if you don't fancy the walk. I had also read reviews saying that the location in Singapore was relatively out of the way for tourist spots, well i suppose it is but if you look at the fact that it is in a quiet corner of the city out of the way of the hustle and bustle..that is a positive rather than a negative, and when a taxi costs no more than √ä√£¬¢4 each way to get you to Raffles or indeed, anywhere else, i would say it's a no-brainer.I think it is also important to mention that this hotel is the flagship of a large luxury asian hotel company and as such, the design is pure asian...i think that this is something that is missed in all of the other large american hotels (four seasons etc) and is an important part of the ambience of the hotel, when in Rome, do as the Romans if you know what i mean. I could have stayed in the Four Seasons or the Ritz Carlton but they are just too generic.As a conclusion, i would say that having spent a good ammount of time at the hotel in those 3 days, i would easily class it as one of the best i've stayed in, the facilites are second to none and the staff are only too happy to help you in any way. I would love to visit Singapore again some time and i honestly couldn't imagine finding anywhere that would even come close to this place...
