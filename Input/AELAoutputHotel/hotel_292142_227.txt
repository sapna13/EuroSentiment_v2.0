{"text":"Great spot With a list of reviews like these then it was no contest as to where we booked. The staff are genuinely eager to help and the suites are spotless and very well appointed. Be sure to request a room at the front of the hotel floors 30 and above - that way you get a terrific view of uptown Mnahattan.I had mentioned when I booked that I wanted a room with a view because we were there for my partner's birthday....we got a great view on floor 33 and a birthday cake to boot!!Location is also great for the 4\/5\/6 subways through 32nd street - make sure you take the local subways because the express doesnt stop at 32nd.Foodwise there are plenty of bars, delis, restaurants in the area. Guy  Gallard on the corner of 34 and Lex does great breakfasts and Pizza Mercato next door will show you what a large  american pizza looks like. La Giara around the corner on 3rd is a pretty good italian. We used the Murray Hill deli next door to the hotel, but there is a better one a couple of blocks down towards 2nd Ave. If you like Starbucks then there is one on the corner of 34 and Lex - although be warned the queues can be long.The visitor center on the ground floor balcony at Macys will issue you with 11% discount cards for Macys and they have a load of tourist info with some good multi booking deals.We flew into Newark - the taxi cost $65 plus the tolls of about $7 I think. The hotel got us a car back for $75 so there's nothing in it.Wasnt too impressed with the Barking Dog. We tried it on night 1 because we were so tired and just needed food. You get a LOT but its no great cuisine.
