{"text":"Ghetto! We went to Punta Cana on August 1st thru August 6th.The Grand Paradise Bavaro Hotel..It was a complete DUMP.. The food was Nasty, it was either Dry, Watery, Salty everything. Nevermind the Drinks...all water down. Gave you the cheapest rum there is that if you drop some on the floor and lite a match the place would be on fire. None of the bars had Bottle water..I've never heard of such thing. The Rooms, we couldnt believe. The beds and furniture were so old that it reminded me back in the 1970's never mind the mattresses...I was just grossed out to even lay my head on the pillow. There was no TV for 3 days, not that i went to go watch TV but not even a clock radio.. The bathroom shower it was a Hand Held..you couldnt even take a relaxing shower. The AC in the room horrible, you have to keep the card in all the time because if you take it out its hot as hell in there...There were mosquitos in our room EVERY day and nite. We probably killed about 10 each day.. Had no clue where they were coming from..Most likely from the vents..On top of being hot in the room we had to cover our heads from head to toe, because they were buzzing in our ears....I had called months in advance to give us a room at least facing the pool or beach, they gave us a room facing the back driveway..and i am not kidding...and the Lobby store was in the middle of doing renovations and you couldnt even walk into to the store to buy bottle water or nothing...No more 3 start hotels for me, even though this was more like a 1 star.I have never stayed in a run-down hotel ever, nothing like this..I did read a couple of reviews before but i didnt think it was going to be this bad..Overall, I guess what it all comes down to is you get what you PAID for...
