{"text":"Very Good Time at the Melia Staying here for 10 days in August 2006. We booked a Royal Service room. Rooms was very clean and spacious. Service in the Royal Service area was good and worht the extra money. Royal service pool area was great. In other pools it was very crowded. Royal service resturant was great because you didn't ever need to make reservations. Any other resturants you always had to make reservations and the two times we tried, times and space were limited and we really didn't want to have to plan a full day in advance where and what we wanted to eat and have to call to book our reservation. All the food we ate tasted good but my wife and I did get a little sick. We don't get sick easy, never have got sick before in Mexico or anywhere else so I don't know what got us sick. I think the Royal Service really made this a good trip. I don't think I would have been very happy with out it.Punta Cana in general in a resort town. We hardly ever left the resort primarly because there is not much to do out of the resort. It is flat and not very pretty except for the beaches. The beaches have really white sand with warm clear water. We went parasailing and banana boat riding. Overall we have a good trip to the Melia in Punta Cana. I would recommend the Melia but probably will never come back to Punta Cana. Not enough in Punta Cana to do and see to bring me back. I like Hawaii much better.
