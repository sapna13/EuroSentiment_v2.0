{"text":"Location, Location, Location Two 30-something couples from New York\/New Jersey just returned from a trip to Boston -- and we spent two nights at the Millenium thanks to a great deal due to construction at the hotel. Even with the construction and a less-than-appealing makeshift reception desk, the stay was quite nice. The rooms were fabulous, with a gorgeous bathroom and a wonderful (but small) porch facing Fanueil Hall. Our only true knock is that on Friday and Saturdays there is a long-standing veggie market that sets up right in front of the hotel and above where our rooms were situated. Its hard to enjoy your porch overlooking the city when you are greeted with the stench of rotting vegetables and fruit. Not for the faint of smell! Other things to note -- if you don't valet, feel free to at least unload your bags on the side of the road. The valet failed to mention that to me when we came to ask where we should park. We didn't want to valet and used the lot across the street. When we came by with our large suitcases, he remembered that we could have at least unloaded. Also, make sure to let the hotel know that you are parked across the street. Although the valet told us to go there, they ended up being concerned that we could leave our car there overnight. They made a call and learned it would be ok, but I am supposing that they don't usually deal with non-valet drivers.Over all, a great trip and a great location. If you can afford the nightly cost, it's a sure bet. Just bring your nose plugs if you are staying the weekend!
