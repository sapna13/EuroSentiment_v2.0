{"text":"Excellent value for money I will try to be brief: I am a hotel owner, very peculiar in taste with hotels, normally stay in boutique hotels, difficult with sleep and difficult to be pleased in general. We booked this hotel via an agency as i was travelling with a friend who was on a budget and i didnt want to bother looking around and i was initially sceptical about he choice (could i have chosen i would propably opt for something like Dylan or Arena hotel). I dont know the exact rate but i think it should be around 120-140 euros for a twin with breakfast. For this price level (we were there in xmass which is apparently a,low season to them) this was a very good choice. Convenient location, near but not on the sleezy red lights and very near the 3 beautiful canals (dont remember the names). We got a 5th floor room and it was biggy and confortable with pleasant street views, nice bed, clean and mora than aynything quiet (no noice from neighboring rooms). We were treated in a prof way albeit impersonal (which was still ok). Few negatives which didnt spoil my good feeling: Boring breakfast in an unatractive room (why couldnt they have a more interesting and richer range of cheeses?), dated and more like a 3* bathroom (but not small).Overall if you can get a good rate and a top floor room and if you dont mind this kind of impersonal feeling this is a good pick.To end, Amsterdam is a very pretty city, perfect for a city break (boring for more than 3 nights), with expeptionally polite people and a very bohemian-youngish charm!!
