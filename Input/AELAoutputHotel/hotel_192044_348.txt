{"text":"Superb - couldn't fault it! My first piece of advice would be to shop around for a deal on this - I used Skoosh.com (with 5% discount) on one night and Ebbookers for another night (worked out about √ä√£¬¢90 a night) - as it worked out the cheapest way. The only problem with this is that they hotel can only see one room at a time so make sure you phone and let them know what you have done and then you won't have to change rooms during your stay!However, the hotel itself is spotless, the staff friendly and polite and the rooms were really nice and well equiped. We had a disabled room (although we are not disabled it was allocated to us anyway!) - and by looking at the plans of rooms, it was more spacious than others (room 310). The complementary bottles of water and copies of The Telegraph were appreciated, as were the White Company toiletries in the bathroom. The bathroom was spotless again, the bath a little small (but at least there is one unlike many London hotels!), but lovely big white towels (changed daily whether you leave them on the rails or not!!!!).The breakfast is now superb - we asked how much it would cost for us to upgrade from continental to cooked (as the former was already in our deal) and we weere told that they don't charge anymore - we could have the cooked for nothing extra! Superb! The choices are superb as well; yogurts, meats, cheeses, rolls, toast, muffins, pastries, a wonderful fruit salad, full English cooked buffet as well!My only problem with the breakfast if you are in a couple is that the 2 people tables in the middle are seated very very close together and it felt as though I was sitting on the next persons table, which was a little uncomfortable. However, if you are early or in 3+ groups you will avoid these rather close 2 people tables!!!The only other thing you may need to be aware of is that the rooms automatically lock (or ours did!) at 12 noon check out - we were 3 minutes late and had to go down to reception to get back into our room to collect our luggage and check out. However, the staff at reception were lovely and apologised for this (even though it was me in the wrong!) and happily unlocked the room for me!We never tried Londonium restaurant but we did go to Georgetown next door - don't bother - the food is over-priced (even though we used the 2 courses for √ä√£¬¢18 deal!) and you hardly get anything for your money. It was like meals we had purchased on holiday in Turkey for a fiver, whereas in Georgetown they were 3 times this, and not as tasty! Although staff in the restaurant were polite and efficient, the food was rather dull. We came out and bought a sandwich as we were still hungry!!!!!Location-wise its not in a posh area, but we didn't feel unsafe either. Its right next to the tube - a 2 min walk (London Bridge tube) and theres loads of pubs and restaurants nearby - for example Slug and Lettuce and some more traditional pubs just down the road.Would I stay again? Yes definitely. For the price we paid we had a spotlessly clean room, good facilities (inc. a 32 inch TV!), the staff superb, and the location was handy.
