{"text":"SAD SHAPE DIRTY and NO CS Stayed at the Medina Grand Sydney on Kent from 26-30 April, 2008 for business. I have had a terrible experience I spoke to reception starting the first night regarding: internet questions-said can't help you, a bunch of people were in the hotel and very loud\/partying, cig. smoke coming into my room via the air vents, screaming at the elevator and the room was dirty (stain splatters on the curtains\/stains on the carpet\/in the shower). I called reception and was treated rudely and told: we are full just mail the comment card in. I asked for a manager on duty and told try tomorrow morning no one is hear that can help you. Then I went down to plead with reception (another person) to help me the next morning, The offer was to move me (to a lesser room-no view and on a lower floor) or I have to pay more for a better room (only thing better was the view). I had a fine view bbefore it was the filth and noise and cigarette smoke that was the problem. Then spoke to the manager and he said nothing we can really do, and then sent a note to me for a $40 credit- that is it! So much for hospitality or working with your customers. My internet was all that may cover for the 4 days. I am back to the hotel on last night and my final straw . The temp control was not working and my room was very hot. They said they have gone to heat and I can not use the temperature control in my own room to lower how hot it is-they have central control so I have to suffer with it being to hot. I am at my end with it hear and can't wait to leave.This hotel is in a good location for the city (close to the harbor) but it is Sad Sad Sad and in desperate need of a complete renovation from staff to rooms. If it is the cheapest then maybe stay but no way would I ever come here again. Terrible! ","annotations":[]}
