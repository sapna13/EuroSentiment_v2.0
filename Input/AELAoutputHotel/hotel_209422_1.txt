{"text":"Good Hotel for Singles The Hilton Waikiki Prince Kuhio hotel is a basic Hilton hotel which is best enjoyed by single travelers, whether for business or pleasure. There isn't much to do for families. I stayed on the Executive Level, and my room was quite inexpensive by Hawaii standards. I considered it a great deal. The room was clean, recently remodeled, and being on the 35th floor, had a fantastic view of the ocean. The executive lounge is in temporary quarters in a level below the lobby. I hope that when an executive lounge is finished on a high floor, the lounge is able to accommodate more food choices. Breakfast is all cold foods, with Starbucks coffee. There are two large flat screen TVs to watch. It's a cozy place, and, most of the time I could find a place to sit and eat. The evening reception consists of one hot dish, veggies, breads, cookies, cheese and grapes, coffee, and soft drinks. The staff throughout the hotel was accommodating. The pool is on the 10th floor, where it was extremely windy to the point where small tables went flying. My only real criticism is the restaurant. MAC 24\/7 is on the lobby level and is open all the time. After the third time I ate there, I decided never to return. The service is mediocre to awful. The worst experience was when I was seated and had to wait over 15 minutes (you know it's bad when you start counting time) for a waiter to take my order. The breakfast menu is unrealistic. Pancakes are 14 inches in diameter and three are served per order at a cost of $15. I asked the waiter if I could order a single pancake (since 3-14 pancakes were enough for a whole family), and he said I could, but it would still cost me $15. Enough about the negative. We had a power outage throughout the entire island one night, and I want to complement the management for the way they handled it. Emergency generators came on immediately (which meant the elevators worked), and once management knew the nature of the problem, they made several calming announcements over the PA system. Would I stay here again? I might since I'm a Hilton HHonors member. If I weren't, I'd probably stay elsewhere. For a family, a larger resort-type hotel might be better.
