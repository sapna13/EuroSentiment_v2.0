{"text":"Great Value I chose this hotel based on reviews and was very happy with my choice. The great exchange rate meant I only ended up paying √ä√£¬¢70 per night as I got a weekly rate. A lot of the hotels I looked at in Seattle wanted √ä√£¬¢100 to √ä√£¬¢120 per night or more for nothing special. OK so it's a little bit outside the centre of the city but our lakeview room was nice and quiet because of that. We walked sometimes but that wasn't always easy because some of the roads were very busy and hard to cross. We used the hotel shuttle to go out in the morning and never had any problems getting a seat on it. The day we left they even took us to pick our hire car which wasn't one of their usual stops. We also used the 70 bus which stops close by the hotel and runs down 3rd Ave in the city centre (only a short walk from many tourist spots and the shops). Our room was clean and comfortable ( a few more towels would have been nice though) and the staff were friendly and helpful. The complimentary breakfast was one of the better free breakfasts I've had in a hotel. There was free internet access in the business centre and the laundry facilities were free. Overall I feel the price I paid was very good for the standard of facilities provided and I would definately consider Silver Cloud Inn properties if I ever stay in the Seattle area again. Oh, and if you like Thai food I recommend Siam On Lake Union which is only a short walk away. ","annotations":[]}
