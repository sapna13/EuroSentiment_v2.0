{"text":"Not Bad, Good Value, Dated but Clean Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Jolly Carlton. The Hotel itself isnt bad, I give it 3 stars out of 5 . The room we got was 2 beds, the beds are not that comfortable, definetly dated. The carpet, room furniture and TV are very dated. But most importantly everything was clean, sheets and bathroom included. The bathroom is actually very nice. We stayed in room 316 , which seemed very lucky since the view was excellent, opening up to a nice little street , and it had a terrace. Internet is expensive in the hotel at .35 Euro per minute. There were about 4 English networks on the TV. Location of the Hotel was superb. Bars,Coffee shops, flower market, shopping , and nice resturants very close. Almost everything is in walking distance - Including Red Light , museums , Brewery and Central Station. The Zoo was a bit of a walk but only because I think we got lost. I would reccomend this hotel for a short, budgeted stay. But if you could afford more and need to be pampered look elsewhere. I would equate it to a Holiday Inn or Best Western in the USA. There is room service from the Italian restaurant beneath the hotel, the restaurant has excellent Brick Oven pizza, there;s also a great Chinese resturant on the corner. There's a Dutch Supermarket called Albert Heijn that is a 2 minute walk and is a great place to pick up snacks for the room. All in all the hotel was satisfactory, the sanitized bathroom is the biggest selling point.
