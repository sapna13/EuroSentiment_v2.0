{"text":"Great Location, Friendly staff, Excellent Breakfast..... Stayed in this hotel from 24 dec 2008 for 3 nights. reservation was done through travelocity for US$156.34 per night including free breakfast for 2. during checkin, requested to have the room in the south tower but was told that additional S$50 for the upgrade. rejected it and was put on the 19th floor in the north tower. this is my first time staying in fairmont. the room had a king size bed, a balcony, bathtub, minibar full of beverages, a nice selection of tv channels. the room looks a bit old due to the wooden furnished. you can double confirm this when you checkout the wooden bathroom door. but besides this, the accessories in the room are top notch. you do not need to bring toiletries at all. they have shampoo, conditioner, moisturizer, dental kit, sewing kit, mouth wash, hair dryer, iron + ironing board, umbrella, bathroom slippers and the list goes... The TV is a flat screen CRT which is ok and nothing fancy. feather liked pillows is nice and soft. there are also some magazines to read. the room had a magnificent view facing towards the Singapore Plaza direction. the room gets cleaned up twice a day. In the morning and late afternoon which is a plus. the morning breakfast can be taken either at the 8th floor near to the swimming pool or at 2nd floor in the plaza market restaurant. the food serve at the swimming is more limited. i feel like it targets more for the western tourist since it lacks of the eastern cuisine but it is enough of you are a light eater. pasteries, cereals, buns, juices, fruits etc. plaza market restaurant however has a more variety of food. they have the fruit juice station where you can request to have your own fruit mixed! u also get to taste some of the eastern cuisine like curry chicken, roti prata, sambal, congee(porridge), soup. From my observation, most of the staff working here are from the mainland china although English is well understood and conversed. Overall, the service was excellent and the hotel was clean.
