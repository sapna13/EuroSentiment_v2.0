{"text":"Useful Hospital Info We vacationed at the Iberostar Bavaro in August. The resort is absolutely beautiful and staff extremely friendly. The immaculately kept grounds with roaming peacocks provide excellent diversion from the beach and pool (as if one needs a diversion from the breathtakingly gorgeous beach). Our 2-year-old also enjoys the little pirate-themed playground. Based on my experience, all the positive comments I read here is true. The only complaint we have is that the marble bathroom floor can be very slippery when wet because the floor mat is way too small. I slipped and fell while holding my son √à√\u2020\u2022?he got a slight fracture on his collar bone! While we were there, our 2-year old also developed an ear-infection. The front desk sent a golf-cart to take us to the onsite medical center. The nurse at the center confirmed the ear infection. Since she couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ write prescription for antibiotic, she produced a detailed report and called a cab for us to go to the local hospital. The hospital, Hospiten Bavaro, caters specifically to tourists so the staff all speaks excellent English. The facility is clean, calm, modern and quite adequate. We only waited a short time before the pediatrician showed up. She examined my son, confirmed the ear infection diagnose and dispensed antibiotics with detailed instruction. She also wrote a prescription for us to take on the return trip in case the airport security has question regarding the medication. The entire process is as smooth as it can be even by American standards. Here are some additional details:√à√\u2020\u2022?The fee for the Iberostar onsite medical consultation is $90 for regular hours and $125 for after hours. If you think you will need antibiotics or any prescription-strength medicine, just go straight to the hospital. √à√\u2020\u2022?The cab fare from hotel to hospital is $26 one-way. It takes about 30 minutes and does go through some poor parts of the town.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------√à√\u2020\u2022?The hospital is called Hospiten Bavaro. *** Address: Hospiten Bavaro, Carretera Hig√Å√∫√¢ey - Punta Cana. *** Phone number: +1 (809) 686 14 14. *** Website: http:\/\/www.hospiten.es\/hospiten\/HOSPITEN\/published_en\/DEFAULT\/con_hospitales.jsp?CATID=77PRDID=2065--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------√à√\u2020\u2022?The hospital does not accept American health insurance. The doctor√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ fee was $220 and Antibiotic (Augmentin) was $24. They accept cash and major credit cards. Our little boy was much better shortly after taking the antibiotic. Later that day, the housekeeper brought a delightful little flower arrangement for him. It was very sweet.  Obviously we did not enjoy our vacation as much as we anticipated, but we would definitely recommend this resort to family and friends. We would just caution them to through down a big bath towel on the floor when they first enter the bathroom! ","annotations":[]}
