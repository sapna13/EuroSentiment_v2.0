{"text":"Would Love to Go Back! When we planned a trip to Seattle, the University Inn was recommended by several friends, so I read the good reviews here and booked it. My email correspondence was handled quickly and in a friendly manner, so I had a good feeling before I even arrived.Our flights were late, so we were probably not in the best mood when we arrived near 11 p.m., but the desk staff was very nice. Unfortunately, they did not hold a king-size room for us----they had told me previously that they would try, but couldn't guarantee it---but when we arrived in our room and opened the window, we were looking right out at the Space Needle, so that was some consolation...then in the morning, we could also see Mt. Rainier--a pretty great Seattle view!Our room was large and clean with a window that opens. The next day, they moved us to an equally attractive room (just down 2 floors) with a king bed. Internet access was easy, room service was great, used the car service---it was all first-rate.Note that we were in the newer section and it was wonderful. My niece from Seattle came looking for us one day and instead of coming to the second floor in the newer\/updated section, she turned the wrong way and went into the older section and said it was a mess. When she got to the right area, she said WOW, what a difference....so I guess if you can't be guaranteed a room in the newer\/nicer area, maybe you shouldn't book until after the renovations are done this fall?We LOVED this hotel and highly recommend it.
