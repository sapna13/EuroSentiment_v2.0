{"text":"Fabulous Hotel and Great location My Fiance and I stayed here the 2nd Dec for 6 nights this year. You couldn't miss the hotel. it looked like a little house in the middle of all the tall Buildings. Really pretty on the outset, and twinkling with all the christmas lights. the doormen were extremely helpful and very polite. reception was quick and easy. the rooms were quite large with a king size bed and the bathrooms was huge. good shower, bath. large mirror over the sink, the length of the bathroom. and a long mirror on the door. the bedroom also had a desk and laptop connections, a chest of drawers, coffee maker, mini bar filled with orange and apple juice,beer, wine champagne, water, soft drinks, whiskey, Vodka and Bacardi. a couple of grenola bars as well. although quiet expensive it was nice to just be able to have a night cap while watching TV after a grooling day of shopping. the hotel also had a spa and swimming pool although we did not make use of these amenities. the bar in the hotel was very nice but had no atmosphere really. Rooms service to the room was quiet dear. for a continatal breakfast and Banana pancakes 2 cups of coffee, 65$. so we did that once and spent the rest of the holiday going to Quincy market where they do food from all over the world at doesnt cost much. the location of the hotel is Great!! 4 mins to walk to quincy market or macys, and 5 mins from the aquarium! Excellant. 4 miles from the airport. all in all this hotel i found was great, bit pricey but worth it for the bit of luxury.
