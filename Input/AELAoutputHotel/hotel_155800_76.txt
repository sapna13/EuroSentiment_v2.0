{"text":"Sad about bed bugs \/hotel service While the hotel has done decent renovations to rooms, the service needs renovating. All the stories about the pool issues are true and while I cant think of a solution I just got up at 6:30 am to get my spot like everyone else who discovered this a day later upon arrival.The biggest problem I am dealing with right now are the bed bug bites (about 100) that are all over my body, they are not from gnats as they say since they are in spots that my bathing suit covers. It is so upsetting because they really itch. And I am hoping that none came home with me.!!! My room was 333. After reading all about bed bugs on the internet I realize that I do have the bites and to inspect my bed before sleeping in it...... And possibly reading a review would be helpful too.!!In addition our glasses were never cleaned (lip gloss on them for 3 days) and sheets were not cleaned when requested. For three of the 5 days I had no top sheet. And on one of the days we came back to the room at 5pm and the room had not even been cleaned! Upon check out we discovered that someone had made local calls in our room which they did take off the bill. When we asked the consigliere to make dinner reservations for us they never did and we had to call back the next night to ask again. When we told the front desk about the many situations they didn't even make eye contact or even apologize!  The gym was nice and the lobby is great!! ","annotations":[]}
