{"text":"Do not deserve 5 stars My wife and I stays at this hotel from Nov 1st to Nov 8th 2007. WE WERE NOT ROYAL SERVICE GUEST, SO NO SERVICE AT ALL! We did a lot of trips in Caribbean and normally go to 3 stars hotels and for the first time we decided to go for a 5 stars and we have been VERY disappointed of your hotel there..Here is pros and cons of our stay.:--------------CONS-------------No Royal Service = No service at all! We did not took the royal service (servicio real) because we was thinking it was a 5 stars hotel anyway. Seriously, if you don't take Royal Service, this hotel become a 3 stars hotel. 1-Royal service have nice golf cart shuttle to go everywhere each two minutes. Normal guest have to wait 15 minutes MINIMUM for the train shuttle and then it takes a slow 15 minutes ride to go to the beach. 2-Royal service have a bar on the beach. Normal guest must walk 8 minutes to walk to the nearest pool bar. 3-Royal service are served faster, better than anyone else. At the bars, restaurants, guest service, etc. If you are not Royal service you have to wait everywhere and poor service without smiles. At this hotel, guest that don't take royal service are not appreciated!!!! I just believed it was a 5 stars Melia hotel for everybody, not just for royal service.-About 6 times EACH days staff were trying to enrol us in any kind of Sol Melia reward programs. At the restaurant, in the lobby, on the beach, at the pool...ANYWHERE! It was the most annoying thing of our whole trip! Staff at the hotel were more annoying than local flea market sellers on the beach. Each day at the Turey buffet restaurant the hostess was asking us our room number without telling us why. When we asked why she wanted our room number, she told us that the reason was to send somebody to come visit us in our room to talk about reward programs.-There is a lot of promotion everywhere about the seafood in the restaurant of this hotel. We got shrimps only one day and that's it. Nothing else!!-There was a casino in the hotel, the Casino Palma Real. About 20% of the slot machines did not worked and it was not indicated, so I have lost money in broken machines!!!-Currency exchange office was closed all time of our stay.-On-site accommodations prices are ridiculous. Example .: A small solar cream bottle for 20 USD.!! -On the beach there is no toilets, no bars (except for royal service guest !?!?), nothing! Yes there is activities but when you try to do something (Example: volleyball) you can only have the ball at a specific time. If you want to play volleyball in the morning the beach staff said no sorry, the volleyball it's only on the afternoon. It's ridiculous!--------------PROS-----------------Great for families. There a lot of things to do for kids (private pool, activities all day long, night show for kids, good babysitting program). And there is refrigerator in all rooms.-A lot of excursions and activities available.-Good air conditioning in restaurant and rooms.-Food is awesome. A lot of different type of food. Excellent food quality.-All is beautiful and CLEAN.: Rooms, restaurants, outdoor facilities, etc.-There is a nice shopping center near the hotel (5 min walk) with a Hard Rock Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ restaurant.-Evening entertainment are great!-VERY SAFE. A lot of security guards everywhere.--------------------------------------------------------------Finally it is a great hotel IF you take Royal service only!
