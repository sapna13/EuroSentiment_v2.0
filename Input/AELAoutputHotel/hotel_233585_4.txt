{"text":"An Honest Review Hotel Duquesne Eiffel is a small hotel rated at 3 stars. Comparing to other hotels of similar class, the room size is a bit small but very clean. The furnishings are new, tasteful and comfortable. They have free Internet access which is a plus. However, their elevator is small and made a jerking motion everytime it stops at a floor. After using it several times, we got the hang of it. Location is very good since it is near a Metro station and some notable spots like Rue de Cler, and the Eiffel Tower. Area also felt very safe.Glitch we experienced during our stay was that the hotel staff who checked us in did not give us a complete orientation. Finding our room was a bit difficult since the hallways were dark. The motion sensitive lights in the hallways on our floor did not always work. Also, staff did not tell us on how to turn on the lights in our room. We were supposed to insert the card key in the light switch to turn on the power. Then our safe did not have a key and we were given the option to leave our valuables in the front desk. Not that we did not appreciate the effort by Julie. Thanks to her we were able to go around the city without worrying about the safety of our travel documents, etc. Jessica was equally helpful in giving tips on which sights to see and also provided logistics on how to get to those places. Even the guy who checked us in was helpful in providing us hot drinking water late at night for my grandmother's tea. Probably he just needs more training on how to entertain guests. Lastly, breakfast could use more variety. They served eggs and ham everyday. Maybe they can mix it up with bacon and sunny side up some other days.Overall, we enjoyed our stay in this hotel and would therefore recmommend it.
