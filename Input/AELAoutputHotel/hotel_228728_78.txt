{"text":"Centrally located - worked perfectly for us We loved this hotel - not perfect, but perfect for us. Here are some details. Our stay: 2\/18\/07 - 2\/24\/07Booking: Very easy - we used Marriott Reward PointsLocation: Excellent. A VERY short walk (5 minutes) from the Tuileries Metro station and only 10 minutes to the Louvre, 15 minutes to the D'Orsay, 45 minute walk up the Champs-Elysees to the Arc, about the same to the Eiffel Tower. Every thing could be walked to within one hour - but the easy Metro Access gave us many choices and the RER station at the D'Orsay gave us direct access to Versaille as well. ***Warning - the Metro ticket machines do not accept American Credit Cards or paper euros. If you plan to use the machine, bring coins. ****Warning #2 - the Tuileries metro ticket window was not open on Saturday morning at 7:30AM when we were leaving for the airport (CDG) - so without enough coin change, we were unable to buy tickets directly to the airport. It required exiting the system while still within zone 1 (which is all the change we had) to buy tickets to the airport from a staffed ticket booth.Check-in: Wonderful. Staff was very pleasant and had our room ready when we arrived at the hotel shortly after 12 Noon. Room: As advertised in other postings, a little small. Very nice, very modern (flat screen); but limited drawer space. Our room was on the first floor with a balcony to an interior courtyard. Very Quiet. Bathroom: Very nice, but again, as other postings have stated - the shower leaks a lot. This could be solved rather easily in my opinion by putting a flange on the bottom of the door to capture and redirect water back into the shower instead of allowing it to fall outside the door onto the bathroom floor. Smoked glass bathroom doors (both from the room and to the shower and toilet provide little privacy when the lights in the bathroom are on. There is enough ambient light though from the room, so when we wanted privacy, we just left the bathroom light off.Service: Excellent. If we left the Privacy sign on the door, we were left alone; even when we forgot, they always knocked and made sure that it was OK to come in. When we were out, the room was cleaned quickly and well; regardless if we had left the Privacy sign out all day and removed it at 6PM. Even at that hour they cleaned without our request. Nightly turn down service was also provided (when the Privacy sign was not on the door) with tasty chocolate suckers brought to the room.Price: As mentioned, we booked the room with Marriott Reward points, however, we upgraded to the Deluxe Room - which provided a larger room and a full breakfast for 3 of us each day. The charge for this upgrade was 60euro per day, which we considered reasonable.Restaurant: Breakfast - Wonderful - eggs to order or scrambled eggs, sausages, bacon, toast, fruit, cheeses, sliced meats - we ate there everyday (to take advantage of our deluxe upgrade).Dinner - Very popular and the menu looked good, but the one night that we decided to eat there for dinner, there were no reservations available. This was fortunate for us as the Concierge recommended a wonderful neighborhood restaurant only 5 minutes walk down the same street - which served great food and even better atmosphere.Excercise Room, Spa, Pool - very nice. In the basement and underutilized. We enjoyed a relaxing swim and sauna.Overall - perfect for us. We would love to be pampered at the Four Seasons, but can't afford that type of experience (yet). This hotel had very friendly staff, a comfortable bed, and was a GREAT LOCATION for touring. We would definitely return to this hotel!
