{"text":"Good Experience After reading the most recent reviews of the Copthorne King's, I had very low expectations for my stay during the Easter break. Service was much better than I expected, everyone spoke to me in a courteous and professional manner. There was a number of minor irritations but I was able to brush them off as I had plenty of positive experiences during my stay. For example, after settling into my room on the 17th floor in the Tower Wing, I discovered an ashtray. I don't believe I specified a nonsmoking room when I made the reservation or was given a choice. There was a strong smell of perfume while the fan was on, and when it was off, a smell of smoke was noticeable. I liked the room, an odd-shaped room with a nice view of the Furama hotel next door as well as a garden below. I had the fan on most of the time, and that seemed to blank out the smell of smoke so I didn't ask for a room change. The bathroom didn't have a normal-size bathtub but a half-tub with the back elevated so you could sit on it. It would have been nice to lie in the bathtub but the half-tub was not too bad. I ordered room service for breakfast, filling in the order and putting it outside the door before 3 am. The order was delivered on time but one egg was missing. I only discovered this after the waiter had gone. I didn't have to specify I wanted 2 eggs since that was what was on the menu. The hotel's location is not as inconvenient as some have suggested. It is a short walk to Great World City, which is a nice mall with plenty of shops and restaurants. It is right next to the Miramar hotel, which is a stop on the Hippotours. And it is across from Saiboo Street, where you can access the river leading to Clarke Quay. I booked the hotel a month ago and got a US99 rate on Expedia for Friday to Sunday. This was my first time at the Copthorne and at a hotel in the Havelock Road area, so I wasn't expecting much. There were plenty of instances when I had to contact the hotel about something, and each instance was promptly resolved to my satisfaction. There were more positives than negatives from this experience and I would certainly consider staying at the Copthorne King's again.
