{"text":"Enjoyed our stay at the Caribe Hilton Stayed one night post cruise. Main building 3rd floor. Room 318. I thought the room was just fine. Not a great view because we overlooked the roof of the main reservation area, but we were here only one night. The bed was extremely comfortable, the shower had plenty of hot water and water pressure. I did not have any type of smell in my room. The hallway smelled a tad musty, but it has to be because of all the moisture being right on the water.The pool, swim up bar and view of the ocean are just incredible.The pool area was not as clean as I would have expected from a Hilton property, but not disgusting. I don't know why people think it's ok to come from the beach into the pool to wash their feet. We smelled no odors while outside by the pool. (We had read and heard of this before. In fact, my husband was here last year and there was a very bad smell at that time out by the pool.We had drinks and ate burgers and appetizers at the swim up bar. the 8oz bacon cheeseburger with fries for $11 was very good. I thought $7 for a Corona and $3 for fountain cola was a bit pricey. We did not eat at the hotel. We went to Haceinda Don Jose for some great Mexican\/Puerto Rican food instead.I liked the hotel enough that I would stay here again.Our main building room was fine, but my understanding is the Villa rooms are much nicer. We met a couple who were 1\/2 thru a 2 week vacation that were initially in the Villa section but switched to the main building to be closer to everything. She said it took 15 minutes to walk from their Villa room to the main area of the hotel.
