{"text":"Beautiful Place, Awful resort It is pretty comical to me to see the reviews on this website. Before I vacationed at the Grand Paradise Bavaro in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic I went to this site, and snarled at these people. At first, I imagined that they were a bunch of ritzy people that didn't get 110% of the hotels attention during their stay. So, I put all this aside and decided that I was going to enjoy this vacation despite the skeptical reviews it had gotten. To my dismay, I was completely wrong. Nothing about the negative reviews were false in the least. Each and every problem that I had previously read about the resort my friends and I had experienced, generally every day. To start, our AC was terrible. Coincidentally, when we had gone to the front desk there was a line of people complaining about the same thing. The staff was completely unprofessional and furthermore, rude. On our first day, the shower broke and it took almost a half an hour for a maintenance man to come fix it, only to realize that after he left it was broken even more. We never had towels in our room and the door to our balcony was broken (which was quite reassuring). The line to make dinner reservations was about an hour long, with ONE extremely unhappy worker helping. As our turn neared, she laughed at us when we said we were confused as to how this situation was supposed to work. Now, let me add that I am born and raised in New York, and if I can hold my tongue, so can she. Despite the many, many complications we had faced during our stay, the resort itself was beautiful. Like all of the other reviews stated, it was everything i pictured, and more. The pools were fantastic and the beach was perfect. There was always something going on, shows every night, and the entertainment by the pools and in the club were great! Since I was vacationing with my four friends, you can imagine that we never really had a dull moment.I would- without a doubt in my mind- recommend vacationing in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, but trust me, pay the extra couple bucks and stay somewhere else.
