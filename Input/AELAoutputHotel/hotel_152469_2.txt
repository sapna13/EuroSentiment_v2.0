{"text":"Ok Stay, not as it used to be My recent visit to the Nikko was late November 2007.When we go to Mexico City most of the times we stay at The Nikko. Many famous people stay here. First day we had the opportunity to see the President of Mexico going to a meeting. (On a visit in the 90√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ I was riding the elevator with Ms. Margaret Thatcher.) Another day we met Ms. Guevara who has won many medals for Mexico. Also we saw singers and bands.There are many restaurants and shops around the area, good transportation from private limo to subway station Auditorio. Since I mention Limo I should recommend two limo drivers one is Jose Arturo Soria Lopez who works for the hotel. He is a very nice man who provides good service. The other driver was Jose Silva Vallejo, he was assigned to us by a third party. Mr. Silva is at the Sheraton Maria Isabel on Reforma Ave. He was always on time. He also speaks English and helped my husband with some translations. We always felt safe and in good hands. The hotel is in Polanco neighborhood. The location is very good. The Nikko is close to Chapultepec. Ask for a room with a view. A fiew blocks away you can find the Auditorio Nacional and several museums. If you want to do the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??urisbu√à√\u2020\u2022? the stop is very close by the hotel. Polanco has many shops and restaurants but if you want to eat in the hotel they have at least 4 restaurants. Food at Teppan Grill restaurant is good, however if you are allergic to something be extremely cautious. After I told the waiter I was allergic to shrimps, he did not pay attention and serve dumplings with shrimps instead of the beef I ordered. It was a good thing they were bite size with little pices of shrimp; and I realized it was shrimp after the first dumpling. So I only got swollen half of the face. You may think they apologized for that, think again. El Jardin restaurant is not as good as it used to be, but it is ok. We had good meals at O√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ei restaurant. Some night we went to listen live music they had at the lobby bar. There are some rooms that have been remodel and those cost more. The staff was always very friendly and nice but I notice some changes. We order many times room service and some times took a lot of time for them to deliver. It was the same story to have them to take the food cart out of the room. It took them the whole morning and part of the afternoon to do so. We also used the laundry services; they deliver the cloths very late at night. The employee apologized and told me they were only 3 persons for the whole hotel to do the laundry job. Make me think the hotel cut off on employees. That explains why they were later than normal to deliver services.
