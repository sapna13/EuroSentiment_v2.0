{"text":"Overrated but still a good stay From the reviews on this hotel I expected to be blown away with an amazing hotel experience but left a little disappointed.On arrival I was disappointed by the decor being somewhat dated my todays standards. It wasn't run down, but just dated. My bags were promptly delivered to my room and followed shortly afterwards by a welcome pot of tea. Complimentary fruit was also provided during my stay. Rooms are a good size by HK standards. Quality bathroom toiletries (L'occitane). Bed linen and comfort very good. Slightly noisy air conditioning (rattling vent). Work desk was well lit with desk lamp and fortunately they also had several international power sockets (I had left my converter behind). LCD TV in room plus a small TV in bathroom.Good quality buffet breakfast at usual high 5-star hotel prices. Chinese restaurant on the bottom floor was fantastic but pricey.Gym was well appointed. Home made lemonade was refreshing after a workout. I also enjoyed a good quality swedish massage during my stay through the Hotel's spa. Change rooms for gym also include spa, sauna and steamroom. Location is great. Hotel is positoned above a large shopping mall with upscale stores. Short walk through mall takes you to the MTR station which is awesome. HK have the best trains in the world!On the negative side, i had some issues with my account on checkout. My room rate included HK$500K per day credit for hotel services (food, spa treatments etc) but their computer system seemed to struggle with how this applied on bills. Took several interations to get the bill right. hotel staff were friendly and couteous through the process but it was time consuming.My summary would be that this is a very nice hotel but it's priced higher than it deserves - even with the special rate I had.
