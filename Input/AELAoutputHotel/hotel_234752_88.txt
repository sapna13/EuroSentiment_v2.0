{"text":"A wonderful city hotel in downtown Boston. My wife and I just returned from weekend getaway at the Nine Zero in Boston.Hotel and Location: The Nine Zero is a deluxe boutique hotel located near the northeast corner of Boston Common adjacent to the Freedom Trail. The Nine Zero is within walking distance of the Public Garden, the Government Center, the Theater District, Faneuil Hall, the North End (Little Italy) and downtown restaurants, shopping and nightlife. There's also a nearby T (subway) station about a block away. We found the hotel to be so conveniently located that once we handed our car keys to the valet at check-in, we didn't need them again until we checked out. The hotel's somewhat minimalist decor can best be described as urban chic. The hotel offers complementary wine tastings nightly in the hotel lobby, which is a fantastic amenity. The Nine Zero's well-trained staff is very professional, gracious and accommodating.Room: As a Kimpton in Touch member I got a very reasonable One Day Sale rate of $209 for a King Premier Room (compared to the $279 weekend rack rate). I must admit that due to the territory-marking behavior of dogs I was skeptical of staying at a pet-friendly property, but my concerns were unfounded. The room was very clean and stylishly decorated. The extremely comfortable king-sized bed had plush linens, a warm down comforter and the softest down pillows we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever slept on. The marble bathroom was very nice and my wife loved the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ deluxe toiletries. The room and bathroom were more spacious than most standard city hotel rooms. Among the many appreciated in-room amenities were chocolate truffles and raspberries at nightly turndown. For those travelling on business, there's free high speed Internet and wireless connectivity in each room. Dining: We had dinner at KO Prime, an innovative steakhouse located on the hotel's second floor. KO Prime is an extraordinary restaurant named after renowned Executive Chef Ken Oringer (formally of the Boston Eliot Hotel's Mobil 4-Star restaurant Clio). The appetizers, sides, entrees and desserts were all delicious, portions were generous, the service and presentation were superb and the wine list was impressive. The restaurant's hip atmosphere was trendy but refined. Like most fine restaurants, KO Prime is somewhat pricey - plan on spending $100 per person for a four-course dinner not including wine (if you order the Kobe Beef, plan on spending at least twice that per person). Most of the reds on the wine list were priced between $100 to $150 per bottle (there were few offerings below that). In fact, my only complaint about the restaurant is that the wine list markup seemed excessive to me. (I have a small wine cellar at home consisting mainly of Barolo, Barbaresco and red Bordeaux, so I consider myself to be pretty good at cherry picking limited-production\/good value reds off of restaurant wine lists). These days, I can usually find a very good\/delicious 1996-2001 Barolo or Barbaresco or Cru Classe Bordeaux from a better producer for around $80, which I consider to be a relatively good value at finer restaurants. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a good value at that price point on KO Prime's wine list. Despite this, KO Prime is definitely worth visiting for a special occasion.Overall, the Nine Zero is a wonderful city hotel in a great location... The One Day Sale rate of $209 was also a great value... We'd definitely stay here again!
