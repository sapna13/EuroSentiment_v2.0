{"text":"The pictures do not lie :) Alila Ubud was truly lovely!!! Two old friends (much like the vintage wine we brought along to drink) opted for the Alila promotion for two nights each at Alila Ubud and Alila Manggis. We were not disappointed and enjoyed our stay immensely at the Alila Ubud tremendously despite the damp weather that made its appearance during the afternoons. These are the points that i had noted : ) Service -- Due to some immigration issues on my end, we had to take the later flight. Alila duly noted our delayed arrival and made adjustments to our complimentary massage appointments and also confirmed our Mozaic reservation on our behalf. Generally, service was attentive although the staff could have offered more suggestions on Ubud activities and improved their walking maps which were abit confusing. On balance, I enjoyed the Alila Manggis service slightly better because they had applied our Pleasures Menu selections in terms of room amenities. Room -- The rooms were not terribly spacious (i.e. with no room for a day bed or comfy chairs) but it didn't bother me much because it was nice waking up to the view of jungle etc. I was especially pleased with the outdoor shower with its rainforest ambience -- pure relaxation!!! I thought the lack of a TV would bug me but it was a nice change not to have the constant TV buzz especially when you are in the company of a good book. I also liked the thoughtfulness of the amenities which included an adaptor, insect repellant, beach bag etc. Pool -- AMAZING!!! ALL THE ACCOLADES ARE ALL DESERVING!!! I wished we had spent more time at the pool... The views overlooking the Valley surrounding the Alila were inspiring!!! Massage -- The hot stones massage is rather relaxing especially on a damp afternoon with the drizzling rain in the background : ) Restaurant -- The ala carte breakfast was sufficiently yummy and i think the western selection was slightly better -- In particular, i had the funky papaya with yoghurt and toasted coconut -- weird but nice!!! Suggestions -- More shuttle services so that guests could nip out to Ubud for an early-ish dinner, and also more stop and pick-up points e.g. (a) Dirty Duck, (b) Ibu Oka, and (c) Neka Museum which is opposite Naughty Nuri's!!!ALL IN ALL, A WONDERFUL HOLIDAY!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK!!!
