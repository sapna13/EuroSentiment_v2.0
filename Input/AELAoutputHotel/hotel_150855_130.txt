{"text":"Absolutely Average We just got back yesterday from the Riu Taino and had read many reviews on this resort prior to going. We had read extremely positive reviews and negative ones. We have travelled to other islands in the past so we had a good basis to compare this one with. We both would rate this hotel as a absolute average to slightly above average resort. We booked this vacation through Sunquest Vacations who rated the Taino as a 5 star. Both my wife and I would say it was a good 4 star but in no way a 5 star.If you are looking for a 5 star resort then stay at the Riu Palace (sister hotel) a few doors down. It was absolutely beautiful! Getting back to the Riu Taino..... The rooms are in need of updating. The bed covers were worn and stained. Their was mold in the bathrooms and the beds were singles. We had a family of four and booked 2 Super Saver Rooms. Our price was fantastic at only $798.00 CDN plus taxes each for 1 week. We stayed from Jan 1-Jan 8 2007. The pools are not heated and were probably about 75 degrees. Not freezing but definetly cooler than expected. The ocean was about the same temp. The beach was beautiful (one of the best we have ever seen). The grounds crew kept the resort very clean but again it is in need of a serious update. The food was average (good selection) but not very tasty. The kids club very rarely had anything for the kids to do and only ever had 1 or 2 kids in it. Our kids are 8 and 9 and they chose to entertain themselves rather than go to the club. Most of the staff were very friendly but some were rude and chose to ignore you. One of the staff said to friends of ours (14 year old daughter) that she and him would do the boom boom and she would have his baby in 9 months. NOT APPROPRIATE!!! In fairness to the staff member he may not have known how old she was but he should not be saying that to any guest regardless of age. On another note the weather was about 25-30 degrees celcius every day. It was very breezy and the waves were fun for the kids. Everyday a brief downpour would happen for about 5-10 minutes (once or twice per day). Overall as mentioned before everything about this hotel is average. If you go there expecting a 5 star resort you will be disapointed. Expect a true 4 star resort and you will enjoy your stay. The family that we met from England said that it is rated a 3-1\/2 star resort in the English brochures. For the value it was a good vacation but we will look to stay at the Riu Palace next time.
