{"text":"Great but forget Golden Visited the GB from June 8 to 15. Most people here have it right, the buffet is good but not 5 stars (I never saw good seafood), the beach is beautiful (but nowhere close to Varadero Cuba), the rooms are well-appointed and the grounds beautiful. Some staff is very nice, some don't bother, it's uneven. The drinks are so watered down my 2 year-old stole a taste of the Coco Loco and wanted more!!!! That's how much you don't taste the rum... Too big for me, really, but my toddler loved the mini-train so we learned to live with it.That said, one BIG warning. I don't know what regular booking is like but the Royal Golden was a major disappointment. We went to the Iberostar last year and, in comparison, I did not see any superior service here, certainly not the kind you pay extra for. Sure, we were near the beach (and away from the major construction site next door!), but that's it. Restaurant reservations were hard to get and you had to present yourself at the office, couldn't do it by phone. The safe box is not included. While all Golden buildings are near the beach, the office handling you is at the Club House (as in the other end of the resort), where the Premium Bar sits there among the desk and computers !!! who bothers !!! (Honestly, we're not drinkers so we didn't care but it looked ridiculous and gimmicky.) Basically, if you ask me, the Royal Golden is nothing but an excuse to make you pay for rooms near the beach, anything else attached to it is par for a 4-5 star hotel, not premium service.I would say, get yourself a good travel agent that can book you close to the sea without going Golden, on the side of the property away from construction and you'll enjoy AND save.Would we recommend? Yes. But this is not a 5 star and the swimming is better in Cuba. Have a good one anyways.
