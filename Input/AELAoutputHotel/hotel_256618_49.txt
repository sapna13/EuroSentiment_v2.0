{"text":"Fantastic, totally up to date I stayed here with a little trepidation, because I was concerned that the hotel perhaps was just resting on its laurels. It has the most fantastic location in Sydney, but would the rooms live up to their high price???I was really impressed. We stayed in the Opera King Deluxe room, a huge room with a stunning view over the Opera House. The room was really well equipped with an enormous king bed and fabulous bedding. What luxury to go to bed with that Opera House view every night. I felt truly lucky. The room was always well-stocked, and the bathroom was large and luxurious (and I am picky about bathrooms!!)The food at the hotel is great. Definitely try to go for a rate where breakfast is included. Normally, the breakfast costs $40 AUD per person, and even at that price it is worth it. It is only a continental breakfast, but it is delicious. Lots of cheese, wonderful breads, and even a berry custard which tasted lovely for breakfast. All of this in a serene room with a great view over the harbor, and the lovely Opera House. I loved starting my day there. Room service was also wonderful, and the food quality was high.Using the computer at the business centre in the hotel was not cheap, but was worth it. It was quiet and private for any personal matters I needed to take care of.I loved this hotel, and will definitely return. Only complaints - we had a bodyguard sitting in the hall near our room for some VIP's on the floor (don't know who). It was tiring always having to greet this guy, night and day. Also, our bill was quite a mess, with all sorts of incorrect charges, due to our having booked this through AMEX Fine Hotels and Resorts where there were some freebies that were not handled properly.. It took a while to sort through, but in the end was resolved satisfactorily. This is the only place to stay in Sydney.
