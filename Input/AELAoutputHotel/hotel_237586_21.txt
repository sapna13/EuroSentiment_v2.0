{"text":"Bargain hotel if a little far out! I booked this hotel through a website and managed to get a bargain price of a room for myself and 5 others!Upon arriving in Amsterdam we got the number 2 tram from Central station (the number 2 tram can be picked up from nearly everywhere in Amsterdam centre, just look for the number on the tram stops to find out if it stops at the stop), we paid a one off fee of 1.60 euros which is valid for as many journeys as you can make within the hour.The tram ride from central station was about a 12\/15 min journey and about 7\/10 mins from the Leidesplien area which was what we wanted to be near.To walk to central station it would probably take you well over 1hour and to walk to Leidesplien it would probably take you about 20\/25 mins.Upon arriving at the hotel (the tram stop is either at the end of the street or the middle of the street - the street name is announced on the tram so you know where to get off) we checked in with a helpful member of staff, as we were 2 hours early for check in only one room was available, but the staff member was most helpful and allowed us to store our luggage in this one room till our other rooms were available after 1400hrs. All the rooms were twin beds, which is a little annoying if you want to snuggle up to your partner, but then good if you have had a row!!!The rooms we had were all similar but different in size. Room 1 was a very good size with a big bathroom and the worlds biggest mirror, room 2 was a reasonable size with an odd layout and reasonable bathroom and room 3 was the smallest of the rooms with a small bathroom, although adequate. The rooms were basically decorated and a little dated, but all was clean so it wasnt an issue. The mattress was very soft which isnt too good for the back but I slept ok so it wasnt too much of an issue. The bathroom in room 3 smelt a little but soon went away.Sadly noone got to sample the breakfast as noone got out of bed so sadly I cant comment on if it was any good or not.Some of the friends I went with purchased some food and drinks from the fridge at reception, the prices were very expensive, but I think this is standard in Amsterdam as everywhere food and drink is rather expensive which isnt good!Overall the stay at the Apple Inn was good, its situated quite out of the way in a quiet street so ideal for those who want a good nights sleep but not if you want to be in staggering distance from the pubs and clubs in Leidesplien area! If you want to be in staggering distance I wouldnt recommend staying here but somewhere closer.I would stay at the Applie Inn again as it was fantastic value for money, only 59 euros per room which is very cheap and I would recommend to others too if they want a nice quiet stay.We did have a walk when we got there and its within about 15mins walk to the RIKJS (maybe spelt wrong) and the Van Gough museums so ideal location for these places.Amsterdam was very rainy whilst we were there but we still had a fun time. All I would say is make sure you take plenty of money as the food and drink is fairly expensive, you are talking just less than 10 euros for a decent breakky (try the Irish Bar in Liedesplien) and 5 euros for a pint of strongbow!
