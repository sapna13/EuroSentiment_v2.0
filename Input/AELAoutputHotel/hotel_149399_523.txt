{"text":"Family of four loved it!! I went to this hotel not knowing what to expect. My husband and I are used to staying in American chains like Marriott and Sheraton and for us, this was a huge risk. We took with us our two boys - 4 1\/2 year old and 14 month old. I cannot say enough about the children's staff - they are incredibly hard working as they work ALL DAY with the children with planned activities and then in the evening they perform in a children's show. Needless to say my 4 1\/2 hr old loved it. The food - hit and miss. I will agree that the breakfast and lunch options were basically repetitive buffets, but oh my goodness the quantities!! The evening dinner options are what blew us away. There are over 7 types of cuisines and restaurants to choose from and we had no problem getting in where we wanted to go with a just a day's planning. Each restaurant was carefully designed to match the theme and cuisine and I really appreciated the fact that though we never left the resort for the 5 days we were there, I never felt like we were stuck there. There was plenty to see, eat, and after all, we just wanted to relax. I never felt pressured by the throngs of timeshare folks on site and never felt rushed during the meals. What I do wish could be improved, the cleanliness of the rooms, I understand that we are in the tropics and humidity, dust, dirt, and bugs will happen but the bathrooms got very gross very quickly and I consider our lil family pretty clean. Other than that, the people\/staff are incredibly friendly (a big plus was that I speak Spanish) and the beach is nice...(Europeans everywhere -so Americans don't gawk - topless!), the evening options were great, my kids both loved it, (Flintstones everywhere!)- and it served it's purpose, we had a great family vacation!
