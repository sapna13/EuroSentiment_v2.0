{"text":"Its was home! When running away from the daily grind, and landing on a small island one would think that the catch of the day could be most anything. While I did read that the Alta Vista was plain, its much more than that. Simplicity is vital in a state of being. While at nights, especially weekends, it can be noisy, the owners were very gracious in making sure that the majority of night owls were well coached in the 11 PM down time.From the roof top in the evening you can watch the sun go down over the waters, the birds take flight back to the other side of the island and hear the sounds we often pay for on CD's in the States. Tropical birds, roosters and wild horses roamed and flew around freely. The roads are winding and publico's are loco but you get used to it in a hurry. We took Mark's mo-ped service and decided to do some free lance touring of the island. This is how you find the food, country style!!! Look for road side servers and watch the traffic flow. Many of the restaurants on the island are great but several are rip offs. Buy from the locals, you'll get your money's worth 9 out of 10 times. I miss my little room there even though I have a huge home and all the amenities. Its one of those places where a person could easily find themselves trading one life for another in order to really live and live great!Bill ","annotations":[]}
