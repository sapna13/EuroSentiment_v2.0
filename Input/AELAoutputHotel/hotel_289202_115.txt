{"text":"The very Fabulous Home from Home! Hotel Antiche Figure! Well have just returned from another wonderful trip to Venice Italy and as wonderful as Venice is it is the Fabulous Hotel Antiche Figure that makes you love it even more! I can not tell you how much of a wonderful stay my friend's and I had again at this lovely Hotel. The staff are what really give it that special feeling from the very charming and helpful manager Alessandro and of course the very helpful and charming Gianni who could not do enough for us while there from organising hairdresser's which was a real Italian experience and one of the best hair stylest I have ever been to! to organising advise on there lovely city! All of the front desk staff also especially the lovely Franseca are what give's this Hotel it's class. I do not know of any other Hotel I have stayed in that make you feel like a 5 star guest. The room we had again was the Resident suite room 511 which I have stayed in before but my 2 friend's had not, they were very impressed and just loved it. The room's are filled with every little luxury from chocklate's on your pillow's to fresh flower's put on our bed for a festival for Women while we were there.We were really looked after in every aspect of our trip. So once again I would absoultley recommend this wonderful Hotel to anyone going to Venice there are many hotel's to stay at in Venice but I can tell you for location service and just plain wonderful hospitality the Hotel Antiche Figure are in a class of there own! Thank you Hotel Antiche Figure for a wonderful break in the lovely Venice we will be back very soon!SuzanneIreland ","annotations":[]}
