{"text":"First class all the way The Mandarin Oriental rates as the best hotel I have ever stayed in. From the moment you enter reception you receive a very warm welcome that extends throughout the stay. We stayed on the 14th floor and the room was of reasonable size, but had a stunning view of the water. The bed was easily the most comfortable we have ever slept in, it was simply beautiful and enabled us to enjoy a very relaxing stay. The room decor was simple yet stylish, the bathroom functioned well and was luxurious, however doors to the toilet could be a useful addition.The buffet breakfast was extensive, fresh and offered a plethora of choice. The coffee\/tea and table service was of the highest standard, however if there was one complaint I would make it would be that that the service at times was too efficient to the point where the coffee didn't taste as great due to all the top ups. The staff are very well drilled and there was only double up on a juice order which was amazing considering their workload.Over our stay the staff became friendlier (hard to believe but true) and the daily breakfast ritual become a pleasure. The dinner buffet was a feast, and was reasonably priced at $70 per person. Again as per the breakfast the choices were extensive.The location when taxis are cheap and plentiful was never a consideration. Singaporeans are very proud of having the F! come to them, and our room was directly opposite part of the track which did result in some daytime noise but nothing excessive. The hotel is adjacent to a well decked out shopping centre (set of stairs near hotel entrance) if you do not want to travel into the Orchard Rd district.A complete, luxurious and well appointed hotel worthy of a 5 star rating.
