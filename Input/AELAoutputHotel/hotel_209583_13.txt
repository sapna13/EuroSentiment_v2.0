{"text":"A Relaxing Vacation First of all, I found that overall, this hotel was about 3 1\/2 stars, and that is using US standards as a comparision. It is extremely helpful if you speak Spanish when staying at the hotel, and if so, one will find many of the people to be friendly and helpful too. Although the trip is all inclusive (food, hotel, drinks), after one eats, leaving a small tip for the waiters and maids who clean the room daily is a good idea. These people make very little, and work long hours in often unbearable heat.When we checked into the hotel, the wait was rather long, and it took us almost an hour and a half to go to our room, which was quite spacious and clean. We had plenty of towels, but the smell was rather musty, and I think it is because the air vents are not changed very often. There are many places to eat, and frankly, I found the food to be quite varied in offerings. The exotic, tropical fruit was a great benefit, including fresh mango, guanabana, guava, passion fruit, and the exotic mame. The beach, although beautiful was not what I had expected, and there was algee, which became annoying at times. Nevertheless, the temperature of the water is a dream, and my husband and I would wake up early and go into the water, then sit and read for the rest of the day. There are also shows at night, which change every night, and although not of the Las Vegas caliaber, are nevertheless entertaining.Additionally, the hotel had some very beautiful jewerely, and I bought some unique Larimar items, which are of top quality. Although this stone is unique to the Dominican Republic, there are plenty of fakes out there, so if buying some, do a bit of reasearch beforehand. The color of the stone, to be authentic is somewhat uneven. Also, there is a swap meet type market set up nearby, where many items, from coffee, to vanilla, to the faceless dolls that are unique to the region can be purchased. When purchasing, remember to negotiate the price, (even in the hotel stores), as they are often inflated quite a bit.All in all a very relaxing stay. If you are speak Spanish, and are looking for a place to forget about the world, this is for you. I found staying 8 days was a bit on the long side, as bordom set in after 5, which to me, would have been an ideal stay.
