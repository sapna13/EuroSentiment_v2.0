{"text":"your best bet for civilized budget accommodation in HK I'm in HK 6-7 times a year on business, and always stay at the BL (and have done for more than 4 years now, as have most of my work colleagues). The hotel is renovating their rooms which prompted this review. The rooms are small, Tokyo-sized, but clean and fairly well-maintained. The staff are professional and polite. The location is in the mid-levels, a residential neighbourhood, but only a 5 minute cab ride (or free shuttle) from the business area, or a 15 minute walk up or down the mid-levels escalator (a string of connected escalators that take you from office-land to sort-of-suburbia). The room rate is a fraction of the big-name hotels in town - not quite hostel-cheap, but very affordable. The internet is free and fast, and the beds are comfortable with good duvets. There's a kettle and cups in the room (a must-have as far as I'm concerned).If you get a harbour-view room (you'll have to pay a bit more, BL's not that generous on upgrades 'cos they're usually full) the view over Central towards Kowloon is stunning. The renovated rooms, apart from having a fresh makeover, have bigger showerheads, shaving mirrors, small flat-screen TVs, and bigger beds (not much of an advantage as the rooms are no bigger, obviously, so there's less space for your luggage!)What do you give up for the price? Breakfast is average and you're better off grabbing something on the go outside the hotel. The pool is a dipping pond, no point actually trying to swim, and the gym is token. There are no bathrooms, only shower rooms. And you occasionally find the modest-sized lobby crammed full of mainland Chinese tour groups.But given that, in HK, you're likely to be out and about 18 hours a day, and all you really need is a smile, a room, and a bed, BL scores very highly for value for money.
