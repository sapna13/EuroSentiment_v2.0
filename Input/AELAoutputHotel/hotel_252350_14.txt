{"text":"Great comfort in the University District We stayed four nights at the Watertown and were extremely happy with our spacious room. It had a comfortable king bed, robes, Aveda products, a safe, an iron and ironing board, a wireless connection, Starbucks coffee and a cable TV. Our room faced the street, but we heard no traffic noise. We did hearoccasional footsteps above us, however. The cleaning staff did an excellent job daily and the place was immaculate.The hotel has friendly, upbeat staff, who are happy to answer questions. On weekends, freshly baked chocolate chip cookies (the aroma fills the lobby) wait for guests at reception in the afternoon and a big bowl of apples is available. A Happy Hour (free wine and beer plus snacks) starts at 5:30 p.m. on weekdays.A small gym is located on the main floor near the breakfast room.The morning buffet includes fresh fruit, such as sliced oranges, honeydew melon and bananas; three kinds of cereal; baked goods, such as bagels, muffins and small scones; scrambled eggs and bacon or sausage; two kinds of juice; 2 percent and skimmed milk; and coffee and tea. The room is too small, though, to comfortably fit the number of guests who often arrive at the same time. On warm days, it is possible to go to tables outside, but Seattle is rarely warm early in the morning.Free, secure parking is an added bonus. You can simply park the car and take nearby bus transport Downtown or reserve a ride on the hotel's free shuttle (with a tip to the driver). The bus takes about 20 minutes to get downtown. It is an easy walk to the University of Washington and its museums and to shops, restaurants, movie theatres, etc., in the University area. I recommend the Cedars at 4759 Brooklyn Ave. for reasonably priced cuisine from India. The Burke Gilman Trail, for cyclists and pedestrians, stretches for miles about three blocks away from the hotel. I highly recommend the Watertown for visitors who do not need to be based Downtown.
