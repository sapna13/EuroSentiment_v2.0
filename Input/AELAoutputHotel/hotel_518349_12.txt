{"text":"stylish  my boyfriend and i have just returned from a four night stay at the silken diagonal between 30\/07\/08 and 03\/08\/08, we went for my birthday and we got a really good deal for the hotel on lastminute.com.the reviews on ta seemed very mixed so i was a little dubious and apprehensive about our stay but i have to say i \/ we were pleasantly suprised.as all the reviews state, the hotel is a bit far out of the city centre but there is a bus and metro and tram stop literally outside or a 2 minute walk away so the location really wasnt a problem at all. taxis are easy to get from right outside the hotel also. the location wasnt great, there was construction work going on right outside and the walk to the metro station was through a not particularly nice neighborhood with graffiti and shabbiness being the main problems, but it wasnt that bad.... what else do you expect in a major city?!the foyer and bar area are stylish and quite retro in the decor, the staff are courteous and efficient but i wouldnt say friendly. check in and out were painless and we had no problems there. we arrived early, around 2pm and we were able to check in then which was handy. we had a few drinks in the hotel, as expected prices were a bit higher than what we should have paid but not overly excessive.our room was on the seventh floor and was tastefully decorated, and was always spotlessly cleaned. we did notice that a room service tray stayed outside the room opposite us for two days though which wasnt great. room was cool, contemporary, spacious and comfortable, the floor to ceiling window was great although we had paid extra for a decent view..... we got a view of the construction site right opposite our building! the blinds blocked out all the light so they were great for keeping the light out and keeping the room cool, although you could clearly hear other neighbouring rooms opening \/ closing their blinds. the bathroom, or rather the bath \/ shower was poorly designed. the shower screen was not large enough to cover past the spray so the floor was wet after every shower.a few minor quibbles, but all in all a good stay and would recommend this as a great value for money hotel \/ trip!
