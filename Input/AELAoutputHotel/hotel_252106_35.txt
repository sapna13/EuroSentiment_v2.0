{"text":"Nice hotel, but with minor setbacks We stayed at the Swissotel Berlin for 7 nights in May. We booked a Junior Suite but after booking the hotel changed the names around to comply with the rooms of other Swissotel properties. The Junior Suite no longer exists and is now called Grand Room. The location is excellent, right on the Ku-damm with shops, restaurants and public transport literally around the corner.Anyway, our room was on the lowest floor on the corner of the building. Normally this causes a lot of traffic noise but because the lower floors are occupied by CA, you hardly notice it as long as you don't open the windows. The room itself was very spacious, but the bathroom - especially the shower - could have been bigger. That bed gave us a lot of problems. At home we are used to an excellent bed made by H√Å√µ?stens, and since we have it we tend to struggle in hotels. The bed in the Swissotel was really hard and didn't give any support. Also the pillows were useless. If you are used to sleeping on a firm bed, you will have no problems but we woke up tired and with back pain every day.The room has enough amenities: safe, minibar, desk (even with a small ruler, pencilsharpner etc.!), ironing board etc. Minor annoyance: the TV is slow and only a 21 inch CRT-TV, and also quite far from the bed.We could'nt help but notice that the rooms are in need of some minor renewals. Although the room was very clean, the carpet was worn, the towel and bathrobes old and once we noticed tears in the sheets. The lobby, elevators, bars, restaurant etc. all look brand new, but the things that are used intensively are nearing the end of their life cycle.The restaurant (44) is good, although since it has a Michelin star, not a bargain. We payed about 250 euro's for the 5-course 'Degustation', drinks and wine. On other nights we just went out and paid about 1\/5th of that. We can recommend taking the short walk to the Savignyplatz, it has lots of nice restaurants.Breakfast was excellent in quality and choice, only when it's busy the items (like pancakes, waffles) that are on the menu can take a lot of time to be served. We were very pleased with the staff, they were very friendly, helpfull and their English was excellent.Overall, we would come back if the beds were more comfortable.
