{"text":"Couldn'f fault, definatly go back !! After reading reviews I discovered that you could get a bus directly from the airport to Place de Catalunya where the hotel is located and indeed this is correct and couldn't be easier or cheaper, for only 3.75 Euro PP we got on the Aerobus which delivered us to the square in about 20mins. Then all we had to do was walk across the square to find our hotel, we were greeted very pollitely and although we didn't get a glass of champagne on arrival we did habe a BOTTLE of it wating in our room - I had not informed the hotel that it was wife's birthday but they given this bottle to celebrate which was a very nice touch. Anyway Location is fantastic, we had a tripple rooom as our young son was with us and this room was fine - but a bit hot towards the end of the day (Air-con not working ?) Breakfast was plentyful and the price was included in our room rate, we got there a bit late on the 2 mornings that we ate and there wasnt much of the english style breakfast left but still enough of other styles of food left to fill my stomach. We didn't find out if they still did the free drinks in the hotel as we got back there too late to sample, but they were never mentioned to us. All in all a really fantastic little break and I would recommend this hotel to anyone, and I would definatly stay here again if we were to re-visit. I contacted the Hotel directly to book and the whole thing could not have been easier, and as for getting around the city this really is a fantasically central location with bus stops and the metro within yards, and many of the attractions were in walking distance anyway. So go and explore and you will enjoy. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":652,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":648}]}
