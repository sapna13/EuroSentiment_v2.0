{"text":"Fantastic hotel if you can afford the rate We booked directly over the internet a room with canal view which cost extra and is definitely not a budget price hotel, however, if it fits your budget We can thoroughly recommend it. our room was No 106 on the 1st floor and was decorated stunningly with 3 opening double tall windows looking out onto the canal and main street. Lovely decor, very comfy bed (2 very wide singles pushed together) air con, tv with 2 free porn channels 69 +70 (spice up your weekend - the dutch are definitely not prudes) a superb double size Rain shower and a bath, haidryer etc, plus FREE whisky, conyac and vodka in cut glass decanters and a mini bar stocked with smoothies, coca Cola, beer and fruit juices. That was just the beginning, the staff are so helpful and will recommend eating out etc based upon their experiences. Once you get your bearings you will soon find that you are located in an excellent location whether walking(as we did) or getting buses, taxis or trams. Some of the best places we went were The Ice bar (expensive but worth it) Ranchos Argentinian steak house, Red light district - you will be amazed (just window shopping) Anyway back to the hotel, the breakfasts were great, choice of cooked scambled eggs, bacon and sausage plus fruit, cooked meats, various breads for toast, or your own personally cooked omelette. And in the Living a lovely fire to chill out to when you returned to your hotel each evening with a FREE bar where you just help yourself to beer, wine, spirits and snacks (if there is a bottle that is empty just ask the staff and they will replace it with a full bottle) Then there is the free internet also in the living, by the time you add all the free booze and internet time you soon realise that although it seems a bit expensive when you first book when you check out and your bill is just the same as when you first booked that this hotel is a real find and is actually a bargain.I would recommend this hotel to anyone I know and will definitely stay here next time we visit Amsterdam.I hope the other rooms in the hotel live up to room 106.Personally we will ask for 106 when we go again.Enjoy!!!!
