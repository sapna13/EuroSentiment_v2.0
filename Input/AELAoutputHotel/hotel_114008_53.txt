{"text":"Simply peerless service... and the renovation is looking good! I spent a full week at this outstanding resort with my family - including 2 kids under the age of 5. I had last stayed here 8 years ago - when it still flew the Mandarin Oriental flag - and was curious as to how the renovation had changed the hotel. We had 2 rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?one renovated and one not.First off, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° like to compliment the service, which was simply outstanding. All requests √à√\u2020\u2022?whether they were for extra towels in the bedroom to something off the menu in the restaurants √à√\u2020\u2022?were accommodated without question or delay. The staff was friendly and used our names whenever possible. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ big on service and this resort has obviously made it a point to be outstanding in that area.As for the renovations, they continue apace. As of the first week in December, they were working primarily on the guest rooms in the tower on floors 6-8, with most rooms below completed and all above (on floors 9 and 10) still to be started. Also, the lagoon rooms have not yet been started. They expect to have everything done by the end of March.In the meantime, noise during the day is an issue. Naps are a challenge, though we did get our 2 year-old down without too much fuss. If you are a light sleeper and like your afternoon doze during your holiday, beware of this if you will be visiting in the next several months.Having addressed that, the work that they did on the rooms is beautiful. Even though the resort opened in the mid-60s, its rooms (at 550 square feet) are among the largest on the island. With the renovation, they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe mounted 40-inch LCD TVs to the wall, which has allowed them to remove the armoires and make the room even more spacious. The theme has moved from the Asian-influenced mahogany to a more tropical feel. More space is devoted to the bathrooms than in other resorts, and the result are separate his and hers areas (independent sinks and closets) with *plenty* of storage room.Of course, given the recent nature of the renovations, everything feels new and is in excellent working order.Tip: If you have an oceanview room in the tower, ask for the Koko Head wing, which is a bit closer to the water and doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ look over the (sometimes busy) porte cochere, which is the case with the Diamond Head wing. If you have a mountainview room, ask for an upper floor (once renovations have been completed, of course).I feel this resort rivals the Halekulani and the JW Marriott Ihilani as the best on Oahu. As such, it can be pricey √à√\u2020\u2022?but the quality of the resort, its service and restaurants plus its location provide value nonetheless.
