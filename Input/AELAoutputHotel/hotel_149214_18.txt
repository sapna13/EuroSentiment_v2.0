{"text":"5 star prices for 1 star service! I just spent two months in this place, from June 26th to August 23rd (for work), and can't say too many good things about this place. I named my experience here A beautiful nightmare. I'll start by mentioning that I was robbed during my first week there. Someone stole my Ipod, digital camera, leatherman tool, and all my computer recovery cd's from my room. Of course I reported the incident but they did nothing to reimburse my loss. About 5 weeks later my cell phone grew legs and walked out of my room as well. So the lesson learned here is USE THE SAFE! The food, I had diarrhea for 6 weeks! Should I say anymore?Cold showers, leaky rooms, doors don't lock, a\/c doen't work, floors are extremely slippery when wet (but they are pretty), and the service is painstakingly slow. Oh did I mention the food sucks! The breakfast at La Cana is good only because of the view of the ocean as you enjoy waiting 15 minutes for your coffee, dinner at La Choza is pleasant as long as the tractor isn't out a 8:30 pm dragging sand while you try to enjoy the ocean breeze, and the menu at La Yola is appetizing as long as you have plenty of cash! The menu at Francos Pizza has got to go, because if Dominican food is what you want, it won't be here, in fact it won't be anywhere in this resort. You won't even hear any local music, there was simply no culture in this resort. I might was well have stayed at La Quinta in Central Florida! Oh, l can't forget to mention the night club, the one that has only 1 employee dancing waiting for the guests that never arrive. The crickets in the garden were having a better time rubbing their hind legs.It seemed the only time guests stayed here is when a flight got stuck or was overbooked so they threw them all into this place. Hmmm.........Other than the fact that the location is very nice, I would never want to stay at this over priced motel ever again. There are just too many deficiencies to point out, the best part of my stay here was riding the catamaran, swimming in the springs, and going to the spa. The place is in dire need of maintenance and new management, it has potential, just not right now.
