{"text":"Unforgettable Hotel David is one of the six hotels we stayed at while in Italy. My husband agrees that this was the best of the six. The staff was warm and friendly- giving directions, making reservations and going above and beyond in every way. Sabrina was great! Florence was a very busy city and the hotel is walking distance to almost everything but away from the craziness. It was nice to be South of the Arno. Our room had tall ceilings, a great shower with hot water and good pressure and comfortable bed. Breakfast was good and presented nicely. I thought the coffee was nice and strong as well. Internet and happy hour make this hotel wonderful. We had quite the lively group one evening after happy hour and met some interesting people from all over the world. The hotel is on a busy street that leads up to Piazza Michaelangelo. You would never know it at night or sleeping in the next day as there was a button to push next to the window with an electric cork board that pulled down and closed out most sound and all light. I have nothing negative to say about this place. I hope their prices stay the same and that they continue the happy hour. As far as other advice I have to give- you HAVE to book a wine tour through Chianti and you HAVE to use Nathalie. She was so knowledgable and knew all the owners of the vineyards and castles and we got a behind-the-scenes tour almost everywhere we went. The owners chatted like old friends and handed the key over to her and we were free to explore the wine cellars of old castles and see where they make wine, balsamic and olive oil. She spoke English very well and had a great sense of humor. She picked us up from our hotel and drove us around for the day. She dropped us off in Greve to shop and took us to a family-owned place for lunch. Best day of the whole trip thanks to her (natintuscany@hotmail.com). I found her on tripadvisor. Restaurants- Gigi's was OK, Garden Room 15 euros for a drink!!!Ahhh!! That is a lot when the American dollar is performing so poorly. Il Latino had a neat atmosphere, but a long wait and the food was overrated. Our favorite was Osteria Antica Mescita San Niccolo. Walking distance from hotel and best cream of mushroom soup and a great beef and curry dish and good house wine. We loved the Boboli Gardens and wish we had spent more time there and would not have missed the view from the top of the Duomo. I know I got off subject here, but had to mention the few things that made our trip memorable. Overall, a wonderful 4 days and worth the exchange rate.
