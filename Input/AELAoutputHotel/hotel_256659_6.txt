{"text":"Luxury and Style for Christmas I had the pleasure of spending Christmas at The Westin (it was my Christmas present - lucky me!)We stayed in one of their Executive Suites and found the service and entire experience an absolute dream with a beautiful room. It was clean, well appointed and had the most luxurious bed - it was truly as marketed 'Heavenly'. Large Plasma TV's and BOSE Sound systems in both the sitting room and bedroom were fabulous, as was the quality of the decor. The room had floor to ceiling windows with fabulous views out onto the cityscape. The bedroom and sitting room were great but the bathroom was where I actually found myself spending most of my time....The Executive Suites have deep, deep double ended baths which, once filled with hot bubbly water (this takes a while as the baths are so big!) you can sit in and press a button to lift the blind to the floor to ceiling window which looks out over the city. The best bath views I've ever taken in!The entrance to the building is to one side of the old Post Office building and has a great juxtaposition of old and new architecture which sit extremely well together. The Lobby in the courtyard is where, as a change from the usual Christmas Dinner, we decided to have Champagne High Tea. We were met by a friendly, charming girl who was obviously a natural at providing great customer service. As we sat admiring this architecture we were approached by a gentleman, who we assume was a porter, who proceeded to regail us with some history of the building and the local area giving us an insight into some extra things to do and places to go. The service from start to finish was second to none and I would love to go back (hint hint, nudge nudge!).This hotel most definitely lived up to expectation and I would happily stay again and again.
