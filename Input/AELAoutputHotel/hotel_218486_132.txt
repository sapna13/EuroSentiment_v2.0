{"text":"Good Enough! My husband and I stayed at Barcelo Bavaro Beach and Caribe from Jan 27- Feb 1 2008. While the hotel looks old and a bit worn down it was very clean. I was a bit nervous at first when I read other reviews and people wrote about roaches in their room. I'm glad to report that I found none. The room was nothing fancy, but it served its purpose, for us to crash and go to sleep at the end of each day. The housekeepers swept and mop the floors each day (rooms there are ceramic tile, no carpets). The bathroom was clean to perfection, the towels were always replaced with clean ones.The staff at the hotel was not the friendliest, but they were polite. The food was not at all bad, they defenitely had a great spread for breakfast, lunch and dinner at their main dining room. Their Steak House Restaurant was not bad, however, you must get there as soon as they open for dinner (6:30pm) or otherwise you will be waiting for a while. The Mexican restaurant, which my husband was very hesitant to go to, and only did so to please me, was surprisingly good. This place was great for us, since all we wanted out of our time there was to relax, and we definetily accomplished that. The weather was not too bad, it rained here and there, and some mornings were overcast,but that was mother nature, not the resorts fault :).So if you are looking to just laid back, relax, eat and drink until you fall asleep again, this place may just be right for you.
