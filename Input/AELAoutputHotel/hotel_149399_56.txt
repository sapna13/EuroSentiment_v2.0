{"text":"Totally Amazing!!!!!!! Go for Royal Service if you can! Just got back from a 5 day stay at the Melia and I have to say it was wonderful. We started off a little rocky- had a delay, got violently ill the first night, had a blackout, got hit by Tropical Storm Fay and got really sunburned but despite all of this- it was great!Royal Service- I had read many reviews before going and a lot of them said to try the Royal Service- so we upgraded, and let me tell you - it was definitely worth it! We arrived with a bunch of other people who had to wait on this long line. They took us by golf cart to a VIP lounge to check in where we were greeted by a wonderful staff and some cocktails. Then our butler (Manny) drove us to our suite (Villa 49). It was great- kitchen, living room, plasma tvs, jacuzzi, 4 sinks, 2 huge closets, a safe and an awesome shower with 8 heads. The room was immaculate and was always kept that way. Grounds: This place is HUGE and people complained about it but it's beautiful to walk around and check out the scenery. Plus, you can hop in a golf cart or on the train and be escorted around.As far as the architecture and set up of this place goes- it was truly amazing and so so beautiful. The lobby areas, bars, restaurant areas, etc. were really so nice. I dont' think I've ever been to such a beautiful resort.Restaurants- Food was really good. Ate at the Gabi (part of the Royal Service)- place was BEAUTIFUL and food was very yummy. Also had Dominican food which was good, Italian which was also good and Mexican the last night, which was Great! All the other breakfast and lunch buffets were great as well- tons of food and good too.Pools- BEAUTIFUL!!! Loved our Royal Service pool b\/c there were little huts you could reserve to relax in (which we did for 2 days). We also had a swim up bar and waitress service poolside. As well, there was this little snack place with burgers, nachos, popcorn, ice cream, pizza (the other pools don't have this). The Caribe and Tropical Pool were also very beautiful. We didn't swim there b\/c our pool was straight across from our Villa. Plus, the other side had lots of unpleasant Europeans (we noticed).Service- Let me just say that the staff at this place was wonderful. They were so warm and friendly and really just happy to serve you. We tipped them a lot and they were so grateful and totally remembered us the whole time. They treated us like royalty and couldn't do enough for us. They were all wonderful.Beach- The beach was about a 7 minute walk from the Royal Service side and a 2 min ride. We got a ride once and walked the other times. It was beautiful and once again, very clean.Entertainment- Melia has shows every night at 10 and also a small Casino that we visited every night after dinner. There is also other entertainment at night (singers, dancers) at the other bars. During the day, they have Bingo, Dance lessons, singing around the lobby bars. There was always something going on there.All in all, we had a great time at the Melia. I would definitely recommend it. A few tips- bring your own sunscreen (very expensive in the gift shop). Also, bring some bug spray (got bit while laying in those little huts- otherwise- it was not buggy at all). And if you're the generous type- bring some singles, 5s and 10s- you're gonna want to tip the staff. They really made our vacation so much more worth it.
