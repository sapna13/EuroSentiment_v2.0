{"text":"Good Hotel The Caravaggio appears to be a part of the Welcome Hotel chain which ensures some minimal standards of cleanliness and service. We found this hotel to be in a good location, 10 minute walk from train station, and fairly close to many of the attractions we wanted to see. The staff spoke excellent English and were always very pleasant. There was someone at the desk 24 hours a day so we could go and come as late as we wanted. The hotel room was a decent size, very clean and included extras such as a mini bar and free wi-fi access (spotty). The bathroom was modern and had a good shower. No issue with pressure or hot water. Breakfast was served on the first floor in a very nice lounge and it was better than the breakfasts we had at other hotels in Italy. There were eggs, cold cuts, breads and fruit. The hotel had a small courtyard out back which was a nice place to unwind with a drink after a long day of sightseeing.We would definitely stay at this hotel again and have no problem recommending it. Please note that if you follow the map on their website, you might have a hard time finding the hotel. The dot on the map makes it look like the hotel is in somewhere in the square, but it's actually on the right side of the dot. This square\/park also was a gathering place for locals to sit and drink and listen to music. This didn't bother us too much as we were not in our room for very long and they were usually finished by the time we went to bed. However, the sight of so many people drinking and singing in front of the hotel did not add to its appeal. To their credit, they didn't appear to be rowdy or dangerous, but their presence could be a little off-putting for some folks.In summary, we believe that we got great value for our money at this hotel.
