{"text":"The BEST place to stay in Ubud!! Found this hotel through Expedia, Trip Advisor, LonelyPlanet etc. so really didn't know what to expect. But what a great surprise - it totally surpassed all our expectations!Uma Ubud is VERY well located. Just 5 minutes fromMonkey Forest Rd (the centre of Ubud - Art Market etc.) It is in the middle of lush surroundings to give you a great view of the paddy fields etc. But also a minute's walk from 2 FABULOUS places to eat - Mozaic and Naughty Nuri's. Both could not be more different! Mozaic is a lovely gourmet french restaurant -a must do when you're in Ubud. Fantastic 6 course meal; great ambience. Naughty Nuri's is more of a local haunt- very chilled out - like a biker bar -but great food and a wonderful slice of local flavour..Other than that, we saw a few other hotels in Ubud, and Uma is the best by far. It has a lovely pool and serene bar and dining area.. The rooms were gorgeous - we stayed in the Garden Room which is slightly bigger and has a separate bathroom that was quite stunning. The Terrace room was also nice with a great view of the rice fields..Super facilities - Free Internet access. The famous Como Shambala Spa. (Dont forget the widely famous Como Shambala toiletries). A well equipped gymn. Free Yoga classes every morning.Breakfast was superb.You must make the most of it - the juices were fresh and delicious!Overall, a peaceful and gorgeous experience. All I can say is if you're going to Ubud, Uma is the place to stay!
