{"text":"Hoped for the best, and they impressed! My stay at the Four Seasons George V was to be my treat to myself this year, and it ended up being even better than I had imagined! The service there is unparalleled, and everyone there gets spectacular treatment. The hotel rooms are huge, by any standards, the bathrooms are huge as well as amazingly opulent. The Bvalgari shampoos and soaps are amazing, a must try even if you never stay at the George V. I stayed at the George V for 4 days, and I was about to cry when I checked out early one morning. FYI Paris doesn't wake up before 8am! I had the opportunity to try got their regular restaurant, Le Gallerie, as well as Le Cinq, their highly touted world renouned restaurant. Actually I didn't care for the menu too much at Le Cinq, but there's literally 5 people waiting on you hand and food, and after the generous amounts of champange you forget about the food. My dinner in the Gallerie was excellent and the service was astounding as well. Room service was awesome and the food arrived very hot, too hot to immediately eat. They don't mess around at the George V. Room service comes twice a day, and they look for things they can do, they don't just clean, they make sure everything is absolutely perfect, and with a great attitude at the same time. Parking (underground) was 40E a day, which isn't that bad. Phone calls back to the USA were quite expensive, but hey, the whole place is expensive, nevertheless you feel like you've gotten more than your money's worth when you're checking out.
