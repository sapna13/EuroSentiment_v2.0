{"text":"Excellent location, friendly staff I travelled with my two sons, aged 7 and 10. We arrived early morning after having travelled to Barcelona by the overnight train from Paris. I didn't expect to be able to check into the room and didn't have to ask the staff if we could leave our luggage with them while we went out for the day - they offered to do it unprompted.The hotel is very close to the metro station (Universitat) and therefore it is easy to get around, and in fact you can walk to many attractions within 10 minutes.The room was clean and quite spacious, the window opened on to a wall but who goes to Barcelona to sit in their room ? Free wireless internet access is available to all customers, which is an excellent offer when you're on a long trip.The public area was very nice to sit in while waiting for friends to get ready. We had breakfast, which was good though a little more expensive than if you went to one of the many local caf√ã√\u2022√ñs. We also dined there the first evening because we were too tired to go out and find somewhere else. The food was excellent value - around four courses and a free aperitif for less than 20 euros per head, with very good service.We were travelling on to the Pyrenees for a week before returning to Barcelona and I was happy to book the Gravina for a night on the way back to Paris. The hotel gave me a complimentary bottle of Cava for re-booking with them, which was a nice touch. Our room on the return leg was a little bit noisy, we were in the newer part of the building, but it didn't bother me overly much.Overall I thought the Gravina was good value for money if you want a no stress place to stay in Barcelona.
