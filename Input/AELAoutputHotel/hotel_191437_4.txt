{"text":"Still Wonderful After All These Years In early September we made our second trip to Berlin and based upon our excellent experience there in 2002 we chose to return to the Westin Grand. And again we were extremely pleased with our stay. First, the location is perfect. Located directly on Freidrichstrasse at the corner of Unter Den Linden it is in walking distance of many of the the reasons you come to Berlin for a visit. For those locations which are not in walking distance, a U Bahn station is just a few feet (meters?) away. The hotel itself is both pleasing to the eye and the person. The lobby with its giant staircase makes an impressive statement, and the four efficient elevators will take you to your room with no waiting. The room itself is exceptional with extremely comfortable bedding, attractive furnishings and with one exception a very efficient bathroom. The one exception is the shower which like many European showers is not up to American standards. But that seems to be an European failing, not specifically one of this marvelous hotel. We overlooked Freidrichstrasse from our room which made for an interesting city view. There was no sound from the street which made paying for the upgraded garden view unnecessary. The breakfast buffet was included and with a wide variety of hot and cold foods, breads, and even German bubbly (sekt) it made for an excellent start to the day. If we ever have reason to return to Berlin it will be to the Westin Grand.
