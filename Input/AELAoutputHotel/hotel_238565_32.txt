{"text":"Nice Hotel, Convenient Location This hotel is located right by the central station, which is very convenient for getting from\/to the airport and for traveling throughout Holland and other countries by train. The Dam square is 10-15 minute walk away and the whole city can be easily explored by walking √à√\u2020\u2022?we never had to take trams\/metro. The area around the hotel is quite busy and some of the streets nearby house outgrowth of the red light district (so keep that in mind if you are with children), but we felt quite safe around the hotel. The staff was quite nice, but not too friendly.Getting suitcases up and down the floors is easy since the hotel has quite modern elevator. The (standard) double room we had was very small to the point that we did not have enough room to put our suitcases. However, the bathroom was very nice, large, and clean. The room had a safe, which was convenient. There were no ironing boards, etc. in the room as well as no tea\/coffee making facilities and no fridge.. There was a TV with a number of Dutch and German channels as well as several BBC ones. The rooms do not have air conditioning, so they might be uncomfortable during hot weather periods. Wireless internet was available for a surchargeOne of the best things about the hotel was the breakfast, which was included in the room price. Although coffee for some reason is not free, you have a choice of several juices, tea, meats and cheeses, cereal, toast and jam (no fruit, though).Keep in mind that you must pay for your stay upon check-in. They accept credit cards, so this is not a problem. The hotel itself is not very cheap, but it will be hard to find a better value in Amsterdam considering the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ location. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone and would stay there again myself.
