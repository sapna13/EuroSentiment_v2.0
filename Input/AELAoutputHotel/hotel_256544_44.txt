{"text":"Tired Feel--Great Service I recently had a three-night stay by myself at the Four Seasons Hotel in Sydney. I was there strictly for a holiday and to sight-see. I booked a small suite on the Executive Club Floor, and that's exactly what I got. As others have noted, the hotel has seen better days. It has a very tired feel to it--the furnishings are aging and the facility itself desperately needs an upgrade. I spent a lot of money on my room--overall I think the value received was reasonable but not great.My room, located on a high floor, did have a nice view of the Harbor, including the Opera House and the Bridge, but neither window was posiitoned to see the entire Harbor, either while seated at the desk in the small sitting room, or from the bed in the bedroom That was a MAJOR disappointment, since I booked the room based on the view. The only way to get a nice view was to stand by either window. That being said, I did enjoy my stay. The Club had continuous servings of food throughout the day, including a fabulous breakfast (they had a chef prepare eggs to order) and nice evening heavy hors d'oervres, and after dinner drinks with a nice selection of premium spirits. The Club Concierge has to be rated as one of the finest I have ever experienced. She made every effort to make recommendations about restaurants and places of interest. Since I only had 3 days to explore, I tried to make use of every minute--and her help was invaluable. Little touches really helped, like arranging to have breakfast delivered gratis to my room early on the day of my departure. A major disappointment, though, was her inability to push a reservation at my first-choice restaurant--I understand that it is difficult to reserve at the last minute, but at least she tried.The room itself was laid out fine except for the positioning of the windows. There was a nice working desk, a small sitting area with television (neither television in the sitting area or bedroom were a flat screen---they should definitely upgrade), and a small wet bar. The bathroom was very small, though with a separate walk-in shower---I wish it were designed to have its own window looking out on the Harbor. The bedroom was small with a comfortable king bed.I did spend an hour at the outside small pool. The pool area was cozy and well laid-out, and the service was very attentive.Location was great--walking distance to Circle Quay and the Opera House. Service is what sets this hotel apart from others. Simply put, there are few hotel properties that provide the type of service that Four Seasons consistently does, and that was not an exception in Sydney. So despite the fact that the hotel needs some plastic surgery, I would definitely stay there again.
