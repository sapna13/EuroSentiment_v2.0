{"text":"After 11 pm Was there couple of wks ago en route to Australia.We remembered clearly where we put our perfume but it went missing without a trace. Complained to the counter staff, all they said was: will inform the manager. And then? Long silence and avoidance at the counter? Is that what we called customer service? Another incident was this old lady, counter staff, she just sat there and play with the internet, will never help despite I tried my very best to ask her where can I change my foreign currency upon arrival, she just looked at me blindly and said ''come back after 11pm''??? (I'm not gonna wait for another 5 hour for another staff to take over the shift, that's very unprofessional and silly!) Not once but twice. Very arrogant and ignorance at the same time.Horrible experience!!!I will never return to this awful ''hotel'', if you can call it a HOTEL.If you guys got no place to stay but have to put up with this [--] hotel, CONGRAT!!!Claimed to be ''The Best Experience Standard Hotel, there's nothing compare to a simplest hostel in EU, not even Thailand. Prior to my departure, the only thing that really make it up to is the courteous\/ friendly\/ knowledgeable receptionist who's always ready for an answer, given accurate and sufficient info on various subjects. You can always reach out to this Chinese?\/Eurasian? boy at the counter, normally after 11pm, who speaks fluent English (I thought every Singaporean does?), Mandarin, French (He was talking to a French guest)! Didn't get his name though but he's the only one seems to be ''above'' the standard. Good Luck guys! Lock your bags before going out! Totally agree, this might be the THEFT CENTRAL with well organized snatching staff doing horrible things to guest.
