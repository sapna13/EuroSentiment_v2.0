{"text":"Look no further! My family and I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Affinia 50.(6\/17-6\/24). It was our first time to NYC and this hotel is really in a prime location. The hotel is within a short walking distance to Rockefeller Center, 5th ave., American Girl Store, Moma, and Central Park. There are two subway stations within a couple of blocks that can take you to everything you want to see. Directly across the street is Ess a Bagel! (best bagels in the city!) Bliss Spa is on Lexington! One block from the hotel!( My mother and I had the foot reflexology, it was fantastic!)As far as service goes, Affinia 50 was excellent!!! The doormen were always friendly and helpful with which subway train to catch. When I say helpful I mean above and beyond, they mapped out our entire trip to the Museum of Natural History and the subway route to Brooklyn. (we walked the Brooklyn Bridge from the Brooklyn side to Manhattan, Amazing views!!) Guest Services were always aiming to please and a short call away. Anytime we needed more towels or pillows(the hotel has a pillow menu, the whole family tried a different pillow, Fun!) Everything was brought to the room very prompt. The club floor was great and the continental breakfast served their was very good.($14.95) We enjoyed going down to the club floor at night and watching the flat screens ,sipping wine and talking about our day!I have to also mention our room, it was perfect. The room was Clean, large ,it had comfortable beds and Aveda products in the bathroom. We loved this hotel and will stay here when we go back to New York!
