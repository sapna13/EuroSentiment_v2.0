{"text":"A Very Average Stay - Overstressed Visit After our recent trip to Valencia down the coast from Barcelona, we decided to take a visit to Barcelona and to stay at the Hotel Arts. It was a modern-luxury hotel, which was fine, but the hotel and the conferences they hosted were out of control and mis-managed.Note About Our Stay: A MASSIVE business conference was going on in the hotel. The attendees were extremely rude, all yelling on their cell phones, conducting meetings in the hallway and elevators, and from what numerous staff had told us, many weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even staying at the hotel, but were taking up pool chairs and all the seats at the restaurants, which made all the paying customers extremely angry.The Hotel: The 42 story tower was built in occasion for the 1992 Barcelona Olympic games, and with its sister, are arguably the most visible landmarks in Barcelona. Entering the hotel from a busy street, the porte-cochere had fountains and waterfalls on the right hand side, with a small lobby, with a decadent food store there. Lobby: Going up the elevator to the main lobby, the doors open and we cant even see the floor because of all the bankers and the girls sending them off to their next appointment. However, check-in was fast and easy, with a personal tour of the property with the check-in manager. The lobby, from what I could see, was nicely laid out, with check-in and concierge in the front, with some deep seating toward the back.Room: Taking the elevator up to the 27th floor, we arrived on our floor and to our room overlooking some beaches, the port, the old city, and Montjuic; a very pretty view! In exploring my room, we noticed all of the high-tech touches of the room. Everything electrical in the room can be controlled from the bedside and door side console. The room was of average size and average furniture for a Ritz, but one special thing was a seating area near the panoramic window, which had a heavy lowering shade to keep out the sun and sounds. The bed was very comfortable and had very nice sheets. The bathroom was huge with a separate bath, separate bidet and toilet, and a great separate shower. Very nice indeed.Fitness Center and Spa: The fitness center is located on a lower part of the hotel, after a tricky trek. I never used the fitness center, but saw it, and it looked of a relatively small size for the hotel. However the Spa is located on the top three floors of the hotel, and is brought to us by The Six Senses Group. In a tour of the Spa, a very nice locker room and relaxation area with steam rooms and balconies overlooking the Mediterranean. I imagine it was very nice, and a plus, rarely had any conference attendees.Dining: We dined only at the restaurant off the lobby, because we could never find a seat at a restaurant at the hotel. The restaurant was nice, again the work staff was very short of people, but the food quality was very nice and tasty. Tip: the shops at the Port Olimpic (right next to the hotel) are extremely nice to dine at and are a great way to see some of Barcelona.Cost: For the cost we paid, I should have known something was going on, for a high-200 price for a deluxe room, which seemed to good to be true for a Ritz, and now I see why. Otherwise, like everything else now-a-days, most food were in the high 20 euros. Service: This is the only thing that would bring me back to the hotel. During our stay, we met the Director of Rooms, Sandra, and she was very gracious, insisting to meet us and get our input on the conference situation. She further assured us that the hotel has not invited back many of the conferences for next year for the reason many other reviewers have noticed. Very similarly, Stephanie at the front was very assisting to our stay. This would be one of the only reasons I would return.Overall: A very average stay, while we had some horrible times, we also had some great times and were treated with decency by many people of the staff, who were visibly tired from the conference, looking like many of the over-worked and yelled at airline employees. Now I feel their pain. The service and the rooms would be the only reason I would return. It is very different than many Ritz-Carlton's.
