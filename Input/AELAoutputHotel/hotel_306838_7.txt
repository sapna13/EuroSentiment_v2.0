{"text":"graet value just got back from the aston what a great holiday!!the hotel is well kept with large rooms and well kept gardens.the food was nice sometimes only just warm but the majority of the time nice.we travelled with singapore airlines from manchester via singapore,this is the best airline i have flown with nothing was too much trouble. we went on several trips elephant park 2 hr drive but well worth it you get to see bali on the way there also a 2hr trip white water rafting what a laugh!! well worth it.we booked a taxi driver for the day 500,000 ind rupiah(√ä√£¬¢37) he took us all over the island we were gone 11 hrs and saw loads barong dancing, wood carvers rice terraces temple on the lake temple in the sea all beautiful. we are definitely coming back to bali but we will stop in the grand bali mirage about half a mile down the road a lot bigger and better hotel. the aston is in my opinion a 4 star hotel but great value the grand bali mirage is about √ä√£¬¢200 deared but we walked round it and it is impressive. a slight moan about the aston is you have to sign for every meal and every drink and there is a differrent menu for all inclusive all in all a good hotel and well worth the money. the best beach we saw was dreamland but you get pestered with the sellers ALL day. we fell in love with bali the people are soooo friendly we will be going back in a few years ","annotations":[{"endOffset":468,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":463}]}
