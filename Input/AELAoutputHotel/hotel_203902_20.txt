{"text":"great stay We stayed at the Balestri in mid November visiting our daughter in Florence...the hotel is located a few blocks from the Uffizi Gallery and right on the Arno River. You can see the Ponte Vecchio from some of the rooms. It is a five minute walk to the Piazza Della Signoria and the rest of the historic district...The hotel is still undergoing some renovations, although most are done. The outside looks great, and the lobby is almost finished. Nonetheless, nothing interferes with the enjoyment of the hotel. The staff were, for the most part, courteous at worst and really helpful at best.The staff in the breakfast room deserve extra kudos for their professional but very attentive manners. The breakfast is cold, but expansive, and you will not go away hungry...The rooms (we had two - a single for my mother in law and a triple for my wife, me and our second daughter) were very nice. Ours was the better of the two, facing the river with two balconies and a great view up the hills on the other side of the city. The street noise was not bad, as the windows were tight...but then again, it was cold while we were there and we kept them closed most of the time! In summer, they would certainly let in street traffic sounds.There is no restaurant in the hotel, but there are several within a two minute walk - the Tratorria Benvenuto being the best we tried. The real beauty of the Hotel is its proximity to all you want to see in town, while being just off the busy path that most hotels are on.I\/ we would go back in a minute..the best complement I can think of!
