{"text":"Fantastic Christmas at the Langham Place. My wife and I spent our Christmas and New Year holiday at the Langham Place and it was the best ever. Even though it was three years since we last stayed here there was note welcoming us back. We stayed a total of nine nights and booked the Sweet Place on the 36th floor at the club level. It was well worth it for the extra room space and inclusive club benefits and facilities. Everything about the hotel was first class. The service, staff, room and food were all excellent and although some reviewers were a little unhappy about the location of the hotel we really didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find it an inconvenience at all. We always felt very safe when walking in the streets around the hotel and the MTR and all of the Kowloon \/ Hong Kong public transport links are superb. Even at it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ busiest on Christmas and New Years Eve it was really very easy to get around. Buy an Octopus card, it automatically deducts the fare as you go and can be used on just about all public transport including the Peak Tram, Star Ferry and even for small purchases in some convenience stores. It is simple to top it up and the small deposit and outstanding balance is refundable.The whole Langham Place experience from the moment we took the pre-booked hotel car on our arrival to our departure from Hong Kong airport was superb. All of the Langham Place staff at the airport and throughout the hotel were exceptional, I really can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say enough good things about them. The hotel is great value for five star in Hong Kong and I would certainly stay here again.
