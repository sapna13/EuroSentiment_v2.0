{"text":"Like living in the city! We just returned from an adult (i.e. no kids, they are at camp) vacation in NYC. We had seen the Affinia Dumont before and liked it, but did a lot of research here and elsewhere before booking. We decided on the Dumont and did not regret it. We booked a one-bedroom suite at the Dumont through Expedia, which had a substantial discount on all three nights, for substantially less than most single rooms in other parts of the city. While we did not get the great view of the Chrysler building that I had hoped for, we were in the back of the hotel which is very quiet and still has a partial view of the East River. The TV in the bedroom did not work and they brought in a new one immediately. Staff are great and very friendly. The spa and fitness center are fantastic. We brought our own wine, sodas, and snacks, and got a fantastic takeout meal one afternoon from Guy and Gallard (also has THE best coffee and great bagels and pastries), utilizing the kitchen is one great way to save a few dollars. We had never taken a bus before in NYC, but there are bus lines right at the hotel in both directions and they go places the subway doesn't. We took a bus down to the East Village and walked and shopped all the way across through SoHo and the West Village, then took the subway and bus back for an easy trip. The Murray Hill neighborhood is wonderful - staying in a suite at the Dumont makes you feel like you are really living in the city! A taxi ride to dinner in the Upper East Side was only 10 minutes, so the place really is closer to everything than it looks on the map, and it is so relaxing to get back to a quiet residential area after all the hustle of Manhattan. One note of caution if you stay at the Dumont - it is often hard to get taxis there, and forget it during rush hour. If you have theater tickets, have dinner in the neighborhood and then catch a taxi at about 7:30, you will have less trouble and less stress!! Otherwise use the subways and buses to get around.
