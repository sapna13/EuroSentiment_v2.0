{"text":"Disappointment I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l try to keep it short and get straight to the point, since I know that it gets tiring reading long reviews.We have traveled to the Caribbean extensively; all-inclusive places only. Destinations include Riviera Maya, Punta Cana, La Romana, Jamaica (Montego Bay and Negril.)It was 4 of us: 2 adults and 2 kids (ages 10 and 5.)Hotel is 45 min. from the airport, could be more if they stop to drop others off before you.Check-in was fine, smooth. I was able to get a very nice room, close to the beach, on the side adjacent to the pool, 2343, 3rd floor, with essentially a direct ocean view.Hotel is new, opened last December. Rooms, pool, lobby are magnificent. Pool is over 4000ft long, about 4ft deep throughout, with a huge whirlpool area, as well as several kiddie pools.Beach is fine, lots of chairs, but if you want shade, then need to be out there before 8am to reserve.Ocean -- NOT GOOD! Water is way to rough. At times reminded of Jersey shore water. The weather was great, no winds or rain. The reason has to be the physical location of this hotel. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ much further up north, relative to other Punta Cana\/Bavaro hotels, away from the Caribbean waters and much into the Atlantic ocean. Early morning and late afternoon were better. However, overall this water was unsuitable for us and especially kids.Food √à√\u2020\u2022?Mediocre. Notable absence of a wide variety of fruits, Buffet selection is very poor. Same salads every day. (We were at Riu Negril last year; the selection at buffet restaurant was several notches higher.) Steakhouse\/Seafood restaurant is not bad, but it won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fill you up. Japanese is ok, try it only if Hibachi is a novelty to you, otherwise, skip it. French, didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go (don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ allow kids under 12), heard very nice reviews though, so go; Caribbean √à√\u2020\u2022?didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try.Kids club is a grandiose castle\/fortress with water slides and its own pool! But it is completely misplaced and located near the lobby very far away from the beach and the pool. Weird.Entertainment √à√\u2020\u2022?usual √à√\u2020\u2022?they try hard, but skill level is low. On the positive note, the saxophone player across from the buffet restaurant entrance is a very nice idea!Service √à√\u2020\u2022?average. Waiters are slow and tend to skip your table quite often. Bar service is ok, no problems there.To summarize it, the most important factors for us are food and ocean\/sea water with both of them being a disappointment. Hence, I would not recommend this hotel.
