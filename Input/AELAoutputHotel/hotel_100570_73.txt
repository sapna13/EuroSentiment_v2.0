{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location We stayed at the Westin between Xmas and New Year and were looking forward to it after everything we had read here on TA.The location is excellent - right in the city, a stone's throw from everything and a minute's walk from the monorail.We had a room on the 33rd floor which looked directly at the Space Needle. The view was fantastic! The room was large and we were very comfortable, though there was little storage space. The bed was wonderful - not a bit like your usual hotel bed!The bathroom was small and we were quite disappointed with the so-called Heavenly Bath. From the description we were expecting a large, deep, full-sized bath that we could sink into and fully relax in. The reality was a short, half-depth bath that you couldn't stretch out in (and I'm 5'2!). It may be that we have a thing for the indulgence of a long hot soak in the UK, but it's worth noting for anyone else who, like us, was expecting something more!On the plus-side, you are provided with robes, toiletries, tissues and plenty of lovely fluffy towels. The hairdrier is a proper salon-style model so leave yours at home if you normally don't like to leave it to chance.The hotel lobby is very large and plush and the checking in process was speedy and efficient, which was very welcome as we arrived on a late train from Vancouver. One negative was that the quality of housekeeping wasn't great. The bedclothes were just sort of thrown over and there were a couple of days when the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly.This is a very large hotel that is popular with business travellers and I can see why as it really is a great place to stay. What I would say is that if you prefer smaller hotels that offer a more personal style of service then this isn't for you. However - the location, views, decor, facilities and cost all make it a perfect Seattle base. ","annotations":[]}
