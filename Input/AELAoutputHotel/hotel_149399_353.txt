{"text":"Great but not perfect My boyfriend and I were looking to book a long weekend (Thursday-Monday) at a tropical, all-inclusive resort. We're in our mid-twenties and neither of us have overflowing bank accounts, so price was a big factor. Both of us had heard good things about Punta Cana and once we saw the price was reasonable (through Orbitz) we decided to go there.Melia Caribe Tropical had great pictures online, and I have to say the resort really lived up to the pictures. The place is beautiful and nicely laid out. The bedroom was surprisingly large, and it was very clean. However, we did encounter some problems. When we arrived at the resort, we had to wait over an hour to check in - the people ahead of us in line ended up waiting close to 2 hours! When it was finally our turn, it took about 15 minutes to officially check in and get our room keys. Maybe it's an American thing, but there was just no sense of urgency to get people through the line and checked in. Many of us were frustrated.I know very limited Spanish - my boyfriend doesn't know any - so at times there was a language barrier. But the staff was always friendly and willing to help, even if they didn't really understand what you were saying.Making reservations for dinner at night was a little difficult. Sometimes the phone rang unanswered for minutes, so I'd hang up and call back and after a couple more minutes someone would finally answer. From what I was told by other people vacationing there, the resort doesn't like to overwhelm their staff so the restaurants are never very full. The buffets for breakfast and lunch were pretty good - no complaints there, although I would recommend going at a time when the place is not packed with people - otherwise it is very hard to find a seat\/table.All in all, for what my boyfriend and I wanted in a vacation, Melia Caribe was pretty great. It wasn't perfect - but few vacations are. ","annotations":[]}
