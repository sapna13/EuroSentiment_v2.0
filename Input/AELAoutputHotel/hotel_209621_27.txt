{"text":"Horrendous Service My wife and I stayed at the Normandie along with two other couples, all in for a mutual friend's wedding. The hotel is very easy on the eyes, but in a somewhat inconvenient location because you need a cab to get to either a nice beach or to Old San Juan. The hotel has a beach, but it is very small. You're much better off getting to a beach east of the Normadie during the day. That said, we had many problems with the service. In fact, this was the worst service we have ever experienced in a hotel. We were told by soon-to-be-wed friend that she had left a San Juan welcome kit at the Front Desk. We didn't get the welcome kit until we checked out and that was only after asking 4 different employees. Also, the breakfast service in one of the hotel's restaurants was equally atrocius. Not a single wait staff led us to a table or offered us a drink. At the end, when we went to pay for the buffet (which was not complimentary), we could not even get the attention of the wait staff. We left without paying for the below-average food. Finally, when we complained at the check-out about our bad experience, the manager on duty offered us a free meal at the same restaurant where the wait staff ignored us. We declined and vowed to write this review. If we had to do it again, we would have booked a hotel in Old San Juan. There are restaurants, museums, and bars, which cannot be said for the area around the Normadie. If you want to visit a beach around San Juan, it's just as easy to take a cab from Old San Juan as the Normadie. San Juan was fantastic, as was the rest of Puerto Rico we saw (Culebra, Fajardo, the food, the people, the culture). The Normandie was an oustandingly poor exception. If we have the opportunity to go back to San Juan again, it would take a lot for us to darken their door again.
