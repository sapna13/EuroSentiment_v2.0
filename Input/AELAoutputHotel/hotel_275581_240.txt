{"text":"City Inn Westminster, what a gem. I booked this hotel after reading reviews on this website. I was somewhat dubious that it could be as good as described but it was. The location is excellent, it is about five minutes walk from the Houses of Parliament but the street is quiet, and tidy. This area has a mixture of apartments and government offices and is clean and safe. The hotel is literally round the back of the Tate Gallery. Check in was efficient and courteous thanks to the lovely Pilar. The hotel is modern, bright and airy and has bars, a restaurant, a fitness suite and conference facilities. The room was excellent having all the usual things as well as DVD player (the hotel has a selection of films in the concierge) and a mini hifi system. Everything in the room was very nice. Decent biscuits with the tea\/ coffee making facilities as well as decent tea\/ coffee. Fluffy bathrobes and nice shower gel in the bathroom (although no bath). Air conditioning and WiFi as well. Overall the room was very very nice. The breakfast was very efficient and very comprehensive. Cereal, yoghourt, fruit, smoothy, croisant, pain au chocolat, muffins, cheese, cold meat, salmon, bagels as well as cooked breakfast (including kedgeree and eggs benedict). Here again everything was very nice. The staff here are also good looking, I felt as though I were in a film. Room and breakfast for two cost √ä√£¬¢113. What a bargain. Fantastic location, great facilities, great room, great food, this has to score the full 5 marks. The staff and the hotel itself really tries hard to make you feel special, will absolutely not go anywhere else after this.
