{"text":"Bad and Ugly, with very little good! My wife and i booked our trip to the Majestic in Oct. of 07' Upon arrival at the hotel we were advised as well as many other guests that the hotel was Over-booked by as many as 60 rooms and for 2 nights we would have to stay somewhere else. We attempted to get them to place us at the RUI as we had friends staying there, however they insisted that they did not have an agreement with them and we would have to stay at the Gran Bahia. Note to yourselves, Stay at the Gran Bahia Principe Ambar section if you truely want the 5 star experience. We were offered some lame excursions, free internet, free room service, and VIP treatment at Majestic, we were also more than welcome to go back and forth from the resort as we please. How pointless to have to commute to your resort, and free internet????Ok, so we served our time at the Bahia which to our dismay was the best part of our vacation. The majestic is far from 5 star. I happen to think the breakfast was the worst meal and the others are very so so. The room: I forgot to mention we cut our trip short and came home early. The room smelled like mold and according to my allergies and how stuffed up I am and was every morning there was a lot of mold in that room. Horrible bed, actually broken and leaned to one side. Nothing in this place says 5 stars, nothing. It screams for a 5 star rating and outwardly appears as such, but never lives up to it's obligations to be an actual 5 star resort. Service was scetchy as it alway is in Punta Cana, nothing new to report there, but out of all the places we have been in Punta Cana, Barcello Beach, Palace, Bahia, this place had the nastiest room. Our friends stayed at RUI Naiboa a resort that was not 5 star according to Victor at Majestic. Guess what, their room didn't smell like a mold experiment for the local science fair. In the end, we left early as I kept getting sicker and sicker the more nights I slept in that room. During the day I would fight off everything and feel ok, but as soon as I stepped foot into that room I felt miserable. I know that when your on vacation you should never attach any value to the room because you don't want to spend all day in your room in the first place, but when it makes you sick to sleep in your room that's a problem. In the end, they should have never been in a situation to have overbooked by so many rooms, and they should have never placed us in the Bahia. I'll be writing my review of the Bahia soon. The majestic seemed like a serious step-down from the Bahia and they need to do their homework on where they send other guests because I can think of 4 people that will not be staying at the Majestic ever again. Can't believe I am just happy to be home!
