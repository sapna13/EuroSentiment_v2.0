{"text":"New Year in the Millennium! We, being a party of six stayed over the New Year for five nights. We were all given rooms in the West tower, despite trying to change to the East tower, as we were there for a special occasion. Only one of the rooms had a view of the city (3235). The other two 3030 ans 3230 were both in the corner and had partial river views. We could see straight into rooms opposite from these rooms and the beds were a lot smaller. There was a kitchen area with fridge, hob and oven, but not a lot of use without utensils etc. The bathrooms were in need of a makeover.On a positive note the entrance lobby was very nice and the staff most helpful. The pool was warm and had great views.The hotel is in a good position with the walk to Grand Central just over five minutes away. We used the little deli just up the road most days and tried John's for breakfast, which had a great choice. We had a couple of problems with the taxis outside the hotel. The first time they refused to take us as we came out of the hotel without luggage, they were obviously all waiting to get fares to the airport (more money in it for them). The 2nd time we needed to get across town around 5pm for a dinner cruise at 6pm and no-one would take us. The hotel staff suggested we take the subway to Times Square and walk the rest. This was not ideal in high heels and took around 30 mins to walk. I don't think we were the only ones to have this problem by the number of people running onto the boat just before it sailed.All in all these were the only problems we came across during our stay, and the rest was brilliant.
