{"text":"Beautiful Hotel My husband and I did a stopover in Singapore on our way to and from Australia; and we stayed at the InterContinental in Singapore for a total of six days (three at the beginning of the trip and three at the end). The InterCon is in a great location, close to the Arab Quarter and the old colonial area (near Raffles).The hotel itself is a beautiful colonial building with an old wing and a newer tower. On our first visit, we stayed in a room in the new tower. The room was wonderful with a very comfortable king-size bed and lovely furniture and decorations. The large modern bathroom had both a full-size bathtub and a separate shower stall. The room also had a small safe, black out curtains, a large LCD screen television and cable.On our second visit, the staff gave us a room in the old wing, which is situated above a shopping area. The room was overlooking the street and was rather quiet, and it was large with lovely hardwood floors. However, there was a plumbing problem - we had a steady leak coming through the ceiling by our door. We alerted the staff to the problem, and they switched us to another room in the same wing. Unfortunately, this room overlooked the shopping area and was rather noisy. We finally ended up in a room in the new tower area again, which was again very nice.The breakfast was very good, with a huge buffet, but it was relatively expensive. The bar was really cozy; we ended a few of our days there with a tall drink.I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Singapore, but I would also warn them to avoid rooms in the old wing overlooking the shopping area, if possible. Aside from this issue, the hotel is wonderful, and the staff is very pleasant and accommodating. ","annotations":[]}
