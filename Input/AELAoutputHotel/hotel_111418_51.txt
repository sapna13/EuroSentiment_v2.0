{"text":"Really good stay at the Park Plaza We had a deluxe king size corner room with 2 windows and a small view on the 12th floor.The room was a great size with a sofa, desk, walk in wardrobe and huge chest of drawers with a large tv. Strange thing to mention but the bedside cabinets were a good size as well which made it easy to put books,clocks etc onto. Very quiet couldn't hear a thing from adjoining rooms.The bathroom was small but very clean and plenty of towels and a great shower. Normal size hairdryer as well instead of those silly on the wall pull out ones - important detail for us girls with lots of hair to dry!!One of the most comfortable beds I have slept on with loads of different types of pillow so you just chose the type you liked. All kept very clean and tidy.Location of hotel is ideal with good restaurants on the doorstep and easy to get around the city.Literally the only thing I could complain about was that the concierge wasn't that helpful when my husband had a minor but irritating eye infection which to be able to get anything for he had to get a prescription from a doctor - the concierge told us there was no choice but to go to a hospital and be referred to a medical centre which would have meant a long wait into precious holiday time. We went to the local CVS who sent us to a walk in clinic next door and it was sorted in 2 hours in total. Small point but I did think the concierge perhaps should have known about that for guests who have minor problems.Other than that - great stay and would definitely stay at the Park Plaza again.
