{"text":"What are you expecting? I just returned from a 5 night stay at the Holiday Inn Express in Seattle. This is the typical hotel chain my husband and I stay at, to save a little money for everything else that goes into a vacation. This hotel is just fine for a Holiday Inn. I really think some people have some high expectations, and you can't do that here! We had a great room with a view of the Space Needle. Yes, there is traffic below, but I never noticed it. It's about 15-20 minute walk down to Pike Place Market, the real highlight of this city. Your best bet is to go down Battery to 1st Avenue. You will avoid most of the numerous homeless people that plague downtown Seattle. The room was very clean, breakfast was great, though very crowded. We only parked a car for 1 night, and after getting stuck at the end of the parking lot, we got a spot that fit our sedan rental. Parking is tight, but the price is not bad. I did a lot of research before going on this trip - months of research. I encourage anyone who enjoys walking to stay at this hotel and save some cash. I didn't find the monorail to be helpful in getting down to Pikes Place Market, it is better for the shopping district only. SafeCo Field was about 2 miles from the hotel and we walked to two games while we were there, not bad at all, as long as you take the right route. Through all of my research, I never saw information on the big homeless problem here, and most appear to be on drugs, so be cautious what you carry and the streets you take. We were never bothered, but I would have been uncomfortable if I were by myself. ","annotations":[]}
