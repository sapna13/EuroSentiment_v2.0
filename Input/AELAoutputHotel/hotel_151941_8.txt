{"text":"Perfect Place to Stay Came in late on a red eye after missing connection to San Juan. At 6 am Jean was at the front desk with a wonderful smile and great hospitality. He welcomed us and told us to help ourselves to breakfast, stored our luggage and let us wait by the pool until a room was available. By 9:30 am we were in a room and getting some much needed sleep. Thanks so much to JEAN!!Now for the room it was a corner room #315 and was clean and comfortable. The bed was soft, the pillows outstanding and we had plenty of room for the 2 of us. There was a window in the tiny bathroom that looked out to the lagoon. The shower was nice and strong and refreshing after a full day of travel. Although the towels were standard issue the soaps and shampoos were nice.The pool area is kept very clean, although it is small, and the loungers make for an enjoyable end to the day. The breakfast was more than adequate and met all of our needs. There was always plenty of food available.Our luggage was stored all day while we enjoyed Puerto Rico before heading out on our cruise. What a nice convenience to have at no extra charge. All in all this hotel is excellent if you are looking for a budget friendly hotel with outstanding customer service and a relaxing atmosphere in the heart of the condado shopping area. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone unlike our post visit to Condado Plaza (read my review there).
