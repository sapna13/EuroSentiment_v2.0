{"text":"Beautiful Amankila Pick up from the airport and drive to Amankila was seemless. We arrived around midnight, and the lack of traffic at that time of night meant our transfer took only 70 mins or so ( 2+ hours during the day ).On arrival we were upgraded to an oceanfront villa ( no. 5 ) which I think had possibly the best location, other than the three feature villas. Our arrival drink was a lovely bottle of French champagne, which we drank on our huge balcony, overlooking the surf.Our four days there were spent on a huge private bale next to the bottom of the three tiered pools. We seemed to sleep a lot ! The environment is so tranquil, it is a perfect place to relax. From the moment you get up and have breakfast by the pool, you seem to fall in to almost a trance. The Australian head chef - James - spoke with us most mornings, and also planned a private poolside dinner for us on the night of our 20th wedding anniversary. ( We considered the beachside bonfire setting, but it was very windy ). We ventured to the hills one night for the canapes  daquiris by sunset outing. This was beautiful - a most gorgeous view over the hills. It felt very luxuriant. The only negative here was that the canapes were not well chilled, and we felt this may have been the cause of my husband's subsequent illness which hit him from the next morning.Overall the food was good, but not exceptional. In particular, my husband didn't like the breakfasts as the eggs were not to his liking. What I did like was the afternoon teas - beautiful ginger tea served with local cakes, served by the poolside.The beach is quite pleasant - there are ships about every day, but they really are not an issue. The black sand is not unattractive, and also not an issue.The resort is heavily stamped by the influence of the GM - Tracey. She sent flowers to our room accompanied by a personal note. Often we would see her around the resort, and she seemed to be very involved with both staff and guests. The atmosphere at the hotel is lovely - you feel like someone has pushed a  go - slow  button on you, and you can't help but relax. The decor and surroundings, including the foliage, is almost minimalist and adds to the ability to erase everything from your mind - hard to describe, but I felt that my mind had been purged of all thoughts of home ! I agree with a comment I read in earlier review that the beds are quite hard. I like a firm bed, but this one was too hard for me - I mentioned it to staff, and I'm not sure what they did, but it felt softer on subsequent nights ( You never knew what housekeeping staff did, as you never saw them ! The were incredibly discreet )After four days we felt the need to move on - I think that 3 - 4 days is probably the right length of time here. We had originally booked for 7 nights, but the hotel had no issue with us transferring to Amanusa. The transfer there, during the day, was slow and boring at times, as we were often stuck in traffic. I would recommend transferring \/ going to the airport either early or late in the day.In summary, Amankila is stunning. It is a perfect place to clear the cobwebs from your mind, and absolutely chill out in beautiful surroundings. You are made to feel like a very special guest. If you are a foodie, it may not be your cup of tea, but that said, the food is not bad.
