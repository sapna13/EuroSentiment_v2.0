{"text":"Loved it I'm surprised by the reviews of the Caribe Hilton. My husband and I and our two children(8 and 11) had a great experience. My husband travels for work and we stayed using Hilton Honors points (diamond club member, I think) so we had a room in the executive tower which is newer and very nice. We actually lived in PR for six months and this was our mini vacation before flying home. We had been all over the island and my husband and I had also stayed in the Ponce Hilton (south side of island). I admit that the service and overall appearance of the hotel is not as nice as some hiltons and even the Ponce Hilton, but it was still very nice. (don't expect the same quality of service in PR as in the states - they have a much more laid back approach to everything and you will wait for food everywhere you go - even fast food - just let go of your Western expectations, relax and follow the local motto -no worries) I also admit that the food is VERY expensive, even compared to other nice hotels on the island. (there are restuarants within walking distance, both cheap fast food and nice ones - you can also always take a cab as well). Having said that, I will tell you what I liked and why I would recommend it to anyone.1. It's within walking distance to one of the best beaches in San Juan - Escambron. It's very popular with locals, which gives you a taste of the local culture, and it is a great place for beginners to snorkel. It's one of the places we always took visitors. The peninsula of sorts is a great place to walk at night and there is a decent nice restuarant there with an outdoor patio overlooking the beach. make sure to try the Red Snapper (traditionally cooked whole, fins and all in a beautiful presentation - check out their sign which has a picture on it)2. It is also with in walking or short cab ride to Old San Juan, which is a must see and do.3. The scenery is very nice. The beach is in a cove and looks over toward escambron beach. There are ruins of the old wall of the city across the little bay. You also get a great view of the San Juan coast line, especially at night.4. The grounds are attractive and large enough to find a quiet place, most of the time. It is a great place to sit and look at the ocean.5. The pool is large and good for kids or adults wanting to lounge, with a bar in the adult pool.6.The beach is great for families - who cares that the sand is imported - at least it's clean. There is a raft with slides that our kids liked. Beginners can also snorkel here - try over by the rocks . One of the tourist groups that takes people to snorkel is often out in the bay just outside of the beach markers.7. It's off of the beaten path away from most of the other Hotels.FYI, I have also stayed at the Intercontinental and loved it very much. It is on the nicest white sand beach on the Island and in the heart of Hotel row near the airport. (Isla Verde) It may be a bit nicer, but the grounds and pool area are much smaller. They do have a great place to sit on the beach and have a casual dinner watching the sun go down. Take a cab there to spend an afternoon and stay and have dinner on the beach.We recommended the Caribe to a friend going to SAn Juan for work. She's traveled all over the world. She spent a week there (including a night at the Intercontential) and LOVED the Hotel Caribe. She sat outside until late at night never wanting to go inside. Annother of my husbands co-workers who travels extensively and is very picky about where he stays, has stayed in many of the upscale hotels in San Juan and always chooses to come back here when on the Island. He even chooses it over the Ponce Hilton and the Intercontinental .Hope this helps.
