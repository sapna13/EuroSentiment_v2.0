{"text":"Nice place, bad managers Don't get me wrong: the bad people are the managers and accountants. Nothing bad with the people serving clients, they were perfectly nice and efficient. When I booked my room online (on Price Travel), a standard room for 2 people, and for 2 nights (you can book a petite room for cheaper) i got an error message on the website just after filling my credit card informations, saying the transaction could not be made. Trusting nothing was recorded, I tried again. Same message, so I tried again. Finally i went to another website (booking.com) and made the reservation. When we arrived at the hotel, the deskman told me i had 4 reservations... I went green, so he told me not to worry, i wouldn't pay for all, but just one reservation. Good. We stayed there for 2 nights; I know now that they gave us a petite room (N√ä√©?1106), but charged me for the standard room I booked. Fisrt dishonest behavior. The hotel is nice, the room, actually small, was nice, the bed was perfect and it was clean. Good room service and nice employees. We left after 2 nice nights, paying the bill at the desk as we checked out. A few days later I discovered 4 charges of 165 US dollars on my bank account! After a week travelling around Mexico, we came back in Mexico City. So I went to the hotel to make all that clear. I met a nice guy, speaking english, who asked me to write him an email explaining all the problem. I did. He answered me saying he will do his best do bring the money back . That's it. No news since, no money back. That was a month ago. Second very very bad behavior... Hard to believe, right? Around 650 US $ stolen. Make your opinion...
