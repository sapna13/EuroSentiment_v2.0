{"text":"lovely time overall We have just returned from a week at this hotel. Overall we had a lovely, relaxing holiday which is exactly what we hoped for. However, I would say that a week is long enough, just because the evening entertainment is quite dull, and personally I get quite bored of relaxing after a week! Hotel and location is lovely, rooms were clean tidy, well kept, plenty of space. Any problems we had eg. flickering bulbs were fixed quickly. Pool is clean. Beach is fantastic (having been on two previous occasions to Dom Rep it was refreshing to be able to stroll for miles down the beach and feel safe because there are so many people around). Gym facilities, jacuzzi's and sauna were good. Food is good if you eat meat (especially recommended is the seafood restaurant) - but vegetarians beware - Caribbean countries are not good at catering for us and this hotel struggled to label foods. eg Bean soup had lamb in it! Also there's very little choice for veggies in some of the speciality restaurants. Make sure you book in early for the speciality restaurants as spaces are limited. The only problems we had were with some of the staff - some of whom had very limited English and others who were rude and very unhelpful. As we checked out they tried to overcharge us for some laundry and someone calling herself Teresa refused to get a Manager and nearly caused us to miss our transfer to the airport. Make sure you check out well in time for your transfer as we learnt the staff are not good at dealing with problems!Despite this last minute problem I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants a week of relaxation and sunshine in a lovely location.
