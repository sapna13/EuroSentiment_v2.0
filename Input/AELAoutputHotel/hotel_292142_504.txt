{"text":"Believe every word you read! We have just returned to the UK from our 4 day\/5 night trip to NYC and this was our chosen hotel. (a full trip report will appear later when i have caught up). From the moment our taxi pulled up outside the hotel and we were met by a smiling Chris on the door, to the early morning call on the last day to tell us our ride to JFK was waiting outside, we have nothing but praise. We booked a junior suite and were on the corner of the 26th floor with a view from one side up Manhattan towards the Chrysler and on the other towards the East River. We were visiting for my wifes birthday and i had casually mentioned that when booking last November - and on arrival there was a card, complimentary wine and fruit. The room was huge and the bed lovely and comfortable - in the mornings we raised the curtains, propped up the pillows and with that first cup of coffee, watched the sun rise over the East River skyline. Admittedly the bathroom was a little dinky but more than adequate. As for location - as everyone else has said you are on E34th street but we found it to be the ideal place. It was fairly quiet (as much as NYC can be) 5 mins from ESB, 5-10 from GCT and the Chrysler, 10 mins from Macys and 15-20 from Times Square. There are loads of places to eat and drink within a 10 minute walk (Sarges is just around the corner on 3rd and Keens Steakhouse a light stroll away). You also have the 24 hour deli\/market a couple of doors away or a Starbucks within 3-4 mins. All in all a great place to stay and we will definately return.
