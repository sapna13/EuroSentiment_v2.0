{"text":"Well located, pleasant experience. Will return! Overall - a well located hotel at the heart of Ginza; near shops, subways and large range of restaurants from cheap eat to most expensive. Strong retro styled building that gives a business √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√±outique hotel√à√\u2020\u2022?feel (the lifts have sliding block indicator that actually click over each floor with a sound). Compact room size that offer adequate floor area for bags. Good size bath room for Japanese standards. No problem in returning for my next stay. Breakfast is expensive at the hotel, as expected in all Japanese hotels. More reasonable if you go for the local coffee shop - big mug of blended coffee at Y160. Service is attentive and staff spoke reasonable English. Check in \/ out time √à√\u2020\u2022?disappointingly restrictive! Earliest check in time 3 PM and latest check out time by 11 AM with extra hour charge at Y1000. This is a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√ºard rule√à√\u2020\u2022?and typical of Japan hotels, even though there may be rooms available. Pretty stupid rules; Japan Travel Bureau please take note.Facilities - a compact hotel with few extra services. There is a large TV in the room with just one English Channel (BBC); access via a language selection that did not work well as the selected language kept reverting back to Japanese after some minutes. Internet access was free but you need to obtain a cable from the Reception (this practice is common in most Japan hotels). Coffee and tea are also supplied free of charge but the facilities are hidden away that you need to play hide and seek in finding them.Shakesp380, Sydney Australia ","annotations":[{"endOffset":628,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":622},{"endOffset":643,"mention":"mug","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mug_Root_Beer"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":661,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":655},{"endOffset":1427,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1421},{"endOffset":1435,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1432},{"endOffset":1427,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1421},{"endOffset":1435,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1432},{"endOffset":1427,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1421},{"endOffset":1435,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1432},{"endOffset":1427,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1421},{"endOffset":1435,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1432},{"endOffset":1427,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1421},{"endOffset":1435,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1432}]}
