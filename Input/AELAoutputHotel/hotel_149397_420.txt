{"text":"A Four Star (not more) Experience - Expectations Missed Stayed 1 week December 25, 2006 at Bavaro Princess with my wife and 9 year old daughter. We travel extensively in Mexico and the Caribean mainly at 4+ and 5 star hotels. Bavaro Princess is a 4 star hotel (not 5 star). That is our main gripe because it is advertised as 5 star and expectations are that we will get a 5 star only to be disappointed.Accomodation: - room is really excellent.Food:Main Restaurant - Hispanolla, is okay but you will never walk out saying that it was great. Side restaurants - this hotel expects that you will dine 4 or 5 times at the side restaurants. Most are okay but again you will never be walking out saying that anything was fantastic.Chopin - a buffet better than Hispanolla.Gaucho- mainly beef, okay.Sakura - Chinese, okay. Miguel, the manager, understands customer service (he might be the only guy at this hotel that does).Bella Pasta- below average and service is an insult to customers. The manager at this restaurant could not care less what customers think ( a complete zero).Cafe Del Mar- OkayEl Pesquator - Fish, okayLicey- Not a 5 star, okay, extra $ Service:You expect slow service but here the service is sometimes so bad that it really is insulting. Our comments are focused on restaurant service in the main and side restaurants. The management does not care if customers like the service or not. Their attitude is that you will be leaving in a week so who cares. This is really a terrible aspect of the hotel and many customers had problems. To be treated in this way is unacceptable at any hotel. Its a management problem ! They should make Miguel ( the manager at the Sakura Restaurant) the manager of the entire hotel !The Beach- Just absolutely fantastic !Bars- Good and many. Believe me with the lack of service you will be drinking a lot !Entertainment- Very average. Couple of shows very good, some depend on guests participation, a four star performance.Four Star VS Five StarService is what really defines a 5 star and Bavaro Princess does not come close. Sure it has 8 restaurants, 8 bars, good rooms, a nice beach, some enteratinment etc but aside from quantity the quality is geared for someone with very average expectations. This is a solid 4 Star.Better ChoicePay a bit more and get a lot more by going to Paradisus or another true 5 star. Alternatively, consider even paying less and getting the same at some of the advertised 4 Star or 4+ star hotels.
