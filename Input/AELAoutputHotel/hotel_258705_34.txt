{"text":"Quite Eloquent. My 2nd review of this hotel and for good reason. During my last checkout I requested a refreshment centre item that I had not taken be removed from the bill, and so the bill was amended, re-printed and placed in an envelope and I was on my way. Later when I looked at the bill instead of zero refreshment centre items there were now 2! which were cheekily added at check out knowing full well I would not re-open the envelope there and then. I still had the copy of my first bill. I rarely use hotel mini-bars so this hit a raw nerve. Hmmm. My previous stays have been more honest affairs and this hotel is very pleasant with friendly staff throughout. The rooms are very nicely furnished and the hotel being only 4 years old are still in fine decor. The windows are on the small size so the rooms are a little dark but this does a good job at keeping out the din of busy Kenmore Square at the front and the Highway at the rear. I once had a room above the bar that was not so quiet. Rooms have complementary wireless internet access and a DVD player with free DVD's from reception, but don't expect any blockbusters. The alarm clocks are quite useless and there is no coffee maker but there is free morning coffee in the lobby. The air conditioning has always been very effective and the bathrooms are quite spacious, nicely fitted out, include a bath and the soaps are top quality.The large Eastern Standard hotel bar with its high ceiling, long bar, open kitchen is to me one of the better bars in Boston but it can get very busy so finding a seat at the bar is not always possible, mind you the last 2 meals I had were served luke warm but this is not the norm. There is a further very smart separate restaurant which again serves excellent food and then there is The Foundation bar in the basement. Fenway Park which you can see from some of the rooms and the many night clubs are a 5 minute walk so the place really gets packed out on game days. There are several moderately priced good restaurants very nearby such as India Quality and Thai Dish with its tropical fish tanks that both serve excellent food. For wings and burgers there is The Beerworks brewpub and over the square there is a very popular home made burger joint. As an alterantive to the hustle and bustle of the city you can jump on the C subway line just 1 stop to St Marys or beyond and there are some real gems.The only nearby coffee shop is across the square in the book shop but this opens quite late so you may have to visit the Eastern Standard for that early morning Latte ($4.20 + tip so $5). Kenmore green line subway station is just 30 seconds away which you may choose to use to reach the finer parts of Boston such as Newbury Street, Copley Square and Downtown which are 10, 20, 35 minute walks respectively. A 7 day $15 subway pass is a snip for a ride on the oldest subway in the USA. Jump on at the head of the front carriage for a drivers eye view as the tram snakes along. Getting to the airport on the green and blue subways takes about 45 minutes. Taxi is typically 20 minutes and $35.
