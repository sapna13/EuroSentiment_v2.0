{"text":"Greatbreakfast. Quiet. Close to MRT Wow. I was traveling for work and the travel agent booked this. The hotel was clean, very close to Clarks Quay for food and 30 secs from an MRT station. Staff pleasant and courteous.My room was a good size and very clean. Lovely big bed. Plenty of towels and nice smelling stuff to wash the travel stains away. I was warned there might be construction noise when it was booked but there were no porblems and it was very peaceful.Breakfast was included and very good food. I ate a lot and went back for thirds. Lots of fresh fruit as well as all the usual.It irks me that internet is not free in places like this. Goodness it doesn't really cost anything to provide and it is nice to check email.One weird thing was that they tried to charge me for some pringles from the minibar only 3 mins aftre I had left the room. I didn't even open the minibar and I wondered how they could possibly know anyone had taken anything that quickly.If I was running a hotel like this in Singapore I reckon a useful add on would be access to showers for guests who have checked out but are not leaving till later in the day. I had a late afternoon flight and by the time I went back to get my bags I was dripping with sweat. A quick shower before jumping on the plane for 12 hours would have made me feel better.I don't think I could afford to stay if I was paying but it was nice to have some luxury.
