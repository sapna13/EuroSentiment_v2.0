{"text":"Close To To Perfection and Las Ramblas! Not majestic on the outside but stunning on the inside the Hotel Claris is in a prime Barcelona location. You're within easy walking distance of Las Rambles, and close to public transportation.We found the entire staff to be friendly and accommodating. The breakfast buffet is a veritable feast, and the helpful wait staff will prepare whatever else you might wish. Our room was spacious with enough hanging space and it was an interior one, thus we were not bothered by any street noises. We did find that the safe did not work properly and since it was a Friday, they said they couldn't have a repair man there until Monday so we simply moved our things to the hotel safe. It would have been nice to have had bottled water in the room, and a clock. We're assuming it was an oversight as there was only one bar of soap in the bath which my husband and I tossed back and forth between shower and sink. These are, of course, minor details but things one does expect to find in a five star hotel. I should add that there was a special bath amenity - a zippered tote holding six products - shampoo, conditioner, lotion, bath gel, mouthwash, cologne, and cotton balls. This tote was freshened every day. A nice touch! Plus, our room was cleaned thoroughly and made up promptly each day.A return trip to Barcelona will bring us back to the Claris. - Gail Cooke ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1246,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1242}]}
