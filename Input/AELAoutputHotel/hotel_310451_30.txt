{"text":"Great location with limitations We arrived midweek and had to wait at the desk since they had only one person working. We did get to check in early and they did have a room ready. We parked our car ourselves and lugged our luggage up one flight. First, they should take the carpeting out and put in tile. It is too humid and wet an area of the world to have carpet. It smelled. Second, they should put in a ceiling fan and rely less on ac that gets too cold and makes the room air stale.Room had no refrigerator and the safe had been removed.It was clean and the bath was well appointed.We were by the pool on the second floor and it was fine.The beach was a short distance but not well marked so it took us a while to find the right path. There was no attendant by the pool to get a towel and no one at the beach to get a chair. I had to search back and forth until I could finally settle on the beach.The beach is wonderful, can have a strong surf. Pool is nice.Restaurant choices are limited at this time of the year. Many were closed in the Palmas Del Mar complex. Sebastians was ok. Had a dirty tablecloth which I asked them to change. Nothing to do at night except casino which is not our thing. Sheraton needs to tweak this resort a little more and it will be a great destination.
