{"text":"Lovely Hotel! My Husband and I stayed at this hotel on the weekend for my Birthday. We stayed for 2 nights and booked the autumn special which included breakfast and champagne and canapes.We loved this hotel, the staff were excellent and very friendly. The hotel is very clean and modern. We were sent a complimentary bottle of wine to our room as it was my Birthday which we thought was a lovely touch. The room was lovely, very clean, neat and tidy. We didnt have a very nice view but that didnt matter really. I was dissapointed there wasnt a bath but the powershower was great. Each room has an Apple Imac which you can use for watching tv, dvds, listening to music and surfing the internet. There is a list of complimentary dvds and cds at reception which you can have whenever you want 24hrs! My husband loves films so this went down well - considering the price you have to pay for films in previous hotels we have stayed at!The breakfast was fantastic, cooked individually for you and you can choose exactly what you want. Also fab continental breakfast. The breakfast room was really nice and all the staff were very friendly, approachable and helpful. It did get very busy on the Saturday morning but this didnt affect us much, we had to wait a couple of mins for a free table which didnt bother us at all.The walk to the tube was about 10 mins but it was a nice walk past the houses of parliment.We would definetly stay in this hotel again and would highly recomend it.
