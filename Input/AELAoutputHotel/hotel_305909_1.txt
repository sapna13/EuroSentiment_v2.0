{"text":"super far, lousy staff  We stayed at the Royal Plaza Mongkok during Dec 24-28. The hotel made our trip a totally unpleasant HK trip I've ever had.We have to wait till 4 PM to have access to our room. At the day we checked in, there was x'mas eve gala dinner. For whatever reason it is, the dinner is arranged at the lobby of the hotel. As a result, they only allow one person of each group to go inside the counter area to check in while they're preparing tables. It was chaotic. The rest of us and other groups have to stand nearby the lift, waiting for our room for an hour!. staffs were so rude and do not manage the queue at all. they didn't care who came first .. it's a matter of who yelled louder. the room was smelly. i guess the hotel is quite old and the carpet didn't feel clean. Luggage delivery to the room very slow, it was 30 mins after we got our room. At the check out, there was no bell boy coming up to pick up our luggages either.the worst part about hotel is the location. they claimed the hotel is 2 mins from MTR. it's true, but that station is MONG KOK EAST, not MONG KOK. they're 2 different stations. Mong Kok east is a small station and it is very hard to go anywhere as u need to transfer and connect to other stations. at the end of the day, it's easier to walk to Mongkok ... and that makes u 15-20 mins from subway station. be careful when you're about to book this hotel.
