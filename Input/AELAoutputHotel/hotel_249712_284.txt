{"text":"Hit and Miss Let me start by saying that I stay at Westins often and am a starwood member. Having said that, this Westin was not up to par, especially at over $400.00 a night. First the good things:We had a great view, the a.c. kept up with the 95+ heat, the customer service manager was apologetic and helpful when we called with issues and the concierge and bell folks were very helpful. This is also a very central location and we had no trouble walking or subway-ing our way all over the city.Now the issues: We booked this hotel as part of a vacation package, so we knew we wouldn't be getting any starwood points for the price of the room. However, as I confirmed later with Starwood services, you are supposed to get points for things you purchase at the hotel - food, spa, etc. I have done this at other Westins. When we checked in I tried to give the check-in person my Starwood card so we could get points for these incidentals - she flatly refused. She said because we booked through a vacation package we got no points for anything. I tried to explain to her what I just explained here, but she would not listen and was very rude. Not the type of customer service I'm used to at Westin.Next - for some strange reason, every day we were given a new bottle of mouthwash, even though we never used it. In contrast, the shower gel, which we used up the first day, was never replaced - 4 bottles of mouthwash, no shower gel! When my husband called on the third day to ask for shower gel, they said it would be right there. 1.5 hours later I called the service manager and only then did we get shower gel (actually an entire bag of bathroom stuff we didn't ask for, including about 4 more mouthwashes - is some trying to tell me something?!?!?!)Housekeeping also left anything that wasn't put in the trash - the empty coffee supplies, the empty bottles in the shower, etc. I have never had that kind of stuff left in the room anywhere.Finally, and this is a general Westin complaint as it was also true in Boston. You can't just print the words heavenly bath on a bar of soap and think that makes it a heavenly bath. True Westins have a wonderful seperate shower and a deep soaking tub - THAT is heavenly. A regualr old shower\/shallow tub combo is not heavenly and rather dissapointing after a long day of walking and looking forward to a nice soak. There should be some standard for what is and is not labeled heavenly bath.So, all in all, if I had it to do over again, with as easy as the city is to navigate, I would have found a more reasonbly priced hotel out of time square and from now on will call all Westins and ask them just what is so heavenly about their bath before I book.
