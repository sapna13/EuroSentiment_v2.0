{"text":"Loved the Park Shore, Can't Wait To Go Back Next Year! After reading some of the reviews on here, my husband and I was a little nervous about booking the Park Shore only to find out that it was the best experience by far. The staff are so friendly there, sure the rooms are small but go down to the front desk like we did and see one of the clerks and ask about an upgrade. We booked through Orbitz and the only choice we had was a city view room because the hotel was full. Luckily one of the girls at the front offered an upgrade to a Ocean Front room in the corner end and for what we paid for it, it was well worth it. One thing Park Shore has to offer is the location, it was so convenient that after our second day there we decided to return our rental car. One thing that was a suprise to us was the $20 parking fee, that kind of blew our mind but if you dont need a car then most things are in walking distance of the hotel. Would we stay at Park Shore again? You can count on it! We have already booked for February and this time we're bringing the kids. From the time we arrived and throughout our stay we have felt welcome and thats really hard to find these days. For a little hotel in the corner from our experience and what we saw, they seemed pretty busy while we were there. But what I loved the most was they always took the time to what the natives there call talk story even the housekeeping was friendly and replenished our towels daily. Park Shore not the biggest hotel in Waikiki but good enough for my family and I. ","annotations":[]}
