{"text":"comfortable and quiet This was a last minute trip, so I had no time to delve into Amsterdam√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ boutique hotels and decided to go with an American style chain. We were not disappointed. The Radisson is a nice hotel with a courteous staff. They made arrangements for cabs, placed reservations, and handed out maps with a smile. Even though the service was impersonal, it was excellent. The room was large, clean, comfortable and in good repair. The closet was larger than most with adequate space. The bathroom was marble and the gently heated floor was great. The shower was a wall mounted American style. A hand held is also available. The bed was a true king and very comfortable with a down comforter. The only gripe I had was the lack of a top sheet. At first we thought it was an oversight by housekeeping. By night three there still was no top sheet. You may have to ask for one. The in-room coffee is no charge although it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ instant. The mini-bar is pressure sensitive meaning if an item is picked up, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ automatically charged to the room. Wifi unlimited internet access is included with the room rate and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ easy to sign on.The location of the hotel is walking distance to most sites in Amsterdam. Numerous restaurants and shops are close by and there is one coffee shop right across the street.I recommend this hotel.Tips: Taxi cabs are reasonably priced (for a major city)The bicycles are everywhere, kind of like China. They don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like to slow down for pedestrians. Watch for bikes first, then cars and busses, then the tram.Money changing at the train station offers reasonable rates without excessive commissions and fees.Some shops and restaurants require customers to ring the bell for entry. If the door is locked, check for a doorbell.The people are friendly and for the most part speak excellent English.Holland is a permissive society. If you have problems with cigarette smoke, prostitution, or marijuana, go elsewhere. Smoking is allowed in most restaurants and public places. There are no designated sections.
