{"text":"Outstanding My wife and I stayed at the Grand Hyatt on August 7-9, and enjoyed our time immensely. We stayed in room 2722, an Emerald Suite, and were given complimentary access to the Regency Club on the same floor. Here's the good: - Very peaceful and quiet - not the place to go for a party. - Excellent location - just at the E. edge of the central shopping district, probably six blocks (a nice walk) from the Public Market. Plenty of great restaurants (try ICONS - outstanding comfort food). - Excellent view (NW corner of the hotel) - directly down Pike Street past the shopping district to the Public Market, and Elliot Bay beyond. Also great view to the N. of the Space Needle. - Large room - size was perfect and comfortable. - Blackout shades - if you want to sleep in and not be awakened by the light, you'll have no problem here. - Helpful, courteous staff - we found everyone to be helpful and attentive, especially in the Regency Club. - Tastefully decorated - very warm, sumptuous appointments throughout. Great sheets and pillows. Great lighting. Great bathtub and shower. NW theme with understated asian influence. - Regency Club - tasty breakfast (if you enjoy granola and fresh fruit, and pastries), yummy snacks, plenty of papers and interesting books, great place to relax. There's complimentary internet access here also.Here's the could have been better (I'm reaching here, as we loved it and will definitely come back again!): - Hot water was lukewarm the first evening - no problem throughout the rest of our stay. - Drop off area is tight. Had to wait probably 10 minutes for a cab when we departed. If looking for a quiet, centrally located hotel for a getaway with your spouse, this is a great choice!
