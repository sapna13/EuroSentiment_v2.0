{"text":"Perfect for our family We have just returned from a week at the Argonaut Hotel in San Francisco. We booked a special advanced rate on an enormous corner suite for our family of five. The suite, which included a king room with bath, twin double bedroom with bath, and enormous living room with double pull out couch and dining table, is probably the most comfortable accomodations we have ever had with the children. The location, at the calmer end of Fisherman's Wharf , is absolutely perfect for a family vacation -- we were within very easy walking distance of the cable car, duck tour, fire engine tour, biking over the golden gate bridge (not to be missed!), Alcatraz ferry, and historic boats (the submarine audio tour was excellent). Numerous restaurants in the area appeal to famlies and the views over the bay are spectacular. The hotel rooms are stylish and fun; the only drawback was the noise -- we had a third floor suite facing away from the water, which I hoped would be quiet, but was in fact rather noisy in the early mornings. The water facing third and fourth floor rooms and suites must have great views but might also be noisy, since they overlook the wharf area. Beware that the interior rooms in the hotel (which i don't believe are suites) face a very bland concrete courtyard -- they must be quiet but not exciting. Finally, there is no pool (which would have been nice, but wasn't essential to us) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":712,"mention":"submarine","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Submarine_sandwich"],"startOffset":703}]}
