{"text":"Fantastic staff, very freindly We have just returned from a very quick 2 day 1st Anniversary break at the Grand Marina, and both have very mixed feelings about this hotel, the staff are exceptionally freindly and helpfull, having arrived at Barcelona airport to find one piece of our luggage had not come with us was quite upsetting, and spending an extra 2 hours at the airport trying to track it down was really annoying but it seems to happen all the time, after receiving a reference number for the missing luggage off to the hotel, We had booked a romantic double room which lived up to expectations with Cava and chocolate covered strawberries waiting for us. The views from the room were amazing across the port,and we felt very happy to have found such a wonderful hotel, however not so amazing at 5.30am when the biggest passenger liner docks by the side of the hotel, with engines running, the noise was 2 say the least unbearable, and i'm a heavy sleeper!!! asked to move rooms for the next night as felt could not go through that again, staff very helpfull and seemed use to this complaint. We were moved to a room on the Trade Center side of the hotel, overlooking a concrete jungle but at least, had a good nights sleep. Breakfast amazing, drinks very pricey, the hotel is very central for walking to all that the city has to offer, tourist bus very handy to get on just outside hotel and a great way to see the city, and find your bearings. Nice roof- top sun-bathing area, pool very small but ok for a dip, the hotel was very quiet when we visited, not sure how relaxing it would be if busy. We had to be out of room at 12.00pm, but were still able to use pool facilities, showers etc to freshen up befor evening flight, which was a nice touch. Baggage arrived back in UK a day after we did, so must add that the shoping in Barcelona is quite good if you need to get essentials and something to wear if your unlucky like us for the airlines to loose your luggage.
