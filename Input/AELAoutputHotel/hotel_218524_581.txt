{"text":"The rating is spot on It is rated 4 1\/2 stars and it is about right. We stayed one week end of February. The weather was unsettled, but when the sun was shinning the breeze made the heat very comfortable.The hotel is BIG and at first glance we thought TOO BIG but you do get use to the layout and in fact people scatter all around the place and it is not crowded - except in the evening when the show is on. The choice of 7 restaurants is great ; being French I like my food and must say that in all the restaurants the quality was good. Even the wine, which can be a bit mediocre when it is all in, was very pleasant.I was disappointed with the cocktails ; they are all prepared with commercial juices rather than using fresh fruit - obviously a cost thing, but they do not taste anyting like the cocktails you get in 5 stars hotels.The sea is quiet rough, so not a paradise for keen swimmers.The beach is nice and long and you can go for over an hour walk each way.The pool is very adequate.The beds on the beach are very good and comfortable, but it is a challange to get one as everybody seem to be up at 7 in the morning to reserve their(s). I put an S because some reserve beds around the pool as well as on the beach, even that they cant lay on both at the same time!We had a room with a double balcony and it was nice and roomy. It did smell a bit damp, perhaps because the jaccuzi is in the middle of the room. I dont know what they thought we might drink, but the 5 bottles of Gin, Whiskey, vodka etc in our bedroom did not get touch. There was plenty to be had at the 11 bars of the hotel!The spa was very nice.Overall, a good holiday and I do recomment booking the Excellence Club, it really adds a touch of luxury to the holiday. The food in the Excellence Club Lounge was very good with breakfast, lunch and dinner served there and snacks thourought the day.
