{"text":"A Luxurious Experience My wife and I went there for a weekend getaway and anniversary celebration, and we had a wonderful time together.We had a deluxe room on 2nd floor. The room had a separate small foyer area housing furniture for putting luggages and large bulit-in wardrobe. A thoughtful design we found was that a little box inside the wardrobe on the wall - if you put your shoes inside and press a button, they will be taken away without you noticing, and be returnded to you cleansed and polished in a resonably short period of time. Newspapers were also delivered to this little box daily.A door opened to a comfortably large room with high ceiling (quite unique experience for HK hotels) and classical feel and beautifully decorated with Chinese favoured pictures. The room was fully equipped with all facilities most would want, e.g. flat TV, CD\/DVD player, mini- bar, internet access, fax machine, telephones (4!), all-in-one control panels, automatic curtains, sofa and armchairs (4!).Bathroom was light-coloured and modern-styled with Mood lighting option. A number of sweet designs, such as a small TV at the bath-tub, separate shower box and toilet, twin wash-basins for male  female, 2 sets of bathrobes (different materials and thickness) for each occupant to name a few.We were celebrating our anniversary so the hotel gave us a half-bottle champaign, a chocolate moose cake on top of the regular welcome tea and fruits. The house-keeping service was good and efficient (we didn't ask for help much though, because everything inside the room were in perfect conditions. We only borrowed 3 DVDs and they were delivered to us quite soon).The hotel has 80 years of history and I was a bit worried if the property or the furnitures would be tired. It's certainly not the case, they look well-mentained and were obviously being upgraded from time to time. History has taught her good lessons in hospitality I suppose. The room even has emergency call buttons in both the room and the toilet - a sign of wisdom and thoughtfulness.We went to the Verandah for buffet dinner. The environment's cosy. Excellent choices of main course on menu, well set buffet bar with enough variety of appetizers and deserts. We were informed (a call to our room in the afternoon!) that the oysters were out that night but were replaced by large-crab legs to our little disappointment.A la carte breakfast was served at The Lobby. It's very elegant. All utensils were made of silver if not china. (Maybe because the hotel is right in the middle of the town or the food at The Lobby is so good, it attracts quite a number of patrons for tea there. Once we saw a line of about 40 to 50 people waiting for table in an afternoon!) The food was up to standard with right quantity. The waitors were very polite but some looked a bit inexperienced, they often came between us while we're talking to take the dishes, fill the water etc. For a busy restuarant like this one, I think that is quite unavoidable.There were other restuarants, such as a Japanese resturant where we had lunch on the first day, and a French restuarant which was 55 years old. Many expensive world famous shops were found in their shopping arcade which was very convenient, not to mention the hotel itself was in the middle of the largest shopping area in Hong Kong.Overall, the experience was flawless. I have to say the room rate is very pricey but that's expected for a 5-star (I'll give it 6) hotel in down town.
