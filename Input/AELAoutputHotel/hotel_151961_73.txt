{"text":"Great stay We had a great stay at the Hotel Milano. For the price and location, I think it was definitely worth it and would recommend it to friends. It's not fancy, but we thought the decorations and cleanliness and general comfort were just fine. The rooms are simple but we were happy with ours. We took the advice of one of the reviews here and stayed in a rear-facing room, so we had no problems with noise. The windows are incredibly tiny but at least gave a little light, and the room size was fine. The staff were very nice, always happy to hold our key when we'd go for a run (and then laugh with us when we came back very humid) or greet us at breakfast. Breakfast was simple but there was plenty of food and the restaurant atmosphere is nice. The best part of the hotel, in my opinion, is its location. Where you'd be paying a Lot more for a different hotel in old San Juan, here you saved the money and were still in the thick of it. There is lots of shopping on or just off Forteleza street, and lots of bars and restaurants and the casino are about a 10 minute walk. The bar where pina coladas were invented is a 10 minute walk up Forteleza. You can walk easily to El Morro or San Cristobal or explore the north shore. It's a little under a 2 mile walk to the nearest beach. The cruise port and lots of little shopping stands along the south shore are really close, too. Get a good map and enjoy wandering through the city!
