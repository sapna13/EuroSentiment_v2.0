{"text":"What a Blast! - Loved It! I would highly suggest visiting the Globalia Grand on your visit to Punta Cana. The people were friendly, resort clean, entertainment awesome and food excellent!The people are extremely helpful and friendly. I didn't pass one employee that did not greet me or smile to acknowledge me. Mnay of the employees know a good deal of English and some also know French and German. Communicating was not a problem.The resort was very clean and well mainained. Our room had clean towels left each day and the cleaning ladies put new soda, beer and bottled water in our room each day. We left a $2.00 tip for the ladies each day. Each day you can turn in your towel to recieve a new towel. Make sure to not leave your towel lying around or forget to pick it up at the end of the day. Thsi did not happen to us, but another couple forgot their towels and then had to pay $20.00 for new towels. I would suggest getting up early (7 am) to put your towels over chairs so you can eat breakfast and then go back to your chair. Also, if you are not traveling with children under the age of 17, make sure you frequent the adult only pool. It is off in its own little area and there is no noise. This pool has beach chairs, palm trees and a bar. Very relaxing! The entertainment offered was fabulous. This resort truly caters to the adults as well as children. Each day, there is a shedule of events the visitors can participate in. Some events include dancing lessons, water aerobics, bingo, beach volleyball and the lisst goes on. Each night, there is a movie shown in a big theater. This theater also houses events such as magic shows and other kid events.The food at this resort was great. When I was reading some of the reviews before my husband and I went to this hotel, I noticed some people were saying that they became very sick from the food and told people to avoid the resort. Then I looked at their pictures they attached to their review and realized why they got sick! Just keep this in mind, be aware of what you are eating and don't drink the water. The fruits and vegetables are washed with filtered water. I don't eat much meat so I was a complete vegetarian on this trip. My husband did eat soem of the meat but was careful with what he chose. He avoided the seafood and hamburgers. The three restaurants to choose from are good but we highly recommend the italian restaurant (de Mario's). If you want a superb meal, here's what to order. For the appetizer get the sliced tomato with cheese. For the soup choose the minestrone. Get the pasta trio for your main course. Finally order the chocolate lasagna for dessert. It's like the dessert they used to have at the Olive Garden only much better! Order this and you will not be disappointed!So I think I managed to inform you as best I can about the Globalia Grand. Make sure you check this hotel out. It was fabulous. We will be back with the whole family next time!
