{"text":"Charming hotel, good location My husband and I stayed at the Jardin de Cluny for 3 nights in late May. I chose this hotel after reading the reviews on tripadvisor and got a good rate on the hotel's website. We had a double room at the front of the hotel which, although small, was charming and equipped with plenty of creature comforts - comfy bed, flat screen TV, nice modern decor, mini bar (not overly expensive), powerful hot shower (no bath) and nice toiletries. In addition to the nice rooms, lovely atmosphere, decent value for money and helpful staff, another good thing about the hotel (as mentioned in previous reviews) is its location. It is situated on a quiet street just off the Blvd St Michel and is close to good cafes, restaurants, shops and sights. It is also just 5 mins from the metro, 10 mins from Notre Dame etc and you can walk to other central locations, including the Louvre and the d'Orsay within half an hour. It is also easily accessible from CDG airport on the RER.The only negative points would be that our large window wouldn't quite shut properly which meant we could hear some street noise at night. Additionally, we didn't have breakfast at the hotel, instead choosing local cafes, however we found that the choice tended to be limited and expensive compared to other meals. We would recommend Brasserie Balzar just round the corner on Rue des Ecoles for its food and wine, atmopshere and charismatic staff. Overall a great hotel for a short break in Paris.
