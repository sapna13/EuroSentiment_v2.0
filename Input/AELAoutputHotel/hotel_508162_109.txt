{"text":"great service but scooter needed to get around when we arrived we were really impressed with the grounds, they were beautiful. we have stayed at 2 other resorts in Punta Cana and Dreams was definitely very impressive.one problem we encountered on arrival was the location of our room. I have a problem with walking any long distance and we were put into a room all the way at the end of resort. this made it difficult to go to Lobby or central hub and with one phone call we were moved to another room that was middle of resort of rooms. Also we were told we could call and an employee would drive us to restaurant or anywhere else that we wanted. We used this service and it was great, the response time was excellent.The food at the buffet was good but, some improvement was needed. The restaurants were great and wait time was minimal .The bar service was EXCELLENT, best we haveexperienced in all our travels, someone was there at all times to get drinks. The best part were the employees, hey were always in good spirits and would do anything we asked of them. To us that was VERY important.The nightly entertainment was good but, it could have been longer usually1 hour and it was around 10;30pm and if you didnt go to disco there was not much to do except drink.The casino was small, the machines were paying off fairly well and I can say I came home with money won.
