{"text":"Im not suprised they lost franchise rights As I said in my title I wasn't suprised to find that this hotel can no longer be considered a Clarion. I actually stayed at this hotel on my honeymoon, but reviews of recent renovations urged me to TRY it out again. The low rates also hooked me. But there is one thing I have learned about vacations in Miami. Cheap never equals good deal it equals CRAP and that is exactly what I got the second time we stayed.My husband and myself had brought along my best girlfriend for Ultra Music Festival at Bayfront park. We resereved a room with TWO beds because obviously we weren't all gonna share a bed! When my husband told me we were on the 4th floor and the room number I was praying that we were on the river side because I knew that 4th floor would probably have a view of the roof of the lobby. I was sad to find out that not only did we have a roof view room but that they actually had us in a room with ONE DOUBLE BED. Im suprised they could even call that a room! It was a closet with a bathroom. The Double Bed hardly fit in there!My husband got orbitz on the phone immediately and whatever orbitz told them made them change our room.The next room we were given had a river view and two double beds....but it smelled like a gerbil cage! We discovered the problem upon leaving. I checked under the bed for stray socks and discovered several stains that looked like someone had a puppy in there....that explained why there had been a large phone book proping open the room's window. Im almost positive that they gave us an off market room. How nice huh?I took one chance with the pool, my friend and I ran screaming out of the pool when we found a chicken wing bone and other random trash. Sick!There was also some kind of India convention there, and the room next door to us was banging on drums well after midnight. I broke up that party as the hotel staff couldn't be bothered to.The only thing that saves the place from a terrible rating is the resturant, the location, and the apperance of the lobby and besides the smell the apperance of the room. It wasn't that bad. The Gnocci at the resturant was great and the drinks at the bar were reasonable.I'll never stay here again. The staff doesn't care about it's guests, and it seems like they aren't committed to fixing problems. I find it saddening to find that people are still complaining about the same things over a year later!
