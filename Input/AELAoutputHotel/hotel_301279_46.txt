{"text":"Excellent Location, Exceptional Service!!! It's true that this hotel is under renovation. And will be so through October 2007. The part being renovated now is the main building so I would opt for a room in the 'tower' if possible. The rooms (at least in the main building) are right out of the 60's so expect that.The staff service was exceptional, as you would expect at a Japanese hotel of this caliber. They were more than helpful to us. This was demonstrated when we lost an umbrella and the bellhop lady came running through the hotel after us to bring it to us. She was out of breath when she got to us! Also, when we thought that I had lost our passports the staff turned the hotel upside down and even the Housekeeping Manager got directly involved! What more could you ask for?What a location! If you walk through the building through the tower, the hotel complex is a short walk away down a hill to the Akasaka-Mitsuke subway station. Here you will have a direct-line connection to Tokyo Station, Ginza, and Shinjuku via the Marunouchi or Ginza subway lines. There is a pleasant park and little lake close by where people fish. Akasaka has many great restaurants in itself.The complex property is enormous. There is a beautiful Japanese garden on site and several very nice Japanese restaurants in the middle of the garden that will make you feel like you are walking back into the Edo period.We'll be back!
