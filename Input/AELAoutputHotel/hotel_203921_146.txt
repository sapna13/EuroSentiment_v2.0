{"text":"Absolutely loved the Hotel David My husband and I stayed at the Hotel David in Florence (13 August to 16 August) during our 18 day trip to Italy. The Hotel David lived up to all of the accolades I had read on TripAdvisor. The hotel is located on the far side of the River Arno, a quick ten minute bus ride to downtown Florence. Bus stops are conveniently located just outside the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ door and stop there every ten to 15 minutes. (The hotel even sells bus passes√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√Øo convenient). We stayed in a large room with comfortable bathroom, where we enjoyed peace and quiet each evening. (No trouble getting to sleep there!). I should point out that a remote control allows you to regulate the air conditioning, so do be on the look-out for that item. It certainly comes in handy in August! We enjoyed our breakfast there √à√\u2020\u2022?a traditional fare of breads, coffee, fruit, and cold cuts. And, their afternoon happy hour (5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.) was delightful. We enjoyed relaxing with a glass of wine on their outdoor patio with other guests. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss a late afternoon stroll from the hotel to the top of Piazza Michelangelo to watch the sunset over Florence. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in for a real treat if you stay to see the sunset √à√\u2020\u2022?something not to be missed. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only a ten minute walk (uphill) from the Hotel David. I would be remiss if I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mention how helpful the staff at Hotel David was. Via email, they set up our reservations for us to see The David and go to the Uffize. (Be sure to make reservations √à√\u2020\u2022?the lines are very long without them). The staff always asked where we were going each morning and provided us maps to guide us. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hard to describe how helpful they were in guiding us around their lovely city. Frankly, they really made you feel at home√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√∂hich was a most welcome feeling. Hotel David provides its guests free Internet access on a lobby computer. If you have a laptop with you, you can also access their wireless Internet network, using a password that the staff will provide you. By using our Touring Club Italiano Card [--], we received a 15% discount on our standard room rate (E99, bringing it to about E85 a night). If our travels take us back to Florence, we will happily stay at Hotel David.
