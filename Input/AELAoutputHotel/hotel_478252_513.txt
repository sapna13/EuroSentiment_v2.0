{"text":"Great honeymoon destination!!! We spent two weeks at the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana for our honeymoon starting August 26. We travel a lot and loved this resort. We had been to Punta Cana before but this resort was the best yet! We were treated like royalty. We were on our honeymoon so they put us in Building 7 which is close to the beach but really quiet because it is not on the tram route. Food was incredible which is saying a lot for a Caribbean resort. Lobster and prawns-just at the buffet.They have 8 a la carte restaurants and we ate at 6 since we were there for 2 weeks. My husband said that when we ate at them he forgot that we were at a resort. We recommend the Italian, French and Japanese as our top 3 favourites.This is the first resort we have ever been at that we had to ask for the drinks to be watered down. Lots of variety and the bartenders remembered our names after just the first night.Shows were good. They do repeat them each week. There is an ealry show at 9 and then a later show at 11 which is more adult oriented. Rooms were incredible. Every room is a large jacuzzi suite with a roomy balcony and separate seating area.We were lucky with the weather-two solid weeks of sun and over 100 degrees each day with the humidity. It was only one week after Hurricane Dean hit but no damage to the resort. Beach is fabulous as well. There is a sunken ship off the shore that is nice to look at. Beach is large with white sand and very clean. Hundreds of thatched huts that provide lots of shade and a bar and snack area. Very few vendors bugging you which is nice.There is a lobby bar that is really nice to veg at after the show. The nightclub Congas was great-more than you would expect from a resort.So many good things to say but the following should give you an idea of how good the resort was. My husband (one one month!!) does not really like to stray far from home and near the end of our second week he asked if we could stay longer so we called our travel agent!!!Do not drink the tap water or even use it to brush your teeth but it is not a problem as they provide bottled water, beer and pop every day in your in room fridge to use. Tips go a long way down here - even small ones - as most of the staff only make $60 US per week. We didn't even leave the resort for the entire two weeks because we had such a great time. Great gym too and mini golf. Very few kids - most of the people were couples or couples with kids that were under age 2.
