{"text":"Paradisus is Not Paradise Our party of 4 spent 5 nights at Paradisus in March 2007. One of our travelers walks with a cane and has difficulty standing alone. Our sad experiences began with the doorman. We arrived in the afternoon and after standing for considerable time with our bags at the entrance, we asked if we could not proceed to our rooms. The doorman responded that he was busy and for us to sit down and be patient. We considered this an insensitive comment directed to a handicapped person. We proceeded to the registration desk. The receptionist was disorganized and not understanding the reservations. We finally reached our rooms only to find that our reservations had been switched. The handicapped person did not receive the requested handicapped room. The second couple did not receive the requested king bed. We returned to the registration desk to seek correction. Believe it or not it took almost one hour of confusion to check in.We were informed that dinner reservations had closed at 4:30 and we could present ourselves to any of the several restaurants for seating without a reservation. Nothing could be farther from the truth as we arrived at first restaurant and we were informed that we could not be seated until 9:00, a little late after a long day of travel from the states. I sought the help of the night manager who obtained us a table at the Bamboo Restaurant. For a 5-star resort we were shocked by the brusque service. It was as if we were intruding on the staff's routine. The food was expensive and unsavory. Duck in wrap was cooked so hard that we could not eat it. We were much relieved to finally get to bed. The next morning the breakfast buffet was fabulous as it was each morning. Breakfast was the best meal of the day. Trying to get food at the pool was another matter. There is none. You must go into the restaurant for lunch. I asked the receptionist if I could take some food to the pool. She explained that it was not allowed but that I could wrap up some food in a napkin and take it out. That I did each day. We had two excellent meals at Avocado and Romantique. The resort is in the process of renaming the restaurants. Avocado food was superb but the service was about 2 star if that. The waitress insisted upon delivering our check before our dinner was complete. Since we had the same annoying experience the evening before I pointed the oversight out to her , and she insisted that was what management required. I explained to her that the check should not be presented until the guest asks for it particularly so if dessert or coffee is likely to be requested. My comments did not make any impression, instead she argued with me. Apparently there must be guest walk-outs without signing or paying the restaurant bills. On several occasions we were asked when leaving the restaurant if we had signed. Rude? Yes?The best meal was at Romantique and the worst at the the Bamboo and the Mexican restaurant whose name I cannot recall. The service at Romantique was impeccable. I asked the waiter why so much difference between the service at the various restaurants. Training and experience was the answer. And, of course management.Our handicapped friend and his wife were locked out of their bungalow after dinner one evening during a heavy rain. The electronic keys had failed. Repeated calls to the front desk did not bring help. Luckily a staff person happened by and opened the door after 30 minutes. I complained to the night manager and was informed that mobile phones will deactivate the door keys. The inconvenience of being locked out was compounded by the long distance to the bungalow. It is not merely an elevator ride to the lobby to reactivate the key. I suggested that the locked out guests should be compensated. I thought it unusual when the night manger asked how. I said at the least a bottle of wine to the unconvinced guests. The next evening a nice bottle of wine and cheese was provided to our friends. Paradisus is beautiful. A swimming beach is non-existent. However the pool is beautiful with a swim-up bar with pleasant bartenders. To obtain a cabana you must get up early and occupy your site. No towels are laid out for you. My impression of the hotel is that it lacks knowledgeable management. Maybe it is the Caribbean attitude. It is certainly not the attitude and service we have experienced at other Spanish owned hotels. At a so-called 5-star resort I would expect more concern for guests.
