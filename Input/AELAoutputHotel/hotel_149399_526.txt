{"text":"believe the bad reviews We flew AirTransat out of Toronto. Actually over 60 of us travelled from across Canada for our Mid Winter Meeting. All the bad reviews are true. I did not choose this hotel or destination. We were off for a 1 week business meeting and another week of vacation. By day 4 the National Association decided we would never return. Good thing. If I had to personally pay for this I would just be sick. I think I figured out the problem of this hotel. It has grown quickly too fast. I understand last year they had 2 million guests, this year 3 million. They do not have staff. They do not have front desk people who know what they are doing. They cannot make a decision, they get another person with a different decision, they get someone else until the manager comes out. A manager one night will tell you something and a manager the next, a different story. Yes, I had fun. Yes it is the most beautiful property I have ever stayed on. Yes the staff you ran into on the grounds are lovely people. However, I need a vacation from this vacation. It was work to get a reservation for dinner for example. Three of us would call every morning approx. 7 30am with a different room number to get a seat for dinner. Nine times out of ten we got the 9 45pm time slot. This became hilarious and a daily joke. I cannot imagine bringing children there. In conclusion, I am still waiting for my washcloth. ","annotations":[]}
