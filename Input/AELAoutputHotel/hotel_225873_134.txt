{"text":"Perfect hotel, too bad about the staff... After taking a tour of the Charlesmark last June, we decided to have the members of our wedding party stay there. We couldn't reserve a block of rooms because of the hotel size, so, we just had everyone call. Last June we had a great guy who offered to walk us around, show us rooms, etc. He sold us. Then came October...A few nights before checking in we swung by to check on our reservation. The kid behind the desk was initially less then helpful. When I asked if it was possible for all of the girls to be on one floor and the guys to be on another, he exhaled and said that it would be a real problem and we should have notified him earlier. When we noticed that some of our wedding party members hadn't made reservations, I said that we would call them and have them confirm. The kid behind the desk mis-heard us to say that we wanted him to call and confirm our reservations and responded with, That would be an absolute hassle for me to call everyone... which I immediately had to correct him to say that _we_ were going to call our friends. He seemed relieved. After asking for something else and getting denied, I left wondering if it was too late to go somewhere else. (By the time we checked in, the girls all did end up on the same floor with the guys on the two floors above) We checked in on the Wed before our Sat wedding. That's when we met Ingrid. She was the absolute shining star. She came to the rescue when our inquiries of can we have a late checkout on the day of the wedding were answered with (by someone else) I don't know that that's possible with a plethora of reasons why not. Ingrid said not to worry, she'll make it happen. Anytime anyone in our wedding party needed anything at all, she was there to help. Every one in the wedding party (even those who weren't able to get in because they were full) loved her. Unfortunately so did the Head of Human Resources at Tiffany's who's hired her for bigger and better things. Anyway, aside from the remaining staff, the hotel itself is quite nice. The bar area and lounge behind the bar are great. There's also free internet which is wonderful. The regular sized room is a bit small with only a half size closet. The refrigerator is only large enough for 2 bottles of water. We had to plug ours in only to find it unplugged by house keeping later. Normally we don't need a lot of space, so, a room that size is fine. We didn't find the drawers in the room until we left (they're under the bed). The double room is a better bet if you're rooming up with friends. There is a breakfast put out - donuts, bagels, water, and coffee. Although we didn't have time to hang out at the bar, all of our friends did and really loved it. It was definitely hopping at night. Overall I would recommend staying here if you don't normally talk to the front desk anyway. That is, if you're low maintenance. We usually are, but, due to the wedding we had a few more needs then the average customer. I know without a doubt if it wasn't for Ingrid, we would have been a lot worse off. All of that being said, we probably would stay here again at the location was fantastic and the price is definitely right.
