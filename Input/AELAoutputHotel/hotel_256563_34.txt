{"text":"Budget hotel in a good location My husband and I spent six nights at the Ibis for a conference. We selected it based on price and proximity to the conference center. This is definitely a budget hotel!The rooms are tiny; the bed fills the room and you must squeeze around it. The bathroom is even smaller with a shower designed for a very small person and a shower door that won't stay shut. Only one person can go into the bathroom at a time. Amenities were two packets of shampoo, two shards of soap, a shower cap and sanitary bag per day. The room could have been cleaner and the staff would not change your sheets unless you left them a note. On the first three days, each time we returned to the room in the afternoon, the key would not work. The desk staff would apologize but offer no compensation. One staff member promised that the key would work the next day. When we asked what he'd offer if it did not work, he said, An apology which was a poor response. We eventually had the key re-keyed each time we left.On the good side, the harbor view was beautiful. The room had a refrigerator and coffee\/tea-making facilities. The location is excellent, smack in the middle of Darling Harbour with access to Harbourside (a shopping mall), the visitor center, the Chinese garden, the IMAX theater, Wildlife World, the conference center, and tons of shops and restaurants. Most are high-end and it was difficult to find a meal for under $15.Breakfast at the Ibis was $15\/per person for a good buffet. Typical fare was scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon, roast tomatoes, baked beans, do-it-yourself waffles, cereal, pastries, yogurt, fruit, and an espresso machine. Judy at the cashier station always had a smile.The Ibis is fine if you know what you're getting into. Don't expect luxury and enjoy Sydney!
