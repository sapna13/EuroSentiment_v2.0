{"text":"Superb stay at the Westin We stayed at the Westin for 10 nights in mid November 2006From the moment we arrived at the airport and met our private limo to transfer us to the Hotel we knew that we had made the right choice. We had upgraded our package to the Royal beach Club hence the private transfer! This was followed by a personal check in and intro to the hotel and facilities. The Westin is wonderfull, clean smart, rooms are a good size typical American proportions , we had two king size beds which are Westin Heavenly beds, and wow are they heavenly, you just do not want to get out of them on a morning they are so comfortable. The Royal package is great value for money, you have a private dining lounge with sofa and huge plasma tv, free internet access, full breakfast daily, excellent lunch , free evening cocktails and soft drinks, wine and beer, all day ,if you felt like it!. We even had the luxury of two items of laundry per person per day done for you at no extra charge which is ideal in the tropical climate of Bali. The staff are superb very attentive and happy to help you at any time. The pool was excellent as it was around 35 degrees every day and clear blue sky, no sign of rain for 10 days so we where lucky with the weather, it is very humid and you can not just lie down in the sun or you would boil.Bali itself is a large island with a population of 3 million so it is not a desert island but to combine the atmosphere and sites of the island, temples, volcanoes, wonderful beaches and great food it is fantastic. Go to Bali dont miss it! ","annotations":[]}
