{"text":"Great Location and amazing black out curtains The hotel is in a good location for La Ramblas (the main thoroughfare- 200yards) and all other amenities. Opposite is a nice shop selling gorgeous brioche which tasted gorgeous at 5.00am.We stayed in a triple room, and it was spacious so we didn't trip over eachother. The bathroom was clean and had plenty of towels. Also the room was away from traffic and general noise.The most amazing part of the hotel was the curtains. When you were coming back from nightlcubs in the early hours of the morning the blackout curtains made you think it was late at night.The downside of the hotel was the fact that the staff did not know the meaning of do not disturb. Despite leaving the do not disturb sign on - the maids would knock on your door and if you were not up by 12.00 the phone would ring and ask if you wanted your room cleaned. V annoying.The only other downside is there are no tea making facilities - we were often gasping for a hot drink - but there is a star bucks 50m down the road.Also - learn the name of the road the hotel is in as taxi drivers in the city have never heard of the hotel!!But overall we were really pleased with the hotel and on the whole the hotel staff were friendly - especially the night shift.We loved the location of this hotel as taxi's were right outside - ready to take you to the marina and the proper bars and clubs....
