{"text":"Cheap(ish), clean and acceptable for a city centre hotel A convention at Berlin Messe saw me needing hotel accomodation for 2 nights in Berlin. As a couple of colleagues had chosen this hotel, I booked myself using a special rate on Expedia.The hotel was a little challenging to locate. I had never been to Berlin before and after getting off the S-Bahn at Zoologisher Garten I managed to spend about 20 minutes wandering around some back streets. Eventually I located the hotel, and thereafter it was only a 5 minute walk from the hotel to the station.Check in was quick and easy, and reception noted that one of my colleagues had already been asking for me. The room was clean and functional - a slightly strange shape but all that was really needed was a bed and a desk.Wireless internet is available but strangely only allowed access to Google and nothing else. The 10 euro access fee was refunded without question.The hotel's bathroom was the smallest I have ever come across. Without conjouring up too many horrific images, it was physically impossible to sit on the toilet - there was literelly no space at all. Breakfast was buffet style and a good choice of cold meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal etc was all availble, plus a couple of hot dishes.If I had paid rack rate I would probably have been disappointed but as I had paid a discounted Expedia rate, I was happy enough with the standard of the hotel. I would recommend providing a discounted rate can be secured. ","annotations":[]}
