{"text":"The Best of Berlin I selfishly hesitated to write this review as I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ afraid the next time I go to Berlin, Goethe 87 will be sold out! My husband, my mother, her friend and I all stayed for a week at Goethe 87. It stands tall as the best deal we encountered in Europe, we all loved it. These hotel rooms are like small apartments and include their own doorbell, kitchenettes, and balconies. They are tasteful, sleek and appointed with the best features, such as Gaggenau stoves and refrigerators, gorgeous French doors that swing open or hinge at the bottom for a breeze, push-button shade closures and high-end fixtures throughout. Our room had a lovely view and was very quiet. The bathroom shower is a dream, equipped with a Grohe wellness apparatus that shoots water at you from various heights, culminating in a large rainshower head and a hand-held sprayer. The entire impression is Euro-style and upscale.There is daily cleaning service, despite the apartment schematic. There is free onsite laundry service and wireless internet, unheard of at their rate. The reception and Bistro staff were utterly professional and always helpful. They lent us an English book on what to do in Berlin, and when we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ figure out the shower workings, someone came right to our room and demonstrated for us. They lent us an umbrella when it rained and even faxed for us. If we called for something, it was immediately addressed. We were very impressed. We did have a concern with the cleaning staff, but that was quickly rectified and apologized for.Goethe 87 is in what was once one of the most fashionable parts of town, Charlottenburg. The trend factor loss to the east is our gain in the west, as staying in Charlottenburg is now less expensive than say Berlin Mitte or nearer to the gate. Bearing in mind that Berlin had the best transportation system we encountered, anywhere you stay is accessible to the city centers, and Goethe 87 is surrounded by excellent shopping and varied restaurant choices. When you stay at Goethe 87 you feel you are absorbed into the lifestyle of Berlin. The post office is across the street, the apothecary is around the corner, the grocer is down the street and the Kurfurstendam is a few blocks away√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√ßife goes on around you as it would for a local; the environment is authentic Berlin. Berlin is a lush, fascinating, historic and vibrant city with an international flair, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bypass it, and get out to museum island! Surrounding the city are a multitude of relaxing parks, quaint lakeside towns (Tegel-am-see), and castle areas (don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss the Potsdam Palaces). There is an active art scene. I loved Berlin and Goethe 87 made it truly comfortable and memorable for our entire group. A++! ","annotations":[]}
