{"text":"Pricey Hotel - Horrid Guests We chose the San Juan Intercontinental for the last four days of our 10-day trip to Puerto Rico. The rest of the trip was spent at serene, out-of -the-way sort of places in Puerto Rico, so we were thoroughly rested and recharged when we arrived at this hotel. The people at the front desk are very well-trained and polite. We were a tad early and our room wasn't ready, so the bellman took our bags and we went out to the beach-side deck for burgers. When we got to our room an hour later, it was lovely. We had a 12th floor room with an ocean view. Outstanding! My only complaint was thatthe double beds seemed small for two people. There would have been enough room for slightly larger beds, I think. All the other room amenities were very nice.This otherwise lovely property was overrun by rude, arrogant, loud people from a certain East Coast major metropolitan area for the long MLK holiday weekend. They were their usual loud, pushy, obnoxious selves all weekend. Those people were on their Blackberrys and cell phones constantly, everywhere you went, including the pool area, so it was really difficult to relax. I could just feel my blood pressure going up. Several men even smoked cigars by the pool. I was disgusted by this. Who wants to smell that instead of the fresh sea breeze?It was really hard to move to another lounge chair, too, since it was extremely crowded and difficult to find a seat in the first place. Then, when I did find another seat that appeared free, some jerk pushed all my stuff on to the ground while I was swimming. Complaints to the staff elicited little more than shrugs. Later that evening, I went out on my hotel balcony, only to find a man on the balcony below and to the right completely nude and showing himself off to a cheering woman on the patio below. Revolting and low class (more of our countrymen from a certain major East Coast city). The pool is really nice (except they allow smoking anywhere), the beach was nice, too, but the water was full of seaweed. The food and drinks are very high-priced, but I knew this going in, so I sucked it up. I paid $23 for a very tasty quesadilla and Diet Coke. They add the15% tip right into the bill, so just be aware. We had a rental car andknow our way around San Juan pretty well, so we chose to take most of our meals off the property. The valet men were quick and efficient. Noproblems there. The other thing they get you with is one of those stupid resort charges of about $50 per night, so make sure you add that (and about another $50 in taxes) to whatever room rate you find online. Do not befooled!!!This hotel is very close to the airport. This is good and bad. Good because it takes no time at all to get your rental car returned at to the airport, but bad because you can hear jets taking off all day. Notthat big a deal, just something to know before you go. All in all, this was a lovely property with friendly staff, but I doubt we will ever go back. It's perfect for the loud, obnoxious city types requiring every luxury and used to paying exorbitant prices for everything, or for people who want to go to Puerto Rico but are too scared (which is silly) to venture outside of a resort. We'll be looking for something much less crowded, where quiet and solitude are more possible on our next trip.Lastly, we are Priority Club members, but we had no idea that Intercontinental hotels pay Priority Club points at a much lower rate than standard Holidays Inns. We actually received more points for a short stay in a Holiday Inn in Ponce than for our longer, far more expensive stay at the Intercontinental. Frankly, we felt a little ripped off about that.
