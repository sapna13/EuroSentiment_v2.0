{"text":"Well above Average and my expectations The first time I stayed at this Hotel was in July 2001 compliments of an Airline which had rescheduled my flight. At that time the Hotel was horrible.Small room, unkempt bathroom with dark mold all around and generally not pleasant.But it was a free stay, so I did not do much about it.How much they have changed! I stayed there on Mar 3,2007 for 1 night to catch an early departure from Seatac.On arrival staff was friendly and I had reserved a nonsmoking King room-which I got without any problems.The room on the 5th floor faced the edge of the Airport tarmac- but I did not hear any airplane noises during my entire stay.Everything was very clean (MOST important for me), and the bathroom had no mold and looked fresh and new.The room has a good size and had an easy chair, a desk with free DSL cable Internet connection. A big TV with a good selection of channels.All in all things were completely different from my first stay.I did not find the bed too hard-just right to get a good nights sleep.The towels were not as nice as in some other La Quintas I have been to-but still not the flimsy kind that one gets a a budget motel.I paid $60 plus tax for this weekend night, which is quite low compared to other Hotels in the area.The free continental breakfast is really quite extensive with cereal, fruit, Joghurt and fresh waffles.A bit to few tables when I was there, as a tour group from Korea just had breakfast-they were not provided an extra area, although they were more than approx.30 people, who were not familiar with western breakfast it seems.But the staff cleared up all the messes quickly and refilled all supplies within minutes.One very touching thing happened, as a blind man came for his breakfast, he asked for assistance and truly one of the staff was at his side for the whole time, getting him what he wanted and needed.I stay at Seatac often because of early flights and I think this La Quinta will be my choice for the future.
