{"text":"A Great Resort and Stay .... just a few details need attention I really enjoyed my stay at this resort and I would recommend the resort to other travelers. Just a few details I think they should work on:1) All the pools at the resort close too early 7 p.m.2) The room only had one large towel and no facial towels. When we requested more towels the housekeeping staff was not friendly about giving more towels.3) The shower drain was clogged.4) My room smelled like smoke.5) The pool towels - they ran out and informed us to return in one hour.6) The property train that goes around the hotel is supposed to run every 15 min - it runs more like every 20 to 30 min. 7) The satellite TV has interruption in service and not enough american channels.8) Had trouble plugging items (adaptors and appliances) into the room outlets - kept falling out of the outlet.9) Big Item - the common area lighting in the buildings and hallways are turned off at 1 a.m. If you return after that time it is scary and feels dangerous!10) Last Item - It is great the resort offers nightly shows and entertainment. However, they can improve a few of the shows such as the Ms. Palladium show was not good. The Master of Cermonies was very, very hard to understand in both english and spanish. The Dominican Cultural Show had very little to do with Dominican cultural dance and was more of a modern dance show.Other than those details... it really was a great experience! ","annotations":[]}
