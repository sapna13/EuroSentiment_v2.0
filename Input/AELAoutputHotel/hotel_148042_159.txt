{"text":"The Best Customer Service in PR Me and two other friends stayed at this property for 5 nights in July. We had a wonderful time. I don't usually stay at luxurious hotels but we got this at a fabulous price (which included the club level). While this hotel is extremely expensive the service here is probably the best on the whole island (or at least in the San Juan metro area). Everyone was exceptionally nice and accomodating. I would recommend the club level since the price of food in the restaurant is absolutely price gouging. For example a pina colada (probably the best i ever had) was 14$ and french fries in the steakhouse was 10$. I had a problem with my bill upon checkout and all matters were quickly resolved. Apparently they had overcharged me for services. As the other reviewer posted, make sure you review your bill thoroughly when you check out because it appears that this hotel will add charges you didnt authorize. I simply asked the front desk to produce a ticket that i signed which authorized the charge. They couldn't and it was resolved. The hotel also offers tours to various points of interest. I suggest doing the rainforest, it was great. Old San Juan was okay nothing spectacular and it seemed like everything was dead by 7pm. I was told that since the cruise ships were not docked the stores close early.Overall, this was an excellent hotel. The club level team was great including Roberto and Rey. They really made our stay more enjoyable.
