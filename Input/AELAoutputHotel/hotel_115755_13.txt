{"text":"Not perfect, but pretty darn good Just left Seattle and wanted to give Deca a plug for being so nice to our family. There were a few little things that could improve, but the service was top notch.Pros:1) Friendly, accomodating staff. Service with a smile  a sincere desire to please.2) Lobby is a great place to gather to plan your day. In some hotels you feel really self-concious sitting in the lobby, but here you feel completely at ease.3)The free shuttle made it really easy to get downtown. The first day we took the car downtown and had to pay $18 to park - this was a great alternative.4) Spacious room. We were in 1507 which had two queen beds and still enough room for 3 chairs, a desk, and a tv stand. It was comfortable for our family of 4.5) Views, views, views! Nice view of downtown, the Space Needle, and the mountains. This was a big hit with the kids.6) Price. The hotel was about $40 lower than the same level of hotels we considered downtown. We used the money we saved to go on a seaplane ride - a better investment if you have kids!Cons:1) Bathroom is small. If i was traveling by myself i wouldn't mind, but with a family it took a lot of time to get everyone ready.2) The room has a DVD player but they don't have any DVD's to loan you. They should have a library if they are going to have a player,3) They don't have a kids menu. All in all the restaurant didn't cater to kids very well. We didn't see many other kids during our stay, but still...4) could be more green. There was an option to not change your sheets, but no recyle bins, the tempature control was old and only turned on and off which keeps the AC running even when you aren't there,  the fireplace in the lobby is on all the time burning gas.All in all we would stay again. The nice staff, beautiful decor,  good value made up for the cons'.
