{"text":"Delightful SF experience! Enjoyed a 2 night stay at this recently renovated gem 9\/10-9\/12 and very much enjoyed my stay!THE PLUSES:* Front Desk staff were superb, especially Irene and Michael.* A half block off Powell - you'll hear cable cars from your room and can zip down to Market or over Nob Hill easily* Delicious coffee service in lobby. I'm a coffee snob. Theirs is wonderful. Also coffeepots in room, so if you need a cup of coffee so you can go downstairs to get a cup of coffee, you got it* Complimentary SF Chronicle in the lobby. It's nice to get local flavor on the news instead of the traditional USAToday left on the doorstep.* Charming period notes in the room ( frosted glass window slats in the bathroom, period doors to closets and bath ) offset by modern luxuries ( flat panel display in room, Lather bath accessories )* Large windows offering plenty of light and fresh airNow, lots of reviewers comment on the room size. Yep, they are modest. I was in standard room 710 and found it to be smallish - but c'mon, people, you're in downtown SF in a historic building! If you want a big room, BOOK A BIG ROOM - they offer larger rooms than standard.Also, only one elevator on site - again, a retrofitted older building .... I'd rather enjoy ANY elevator than the walk up 7 flights (though the walk down was fine!)I enjoyed my time so much I'm considering switching my upcoming reservation at another property over to Larkspur.
