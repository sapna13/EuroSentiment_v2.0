{"text":"Great Beach My wife and I were among a group of fifteen who stayed at this resort from Jan.5 to Jan.12\/08. We had requested a ground floor room close to the beach because I have mobility problems but were placed in section #39 that was about as far from the beach as you can be. After many trips to the front desk we were able to get a ground floor room in building nine (which was about half way to the beach) a couple of days later. They seemed to be overbooked and had trouble making a change to accomodate my disability. We settled in finally and enjoyed the beach and pools for the rest of the week. The main buffet was just fine and we found the specialty dining to be even better. The staff in both were very helpful, friendly and eager to please. The beer was cold and the daily special drinks were a refreshing change from day to day. The room was adequate although the king size bed was a bit too hard for my liking and the pillows were the worst I have ever had to try to get used to. They were very thin and two each just didn't do it for us. The maid service was fine but a little inconsistant although we did leave a tip for them every day. One day we got all the fancy swans, etc and the next they must have been in a hurry as we got none of the little extras or even clean towels. We never did see any washcloths the whole week but just assumed that maybe no-one in the Dominican Republic uses them! So in reality we didn't find very much to complain about. We went there for the beach, the sun and the sea and this resort certainly didn't dissapoint us. We would likely try to find a resort that was not quite so big next time. We have stayed at the Colonial Majestic in Punta Cana and would probably pick it again over the Gran Bahia Principe Bavaro. ","annotations":[]}
