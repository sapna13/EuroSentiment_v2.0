{"text":"Great resort! My family and I have been to Punta Cana over ten times and this was our best experience yet! This is a great resort. General FacilitiesTop notch. The grounds are very lush and pristinely maintained. You feel like you're walking around in paradise. If you are a bird lover - there are peacocks roaming around and lots of other birds in the ponds near the main restaurant. Beautiful pool. We walked over to the other Iberostar properties next door and while they are also nice, felt that the Iberostar Bavaro is definitely superior. BeachWhite sand and very clean. The ocean is good for swimming - but has some small waves. Lots of palapas (straw umbrellas) on the beach for shade - there are signs saying you can't reserve them but everyone does. Usually people go out around 7-7:30 if they want a premium location but loungers\/palapas can be found all day. RoomsThe rooms are not over the top but are very nice with marble bathrooms, a minibar, and a nice chaise lounge\/bankette on the balcony. Food\/RestaurantsThe food is of remarkably quality - especially at the a la carte restaurants. Service was always prompt and friendly. For breakfast there is pretty much anything you could ask for - from french toast, pancake and waffle stations, omelettes, fresh fruit and pastries. The resort tries really hard to cater to both its North American and European guests and there are lots of options. We tried the Gourmet, Cajun and Mediterranean restaurants. All of them were very good but our favourites were the Gourmet and the Cajun. The lobster salad at the Gourmet is great! The menus are all posted near the restaurants if you want to check them out. For the lunch and dinner buffets, they do tend (like all all-inclusives) to get a little repetitive. However there is always a variety of options and we found the seafood - especially the calamari and fish - to be exceptionally good. On Friday there was lobster at the buffet. Check with the reservation desk to find out when it is - previously it was Wednesdays. GuestsA variety - young and old, couples and familities, Americans, Canadians, Europeans. Some reviews said that the Europeans were rude - I didn't find this at all. A great resort for families and couples but is probably too lowkey for most singles. Definitely recommend this resort!
