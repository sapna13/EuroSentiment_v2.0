{"text":"Absolutely the best hotel in Amsterdam! I don't see how anyone could have any complaints about this fabulous hotel! Sure, the rooms are small, but this is Europe, and we did pay only 100 euro\/night! Good things:-SUPER nice staff. Always helped with every need, even carried my very heavy suitcase up the narrow stairs for me =)-GREAT breakfast. Fresh squeezed juice, eggs, meats, cheeses, ect.-Free coffee anytime, from an awesome machine that could make anything from a macchiato to espresso.-Extremely clean rooms and bathroom.-Terrace to go out and sit at night with a glass of wine or a coffee.-Perfect location. Quiet residental street, but only a 1-5 minute walk to the more bustling areas.I could go on and on about this hotel. I have traveled through Europe since I was quite small, and this is the 1st hotel that I know for a fact that I will return to. I will never stay anywhere else in Amsterdam.Some tips:-Eat at the resteraunt right accross the little pedestrian bridge by the hotel. It is fantastic, quiet, and reasonably priced with great food. -Visit Albert Hejin supermarket, they have great little snacks.-Anne Frank house and Van Gogh museum are must-sees. This hotel is only 2 streets over from the Anne Franks house (and visit on a weekday - we had no wait!).We had a great time and can't wait to go back. We loved this hotel so much that we are sending them a Christmas card. Please stay here, you will not be disappointed.
