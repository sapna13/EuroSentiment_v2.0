{"text":"Massively over rated by Trip Advisor I always take Trip Advisor reviews for what I think they are - basically good marks are for value for money. For suite hotels like the Affinia chain this tends to mean can you sleep many people comfortably To be fair this is a problem for hoteliers -unless they impose stringent controls at check in - because it means that the fittings get put under immense strain -  if the housekeeping on your floor is slightly weak after heavy use by previous guests things get shabby real quick.Location is good - not stunning. Especially impressive is the choice of restaurants of decent quality within one block. I'd guess this is probably one of the most densely populated Zagat recommended blocks on Earth. Nothing Earth shattering but great choice, variety  price equation.Enough of being considerate - even by New York standards this hotel is overpriced for the offer. The problems are;1. Poor public area\/reception space compared to hotel space. If you are out of your room by midday you will have nowhere to sit if you have a late flight out of NYC.2. Shabby decor -  lack of cleaning of public areas - especially elevators.3. In this case, an extraordinarily shabby 2 bedroom suite. Filthy dirty carpets, stained furniture - notably the sofa bed  dust everywhere. Indeed it wasn't a 2 bedroom suite at all it was a studio with a suite connected through opened connecting doors. This meant we had two kitchens and 2 of the rooms were dominated by huge desks - BUT we had no dining table.Sorry to be picky but this place does not even compare with the Envoy Club let alone somewhere like the Kimberley.To give a sense of proportion I stay regularly at The Affinia Manhattan, The Westin Times Square  The Tribeca Grand as well as the hotels mentioned above. They all have their points but they are all in my opinion fairly reviewed on Trip Advisor.As a previous reviewer said √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëo not expect luxury√à√\u2020\u2022?- fact is - it is barely 3* let alone 4*. And to keep that 3* level based on my experience it needs some serious attention to housekeeping!Oh and I only booked through Expedia because the groups own website is astonishingly ineffeicent - even for registered Affinia group registered members.
