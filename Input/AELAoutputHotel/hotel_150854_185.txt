{"text":"Clean resort with Great Service! I stayed at the resort April 11 - 16th with one of my girlfriends. We had a great time. The Domincan men were so nice and fun! The weather was great and the resort was very clean. The beach was beautiful. Our jacuzzi suite was spacious and clean. The food was ok. I would not rave about it. But we did enjoy our meal at the Japanese restaurant. We had two slight incidents: there was a large cockroach roaming throughout the bread table. We informed a server and she just waved it away. We informed the front desk and they gave us extra towel cards (by the way, you only get one towel card per person for the pool). Also, although this is an all inclusive resort, you have to reserve the time you will eat dinner (6:30 or 8:30 pm). They assign you a table. When we arrived for dinner the third night and sat at our assigned table they came over and argued somewhat that we were not reserved for that time and table (we had the paper that they gave us with time and table written on it). They moved us! We weren't happy about this but we eventually came to a resolution. This is my second visit to Punta Cana and the first at the Riu Macao. It was fun and very relaxing, but I will not return. The damp smell was quite overpowering in the rooms. We had one of the best suites at the resort. But the beds were so hard and for me quite uncomfortable. If you plan to bring children, please understand that they will see topless tourists at the beach and pool and some funny, ugly sites with thongs (men and women).
