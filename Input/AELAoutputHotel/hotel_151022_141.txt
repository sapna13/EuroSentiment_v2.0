{"text":"Resort a Real Treat We left Halifax Mar. 31\/2007 and spent 7 wonderful days at Natura Park. The check in was quick and efficent and our bags were delivered to the room within 10 mins. as we were told. The Buffet was excellent with plenty of choices, and what was to be hot was hot and what was to be cold was cold. We only did 2 of the A La Carte's the Steak house with the best beef tenderloin we have ever had, so good that we did some dealing to get a secound night there. The Seafood resturant at the beach was also well done the only down fall as far as the resort stay was the misquito's on the last two nights mainly due to the wind dying out and the air becoming calm. But a little planing on our part and a trip back to the room for bug dope and all was well.If only the whole vacation had gone so well but our return was not at all what we had expected. Sunwing airlines definitely needs to have a look at their contingency plans when an aircraft is diverted to another airport due to a snow storm. As Debbie from Halifax had mentioned in a previous review we were left in Moncton airport from 8:30 pm Apr. 07\/2007 till 5:00 am on Apr\/08, 2007. Then after all that wait for the supposed busses we were told were still coming we were given a hotel room for 4 hrs. before we were told to be ready to return to Halifax via School Buss at 9:00 am. We also did not appreciate the threat that if we took the Hotel room we would have to find our own way back to Halifax! I wonder how Sunwing plans on gaining more share of the market to the Dominican if this is the way they treat their paying passengers..Lew ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1001,"mention":"snow","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Snow_cream"],"startOffset":997}]}
