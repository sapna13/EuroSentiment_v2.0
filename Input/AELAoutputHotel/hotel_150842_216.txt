{"text":"Paradise! Myself, my partner and his parents have just returned from a two week stay at this hotel and found it to be absolute paradise.We flew from the UK with Mytravel Airways and went premiair - well worth the extra money! We had loads of extra legroom and comfortable seats.We landed at Punta Cana airport and were greeted by Dominicans locals playing music and stop you to have your photos taken which are for sale on the return journey if you would like to by one. The ride to the hotel took about 20 minutes and when we arrived we were greeted with cool fruity drinks, check in was quick and easy.RoomsWe had requested a higher floor room, which we were given and after reading some of the reviews on here we were expecting the rooms to be awful. Quite the opposite, the room was huge and very nicely decorated which a mini -bar that was stocked daily, satellite TV, Bath\/Shower and a huge bed, everything that you need!GroundsThe grounds were beautifully laid out, loads of trees\/flowers. ponds with carp\/turtles and birds. The resort also had its own rooster which slept in the entertainment theatre that you were able to stroke as it was so tame. Everyday the trees were being clipped hedges tidied up and leaves swept away.Pool\/BeachThere were 2 pools, 1 for the Punta Cana hotel and 1 for the Dominicana hotel and you could use either. They were very big and very cool on a hot day! The beach was absolutely breathtaking and we had no problems founding loungers with or without shade. There was a bar right on the beach that you were able to get plenty of drinks from throughout the day.FoodThe food was great, I am quite a fussy eater and never had a problem finding something that I liked, it was so good that I put 10lb on in weight! We visited the steakhouse, Oriental and Mexican several times and never had problems booking them.Not one of our party were sick at all, and everytime we walked past the doctors area it was always empty. We drank everything with ice and all the water that was served at the restaurants.ExcursionsWe went on the Marinarium trip which you swim with the sharks and rays, this was brilliant and also the Aqautic tour which was a blast. You get to drive your own speedboat along the Bavaro coastline and then get to snorkel for about 20 mins. The guides give you bread to feed to the fish and you are completely swarmed by loads of them, this was the best snorkelling I have ever done! SpaYou could also use the Jacuzzis in the Spa, but you had to book for this and you could use the steam rooms and sauna included in your stay. Myself and my partner paid for the deep tissue massage which was well worth the money!OverallI would go back to this hotel in a heartbeat, the weather was amazing, at least 100 degrees everyday and only 2 - 3 days of on off rain. The Star friends and all the staff work extremely hard to make your stay wonderful. After reading some of the reviews beforehand I was a bit concerned that we had made a mstake in booking here. we have stayed at the IB Lindo, Tucan and Paraiso Beach in Mexico so were fairly familiar with Iberostar. We were not disappointed. I would take all reviews with a pinch of salt and go with an open mind, enjoy yourself and make your own opinions on this hotel. I have only been home 1 day and I already want to go back! Sorry for the long review!
