{"text":"Not bad, not great I booked the Library based on the many positive TripAdvisor reviews, and stayed for 6 nights in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºuite√à√\u2020\u2022?in November 2007 for our honeymoon.The hotel had informed me per mail that our favoured, romantic, suite was probably occupied, but they would keep an eye open and keep me informed. At arrival, we were given another suite, and no word was said concerning my numerous requests. In our room, nothing honeymoon-like had been prepared, and I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ help but feel that all previous correspondence had been a total waste of time. Very √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºure, we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l do our best√à√\u2020\u2022?but absolutely nothing done for real. Very disappointing. Remember, in total these rooms cost nearly $700 per night√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>The suite as such was what all other cities in the world would call a double. Adequate size, but nothing more. The bathroom has shower only, no proper bath, and this must be unique for any suite in the world. One basin only.The bed was comfortable, however we had ripped sheets for 2 nights. Not acceptable at these prices. We were on the 8th floor, but still found it too loud. The windows are not state of the art, and not sound-proof. There are no drapes\/curtains to fully darken the room. Only roller blinds cover the windows, and this lets in light.The reading room on the 2nd floor is nice and comfortable. Adequate newspapers and magazines, cosy atmosphere. Breakfast is ample, seating can get cramped if too many guests arrive at the same time. Cheese and wine each afternoon is a nice gesture. The quality of wine and cheese however left most European guests unimpressed, and they, like us, gave it a miss. Many reviews raved about the front desk. We hardly used it, but the front staff seemed friendly enough. If this is important to you, then definitely a plus. Location was good. Close to numerous subways, walking distance from Time Square, very central. Further, smaller, issues: loud a\/c, no HBO. All in all an OK stay. Considering the price, too many negatives if you are a seasoned traveller and experienced to 5-star prices\/quality. Then again, this is New York where all hotels are overpriced considering the service they provide.Finally, beware the .004 rooms, as these are directly located at the elevators (3 feet opposite).
