{"text":"some good  My family  I stayed for 1 week as part of a large group(part business). Out of the 100 or so of us, some had problems w\/ their rooms  others were ok.There are a few good points about this place.1) the beach  scenery is great, but of course this is not something the hotel made.2) Landscaping  grounds were neat  clean  lush.3) There is a lot of staff around to take care of things. Everywhere you turn there is someone in a uniform passing.4) most of the staff seems to be happy go lucky people(which cuts both ways when working)The not so great features are:1) some front desk  bartend staff have a habit of initially ignoring you when they see you coming up. Both my wife  I commented on this. They also have what I consider the worst habit of using their cell phones while working (both talking  text message)  you are right in front of them waiting.2) Our room was in the older part of the resort, which always smelled like there is a sewage leak somewhere. Our room was fairly clean  most things worked properly, but the quality of construction was lacking  the tub really needed to be replaced. a few people in our party did have leaks coming into their room from the toilet above them  had to be moved.3) Even though our room was right next to the pool closest to the front lobby area, we were told later on that we were not allowed to use it because it was for the Royal Service guests. This was not communicated to us before.4) when we asked if we could be moved to another room closer to the pools we could use (we had our 7 year w\/ us) one front desk person told us he would move us but it would be a higher rate. he said the reason we got the room we have was because they were told to keep our group together. Later we find out this was completely untrue because our group was all spread out, even at the other end of the resort which they did not want. A different front desk person we talked to the next day (w\/o knowledge of what we knew) was perfectly fine to move us w\/o charge. This  other examples indicate the staff has a tendency to tell you whatever is convenient for them.5) The meals  drinks are all inclusive. But it seems they are more geared toward quantity rather than quality. The default meal is at the buffets,  it's actually not bad w\/ a fair selection of different items, especially good if you have small children. The restaurant system make you jump through hoops to eat at the a la carte restaurants. Don't bother w\/ them because you can find better  more authentic stuff at any American suburban strip mall restaurant. I am not a drinker but even I could tell it was cheap stuff (I grew up working in restaurants  tended bar in college).6) their system of diesel trolley  gas powered golf carts to get you around will get you there but there were so many carts  staff on mopeds zipping around that you were constantly in danger of being run over. It also made so much fumes that it ruins the fresh air you might have enjoyed.Overall I probably would not go back there again. If you are a big drinker  big eater  just want to lounge around the pool or beach it might be a good value. But it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ for me. ","annotations":[]}
