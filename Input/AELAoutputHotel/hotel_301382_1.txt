{"text":"Good location Okay value The room are small by Asian standards. A room with two twin beds does not have enough space to have two large luggage opened at the same time without blocking the key passage way to the front door and bathroom.The rooms are clean but nothing special.The location is fantastic as it is connected to a large mall in a more residential area of the city so the food is not so expensive. There is a 24 hr grocery store, Seiyu,just outside the mall, very close to the hotel. You must buy some of their fruits. It is fantastic. The convenience store just below the hotel is really expensive compared to Seiyu. If you are tired of the Japanese food, there is a French pastry place in the mall and it is pretty good.The service is helpful but I find the English skills poor except for one girl I met on the day I was leaving.Instead of disposable slippers, they have re-sanitized ones that look really old.You can say the subway is a little far (10 min), but there is a lot to see along the way, and most of it is part of the mall which travels underground towards the subway station. The station is also part of the JR Yamanote line which is an added convenience.I also stayed at the Grand Prince Akasaka for the same price and they were better in all categories except for transportation. So for the same price this is not good value. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":691,"mention":"pastry","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":685}]}
