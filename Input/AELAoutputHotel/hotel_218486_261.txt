{"text":"Super! This resort was great! Couldn't have asked for more. At first my family was worried because we read some bad reviews online. The only problem we had with this hotel was at the front desk. They are SLOW and sometimes downright ignore you. Most of the staff speaks very limited english, but others speak it very well. The beach is great and very large. One nice thing was that it is illegal for beach vendors to talk to you unless you approach them, so you don't get harassed like in mexico! The pools are very nice also. Please note that the beach IS topless and it seemed that most everyone was topless! When we walked along the beach it appeared that most of the other resorts were topless as well. Our whole family thought that the food was great! The buffet is good, we only ate dinner there one night. Make sure you make reservations fairly early to get your pick of the restaurants. We went to the italian restaurant first, you order off of the menu and it was pretty good, you can get lobster that is very good, but you have to pay an extra $15. The steak is pretty good, you can get some noodles with plain sauce if you are less adventurous with your meals. They will even give you two meals if you ask for it! My dad got both the lasagna and calimari, both were pretty tasty. Next we went to the brazillian place, it was very good, we went back twice. You get many different kinds of meat along with a buffet with potatoes, rice, beans, salad and so on...The Japanese restaurant was very cool, they have flat top grills that they cook on at each table. the food is alright, just fried rice and some meat, but it is a must do because the atmosphere. The Spanish restaurant was pretty good, you order off of the menu, the steak with blue cheese is very good, but the rest of my family was kind of disappointed. They have a lot of different types of fish you can order along with lobster for the $15 extra. The Mexican place wasnt very good...you order off the menu here too, no one liked what they got. I would recomend not going here, the other places are far better. It is not on the menu, but I asked for food without meat at the mexican restaurant and got an interesting cooked veggie arrangement, I would assume that you can do this at the other places too if you don't eat meat. We got hour long massages for $30. If you go to the massage place that is near the snack bar you can get this deal, but if you go to the other ones, it is $30 for a half hour. There is a little store at the resort, but it is VERY over priced and all of the souveniers can be bought from vendors that have little shops next to the resort, if you walk along the beach there are many clusters of shops as you go. They have beautiful paintings and wood carvings. We got a very large painting that they took off of the wood frame and we rolled it up and it got kind of flatened and now there are some cracks in the paint. I think that if it had been carried on and not gotten so cold or flattened it would have been fine. On the west end of the resort there are some vendors that sell boat trips, they are good guys. One of them speaks 5 languages! Their trips are fun and a lot cheaper than what is offered by the resort. We went on a private snorkeling trip for 2 hours for $35 a person. The snorkeling is very good. The natural pool is really neat also! The shows at night are pretty good, other than the comedy show I am not sure what they were thinking with that one....save your time and go to bed early and get up and watch the sunrise instead of going to this show! The lobby bar is pretty busy at night, you can meet a lot of interesting people sitting down there! The night time bartender, Edison, is a great guy! He speaks perfect english and is pretty funny. The only thing i didnt like about this vacation was that there is really nothing to do outside of the resort...we had plenty to do, but I am used to traveling in mexico where you can go out at night all around town! It is a very relaxing place to visit! I suggest you do it!
