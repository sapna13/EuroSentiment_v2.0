{"text":"A perfect wedding at PPC My husband and I have just returned from our wedding and honeymoon at the Paradisus. After a trip last summer to DomRep to scope out resorts, I knew this was the place. The grounds are beautiful, and the laid out grounds ensure privacy but are close enough to ensure we often found our 30 friends and family that joined us. From the moment we arrived, we were treated very well--we had reserved a Royal Service room, which was beachfront. We particalurly enjoyed the VIP lounge, where we could check email and get snacks all day long, if we didn't want to go to a restaurant. PPC did a fantastic job of making our wedding special and beautiful. My only complaint are all of the unthoughtful tourists (all Americans, of course) who hovered around our wedding and were in the background of our pictures. One word of advice to travelers, have some respect and give private events the privacy they deserve. You have the whole beach to waddle your fat butts on. The drinks kept coming and even though the food menus were consistent, there was so much variety that everyone had a favorite. About 6 of the men that were in our party ended up with upset tummies---we suspect they were due to the excessive alcohol and lack of water than bad food. Most of us were fine and were eating the same food all week. All in all, it was a wonderful trip, a special thanks to our butler, Amaury, our VIP concierge, Nexci and our wedding coordinators, Jenny  Yadilis...you alll made our wedding week wonderful!!!
