{"text":"Loved this experience! Reading the reviews written by those who had been to this hotel before us was very helpful. The best tip we received was to bring single dollar bills for tipping. There were six of us in our party and we went through at least $200 singles in a week. Tipping is very much appreciated by everyone who works at the hotel, from waitpeople to maids, and they'll remember you for it!One thing I did want to clarify is that the only laundry facilities on the property is that which the hotel operates. Someone had written that there was a laundromat on the grounds and suggested bringing your own laundry soap, which we did. However, there are no do-it-yourself facilities, so we paid (not very much at all) to have some clothes cleaned. Not sure why they wrote about that for this hotel, but it wasn't accurate.This resort was great for us. There were 3 adults and 3 teenagers, and there was plenty (or nothing) to do for everyone! There are activities every 30 minutes if you want to participate, or you can lay on the beach or at the pool and just relax. It was perfect.Our VIP Travel rep at the hotel recommended a half-day trip to snorkel with sharks (not the biting kind!) and stingrays (harmless), and we loved it. We were picked up at the hotel and taken to a big double-deck pontoon boat that took us out to the various spots. We bought waterproof cameras to take with us, and that's all we needed. The equipment was provided, and it was a lot of fun.We also went horseback riding. Our rep recommended one of the two ranches available, and it was a 40 minute ride to the ranch from our hotel, as opposed to another that was closer. This one was a good choice as we rode along the beach and the guides were great. They took our cameras and took pictures (and video) of us while we rode, and they were very kind to those who were a little nervous. Only downside was the ride to the ranch. We went in a safari-type vehicle....bench seating and open with a cover over the seats. We had to breathe in the exhaust fumes there and back which was a little sickening, but the horseback riding part of it was terrific.The people at this resort could not have been nicer, and I still marvel at how many people it must take to run the operation they have there. I would definitely recommend it....great value, nice people, and beautiful scenery.
