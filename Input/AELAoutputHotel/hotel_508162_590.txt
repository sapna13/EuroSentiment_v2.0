{"text":"Excellent Stay, well worth it. The Airport: Arrival- Is a bit confusing, be sure to get your entrance cards, $10 per person at the desk in the center of the customs area, then get into line. Or have someone in your party hold your spot while another goes to get the tickets, they are required for entry. Once you get past customs, the bag √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢andlers√à√\u2020\u2022?with try to grab your bags from you to take them the extra 15 feet to the reservation check in desks (ours was Apple). Be firm if you do not want the help as they will expect a tip for carrying the bags. The ride to the resort is about an hour and quite rough. Depending on the driver, it can be quite scary at some points, if you get carsick easily, be prepared.Departure- The same for the bag handlers, they will grab the bags out of the vehicle, fighting each other to get a bag just so they can get that tip. Once again, stand firm and take the bags yourself. There is a quick customs check that you must get into first, so your bags can get the USDA sticker, than you can get in line for check-in. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ buy one of the palm tree made hats on the beach from the vendors, they confiscate it at the airport and won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ let them through customs. Check-in:We arrived to a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??elcome Home√à√\u2020\u2022?and cold towels (unfortunately no drinks for us)Out bags were ticketed and we were told to check in and get our room number than bring back the stubs and the bags would be brought to the room. Check in was very quick, and seemed scripted√à√\u2020\u2022?our bags arrived to our room about 5 minutes after we did.The Resort:It is quite nice actually. After driving through some of the worst parts of the DR to get there I was pleasantly surprised. They are still working on some renovations, mostly they were reworking the pathways, in about two more weeks they should be complete I would guess. The pool was always clean and quite large. Once you get your bearings, or follow the provided map, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ pretty easy to figure out where to go. Chairs by the pool get snatched up very early in the morning. There is plenty of chairs at the beach however if you get out there before 10 or so. The beach is cleaned daily. Watch for rocks if you go in the water directly in front of the resort, they are sharp! Hint: If you go to the right of the resort around the point and down a few hundred feet, there is some incredible beach( it is not cleaned since it is not part of the resort) but if you can look past that the water there has very little if any rocks and some good waves if you are looking to have some fun! The forecast before we went always said a chance of rain, and there was always a brief shower, but it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ last long. The skies were usually clear in the morning, and then partly cloudy in the afternoon.The Room:Our room was cleaned twice daily, towels always restocked, nightly turndown service, sometimes with towel art and flowers. There was always a sheet left in the room, outlining the next day√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ activities. We were in building 2 and had a great view of the pool, pool bar and a bit of the ocean. (2216) The Food:Being an AI, I was expecting some less than average food. The buffet was pretty much the same for breakfast and lunch, but the food was good, and the freshly made orange juice was amazing! The other restaurants were quite good too. Himitsu, Bordeaux, Seaside, El Patio√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√°ll had some very well made dishes. No complaints here.All in all, if you are on the fence about this resort, the good definitely outweigh any bad here. The staff is quite friendly and does remember your name if you make an effort to be friendly to them. We tipped here and there if the service warranted it. ","annotations":[]}
