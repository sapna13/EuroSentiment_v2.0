{"text":"bavaro princess; not all that great just got back from a 4-day vacation at the bavaro princess. the only word that i can think of to describe my stay is 'eh'. i was in punta cana last year but stayed in a different resort, which i thought at the time was a nice place. however after staying at the bavaro princess i realized how amazing and great the other place was. i found myself comparing the two..and to be honest the cons outweighed the pros for bavaro princess.pros: -very clean place.-welcoming.-nice big pool. the swim up bar was pretty neat.-lots of beach area.-the activities people were very nice and friendly. the games and events by the beach and pool were always very fun and entertaining.cons: -the place was entirely too big. to get from the lobby to the beach is about a 20 minute walk.-there are trams that come about every 5-10 minutes but most of the time they are full and you have to end up walking.-the pathways are lighted but it's still pretty dark at night and they aren't wide enough for the trams to get through if people are walking on them.-the lobby buffet and the beach buffet are both open buildings. which means there are alot of flies and bugs that fly around on the open food. it's gross.-i was eaten alive by all the mosquitos. and yes i sprayed bugspray 24\/7 but still managed to get bitten.-the airconditioning in our suite wasn't working too well. it was cool but not cool enough to stop us from sweating.-the casino  the club (which is in the casino) is not in the resort. which means you have to take the tram to get there and it's open to locals, which is kind of sketch\/shady.-laying on the beach is relaxing until you get 3468 guys asking you if want to parasail\/bananaboat or buy from their suitcases, which is very annoying and aggravating.so as you can see the bavaro princess, in my opinion, wasn't all that great. i would recommend looking\/going to a different resort before ever going to this one.
