{"text":"lovely beach property Stayed at the Courtyard Marriott Isla Verde for one night post cruise. We arrived at the hotel from the ship at 11:30 AM and were warmly welcomed. We were in our room by 11:45 and on the beach shortly after. After receiving our guest wristbands and beach towels we were greeted by two beach attendants who asked us where we would like our sun loungers placed. What service. We also enjoyed the comfortable hammocks which line the beach. The pool was enjoyable as was the jacuzzi. This is a very pretty and tropically landscaped property. The room was fairly standard with a king sized bed, sofa, chair and coffee table. We had a room on the eighth floor overlooking the ocean with a small but adequate balcony furnished with a table and two well cushioned chairs.The hotel has a small collection of DVD's available at no charge which I thought was a nice touch.The pool area grill served standard beach fare which was enjoyed beach and poolside. We also enjoyed the Puerto Ricanbuffet at night (complete with salsa music) as well as the buffet breakfast in the morning. I thought the prices for both buffets were reasonalble ($22.00 and $12.95 respectively) but I did think the poolside grill was overpriced.All in all we had a most enjoyable time at this hotel and would recommend it highly. We have traveled all over the world and have always found that the attitude of the hotel staff makes the difference between a good and a great hotel. Every staff person we came into contact with at this property was friendly and helpful and really seemed to take pride in their work. Thus, a great hotel!!!!
