{"text":"A great vacation spot I travaled to Punta Cana with my husband and my four year old son. We stayed at the Bavaro Princess, from Oct. 14th - Oct.21st.We have traveled to many different place but thiswas our first time in Punta Cana and we enjoyed it.The weather was amazing.The hotel rooms were a little run down. They could use a little fixing up. We had small ants in our room at times. And our air conditioner unit was a little loud.The food was good. There was a great selection. For lunch we always ate at the buffet by the beach. And when traveling with a child it is important to have a geat selection of food.The people working on the resort were very friendly and helpful.The pool also could use and little fix up. There is a pool bar which was very nice. The pool is next to the beach was was great. We had a room very close to the pool, which was an amazing location. The beach was beautiful.Very clean. They did have a kids club but my son wasn't interested. He wanted to spend his time with us in the pool and at the beach.They do have nightly shows at 10:00p.m. We only caught one. (The Lion King).We found the time to be a little late.The resort is large and can be overwhelming at first.But it is a great place and I would recommend it. And we would go back. Keep in mind that 5 star in Punta Cana is not a 5 star in North America. We were aware of this, and we had a great time.
