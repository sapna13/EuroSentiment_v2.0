{"text":"Good, but not the best Stayed here on honeymoon early June for 8 nights. The grounds are fabulous and the way the Lanais are spread out really does help give you a sense of privacy. I can only imagine how wonderful the private villas are, but these were way out of our price range!Pros:Very peacefulGrounds were amazingStaff are incredibly pleasant and well meaningLocationMeals were delicious from every restaurant\/barroom serviceConsRooms: - the bathroom has full length windows with no cover, so if you go in there after 6am, expect to be whacked with the morning sun! Bed - has a wooden frame all the way around the perimeter making it fairly uncomfortable getting in and out.Cost - as previously mentioned, the bar and restaurant are very expensive compare with prices on the rest of the island - as you'd expect at a high-end resort though, so no suprises there.All in all it was a pleasant stay, but not as good as other 5* stays I've had. The service, though well meaning, just wasnt quite up there with other places we've been. As for the local restaurants, we found Ku De Ta to be all hype and no substance, particularly the food. We loved the Living Room and the view at La Lucciola is wonderful. We didnt even bother sitting down in Made's Warung II - found much better Indonesian food just up the road from the hotel.If you want the best, I'd imagine the Four Seasons or Legian would be the ones to go for. If you want to comprimise slightly, but in return get a comparitively good deal, definitely give the Oberoi a try.
