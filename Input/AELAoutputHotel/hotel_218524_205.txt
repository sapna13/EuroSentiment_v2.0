{"text":"Great Place with a few major\/minor setback My wife and I were extremely excited after reading all of the great reviews from this site. The resort was beautiful (take lots of bug spray). The beach itself was soft and the accomodations were fantastic. There were plenty of Tikki huts, beach chairs, beach beds, towels. and you did not have to wake at the crack of dawn to reserve one. We too were there during the end of Hurricane Gustav, during Hannah and the begining of Ike. The people were nice and very accomodating and it does help if you speak the native language. The shows during the evening are a nice touch and give you an alternative on site for evening entertainment. NOW the DOWNSIDE. The first night my shorts were STOLEN (do not leave anything on the patio to dry). WE CONSTANTLY had to spray OFF around our room to set up a perimeter to keep the bugs out. There were a lot of them hidding in the furniture but NONE too close to our BED thank God. The BIGGEST ISSUE WE HAD was the cleanliness of our drinking glasses. 6 of every 10 glasses that we were served a drink in were noticeably dirty (we noticed because we started counting after my wife and I both experienced stomache issues). Some even had remenants of old drinks (such as mint) in the glass. The restaurants while plentiful are average at best. Overall our experience was good because we were together at a beautiful resort with good people. Bugs and Cleanliness were our biggest issues. p.s We have spent alot time in the Carribean and are not being snobs. I simply put in here what I think others would want to know when traveling here.
