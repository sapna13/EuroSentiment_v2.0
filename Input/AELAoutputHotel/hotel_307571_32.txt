{"text":"OMG - What a place! .... Having just spent a few days at FS Sayan we had high expectations for this hotel. When we arrived we were greeted in reception with a cold towel, welcome drink and flowers. We were then taken to our villa - you will honestly not believe how cool this place is until you visit! The villa was enormous! The plunge pool is great, I can honestly say if you didn't want to leave the villa the whole time you are there you wouldn't need to - everything you could possibly want is right there and it is very private. We had in-room dining for lunch most days and for a few nights as well - it is that good! PJ's restaurant was ok, but much preferred the noodle house - it has a real balinese feel to it and the food was scrummy. The only thing is the noodle house is quite hard to find so call for a buggy to take you there. We also had a balinese massage - what an experience. You need to try it out! All in all, I cannot speak highly enough of this place , it is the most amazing place I have ever stayed.. and we have stayed in some pretty fantastic places (mostly 5 star). The staff are at your villa almost as soon as you call them and they are so friendly, the villa's are beautiful, the food is great and I could not think of a more perfect place to spend a honeymoon - mainly due to the total luxury and privacy of the villas! ;)Enjoy!
