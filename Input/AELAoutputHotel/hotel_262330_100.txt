{"text":"excellent stay We just returned from our first trip to NYC and stayed the last 3 days at the Millenium Hilton, and we overly pleased with the stay. We had stayed in Times Square for the first 2 nights of our stay and were a little worried about leaving that area for another hotel.But we were more than pleased with our choice. The hotel is a Hilton, and that speaks for itself. Very modern , clean and staff very more than willing to help on any occasion.We booked a room through Hotwire for $244\/night and felt that was a great price for that hotel in NYC at that time of the year.We had a deluxe room with a king bed ( as promised) and had no complaints whatsoever about the room. It did overlook ground zero, and it was a bit noisy on some mornings but we were on the 21st floor and what we heard at that level was nothing to complain about. Yes there was some noise, but nothing that you may even notice.We didn't eat at the restaurant but we heard that it was very good.They have a great pool, and fitness center. The business center had all the amenities , but charged for use of the internet, (perhaps in my opinion the only negative thing about the hotel). FOr such a hotel for this price, I think internet access should be available at no extra charge.Staff were great and answered all of our many questions about NYC and tried to help in whatever way they could.The location of the hotel is in the downtown area, which was not a concern for us, as the subway was very convenient and got us to where we needed to be in 10 minutes.Overall a fabulous time in NYC and at this hotel. Would definately recommend this hotel, and we would stay there again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":711,"mention":"zero","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Zero"],"startOffset":707},{"endOffset":711,"mention":"zero","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Zero"],"startOffset":707}]}
