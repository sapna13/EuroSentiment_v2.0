{"text":"The Worst Hotel Ever We chose this hotel because we were going to be in Dallas for an extended stay (11 Days) for my daughter to be in the hospital. The rate was good and that was the only thing good about this hotel. It was dirty, service was horrible. Our room was not cleaned for two days. We ran out of toliet paper and took hours to get another role. We had to have our key cards changed or redone over 30 times. When I brought this to the attention of the manager, she said that happens!. The hotel ran out of coffee so there was none in the rooms. The restaurant food while decent was horribly overpriced, orders were incorrect, and the staff inflexible. The shuttle service was discontinued in the middle of one day without notice, leaving my daughter and elderly mother on their own to find a way back to the hotel. They were supposed to call a cab for my elderly father and did not. The staff would say they would do something and then just not do anything, or the front desk would not answer. Marie at the front desk tried to be helpful. Most complaints were not handled well and some never even attempted. I gave a list of complaints on the way out the manager did not offer to do anything except blame me and give me her card and ask to come back. I have stayed in hotels in many states and several countries and for many different prices, and this was by far the worst experience of them all.
