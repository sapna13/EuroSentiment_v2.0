{"text":"The perfect Balinese experience - WE LOVE IT!! My husband and I just come back from The Patra....the best thing that happened in our lives!!! We loved Patra. We come back yesterday, but I cannot stop thinking in that hotel, the lovely staff, the room, the breakfast (!) the swimming pool...every detail simply AMAZING.They treated us if we were the only guests in he hotel. Even with 2 days raining (a lot) we enjoy our stay in Bali. In the second day, was our 4th wedding anniversary. So then, in the morning we asked for a nice restaurant to have a special dinner. The receptionist ask us the reason and then we explain about our anniversary Guess what: when we came back for the bedroom in the afternoon, we found flowers, a dedicated cake decorated  4th anniversary and a gracious card, signed but the staff and management. How such care!! The know how to set up the ambience! The last night we were having dinner in the italian restaurant, and then, musicians came to play specially for our table...couldn't be more romantic!They don't have (yet) direct access to beach, but it's under construction...but you have many options of beach.The room was spacious and very comfortable (specially the bed!!!) The bathroom was huge and had a bathtub for two!! The breakfast: AMAZING! Because they received a lot of japaneses, you'll find sushis and sashimis in the breakfast...but also, pancakes, fruits, cereal, lot os bread, tea, coffee....The hotel is really next to the airport, but the planes didn't bothered us...and we enjoyed the hotel until the last minute (because you need only 5 minutes to do your flight check in.To go to Kuta, you gonna spend USD 2,50...but if you arrange in advance they have free shuttle bus for Kuta.Tis hotel is clean and quite new (5 years old). We definitely wanna come back for The Patra. A great hotel to stay!!
