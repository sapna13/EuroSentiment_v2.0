{"text":"4 stars Hi we just arrived this morning from Punta Cana , this hotel is a 4 star at it's best . The rooms feel smaller with it divided into a sitting room and bedroom. One of our party had a room in A section that was a regular hotel room with 2 double beds and it felt larger . We had a chance to try 4 a la carte restaurants. For me the Steak house had the best food .We had steak and spare ribs .The Jade was realy fun with the chef cooking in front of you . Here we had chicken , beef , rice , vegetables and shrimps. The Mexican was ok but we didn't know the know what to order and the had a hard time explaining them to us. Our worst was the Italian . The beach is great , nice sand and waves to play in . They do need to put more huts on the beach . This was our 8th trip down south and I had never seen so many people arguing over saving chairs . It was realy bad , they would put a string around the leg of a chair and say that it was their chairs. Others tied chairs together with bandanas .And some others would leave empty bottle of sunblock and water toys on chairs all night . The staff never moved any thing off the chairs as they would rearrange them at 6 pm. This was the worst we had ever seen . And it put a sour tast in our mouths for this resort. The staff is realy nice and they all work realy hard .
