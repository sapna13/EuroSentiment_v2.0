{"text":"Lovely and spacious suites.. Location:Located out of downtown Los Angeles in an area called Silverlake. This is a very Mexican style community and no staff around appeared to be American. The area was OK, shops were a good 15 mins walk. I recommend the 99 cents store to stock your fridge up!Check In:A reasonable check in experience. The lobby is nice and has a pretty fish tank on display.Hotel:The hotel itself is very good. The suite we had was very spacious so we had a lot of room even with our cases laid out on the floor. Bathroom was good. We had free wifi, fridge, microwave, coffee maker, HBO, free breakfast.. (Bagels, cereals, waffles, fruit, juice, coffee, toast etc...) all very good for the $114 a night rate we picked up.Staff:The guy who checked us in was a nice guy, however I was disappointed when I checked out as the lady serving me wasn't paying any attention to me at all. She was on the phone dealing with another customer and trying to serve me at the same time. Also she was speaking in Mexican the whole time to her collegue so I had to keep repeating myself to her as she wasn't listening and couldn't hear me over her speech. She was very rude in my opinion. Kind of the only real downer to the whole hotel experience, but I left disappointed due to this poor customer service\/acknowledgment.Overall:This is a very well priced hotel. You receive a great spacious room with all major amenties you require. The location is a bit of a let down and the area is rough, but you can commute fairly easy downtown, Hollywood or Santa Monica. I would recommend this to anyone looking for cheap LA accommodation.
