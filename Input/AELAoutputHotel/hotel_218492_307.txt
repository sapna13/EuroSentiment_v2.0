{"text":"Globalia, Beautiful place with bad food and drink My husband and I went to the (Globalia) Grand Oasis Resort from 5\/16\/07-5\/20\/07. Upon arrival to the airport, you are expected to pay $10.00 (US Dollars) per person for a photo that is supposed to be some kind of country entrance ID. They tell you you can have it when you leave the country. What they don't tell you is that you have to pay another $8.00(US Dollars) for it! The Globalia itself was a very beautiful resort. We stayed in new building 7. It was very comfortable and clean. The beach and pools were great! If you want an umbrella at the pools or the beach, get one in the early morning . The resort employees are all very nice and work very hard to make you happy. We tipped even though it wasn't expected. This is a very poor country. They all speak English fairly well, so no worries if you do not speak Spanish. There seemed to be a black out with no power or hot water every afternoon for about an hour. It really wasn't a big deal. It became funny after a while. When the power finally comes back on, cheers are heard from all over the resort. I will say the the food and drink is terrible. Edible, but terrible. We just kept in mind that we were in a different country! Breakfast is okay. We never got sick or had any problems. We used bottled water for everything. We went on a day trip to Santo Domingo through Amstar\/Apple Vacations. It was great. Angel, our tour guide was wonderful. It is about a 3 1\/2 hour drive each way. If you have any kind of driving fears, it may not be for you. The trip was one wild ride! Probably the scariest drives I have ever been on! There are no real rules to the roads or driving. They all drive like maniacs! Dominicans are true professionals in defensive driving. It's a constant game of chicken with other cars and drivers turning small 2 lane roads into 3. It's very scary! On our trip, there were a lot of screams from fearful passengers on our tour bus! Nobody wears seat belts, and you will see a lot of motorcycles. It 's their form of a taxi. No helmets. No protection. I even saw a newborn baby on the back of one in the arms of their mother. It was a scary sight. For them, its a way of life. If you are grossed out in any way with meat, be prepared. The city streets have freshly killed meats hanging with the heads still attached. I guess they are killed in the morning. It's a frightful sight. We were told they hang there all day until 7:00pm. Yes... they hang there all day. Out in the open heat and air. Kind of gross. Its a real shock. I did not eat any meat while in the Dominican.
