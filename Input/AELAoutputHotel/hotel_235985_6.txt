{"text":"Great hotel with helpful staff The staff at this hotel treated us very nicely! We arrived by train early morning (6:30am) and obv our room was not available for us. We were so tired that we just sat on the sofa in the lobby waiting for our room. The first room that became available was at 8am and the staff were really quick to prepare it for us. It was of decent size, large bed, and extremely clean. We were very happy. We stayed in florence for 2 nightsThe location of the hotel is very good - about a 4 minute walk from the train station. Florence is meant to be on your feet so you can walk to any of the tourist sights or restaurants from the hotel. The staff was also helpful in recommending good places to eat. Breakfast at the hotel had a variety of choices and was very good. We spent approximately 75euros\/night and found it well worth it!We only had two full days in florence and the second day we took a tour of tuscany with a company called best of tuscany tours - it cost 80euros a person and was well worth it! We went to Siena  San Gimignano  Pisa. We stopped at this tuscan farm for lunch and it was one of the best authentic meals we had - great wine as well! The guides were all very friendly and informative and i felt we had adequate time in each location. Overall, the tour was 12 hours long and I would definitely recommend it. We were able to see a lot more in a shorter period of time and was quite happy with our stay overall in florence. ","annotations":[]}
