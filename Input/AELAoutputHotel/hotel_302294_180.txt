{"text":"Very comfortable hotel in convenient location I would happily return to teh Pan Pacific any time. In fact, we tried to work out whether we'll afford to live there instead of paying two mortgages back home. It was sooo comfortable. Arrived late am from an overnight train journey looking a bit ruffled. We were offered a room there and then, although not our choice, and decided to wait for a double and asked for a place to change. Amazingly, we were then whisked to a day room where we could shower and change, and upon or return alter, out luggage had been taken to our room. On the fire-escape plan I could see it was the smallest room on the floor, but is was also a corner room with a good view and zero noise, and still spacious. I agree with one of the previous posters that the decor is a bit dated, but the rooms have been nicely updated with more contemporary fabric, ultra-comfy Aeron work chairs and stylish desk lamps. Yes, the atrium with its fake plants screams 1980's yuppie abode, I am not sure about the quaint artwork in the communal areas and above our bed, and I would have loved to rip out the crumpled old rubber shower curtain that was like an ugly pimple in our otherwise sumptuous marble bathroom. We also ate at the Chinese restaurant and visited the pool many times. The Chinese restaurant is on the 37th floor and while the decor is really bland and the floor doesn't revolved and the windows are misted up so you cannot see out very well the food here is phantastic. Singapore is generally a good place to eat, and food is plentiful and cheap in many food centres, but this was many notches up and justified the comparably high price. The pool area was nice, shape of the pool a little naff, not good for laps, but clean water and not too chlorinated. There were harldy ever any other people in the pool so I feel its size is adequate even for a large hotel like this. I kept looking out for the Marina MRT station which is already printed in my 2003 LP guide, but unfortunately its still a 15 min walk through airconditioned malls to the nearest MRT at City Hall. Also, if travelling on leisure, it may be better to have a lie-in, as many shops and the excellent Marina Food loft open only at 10am.
