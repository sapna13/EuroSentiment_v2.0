{"text":"Wonderful! We had a wonderful stay at the Bale and stayed in a single pavillion (number 8) for 5 nights. Our room was very spacious and airy - the design is very sleek and minimalist but it is still very comfortable\/simple and not at all like at all like those ultra-modern design hotels where you can never find the light switch! The bathroom was big and very nicely designed, complete with indoor and outdoor showers. We loved the steps down into our pool from the sliding bathroom doors. The private pool was lovely and it is a decent size as private pools go and there is plenty of private outdoor space. The single pavillions do not have sun loungers but there are deckchairs and there is also a double daybed outside for relaxing (but it has a roof over it so you can't use it for sunbathing). Our garden\/pool got the sun for most of the day (until about 4pm) but the downside was that we were quite near the main road - there is a constant stream of traffic which means it is not very relaxing or condusive to mid-afternoon snoozing! At the main pool, we couldn't hear the traffic so it is probably worth asking for a room that is higher up in the complex. The main pool is a good size for swimming (about 20 metres) and it never feels crowded as most people seem to stay in their pavillions during the day or go to the beach club. The Bale's private beach club is very nice with loungers and umbrellas and attendants to bring you towels\/drinks etc. - the hotel will drive you down and it only takes about 5 minutes to get there. The beach is not very wide but it has lovely yellow sand and the water is clear and turquoise (much nicer than the beaches at Kuta\/Seminyak). There is some seaweed washed up on the beach but The Bale clear it away from their section of sand! The Bale's spa is really nice and most of the treatment rooms have big jacuzzis for private use after treatments. The treatments are fairly expensive by Balineese standards (about $60 for a 1 hour massage plus 21% tax\/service) but the therapists were very good. We had breakfast in our pavillion every morning (at no charge which is a nice touch) and the food was great - there is a good selection and plenty of different things to try over the course of a few days. The staff are very pleasant and are happy to arrange anything on your behalf. The hotel offers free transfers to any restaurant in Tanjung\/Nusa Dua and Jimbaran, which is a great service and we used this every night - we found Bumbu in Tanjung to be one of the better places nearby. They have great Indonesian food and a decent wine list in terms of both selection and prices (rare in Bali). We were disappointed by PJs at the Four Seasons in Jimbaran - beautiful setting on the beach but the food is not exceptional and the wine list is extortionate (for imported wines, prices start at around $80). It is definitely worth going to the Amanusa hotel (next door to The Bale) for a sunset drink as the setting is really beautiful.
