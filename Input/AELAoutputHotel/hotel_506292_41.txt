{"text":"Enjoyed the Uma It was our first trip to Bali and an unforgettable one. Our stay at Uma Ubud contributed to the wonderful experience. We were greeted by Uma staff at the terminal who personally escorted us to the awaiting car. Thereafter, we were introduced to driver, offered cold towels, drinks and were on our way to Uma! We arrived in Bali late so it was about 1130pm by the time we arrived it the resort. Knowing that we were tired, reception staff checked us in efficiently, and walked us to our Garden Suite. Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?Looked a little old and tired but we liked the landscaped pond as we walked through the door to our Garden Suite. The frogs croaked rather loudly at night which we found rather charming. The bedroom area is air-conditioned, but the bathroom area is open-air so be prepared to be up close and personal to ants, spiders, etc. These bugs are generally harmless, I was bitten by a few (as I normally do and as one would expect being in Asia) but my husband however got away without a single bite! Food was very lovely √à√\u2020\u2022?fresh, full of local and Asian flavours and utterly delicious. A healthy menu, designed for sister hotel Como Shambala, is also available. We did not have a single bad meal at all during our entire stay. The guided morning walk, around the nearby padi fields and local villages, is not to be missed. On the whole, we found the Ubud Discovery package good value for money. Though the hotel only has a 4* rating, the service for us was top notch - it was warm, efficient, attentive but unobtrusive. The hotel is serene, tranquil and it was a good escape from our hectic city corporate lives. ","annotations":[]}
