{"text":"very disappointed We have just returned from our second visit to this hotel. We were there same time last year and though we both suffered 'dodgy' tummies then, you kinda expect that. We have travelled far and wide and are EXTREMELY careful about what we eat and drink. My toothbrush never touched any water from the tap - it was all done from the bottled stuff.The hotel is fantastic.....clean, beautifully kept, the beach is to die for. However....the comments written by others re the smokers are true. I am extremely anti smoking and it was difficult to get away from it. The dress code was not really adhered to either in the evenings. We figured that if the staff are going to the trouble to lay a nice table and prepare your food you could at least make an effort and get out of those shorts and flip flops!. It seemed that BBCs were the dress of the day at breakfast....mmm.. sorry - not at a 5* place.We ate in the French restaurant on our 6th night and I was violently ill all day the next day. I went to hospital for blood tests (as per the advice of the hotel doctor) and got kept in for 4 days on various IV drips. On my return to the hotel I was too weak to do anything but customer services were great and arranged 'plain' food for me every night. We missed most of our A la Carte meals as I was so sick. Back home now and waiting for the hotel to get back to me after writing them an e mail. Am off work till at least 9\/7 as I am so weak. If you have booked - please take care what you eat and try to boost your immune system before you get there. Take extra care with youngsters both in the sun\/heat and the food!
