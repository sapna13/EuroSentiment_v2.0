{"text":"Great deal at central location, but soundproffing could be better We stayed two nights in a family quadruple room. We arrived early (1 pm), but the front desk was able to take care of our bags while we returned the rental car and had a caf√ã√\u2022√ñ break. When we came back round 2:30 pm, the room was ready, and the bags were already in the room. Checkout was accordingly efficient and accurate, including a reserved taxi to take us to the airport.The hotel is quite recently renovated, although by lining the old rooms with new flooring, furniture etc. Unfortunately, the windows and doors have not been replaced (see below)Positive notes:* Large  spacious room, modern, with comfortable beds. Main beds were ca 100 cm wide each, the additional beds slightly narrower.* Non-smoking floors* Bathroom with tub (with shower), all surfaces in stone and glass, implying clean and maintainable conditions.* Exceptional breakfast. One of the best buffets I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe had in southern Europe. Definitively a bargain the additional √à√\u2020√ü?0 per person.* Complimentary bottle of wine upon arrival (I think, the attached card was not explicit on that). No wine opener though, but since my wife do not care much for red wine anyhow, I did not ask for one.Some issues, although minor:* The windows and doors are rather old, with no soundproofing at all. We were woken up both nights by neighboring guests knocking on their own doors to get in. They were not making much noise, but it definitively sounded like they where knocking on our door. Everything said in the hallway is clearly audible in the room, and vice versa. No sound leakage between rooms though. We had a room at the end of the corridor, so not much of an issue for us, but I fear that rooms closer to the elevators might be severely impacted.* Internet connection is provided for free behind the bar at the ground floor. But the line speed was horribly slow. I measured less than 10 kbit\/s. Even browsing from my cell phone was much quicker.* The bathroom door is tiny, around 180x50 cm. Like my son said: √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨veryone would not be able to get in here√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?.√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>* The bathroom is too small to hold the sink, placing it in-room instead. This would work out fine; if it was not for that the sink in our room was mounted incorrectly, with the drain tube going _upwards_ from below the sink and into the main soil. The result was half an hour of water dripping back into the water trap after each usage, a bit annoying at night. The quick fix was to plug the drain with a towel to muffle the sound. This was probably a specific problem for the room we had (#419). I forgot to mention this at checkout, but management is apparently monitoring this board, and can take corrective action. This would require a plumber, something that anyhow could not have been fixed during our weekend stay. ","annotations":[]}
