{"text":"A home from home in NYC Try to imagine a hotel that is slap bang in the middle of the worlds busiest intersection with the worlds biggest digital screens displaying adverts, news and information 24\/7. On your doorstep the worlds biggest and best department stores, restaurants, bars, sports arenas and theatres serving up the best that the world can offer.Now imagine you are in your dressing gown and slippers sipping cappucino coffee, munching on cookies and watching TV at 3 o'clock in the morning in cosy quiet surroundings. It would be fair to assume you are in a completely different place hundreds of miles away wouldn't it? Well as strange as it may sound, you are in the same place and you can have your cake and eat it in the Casablanca Hotel on Times Square New York.A true haven away from the hustle and bustle of the city and when you close the doors to the hotel returning from a busy day you think you are somewhere else.We stayed there 21st - 29th December and I cannot commend the place enough. I don't need to add much to other peoples reviews other than the guys and gals who work there are real gems. Jeffery, Mike, Vinny, the doorman with the ponytail, Laura and all the rest go out of their way to make your stay memorable.You have so many hotels to choose from when you go to New York but I doubt you would find the same level of personal attention and value for money elsewhere. Our Christmas stay there was just the best.
