{"text":"My first experience in the Dominican I've been to all-inclusives before and I've had a mixture of experiences everytime. This is the first time I have been motivated to write about my experiences at a resort. Ten of us stayed here Nov 10 to 17th. It was my first time in the Dominican. In general I was warned before going to the Dominican Republic, not to leave the resort grounds unless going on an organized excursion that costs money. This is because the Dominican is not as safe as other countries when wandering off the grounds. Several people I know have been mugged or know people who have been mugged while off the resort grounds. I didn't think that would be a big deal as we really just wanted to enjoy the resort and the beach and hopefully get some culture while on the property. I was wrong. We were stuck with whatever the entertainment staff had for shows as a sample of the culture. The shows were all rip offs of what american television had to offer. Grease show rip off, West Side Story rip off. I've never been so bored. They hold a beach party on Monday's and Thursdays which was not that much of a party. It was composed of ridiculous games that were not funny to watch or to participate in. The animation staff (entertainers) were quite forceful when it came time to pull people out of the audience for these ludicrous games. One very important point I noticed was that this resort had very many europeans staying there. Many of these europeans had tattoos. My wife and I also have tattoos but we are visible minorities. I really don't think some of the staff at this resort are used to seeing visible minorites at their resort. They seemed too proud to serve us and they were really not friendly. They also kept making references to gangs and guns as though the only way colored people could afford their resort would be by some kind of illegal activity.We made it a point to tip those who were sincere with their service efforts. Another interesting observation was the staff members who had a problem serving us broke their backs sucking up to tourists from Spain. Can you say the masters have returned? Again I can't stress enough that this attitude did not come from all the staff but from enough of them to make me write about it.At all other resorts I've stayed, the staff has made some attempts to learn some level of english which I always appreciate as I make a sincere attempt to learn their language to narrow the langauge barrier. Not at this resort. They didn't even seem to appreciate that we were trying to speak spanish. They almost seemed annoyed like we shouldn't be speaking it. The layout of this resort is amazing with walkways surrounded by water everywhere. The only problem with this is that stagnant water and humid weather is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. They have water fountains to stem this problem and to circulate the water but unfortunately the fountains were never turned on soon enough into the day to stop mosquito eggs from hatching. Everyone was bit numerous times. The buffet was so-so (stay away from the chicken, it may still be bleeding). Too many flies and the floors flooded when it rained, and I mean flooded! The Casino was a rip-off. Some of us played Blackjack and the dealer kept busting us even when we called stay on our hands. It was a total scam. On a positive note, the grounds were gorgeous. The rooms were adequate and the hammocks are a nice touch. The beach is clean and spacious. Never had a problem finding chairs. Pool is designed elegantly. There are many trees on the grounds for shade so walking the expansive grounds was not difficult, even in mid-day heat. Japanese restaurant food was great. The Mexican restaurant food was very good as well.To sum up, my problem with the Dominican is that it's far better off economically than say Cuba and this is apparent at the airport with air conditioning, Wendy's restaurant, Baskin Robins Ice cream. But, I would give up all these creature comforts for some basic courtesy. I guess this country is still fairly new to the tourist game. They may not be aware of the vast number of cultures that love to travel. It will only be a matter of time before they realize that people who like to travel come in every shape, size, and color! For now, go to Cuba. You won't be disappointed.
