{"text":"Loved it We had a a great stay!! After reading some of the reviews I was a little worried. We booked the Coqui water park package. It was a great deal. Sure the park is small, but wonderful for people with smaller kids (ours are 6 and 9). Both of my kids could go down the slides by themselves (at its deepest it was 3' 6). We loved the breakfast. The longest we waited for a table was about 15 minutes. The line for the omelets was long about 15 to 20 minutes. We arrived to the hotel at about 7:30 am. We were concerned that they would make us wait until 4:00 to check in. They actually checked us in when we arrived and upgraded us to the Marina (at no charge). Everyone was extremely nice and helpful. We were a little disappointed in Palomino Island (the private beach). The ferry ride out was lovely, but the water was quite rocky on the bottom or covered in sea grass. My kids did not like to be in the water. It was a lovely view. We spent our days at Seven Seas beach which was about 5 minutes from the resort. We rented a car at the hotel for 5 days at the Enterprise. We opted for the insurance and it cost us a total of $289 for the week (w\/o insurance it would have been $189). Because food was so expensive, it was cheaper to rent a car and eat off of the resort. We also bought sandwich meat, bread, sodas and other things and ate in the room or set a blanket out in the grass and enjoyed the beautiful view. There is a small refrigerator in the room. The funnicular was nice in the beginning, but we got tired of waiting to get on it every day. Plan on walking a lot!!! I wore a pedometer and the walk from our hotel room to the parking lot was about 1400+ steps. The people on the island are very laid back so if you expect to get quick service you will be disappointed. Whenever we had a problem it was taken care of. We would definitely stay here again!!!
