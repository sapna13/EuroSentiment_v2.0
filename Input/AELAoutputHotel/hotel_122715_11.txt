{"text":"Great Weekend Getaway!! We booked the Omni Dallas Park West for a short weekend getaway. We had never stayed at the Omni before, but gave it a shot after reading the reviews and I will say it was very, very well worth it!1 day prior to our visit, I received an email inviting me to check in online which I did. Upon arrival, our keys were waiting at the front desk in the express check-in area.Upon arriving in the room, they had milk and cookies for our 2 children and Omni Backpacks with several goodies. The room had 2 queen beds which were very comfortable. There was also a large flat screen in the room with soothing music on and the view from the 9th floor was spectacular! The Omni had a heated outdoor pool which was spotless and not very busy. There were ample chairs, towels, and also a few kids toys. They also had a small spa with a sauna, whirlpool, and shower\/dressing area which was out of this world. The hotel itself was beautiful and very well kept. There was plenty of free self parking. They had free wi-fi if you are a member of their Guest Select program which is free to join.The staff was very friendly. They always made a point to say hi even when walking by the front desk. There is a beautiful large lake just to the south of the hotel which has a trail that you can walk around.I will definitely be back to the Omni Dallas Park West next time I am in the area. This property is a 5 star in my book. Great stay and looking forward to the next!
