{"text":"Unbelievable value for money - Stay at this hotel! This hotel is amazing. It is in the best location in San Francisco - right by Union Square, a stone's throw away from the Bart, tram, and bus stations - absolutely perfect for seeing San Francisco, shopping and eating.I stayed in twin room (American-speak for a single room) which was quite small, but perfectly clean and newly refurbished. The bathroom was enormous and spotlessly clean. There was a flatscreen TV with DVD player, broadband internet access, an iron and ironing board and coffee percolator. Unfortunately, there wasn't a minibar - but I made do by keeping things in the icebucket filled with ice from the machine on the 4th floor! This was one of the budget rooms - the pricier ones (from peeking in during cleaning time) were much larger, more luxurious and had minibars.Breakfast was the worst aspect. Food was provided in a small room on the top floor, and there was nowhere to sit so you had to either eat standing up or take your breakfast back to your room. There was tea, coffee, juice and weird bakery items consisting of toast, muffins and croissants but it all tasted a bit like plastic to me. However, there were plenty of breakfast options in the street so perhaps that's usual for American hotels.The staff were exceptionally friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.Excuse the plug, but just by this hotel were two great restaurants - Kulitos and the Daily Grill. Really classy food for not very much money.Stay at this hotel! You'll be amazed at the price (contact them direct). Really really good.
