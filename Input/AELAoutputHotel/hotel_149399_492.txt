{"text":"Fantastic we approached our vacation at the melia caribe tropical with some misgivings. we had booked because friends were going to be there. then we read the reviews in trip advisor and saw that about 25% of the people hated it with complaints ranging from surly help to bad food and even getting sick.we couldn't have been happier with the hotel and its staff. the food was restaurant quality (not le cirque or david bouley, but at least as good as your neighborhood restaurant). we live in new york and dine in manhattan frequently. this food was good! we had no trouble with reservations since we were in the royal service. i definitely recommend spending the extra money to get the royal service. your butler makes the reservations for you and the private beach is not crowded and there is always a chaise and a palapa to go under. the private pool always has lounges available and the snack shack next to the private pool has food cooking all day.the waiters on the beach can't do enough for you and never pass your chaise without inquiring if you would like something. these are poor poeople and are grateful for everything and anything you can give them. i tipped $10\/day to the guys at the beach, $5\/day for the maid and a few $ to the waiters for each meal. the service was worth every dollar.the place is absolutely gorgeous, the landscaping is magnificent, and the rooms are wonderful. there were some complaints that the rooms were musty and had an odor but we never had that problem.the only problem was that the washing machine in the room didn't have a dryer so we had to dry our clothes on the patio. it's been a long time since i put on hard, sun-dried clothes. lol. the royal service rooms are also larger.there was no pressure to go on a time share pitch. we fell in love with the nicest beach i have seen in many years and actually bought a time-share with no pressure. we can't wait to go back. we have traveled extensively around the caribbean and felt this was the place to buy into.if you want any information about this wonderful vacation spot, contact me directly.
