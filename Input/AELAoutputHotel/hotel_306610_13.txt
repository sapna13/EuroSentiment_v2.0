{"text":"Runs like a Swiss watch I had a 10 day stay at the Grand Hyatt in May and early June 2008. Usually with long stays, any little cracks in the service start to show after a few days, but the staff here are very impressive and maintained a terrific standard of service throughout. The place is not cheap, and rooms are Tokyo sized i.e. not that big, but well appointed. The shower was excellent, and they had excellent bedside reading lights (something which so many hotels screw up). We had access to the Club Level, which is well worth doing. You get free nibbles at breakfast, lunch and early evening, and unlimited drinks. It is a good view from the 10th floor, and a glass of champagne while looking out is a nice way to start your evening.The gym is excellent, the swimming pool pretty but charged for extra for (an odd notion, it seems to me). The concierge staff were superb, doing a huge amount of work for us in a highly efficient manner. The Swiss general manger actually wanders about the place talking to guests rather than hiding away in his office as so often happens in large hotels. The location in the Roppongi Hills complex is excellent, as a subway stop is effectively in the basement that is just four stops to the Ginza, and you have all the shops, bars and restaurants of the complex at your disposal. We saw an exhibit at the Mori Tower art Gallery, for example, that consisted of every Turner Prize winner, something I would struggle to see n London.I have travelled widely, and I would rank this in the best three hotels I have stayed at anywhere in the world.
