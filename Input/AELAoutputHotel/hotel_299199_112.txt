{"text":"Incompetent The hotel is nice and the staff are very friendly, but there were 3 mistakes made with my trip. I had Mr. Jo on my booking form - even though they could see I was a married lady, and my passport had Joan on it - they did not change it. I was given a smoking room when I had booked a non smoking and I was not warned at check in that they were full. The club floor was good and breakfast was very nice. I returned to my room on the last evening to discover that a letter had been left in. I had hoped it was to address my complaints about the smoking room and the error with my name.No it was a fax relating to a tender that some other guest in the hotel had asked to be sent. I hand it in to the club loung and the staff did not apologise for their mistake in leaving sensitive information in the wrong guest room. They just said Oh thank youMy colleague who was also at the hotel encountered errors with her name - although her booking was in her name - they changed the name to her boyfriends name and started to refer to her as her boyfriends sirname and Mrs too.Two men also arrived at her room mid afternoon 2 days before she was due to check out asking why she had not vacated her room! The hotel will need to tighten up on these things it does not create a good image.
