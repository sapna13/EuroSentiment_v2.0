{"text":"Kids  Travelled with Sunwing to Punta Cana. Great charter. Half decent food served on the plane. Liked it better than Air Canada. We travelled from Dec. 7-22\/07.Arrival was fine. BEWARE- we got charged $20 upon entry into Punta Cana by a customs officer. We knew we were getting taken by the customs person but what can you do? Do NOT pay $20 to enter the Dominican. The ride to the hotel was fine. A nice air-conditioned bus with seatbelts and curtains to close if you wanted to nap. It was about a 30 or 40 mins. ride to the Gran Bahia. Once you arrived you were greeted with a fruit punch and escorted off the bus. We arrived about 3 hours prior to check-in and our room was not ready but that was OK as we and our two children (aged 7  3) walked around the complex to see what was there. It was warm  hot and the kids only wanted to go into a pool.Our room was ready by 3;30pm and we were promptly taken to it in the little bell-hop tram. We stayed in villa 34 with two double beds. I must say the double beds were extremely hard and we asked for a different room the next day. We were moved to a room with a king size bed instead in villa 6. The boys slept on the couch  it all worked out fine.The rooms were always clean and made up while we were at the pool\/beach. We were very impressed with how clean everyting was. The restaurants were clean and we never noticed any smell that some people refer to. My husband can smell something nasty a mile away and he never said anything about a moldy smell in the resort or rour hotel oom.Buffet was half decent and the a la carte restaurants were fine. Our favourites were the Garden Grill, and the two French restaurants by the lobby.The entertainment at night was great. The Michael Jackson show was quite impressive. Our kids were in the mini-club and were on stage for the Lion King show. The animation team did a great job of working with our 7  4 year old and they had great make-up  costumes for the show too.As for pool chairs, my husband went out around 8:30am or 9:00am to hold our two favourite chairs and we were usually there by 10:00am to sit by the pool. We never saw people running for chairs and saw empty chairs around the main pool even at 11am and 12pm. We couldn't figure out what people were getting so upset about pool chairs. There were always some around us that were empty all day long. We sat at the far end of the pool where the kids pool was and we never had issues. Nor did we have issues with chairs on the beach. We could always find one or two to sit on while the kids played in the ocean.Our children loved the mini club. They begged us to let them go every day and we had to beg them to stay with us for some family time too. The kids they met were great. I would highly recommend this hotel to anybody and even my children said they would tell people to come here. They especially loved going on the tram. I don't think there is anything bad we could say about this hotel. All staff of this hotel, including the grounds keepers, were friendly, courteous and nice. A simple hola made people smile and respond positively. If you can take a few Spanish words with you they appreciate it very much.The Animation Team did a great job and if you didn't want to be bother a simple, no, gracias, would send them off to somebody else.The staff at the Front Desk or Guest Services were always happy to make sure we were happy if we had any issues, Tipping at the buffet and bars are recommended. Not that anybody expects to be tipped but it is always nice. Our bartenders by the kids pool section was always willing to get our orders right away even for $2 or $3 each day. I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anybody and we are already looking at going back again next year.
