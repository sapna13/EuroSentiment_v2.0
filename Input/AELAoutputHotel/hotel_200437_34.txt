{"text":"Perfect accomodation for the Berlin Marathon Hi my wife and I booked this hotel as I was running in the Berlin Marathon. The location was excellent close to the shops and nightlife in the Ku Damm area but situated in a quiet side street. This meant we could have a quiet meal and drinks outside the hotel at the chairs and tables provided during the warm September evenings we experienced.The hotel had a pasta party for marathon runners and their friends the night before the race. On the morning of the race the hotel opened their restaurant for breakfast early from 6am to facilitate marathon runners. This was well appreciated although I was not able to make full use of the excellent fare on offer as I had to run 26.2 miles a short time later. I did make up for this on the following two mornings sampling both the cold and hot breakfasts together with the wide selection of breads and pastries. A friend of mine stayed at the Intercontinental and their restaurant did not oblige with an early opening and he had to grab two bananas for breakfast at the first water\/food station on the marathon route.I found the hotel facilities to be first class although i did not experience the pool or sauna, maybe next time. One small detail missing was the absence of a tea\/coffee maker in our room which would have provided a welcoming cup of coffee first thing in the morning.The hotel staff were very polite and helpful. The reception staff handled the mailing of a letter and also forwarded on a camera case that I had inadvertantly left behind in my room.My thanks is also directed to the housemaid who recovered the case from the bottom of a wardrobe. A previous reviewer complained about the maid's haste in trying to clean their rooms. I did not find this to be a problem although the maid called I simply requested that she return later. This was no problem, maybe I should have just put out a do not disturb sign until we were ready to have our room cleaned.An excellent hotel with a very convenient location to shops\/restaurants and transport. My wife and I are looking forward to our next vist to Berlin and the Steigenberger.
