{"text":"Good hotel with personal service Stayed 5 nights at this hotel. It is in a residential neighborhood with a few neighborhood pubs. Within walking distance to Green Tube Station, near Berkley Sq. Our room included a full English breakfast. Nice service in the diningroom. Food so-so. The buffet is included with limited fruit, cereal, and very few pasteries. But, when you sit down, you are served 4 slices of toast w\/jam on the side immediately. The room was small and crowded by American standards. There was a King bed with a fake heavy fur comfortor. We asked that it be removed for the week and they took it out immediately. There seems to be alot of furniture in such a small space. Tiny closet too. The bathroom was big, marble and very nice. The room and hotel are very clean! One night we asked for an extra pillow and returned to our room (with turn-down service) and each side had 4 large feather pillows! The linens are lovely.The people at the front desk where quick to greet you and we found all of them helpful. We asked Chris to check on some reservations we made on our own before leaving the U.S. He had no problem with our request. Seemed happy to do it. They were helpful with directions. London is just very expensive right now for Americans. We loved it and would go back if the $ ever gets stronger. All and all this is a very comfortable hotel. It is not a luxury hotel but felt very homey and safe there.
