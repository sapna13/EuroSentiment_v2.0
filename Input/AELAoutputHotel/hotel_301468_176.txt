{"text":"Indulgent and Relaxing stay at the Mandarin I met my husband for a stay in a City View, Club Level Room at the Oriental, and it was absolutely the right place for us to stay. The whole hotel environment is one that feels utterly serene and indulgent. The room was well appointed and I appreciated the little touches the housekeeping services added each day.The hotel is located an easy 10 minute walk to the City Hall subway station, and it is possible to do almost the whole walk indoors through various malls if Singapore is having one of its torrential downpours.. Getting cabs was super convenient, and the workers hailing the cabs were so nice and actually funny!The Club perks were worth every penny- free internet in the lounge, extra help with concierge services, champagne breakfast, non-alc drinks all day, and evening cocktail and hors d'oeuvre hour. The breakfast was a nice blend of waitress service and buffet. I loved having a mimosa in the morning! The best thing was that the cocktail hour food was amazing and changed significantly each day. At both main services they had a wonderful selection of very fine cheeses. The afternoon tea had a nice array of nibbles, too. They seemed to be a bit slow in the service in the lounge, but most of the time i think it was cultural and not wanting to intrude or to seem pushy...I loved the amenities in the room especially the nice sound system and the soothing Chinese Tea when we arrived. The bathroom was beautiful, though I do wish the tub and the shower had been a bit bigger. Each were fine only for one person really.As far as some of the otehr aspects of the hotel: We had a couple's massage in the spa's couple's suite and the service there was impeccable. The massage was one of the best each of us has had. The food from room service was surprisingly good, as was the food at Melt. We didn't try the other restaurants though we heard good things about the Japanese restaurant and the Mediterranean restaurant from friends staying at the same time as us. I sat out by the pool, but I didn't get in because the one day i had time I felt it was too cool to get wet and there is no hot tub. Overall, we really loved our stay at the Oriental, and we would go back in a heartbeat, particularly for the reasonable prices we had for the club (about $300 US after taxes\/service fee).
