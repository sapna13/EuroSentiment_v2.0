{"text":"Small Little Gem Booked this hotel, upon seeing some of the reviews on tripadvisor. This hotel is in the perfect location for to visit the city, smack bang in the middle and prime location to visit all the attractions and walk around the city. The metro is literally a one minute walk the second you step outside the doors. The location was the main reason for booking this hotel. Now, the hotel itself... The hotel was great, really loved it, we knew before we went there that the rooms were small and they really are, but that never put us off as they are very nice, kept really clean and have air conditioning (which is a must to survive). They have a free safety deposit box which is always a helpful thing, wardrobes are a fine size, bed comfortable, tv in the room, minibar and the bathroom is a good size with plenty of space and a hairdryer there too. The hotel staff were really great and very friendly and have good English. The hotel has a 9th floor terrace bar which is great really loved it, has a great view of the city and do a good mojito, the bar staff are always there to let you sit and relax and do a quick run around to see if anyone wants drinks every so often. I would recommend getting the breakfast included as there wouldn't really be a place around for breakfast in the morning and the breakfasts are a nice continental mixture.
