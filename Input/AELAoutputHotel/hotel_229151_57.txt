{"text":"Tiny Shabby Room I have been to Amsterdam a dozen times in the last 10 years and stayed at a different hotel each time because I've never had a good hotel experience in Amsterdam: tiny rooms and tinier bathrooms, high prices and staff that range from cooly efficient to condescending insolence. So when I read the glowing reviews of the Estherea, I had hope - unfortunately unfounded. I was assigned the smallest room in the hotel although my rate was the normal one for a double room (well over $300US\/night). It was so small, that when I took the large decorative pillows off the bed the only place to put them was on the floor and that left maybe 5 narrow feet to walk around the bed that was wedged in an alcove. The room could best be described as shabby, carpet that hadn't been changed in 20 years (an issue because you had to get on your hands and knees to get to the room safe in the bottom of the cupboard - not a closet). There were holes in the walls left unfilled, 80's style metallic wall paper and beat up cheaply made furniture. It did have a view on the canal, but that just meant it was noisy - I could hear a couple talking at normal voice through the walls too. I asked to move and of course they were full. The staff was reasonably friendly but not helpful. The only good points were the neighborhood and the breakfast. The lobby was rather grand, but in the flower capital of the world it was odd to see so many fake, glittery flower arrangements and I never spent time in the lobby anyway. So still searching for a decent reasonably priced hotel in Amsterdam. ","annotations":[]}
