{"text":"Very nice hotel, few quirks Antiche Figure has been reviewed many, many times so Ill try not to repeat what has already been said and focus on key points (good  bad)Good: LOCATION!!! Venice is a labyrinth, which is beyond obvious. (Quick tip: I used a compass way more then a map!) Finding your hotel is one aggravation that you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to deal with. Seeing this hotel is located right across the Canal from the train station all you have to look for is yellow signs that say FERROVIA....in English it means...Hey, your hotel is thatta way! This is a huge advantage. Plus, your right near a valperreto stop and a gondola hut. Stated many times but worth repeating...customer service. Very attentive, kind, and speak English very well.Overall appearance of the hotel is very nice. Everything is well maintained and very clean.Bad: hate to point these out...The church located right next door is going through a renovation. I am aware this is not their fault but still a little bit of an eye sore. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know how long this will take to complete but it appears might be awhile.Pillows are pretty bad...thin as a Kit-Kat and piling on top of each other makes it worse. For someone who loves the big fluffy pillows, this can be frustrating.Grand Canal....I really don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see the advantage of having a canal room. You have some nice views but honestly it can be a tad noisy and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not exactly private. I would have preferred a hotel with a lagoon view but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just personal preference which leads to my final point.I requested a room on the highest floor possible almost 10 months in advance. We were put on the first floor, not exactly what I had in mind. Could they have been totally booked...possible but not probable.Overall I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure you will be very pleased if you choose this hotel. With such a high ranking I seriously doubt my 4 out of 5 will be that big of a deal in the big picture. Still I wanted to be honest about my stay. The location is a HUGE factor and pretty much trumps any other disappointments.
