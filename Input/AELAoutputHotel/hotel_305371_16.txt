{"text":"Great for a Business Stay Overview: The Conrad Hotel in Hong Kong offers a great location, very good physical facilities and outstanding service.Location: The Conrad is located in a tower above Pacific Place, an upscale shopping mall, with direct (air-conditioned) connections to the subway. It is located on floors 40 to 60, which means a lengthy elevator ride before reaching your floor. During the summer this can be quite warm and uncomfortable. Floors 58 to 60 are the 'executive level' with the Lounge on the 59th floor.Physical facilities: I have only stayed in rooms with a king bed. Once with a less inspiring view of buildings and the mountains and once with an inspiring view of Hong Kong harbor. The rooms are spacious with a very comfortable king bed (complete with a pillow menu), a dresser with a large flat screen TV (with a host of cable channels and pay-for-view movies), a nightstand, desk and chair. The closet is spacious, and lighted whenever the door is opened. A free, and large, safe is found in the closet.The room has many conveniences: a master light switch by the bed turns off most of the lights, a second turns on a muted night light and a third progressively lights two flood lights over the bed. A typically over-priced mini bar, but with a coffee maker and ample supplies, completes the room.The bathroom is mostly marble and quite large. Double sinks are complimented by a full-length mirror, a selection of upscale bath accessories and a convenient hair dryer. A large, deep tub and a separate shower provide bathing options. The commode is located in a quite cozy adjoining room. Towels are large, soft and numerous. A bathrobe and a sleeping robe are provided.A scale and a mechanical stair-stepper complete the bath equipment.Sometimes, the commode area has an unpleasant smell, which seems to come from the water.The 'gym' is located next to the Gardens Restaurant, and then down a spiraling staircase. The gym is small with six treadmills (ask for earphones when you come in, in order to listen to the flat panel individual TVs.) Other equipment includes a couple of bicycles, weight machines and assorted other equipment. The staff is friendly and efficient. I had a massage that was reasonably priced but fell short in technique.The swimming pool is small and somewhat inconvenient.The Executive Lounge is somewhat small and can become congested as guests access free internet there. (Internet access in the room costs about $11 per day). The view is fantastic. An adequate buffet breakfast (optionally you can take breakfast in the Garden Restaurant) is served (but it can become crowded), tea and sweets are served from 3 to 5, and drinks and light snacks from 5 to 7. The wooden furniture is attractive but somewhat heavy and ponderous.Service: Check in, at 7 in the morning, was prompt and my room was ready! Service in the Executive Lounge was always excellent. Food service is prompt and courteous. Attention to business needs (printing, copying, etc.) is handled without fuss and at a reasonable cost.I did not eat often in the hotel as I attended business meetings elsewhere. Two evening meals in the Garden Restaurant (once from the menu and once from the buffet) were forgettable, although it seemed very busy with local residents.
