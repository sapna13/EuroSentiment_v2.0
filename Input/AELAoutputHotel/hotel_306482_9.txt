{"text":"Great hotel at a great price I stayed at the Harbour View for 8 nights in May 2008, and all up I was very pleased. I'd searched long and hard for a reasonably priced hotel in a good location, and the Harbourview was certainly the best option.First up, the location is fantastic - it's right across the road from the Grand Hyatt, and about 100m from the waterfront. Terrific if you like jogging along the water. It was also only a short walk (~5 mins) into Kowloon, and a 5-10 minute cab ride to SoHo and Lan Kwai Fong - plus cabs are everywhere in HK. It's also a 2 minute walk from the Convention Centre, which is where I was attending a conference. There are a couple of good coffee shops across the main highway, about a 3-4 minute walk, which have free wifi and free computers.The staff were excellent, and always very attentive to needs. I was checked into the hotel promptly when I arrived, and with a few thigns I needed help on during my stay the ywere always ready and available. I stayed in a premier double room, and the room was quite large, with all the mod cons you'd want. The bathroom was clean and new. The only bad thing was the bed was absolutely rock solid, but housekeeping put a pillowtop on the mattress for me which helped quite a bit. The room was cleaned everyday, and I was never disturbed whilst in the room. I wasn't in a Harbour view room unfortunately, so the view was of an grey office block, but this isn't something that really bothered me.All up, the hotel was in an excellent location, and since it's about half the price of other hotels in the same location, I think it's an unbeatable deal.
