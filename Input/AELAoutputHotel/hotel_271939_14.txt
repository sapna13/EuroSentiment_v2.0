{"text":"Good location, but weak compared to alternatives in Paris I suspect most of the glowing reviews here are swayed by the excellent location, friendly staff and cleanliness, but do factor in the significant downsides before booking.Starting with the positive, the location is excellent, very near metro, and not too far from the RER line that serves both Gare du Nord and Charles de Gaulle. Also not too far from the river in the 5ieme, so near a few tourist venues and many good places to eat. The place is kept very clean and the desk staff are polite and friendly. Also free wifi and a laptop on the ground floor you can have a quick browse on.Unfortunately the bad points outweigh this on balance.Although clean, the room we were in was rather small with a tiny bathroom and the bed was very short - I'm 6'2 and my feet were sticking well over the edge. Bed was also not the most comfortable, with a distinct slope at both sides - it was like trying to sleep on a pitched roof. Another obstacle to sleep was the noise - although there was little disturbance from the street, the internal walls were very thin and we were woken a great many times by people in other rooms just doing normal stuff like flushing the loo, shutting doors and talking at a normal volume - this is one of the worst hotels I've ever stayed in for this problem.Another couple of negative points relate to food and drink - the breakfast is very expensive and downright poor. There are many places locally you can get a good quality breakfast and if you want to go uber cheap, 2 euros gets you a coffee and muffin at McD*n*lds (blasphemey in Paris, but still, 2 euros...) No minifridge in the room, or even a kettle for tea and coffee. You can get hot and cold drinks from reception, but apart from Espresso they are expensive and not that good. Don't even consider the breakfast and take a travel kettle plus instant coffee and tea if you want a drink. There are many local minimarts to pick up bottled water and snacks, plus a huge number of good places to eat.Price wise, it's not that cheap for Paris, I've stayed in a couple of places which have been cheaper and I've had a better night's sleep to boot.The final point is about the housekeeping service - although the rooms were kept very clean, there were a couple of issues. A nose stud my wife had left on the bathroom shelf disappeared. It was quite small and we think it just got knocked into the sink during enthusiastic cleaning (we popped back mid morning one day and considerable effort was being put in to giving another room on our floor a thorough going over from top to bottom, no skimping for sure.) Similarly, the end of a bottle of aftershave vanished on the last day and was replaced by a lingering smell of Kenzo in the bathroom. We suspect that it got knocked off the shelf and broke, which was no biggie, but it would have been nice to have been given a simple apology.Please be assured, I'm not suggesting anything light fingered was going on, one morning I left a √ä√£¬¢200 mobile charging when I forgot to put it in the safe and it wasn't touched. It was just another annoying little thing that a couple of items succumbed to the overenthusiastic cleaning.We left a feedback form, but didn't get any response at the time of our stay, and no contact about the issues by phone or mail afterwards. As the hotel was totally full, there was no possibility of shifting to an alternative room, so we can't say if we would have been offfered a room change etc.It's not a terrible place by any means, and if you're aware of the downsides (need for travel kettle, effectively no breakfast and internal noise) the location and cleanliness are commendable, but on balance you can do better, especially for the money.
