{"text":"Disabled Guest Review Booked through londontown.com after reading TA reviews. Family of 4 (2 teens, 2 adult - 1 in wheelchair) stayed 8 nights in 2 rooms. Yes, it was beyond nuts, I admit it right up front. but we wanted to be taken care of by a 5-star hotel. We really weren't taken care of as expected (see below), but it was a nice enough place to make our stay an enjoyable experience. As a disabled guest in London for the first time, I was glad that the hotel, as expected, is centrally located within a short walk of good breakfast  lunch places (Cafe Necco is excellent), the Ritz (Evan Evans tour bus pick-up location), Buckingham Palace, and London's extensive bus lines. The hotel doormen had to drag a portable lift to the doorway every time I entered and left the hotel. They eventually got used to the routine  were nice about it, but I still felt conspicuous. Lobby interior is inviting just like the pics, very British-clubby and elegant. Bar and restaurant are as nice as pics as well, but staff is a bit indifferent in the bar. Bathrooms are in the lower lobby and are not accessible at all. The hotel provided me with a lovely and quiet accessible room dominated by the king-sized bed, which had a very hard uncomfortable mattress and several too-soft pillows that made sleeping difficult. AC was loud but tolerable. Accessible bathroom had insufficient grab bars, and a sloped entrance ramp that made wheelchair access impossible without help, and the rickety tub chair was truly treacherous. Still I was very glad to have this room once I woorked out a system for myself - I used a manual wheelchair in the room, and switched to a rented electric one for outside use that I stored in the library at night. Hotel elevator (lift) was very small - I had to move the footrests back on the manual chair to fit inside, and it was a very tight fit for the electric one . Doormen assisted in retrieving  storing the ramp and wheelchairs but I had to get huffy with the night staff before they became more helpful. After they knew I needed them to be more pro-active in setting up the ramp, getting the wheelchair, etc., everything went much more smoothly. Still, I feel that for a 5-star, hotel, I shouldn't have needed to be assertive to get help (just with the night staff; daytime staff was usually fine). [Note: I found the London bus system to be very convenient to the hotel, and the busses were eminently accessible with excellent lifts.] Staff was not very helpful at all re: sightseeing and transportation tips and assistance, again, surprising for a 5-star hotel. I'm glad I'm self-sufficient and that I'd done all my own very extensive research in advance. Still an elegant small hotel in a very nice, safe neighborhood that makes a visitor feel very good. Prices are so ridiculously high (even though I'd been duly warned, the money drain was much worse when actually experienced) that your money gushes out of your hands like flood water - after 8 days in London I felt almost like it just didn't matter anymore, because I was so broke-what difference is another $40 breakfast of 4 bottles of juice, a small fruit container, and 2 muffins, anyway, after a week of crazy prices? Enough to make anyone punchy...!
