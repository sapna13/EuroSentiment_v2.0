{"text":"Disappointed I returned last month from a trip to this resort and was very disappointed with my stay. The beaches in the Dominican Republic are beautiful and so were the beaches on the property at Paradise Bavarro. The accomodations were another matter. The room and all of the linens smelled of mildew. The beds and the linens were old and stained. The refrigerator was stocked with beverages but it was difficult to get simple things for the room. We had to go through a very long process to obtain an ironing board and iron. Once it was brought to our room, we were limited to a two hour use. The food at the hotel was terrible. I am not a picky eater, I generally find something I like to eat in every place that I travel to. This place was the exception. Most of the food was overcooked, oily, and salty. The meats were often very fatty or tough. The sausages and cold cuts tasted like they came out of a can. The food I did eat made me sick four of the five days that I was there. There wasn't much available to drink outside of the frozen mixed drinks. They didn't have normal mixers for the alcohol. They didn't have any cranberry juice or grapefruit juice available. It rained two days during our stay and there was not much to do at the property during inclimate weather. The activities staff was inexperienced and unimaginative. Most of the entertainment consisted of karoke performances. Most of the excursions outside the hotel were $75 and up and the majority of those involved water sports. I had a much better time in Jamaica and Mexico.
