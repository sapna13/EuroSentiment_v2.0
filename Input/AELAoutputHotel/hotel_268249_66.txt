{"text":"NOT impressed. i have just come back from a one week stay at the IFA bavaro ocean village... I was worried about going there because i had read all the bad reviews from people on this site and i honestly thought There is no way it could be that badFirst of all - our room sucked. This hotel is NOT a 4 star hotel... MAYBE a 2 1\/2. First of all we had ants in our room. Second of all our air conditioning broke 2 times in a couple days and we hads to make at LEAST 5 calls to customer service until someone actually came to fix it. The air conditioner leaked so much we could have taken a shower under it we had to leave towels underneath it at all times or else we would have had a huge flooded room... The resort it self sucked. The beach.. it was nice. If you want a place to relax without people in youre hair and loud music and people shouting this is not the hotel for you. No matter where you go there is loud music playing there are pelpe walking up and down the beach trying to sell you stuff and they never give up... At one point someone chased us down the beach trying to sell us a pair of earings. It was extremely stressful. As for the weather, it was nice. It only rained during the day once for about 10 minutes and than the sun came up.. it rained almost every night all night. The food was either reallly good or REALLY bad, and i mean really bad. The mexican restaurant was absolutely HORRIBLE. The japanese retaurant was wonderful, we didnt make it to the seafood retaurant. The buffet by the beach was the best... it had the same food everyday for lunch, but it was decent. The ones in the hotel were good... they had plenty of selection for food. In the mornings they had an omlete station and had bacon sausage fruit everything u could want. At night time they had pasta station were you could pick youre sauce youre pasta youre ingredients and so on... Lots of selection but the quality left something to be desired...ALSO... we were pleasantly surprised at our check out when they had told us the day we arrived to be checked out of the room by 4 30.. So we arive at about 4 20 to check out and the guy at the desk tells us we had to be out of the room by noon and that we had to pay a 25 fee because we kept the room for  An extra 4 hours  I would NEVER recomend this hotel to anyone and i would most definetly NEVER return to this hotel.
