{"text":"Excellent Hotel  My husband and I stayed at the Komaneka for six days at the end of June, beginning of July this year. We had stayed in Seminyak for the six days prior to going to Ubud, but when planning our trip thought we would like to experience more of Bali than the beaches. I am very glad that we did decide to spend a few days in Ubud, as I think if we had only visited it on a day trip we wouldn't have got nearly as much out of it as we did.The Komaneka is very centrally positioned, although once inside the hotel grounds you would have no idea that you are in the middle of a busy town.The standard of accommodation was excellent, with lovely attention to detail. The staff couldn't have been more helpful or pleasant.I would highly recommend that you visit the Komaneka, but do have two criticisms. Firstly when we arrived we were given a pool villa overlooking the rice paddies. This sounds idillyc. However, you have little to no pricacy, with the rice paddy workers being able to see straight in to your room unless you keep your curtains closed. The room was lovely so we did try to stay there, but on two occassions in the space of a few hours the paddy workers tried to beg from us.This made us feel very uncomfortable, and we decided that it would ruin our stay. The hotel were very good about it, and moved us to an alternative pool villa, which overlooked a valley and was almost completely private.The other criticism is the price of the wine. The restaurant was fine, and we would certainly have eaten there, but a glass of wine (not particulary good wine at that) was at least twice the price of having a stong cocktail. Although I appeciate that wine is expensive in Bali, this seemed very excessive, and stopped us from eating there. However, there are so many others places to eat near by that this shouldn't put you off from staying there.I would recommend the Komaneka, but ask for a room which does not directly overlook the rice paddies.
