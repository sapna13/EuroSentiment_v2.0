{"text":"French Fries in Paradise I just returned from a week at the Gran Bahia Principe and it was a decent vacation but not necesarily because of the efforts of the resort.Rooms: The accomodations are very good. Definitely 3.5 star. Spacious, clean and comfortable. I did have a couple of problems during my stay 1) The tub clogged and there was a leak in the bathroom celiling due to heavy rain 2) After a major storm the power went out in the entire room...making it a pain to dress for dinnerService: This is where the hotel runs into the most problems. Everyone is quite friendly and makes it a point of asking you repeatedly if everything is okay. The problem is that they can't understand you if you have a problem and if they can understand you they don't seem to know what to do about it. My bathroom repair took a long time and the electrical problem that happened in the afternoon was not fixed until after dinner at about 9pm. Both repairs also required that I call twice to ask someone for help... not what I want to do on my vacation.Also, my call to bell services at checkout was futile. 10 minutes they said. I suspect if I had waited, I'd still be sitting on the edge of my bed!In short: The service is non-existent.Food: Now this can chage things for me. A place with all the aforementioned problems could still win me over if the grub is out of this world. Unfortunately, that was not the case here. The buffet food is, well buffet food. Nothing memorable there. You can probably find an item or two that you like...mine was french fries. Can't go wrong with french fries.My package also included 4 ala carte selections. We chose Japanese, Steak House, Mexican and Gourmet. Again nothing to really rave about. A bit higher quality than the buffet but most folks have a hometown favorite that could easilty beat any of these establishment. The Japanese was the best; courses of sushi, tempura, then meat and veggies flamed on the grill right before your eyes before you're moved to the main dining area for dessert.Everything was kind of rushed in all the dining establishments. No time to linger. If you want whats on your plate you'd better be actively eating or the plate will be snatched instantly. I found that rather annoying. Of course drinks are included. Dinner comes with wine selection of red or white. Both overly sweet...should be dessert wines. You can order different wine at some of the ala cartes but of course it will cost you.The Pool\/Activities: The pools are great. Clear, clean and always full of fun. Plenty of room to gather or for couples to float off quietly alone. All have jetted spas which are nice for a nice water massage and swim up bars. Of course you have to tip the bartenders for drinks that are more that really cute smoothies. As for activities, I felt they were lacking or less publicized than true five star resort. I did see water polo being played daily and a few random dance contests and disorganized games by the main pool. Supposedly there were aquaerobics, volleyball and spanish lessons just to name a few happening, but I never saw or heard about them.The beach: It's pretty to look at. Plenty of loungers for all who wish to bake. However, if you want to go swimming you might like to stick to the pool. This is the Atlantic Ocean, not the Carribean Sea so the waves are pretty rough and sea weed is very heavy on the beach.Overall, your vacation is always what you make of it. However, if you're going for ultra luxury, five-star service, fine dining, english speaking, grown-up oriented...THIS AIN'T it.If you have a family (kids) and want someplace laid back and are super easy-going this might be the one.
