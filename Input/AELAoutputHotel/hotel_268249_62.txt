{"text":"We enjoyed the IFA Bavaro Village As many of you know the IFA Bavaro has 3 different resorts within 1. We stayed at the Ocean Village which is the one closest to the beach. Yes, it is also closest to the disco that starts at 11:30- 3:00 A.M. We knew this before and took some ear plugs with us, which we needed. On the plus side, though, we were close to the beach and had one of the buffet restaurants and sports bar right outside our building which was great in the morning for breakfast and later for drinks.The rooms are basic but clean, and as many have indicated the bathrooms need to be redone. Found no bugs in the rooms (we had 2) and always had clean towels. The maid did forget to put water in one of the rooms one day, but we found her and she quickly got more water for us. The food was basic buffet style, but there was always something there that was to our liking. There are three other restaurants as well that you have to make reservations for. We chose the Mexican Restaurant. Basically a mexican buffet. Not very good.We went to the Colonial Restaurant twice and enjoyed it. They had an ala carte menu that had various seafood and meat dishes along with a good selection of appetizers and desserts. We didn't go to the Asian restaurant.The beach of course was great. We would wander down after breakfast and as long as we were there before 9-9:30 we would have no trouble finding a lounge chair. All the chairs were in good shape as they must have been replaced recently. I would say that maybe because it was the holiday season there was not a lot of topless women. Maybe 5% at most at the beach and only a few around the pool.The bars were all good and service was prompt at them all. Our favorite was El Capitan bar. It was great to sit and play some cards after a day at the beach and get a proper drink in a real glass instead of a plastic cup. They also had a cappuccino machine which was nice. They had also recently opened a snack bar at the middle pool which served good pizzas, burgers and hotdogs.While the rooms in this hotel are a little dated most of the other facilities are good and the service was good ,so for what we paid we all agreed that it was good value for the money.
