{"text":"Great hotel! Stayed at La Quinta Inn and Suites Dallas-Addison for 2 nights this past weekend and was very pleasantly surprised. Check-in and out was fast and easy. There are several entrances, so we were able to park right in front of our rooms' window and it was short walk to the exit. The rooms were spacious and beds very comfortable, but small. The bathroom was bright and spacious as well and even with 4 of us showering each morning, never had an issue with running out of hot water. Nice desk and high speed internet connection for laptop. Housekeeping was rather slow and we had to call the front desk twice on Saturday to get them to our room to remove the trash and dirty towels and give us clean ones. They finally came around 5:00pm. Both nights we were there, there were several younger children that ran up and down our hallway pretty late at night being extremely loud, but to no fault of the hotel. The continental breakfast was decent having fruit, bagels, muffins, pastries, yogurt, hard boiled eggs, toast, juice and waffles. The only drawback to this is the dining area is very small, so we had to take our food back to our room as there was no where to sit. Didn't use the pool, but we did take a look and it was decent sized and appeared clean. Very nice courtyard area too. Would have liked to have a safe in the room to store valuables, but for the price, that was okay. Close to tons of eating establishments and shopping. The Galleria Mall was only about 5 minutes away and easy to get to. The average rate for the 2 double bed room we had was $119, but I was able to book on Travelocity and got excellent rates of $49 a night. Well worth the price. The entire hotel seemed very well kept and new and staff was friendly.
