{"text":"Deserving of a 5 star but not a 6 My wife and I just returned from the Palladium Bavaro (December 1 - 8, 2006) and agree with most of the reviews. This is an excellent Carribean get away. The rooms are spacious and clean, the grounds are beautiful, the food is above average and there are selections for even the most picky of appetites, and the staff is generally friendly and helpful. The beach is a bit narrow, but there is enough shoreline to accommodate everyone and there are 4 pools to choose from, each with its own swim\/up or walk up bar and each are next to a buffet restaurant for lunch.During the week we stayed the place seemed booked to around 90 - 95 % capacity. We were not able to get reservations at any of the a la carte restaurants during normal eating hours. There were seatings available at 9:30 - 10 pm but that was just too late for us. We were told this was due to the influx of European and Canadian guests during December that stay for 2-3 weeks and book all of their dinners when they arrive, leaving nothing for the guests that are only staying for a week.There are 3 buffet restaurants at the resort and each evening is a different theme. Mexican, Dominican, Oriental, American, Italian to name a few. We were satisfied with the buffets and didn't feel like we were missing anything by not getting an a la carte meal. One night we just had burgers and beer at the Sports bar. If you want a prime seat around the pool or at the beach you need to get there by 8am and claim your chair. The generally accepted manner at this resort is by placing a towel and a book on the chair you wish to reserve. The book is necessary to keep the towel from blowing away. Once you do this feel free to go back to sleep, have breakfast, or whatever knowing your chair will be there when you return.Most travel sites rank the Palladium as a 4 of 5 or a 5 out of 6. This is quite accurate in our opinion. If you are looking for the 5 of 5 or the 6 of 6, in Punta Cana, I would recommend Secrets or the Iberstar Bavaro. The differences are subtle but noticible.
