{"text":"Good Deal, Great Service, Nice Stay We just returned from a five night stay at the Coral Princess and we enjoyed our stay. This is the perfect stop for the budget traveler. One thing to keep in mind when traveling in Puerto Rico tourist taxes add up. We didn't find out until we arrived at the hotel. The Expedia price said $99.00\/night but with taxes it averaged out $140\/ night. This is no fault of the hotel. We booked a room with a double bed for the two of us. It's small but we didn't plan on staying in the hotel much. There is free internet via ethernet cable. Apparently there is wireless but it was not working during our stay. The room was clean and the bed was comfy. There is a ceiling fan and a remote to the air conditioning unit. (The only reason I mention this is because it took some time to figure it out.) The only complaint about the room is the showerhead. It wasn't very strong but it's a very minor detail. As mentioned before on this site there are not many amenities but that did not bother us. The free breakfast was nice. There were fresh bananas, cereal, pastries, yogurt, and croissants. The front desk is very helpful. F.Y.I- If you plan on taking a bus to Old San Juan you need to take B21 and it does not seem to have a schedule. We waited 45 mins one day. The good thing is that it only costs 75 cents one way to Old San Juan. Otherwise expect to pay $12.00+ for cab fare. The beach is a block and a half away. There is plenty to eat in the surround neighborhood particularly on Ashford Ave. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1092,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1084},{"endOffset":1100,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1094},{"endOffset":1100,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1094},{"endOffset":1116,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":1106}]}
