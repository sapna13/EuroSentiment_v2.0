{"text":"Amazing experience From the minute we arrived at the Shangri-La we were treated like royalty, our limo doors were opened for us and our luggage taken straight to our room,check in was quick and efficient and we were shown to our room. The room was everything we had hoped and more at first the bed looked short but we soon found that far from this it was exceptionally wide giving the impression of a short bed. Everything you could need wheteer staying on busines or pleasure had been provided right down to an umbrella  street map.The room was very spacious with wonderful views.We were welcomed with a bowl of fresh fruit and brought some rather nice jasmine tea, we were en-route to Australia where we were to be married and the Shangri-La delivered a complimentary congratulation cake to our room.The entrance foyer is very impressive with spectacular chandaliers, the hotel has a great pool and lovely landscaped gardens.We dined in most of the restaurants during our stay and found them to be all very diferent experiences: -Blu - Located at the top of the tower is the best dining experience we have ever had anywhere in the world, it doesnt come cheap but was well worth it, the food was exquisite the service second to none and the champagne the best I have tasted outside of Reims. The view was also spectaclar.The Line - A collection of small kitchens serving many different foods i.e. Indian, Sushi, Fish, deserts etc they also have a special night where you can eat and drink as much as you want from any or all of the kitchens, this was really good value for money and gave us the opportunity to try food which we had not had before.Shang Palace - This is a chinese restaurant wonderful decor but we were disappointed by the service and the menu, if you are used to Chinese restaurants in the UK you will find it difficult as nothing on the menu was anything like we get at home, unfortunately it was also very expensive.Rose Veranda -an english afternoon tea experience, fantastic food a selection of tea and coffee which would be difficult to better anywhere and all served by beautiful and immaculately dressed waitresses.We will definately be back.
