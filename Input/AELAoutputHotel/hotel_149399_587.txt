{"text":"Got Married here and it was a blast! First let me start off by saying that I read reviews for this hotel for 7 months prior to going and I was scared!!! I got married at the Melia and booked 60 guests to attend with me, so the bad reviews made me very nervous. I am pleased to report that we all had an awesome time at the Melia and recommend it to others.  In our group of 60 about half of us stayed in Royal Service and the other half stayed in the regular section. Those who did not have RS were pleased with their service and rooms until we snuck them over to our side. The regular rooms are okay but the Royal Service is what makes this resort 5 star. I highly recommend it and the price is not that bad if you book it in advance.  Now I must be honest, I do understand some of the negative reviews. The food in the buffets were just okay (I got sick one day) and the night life was boring (It was okay for us because with so many people it was a party wherever we went). The ala carte restaurants are very good and with RS it is very easy to get a reservation anywhere! All in all the pros far out weigh the cons.....Did I mention how breathtakingly beautiful the place is!!! As for the wedding it was all that I dreamed of and more. For those of you planning a destination wedding, they do a great job. I was a little worried about Angelica (the wedding coordinator) before I got there because she was slow returning emails, but she made sure that our every need was met. The destination wedding was the best decision I made other than getting engaged... So don't worry about the negative reviews! Just pack your bags, take sunscreen and bug spary, upgrade to Royal Service, and get ready for a great vacation....You just might see me there!!! ","annotations":[]}
