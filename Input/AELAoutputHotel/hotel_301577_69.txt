{"text":"Nice hotel, great location, but service a little disappointing I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and had a standard room with an adjoining kids room. The kids room is reason enough to recommend the hotel to families with small children. My boys were delighted with the little touches like the kids bed linen, kid size table and kid towels. The water slides at the pool were also popular with the children, The hotel is conveniently located at Clarke Quay, a vibrant and bustling area by the Singapore River and we enjoyed sitting on the steps by the river every evening watching the boats. It is also located next to an MRT (subway) station and across from a large shopping mall. If, like me, your package does not include breakfast, don't fall into the trap of having breakfast at the hotel as it costs a LOT. I had breakfast there the first day, before I got my bearings, as I was discinclined to drag my young children around looking for breakfast at 8.30 in the morning. The shopping mall across the street (Central) has various coffee and breakfast outlets (Starbucks, etc.) and you can also pick up essentials at the supermarket at Liang Court, across the river. The most offputting thing about the hotel was the concierge, who were invariably cold, unhelpful and couldn't manage a smile between the lot of them. I suspect that it may have been because I was perceived as a local (I am a Malaysian living abroad) and thus not deemed worthy of their attention. Basic information about the surrounding area and some tourist attractions had to be prised from them. Having said that, housekeeping was outstanding, and a very pleasant babysitter was available for 2 of the 3 nights that I was there. If you're looking for a hotel located outside the madness of the Orchard Road area, and have young children I would definitely recommend this hotel.
