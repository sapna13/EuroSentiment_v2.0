{"text":"Boring!!! First the good: This resort looks good in photos, rooms are basic yet clean, pool is ok, beach front is ok, clear water, although not blue water.Now the bad: BORING, BORING, BORING!!! until the last day of our stay, the pool side bar and pool side grill were closed, deathly quiet except birds and frogs, no light festive music in backgrouind at all. Jacuzzi had cold water, most ocean view balconies are blocked by palm trees, the sun sets past a mountain that blocks that view, so you have to drive more westward to catch it. Bartenders could not make a decent drink, no one knew what a martini was. On-site restaurant pricey with bad tasting food. Staff quick to have an I don't know look when asked about lack of amenities, I actually heard one tell another guest, the pool bar will open when they have customers, he was like we are customers! Bottom line: didn't feel like a resort at all, felt like a hotel. Thank Goodness we rented a car, we left the resort daily trying to find things to do and decent food to eat. Only used the resort to sleep, except the last day when everything was finally open. By the way, you will find the West side of the island is more rustic and laid back in general. Many roads are not well marked, most places do not have actual addresses! We had to use GPS, iphone google maps and the paper map from the visitor guide to locate places to visit, and even so, many times were lost, however we actually still had fun exploring. So honestly, if the Rincon Beach resort had been more pleasurable, we probably wouldn't have explored as much and had as much fun, but next time if I just need somewhere to sleep, I could have saved a lot of money elsewhere. By the way, The Lazy Parrot had a cool atmosphere and nice restaurant, but if you are looking for 4-5 stars, it's probably not for you. Honest rating for Rincon Beach resort would be 2.5 stars.
