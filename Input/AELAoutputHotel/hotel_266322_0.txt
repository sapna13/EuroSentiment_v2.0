{"text":"Enjoyable I am writing this whilst still in the hotel as I feel that negative reviews on this hotel were not warrented. We booked our stay at the Clarendon after reading their website and checking on Trip Advisor. The reviews here seemed mixed, however we thought we should give it a try, and we are pleased we did. On arrival in the evening the hotel was lit up and flashing blue, it looked quirky and really interesting. (Great touch), the front desk staff were very efficient and helpful and we were given room 423. The room was large had a fantastic comfortable bed, large flat screen TV, fresh coffee machine and all the other normal things you would expect. It was quiet and a very comfortable room. Negative things are the shower which is a bit slow to heat up or ends up burning you. The gremlin in the A\/C unit which turned it on at 2am automatically, and we thought a boeing 747 was landing in the room and the window in our room which opened onto a corridor did not have a lock and could be opened with your hands on the glass. The food in the hotel which we had was very very good. The fillet migion was to die for, and we had it on two nights. The pool looked fantastic. The hotel owner obvioulsy has a lighting fettish as the lights throughout the hotel are really cool. Even though the hotel is an old 70's department block building the owners have tried their best to create a modern feel of an outdated building and have done it well. Imagine the Mondrian in LA on a budget but with better staff which are not full of themselves. The roof top bar is a nice touch but looked a bit rough round the edges. The staff were excellent and extreemly helpful. This hotel most definatly has a future, give it a try, you will be plesently suprised!
