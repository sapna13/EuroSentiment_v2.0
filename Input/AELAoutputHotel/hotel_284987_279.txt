{"text":"Facility 10+\/ Food 3\/ Service 3 too bad nice hotel First off never stay here with a group of four or more if you expect to eat without waiting for 1-2 hours even with a reservation. We made 8:00 pm reservations and they were not honored once during our stay. On one occasion with an 8:00 pm reservation we waited until 10:00 pm to eat only to find most of the employees went home and we had to find the manager and complain heavily to get food. We ended up just walking in past the maitre de at most meals because there is no communication between employees as far as table availability. Expect to wait an hour and a half past your reservation time and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only if they don't lose your reservation which happens frequently. This is a real shame as the hotel is beautiful as well as all the facilities. The employees are very friendly and helpful but all complain the hotel is badly understaffed and they are 100% right.On our first day I was very impressed until we went to eat lunch and were greeted by a beautiful indoor-outdoor restaurant with garbage on every single table. Not one clean table what a disappointment! We have been to many resorts in the Caribbean and know to expect service moves a little slow but this place is a joke. On our final night we were told we would have no problem with our reservation,guess what they lost it again which brought out the general manager who thought by handing his card to us would satisfy us, another joke.The General manager told our party we never made a reservation even though we had a confirmed written reservation from the hotel in hand. Whenever you complain they write it down and hand you a card like that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ supposed to make you feel better. When I told the manager about the lost reservations he incredibly told me (after I refused to take his card again) that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the way it is here. To me that means if you don't like it tough luck! So much for the food, incidentally one night (with a 9:00 reservation) we waited until 11:00 pm to be seated, my dish came with only a small piece of fish as we were told there were no vegetables left. Do not come here if you like the ocean as you can't swim in it because of all the sea grass.If you want a chaise lounge be prepared to get up very early as they are all taken by 10:00am. The cabanas by the pool are great but never available unless you are there before sunrise. There are some good things, the bartenders are very attentive and the liquor is top shelve. Some in our party opted for the Royal service including a private pool which is great because the main pool has music blasting so loud I could not listen to my Ipod. My kids were exited to go to the talent show unfortunately it was is in Spanish. The Casino is small but ok, they are short on dealers. Friday night with the place packed there was only one Roulette table with a load of people waiting to play, I asked the manager to open another table and he told me he did not have a dealer.Upon checking out we were greeted by an employee who asked how our stay was. I gave her the information in this review and she told me she heard the same thing all week.I don't know maybe they had a bad week when we were there but I would guess we were not the first to experience these problems with the facility. I feel bad to write this review as the Hotel is really beautiful the employees attentive, it could be a realnice place once they get their act together and hire more staff. One last note RoyalService doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mean much, the ones in our party who opted waited 2 hours to check in because there was no room for them. It doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ make sense if you have kids as they are banned from using the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬©oyal√à√\u2020\u2022?pool, For adults it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ great if you don't want the zoo scene at the main pool. Also you are supposed to have a butler for the extra $150 a day but nobody ever saw his or her butler after the first day! We had 20 people with us and not one person said they would come back again.
