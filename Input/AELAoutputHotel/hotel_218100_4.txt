{"text":"Very Nice Palce I had to travel to Phoenix on business for 8 days and chose the Sheraton Four Points Metro Center. It is surrounded by many restaurants (Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Chili's, El Torrito) and next to the Metro Center mall. The location is great for a business travel, because when you get back to the hotel, you don't have to drive far to get dinner.The room I stayed in (#148) was nice. A little older, but quiet and comfortable. It had BLAZING wireless internet, that never failed and connected instantly. A big plus for business. There was a small fridge and coffee in the room. I liked the to-go cups for the coffee and used them as I rushed out the door to my appointments. I stored all my water bottles and leftovers in the fridge, so it was very much appreciated.There is a restaurant and bar \/ lounge on the premises. I ate dessert (pecan pie that was to die for!) and had drinks there. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. It seemed everyone I spoke with there, was really enjoying their stay.One great amenity that I wasn't expecting was poolside food and drink service. After 5pm you can order food and drinks from the pool area (burger and a beer!) and charge it to your room. Such a great plus if you're weary from your day and just want to relax and not have to go anywhere.I had a chance to speak with one of the owners of the hotel who seemed very interested in the guest's viewpoint. He mentioned that they would be renovating the rooms and some of the common areas before the busy fall \/ winter season. All in all, I really like the hotel and would gladly recommend it to others. I will definitely be back!
