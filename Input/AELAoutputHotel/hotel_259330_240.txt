{"text":"A motley experience The property was absoulutley beautiful when you entered. However, very few people who work there speak or understand english and I do not speak spanish. Getting information was very tough...They always smile though.My oceanfront room was really a poolside room with a tiny glimpse of the ocean and I mean a tiny glimpse. Plan on iving out of the suitcase-there are only 3 tiny draws in the room-small desk draws for your clothes????If you hang up all your summer attire there is a small closet. Watch out for the handheld shower -that when it is attached -it washes the whole bathroom. The toilet wiggled and the sink faucet squirted everywhere. The room was not plush and alot less than I was used to. I didn't realize this in my all inclusive price. Oh and don't forget the cockroaches we were fumigated and they were here and there even on the third floor.The pool and the beach and the grounds were fabulous. The food was medium, and not spectacular and the outside food was cold most of the time. I was sick by the 4th night from the food -I barley drink. The bartender saw me deathly ill by the pool and made me a great cure of bitters, lime juice soda water and salt and reluctant as I was it really helped me.The people were wonderfully happy and always smiled which made it seem all better, but the language barrier was tough if you really needed something. Great grounds, great people, great weather needed and expected a better room.DON'T DO THE excursion to saona island-you just pay for a very long bus ride to the harbor-left at 7:15 Am and didn't get to the beach until 1:30 and the tour there was just a long bus ride and not much to see. The boat ride was pretty.The catamaran was beautiful with a great view. There was no real refreshments other than 2 liters of warm sprite and coke and a bottle of rum. It was so cheaply done. Really lousy excursion and we didn't see the dolphins or the huge starfish....You only stay at the beach 2 hours and the trip back was long. We didn't get back at the hotel until 8;00 and missed dinner reservations. I was Told we would be back at 5:00 when we booked this. Oh well..Overall I would find a better hotel and be more careful about any extra tours...
