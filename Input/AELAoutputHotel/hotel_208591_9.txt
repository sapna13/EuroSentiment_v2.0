{"text":"Perfect..! Well me and 2 friends have just come back from barcelona and after staying in this hotel - with the extremely helpful staff and wonderful cleaners! We shall definitely be returning! :-)We had 4 nights in hotel lloret in a triple room..admittidly it was a small room but it had 3 comfy beds, a nice power shower and air conditioning!! [ which was at no extra cost ]The majority of the staff speak good english and will be more than happy to help if you don't know the area very well or just want advice on good\/reasonable restaurants. [TIP- bars and restaurants off la rambla are much cheaper and often nicer than ones directly on la rambla.]Being teenage girls well lets just say our room became instantly messy within 5 minutes off arriving.! The cleaners even folded our pyjama's up and put them under our pillows everyday! As well as replacing towels and thoroughly cleaning the bathroom and room.! The service hotel lloret provided far exceeded 2 star rating!Some general info about la rambla area of barcelona...if you are young and don't have the money or don't want to dine in restaurants there are plenty of supermarkets to buy ready made pastas\/sandwiches and bageuttes. However if there is also a Subway, KFC, Macdonalds, Burger King along la Rambla. So your taste buds will be satisfied [sort of] as long as your'e not there for more than a week!! Admittedly we did dine on subways and the occasional KFC, however the 30 minute walk 4 times a day to port olympic and back solved the issue of piling on the pounds.!!The closest beach is barceloneta and is about a 30 minute walk straight down la rambla and left at the harbour..! [We refused to pay for taxis] The best clubs are at port olympic and most are free to get into just get talking to the right people :-) they chuck out mon-fri no later than 4am...BAD THINGS ABOUT THE HOTEL \/ HOLIDAY \/ BARCELONA1] The hotel room had just one plug in the bathroom and one which the TV was plugged into..this was not helpful with 3 teenage girls getting ready to go out each night..!!2] The taxi drivers WILL pile on extras for transfers to and from the airport..it should cost no more than 25euros as its only 20 minutes max away. We paid 35 on the way and just 25 on the way back...we agreed on a price with the driver before getting in on the way back!! You REALLY need to do this to avoid them conning you.!3] Watch out for drug dealers \/ theives \/ protitutes there are LOADS up la rambla after about 1am. And it was a horrible experience having to dodge them on our way back every night. Some friends we made got totally mugged credit cards, money, watch the lot..and this is a common occurance. So BE CAREFUL!4] As barcelona is a city expect to pay more for everything. Although soveniers are cheap. Drinks at clubs were a RIP OFF!! 30 euros for 3 vodka and oranges.!! Although some clubs were cheap - going down to around 24 euros...Despite this we all had a fantastic time and we really want to return to barcelona and maybe do a bit more sight seeing and shopping this time rather than just beach\/clubbing..!!!Hope you find this helpful!!!
