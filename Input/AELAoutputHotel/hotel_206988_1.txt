{"text":"A good place to sleep, but spend the day elsewhere The Conde Duque obviously tries to come across as a quite fancy place to stay. There is no denying that it has some nice touches, and it is quite proper and tidy, everything is in good repair and works as expected (well, it was the cool season, so I wouldn't know about the AC). Really nothing much to complain about. Yet the absence of any ugly spots combined with an elegant lobby and fine stationery is not quite enough to make the luxury class. The neighbourhood is quite decent, but not very interesting. On the other hand, it is only a twenty-minute walk to some more attractive parts of town, and metro stations are found within five minutes from the hotel. The rooms are well kept and quiet but not very spacious or especially pretty. The desk was small and most of it was occupied by the TV set. There was no easy-chair for comfortable reading or watching TV, so unless you get a bigger and better room than I had, be prepared to spend all your time either lying on the bed or sitting at the desk. Not quite my idea of a comfortable stay. Some rooms offer a very limited view from the window, others may be better. The staff is not very fluent in English. Routine matters such as checking in and out present no problem, but the staff can not answer more complicated questions in English. There is Internet connection, but only for a fee and through a peculiar TV interface (yes, the television set is involved somehow). And whatever you do, do NOT use the fancy cast-iron letter box in the lobby to mail anything important. Despite assurances from the staff that this was a good option, it seems from the date stamp that it took over two weeks before the letter was handed over to the postal service for delivery - I suspect that this letter box is emptied very infrequently.But by and large, it is a reasonably good place to stay, as long as one does not expect anything out of the ordinary and spends most of the time doing other things elsewhere.
