{"text":"Nice rooms\/views but hotel lacked atmosphere. My mum and I spent two nights, 28-30 April at this wonderful Hotel. Chose this Hotel based mainly on Tripadvisor's high ratings. We knew we were going to arrive at close to midnight from Venice, by Air France coach, hence the obvious choice was to choose this Hotel since we simply cross the road and the Hotel is located right at the corner of Ave Carnot. We were rather happy with our request for a corner room, which offers us 3 balconies with superb views of the Arc de Triomphe. Room was large even by European standards, bed was really really comfortable and the bathroom was simply long and huge! The view at night of the Arc was especially memorable .....Location wise, it is very close to the Metro\/RER and shopping in Champs Elysees. Even the Lido Cabaret show was very nearby. However, beware of the underground tunnel closing after 10pm or 11pm. When we were walking back to the Hotel after the Lido show, at around 11.15pm. We had to back tracked and walk above grounds instead. I was a little annoyed cos I emailed the Hotel before my trip and was told to walk back to the Hotel via the underground tunnel? As for breakfasts, managed to catch a glimpse of what's on offer - in my honest opinion, doesn't seem to be worth 22 euros. Right across the Street, you can find nice Cafes which offer breakfast sets at 7.50 or 8.50 euros per person. Finally, I did not grant this wonderful Hotel a full 5 stars rating cos of the lack of atmosphere in the common areas. I thought they should invest some money in decorating the reception and common areas so as to create a cosy\/romantic Parisian ambience, which is why millions are visiting Paris each year. After two nights here, we stayed another two nights at the Paris Le-Grand near the Paris Opera, which is by far the most beautiful Parisian hotel I had stayed at (see my review under Paris Le-Grand).
