{"text":"Excellent service. Still under construction We booked the Catalonia Albinoni as part of an Orbitz package (air + hotel) at the very last minute for four nights. I was pleasantly surprised -- the staff here are amazing. For example, I left my sunglasses at breakfast and got them back the next morning. We arrived without advance notice at 9am and they had a room ready and clean for us. There is always someone at the front desk. The hotel has an amazing location. If you're coming in from the airport, you get off the RENFE train at Passieg de Gracia and walk about 4 blocks to the hotel. The hotel is in a pedesterianized area in the old town (but close enough to the metro so that you feel safe at night), one block from Las Rambla, one block from the Placa Catalyuna metro stop, and about two city blocks from the cathedral. There's a supermarket in the basement of the Cortes Ingles department store (not the one next to the hotel, the bigger one one block away at Placa Catalyuna). We basically didn't need public transit (except to get to Monjuic and La Sagrada Familiga) and walked all over the old city and the waterfront. Very convenient. The room was clean, small, and adequate. We were in room 411, which is on the top floor, with a small window that faced a blank wall (no view, alas), but the room was dead silent, even though there was construction on the hotel pool and jackhammers going less than 20 feet away. As usual for Europe, there were two twin beds that were kind of hard (in a bad way) in a very small room. The bathroom was almost the size of the sleeping area, and was very clean (towels and toiletries replaced daily). The TV didn't work, but that didn't matter much to us. You have to insert your room key to make the AC and lights go on. Upon inquiry, the breakfast buffet (normally 15 euros) was included in our Orbitz deal. I'm not sure if I would have paid the 15 euros when there were cafes all around offering a pastry and a coffee for 2 euros, but since it was included, we partook every morning. Breakfast is 7-10:30am M-F and 7:30-11am on weekends. We turned breakfast into brunch and skipped lunch. The buffet is in a new building on the back patio. You have the choice of sitting in the sun, or indoors, or when it's nice (most days), indoors with the sliding doors open. This is a very very nice buffet, with a selection of waters, wine, juices, yoghurt, cereals, fresh fruit, dried fruit (dates, figs, apricots, etc), cold cuts (including serrano ham) and cheeses, pastries (chocolate crossants, plain crossants, muffins), breads and baguettes, a toaster, a sandwich press, eggs over easy, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, and two types of torta espanola (fritatta for Italians, and egg and potato casserole for Americans); and of course, tea + coffee. Most of the food was of really high quality (I didn't venture into the American breakfast section, but had thirds of everything else). The dinner option at the hotel is almost the same price as breakfast (18 euros pp for your choice of 3 courses, including a bottle of wine and mineral water -- when you see what prices are like, even in the tapas bars, you will understand how this is a deal). I would go back, but would request that they push the beds together to form one big bed -- we didn't bother with this, but I saw one of the maids doing it in another room.
