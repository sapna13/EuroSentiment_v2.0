{"text":"Just another Courtyard on the inside Let me start by saying that I stayed here using Marriott Rewards Points from July 20 to July 23, 2006. So I cannot judge the value of my stay.If you have seen one Courtyard hotel room, you have seen them all. Furnishings were fairly new but uninspiring. Bathroom was basic. Sink area was too small for two people. Typical Courtyard with basic features. Nothing new to report about this Courtyard.The property itself is kept very clean. Check-in was a breeze. Although, I did request to be upgraded to a suite but the front desk clerk informed me that they were completely booked. I did not challenge the clerk, but I logged on the Marriott website before arriving and it showed availability for suites during my stay. I am an elite member and they choose to ignore my request. We had a nice City View with a view of they pyramid building on the 14th floor.Soap and shampoo were no name brands unlike other Marriott properties which use Bath and Body Works products. If you are picky about hair products like I am, be sure to bring your own.The Courtyard is in easy walking distance to ATT Park and the Muni\/BART Station (15 to 20 minutes). If you are walking from the Muni\/BART Station, I recommend walking on the north side of 2nd Street. For some reason, this side is more developed and nicer. The homeless tend to stay on the southside during the evenings. Union Square is one Muni\/BART station away.We found a great Thai restuarant on 2nd street a couple blocks away called Osha. Roys is also a couple blocks away also. Starbuck in lobby is convenient but hours limited. You can charge your drinks and food to your room.To summarize, a typical Courtyard. Room very clean and comfortable. Free wired internet in the rooms. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":827,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":823}]}
