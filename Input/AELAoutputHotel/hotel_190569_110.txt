{"text":"Honestly, Just OK I stayed at the Palace in April 2007 and overall it provided a so so experience. I was at the Hotel Urban a few nights earlier, and frankly, the Palace loses hands down!1) Location: perfect location for all of the major sites...art, food, drink. There is even a Starbucks around the corner from the hotel if that's your thing.2) Check-in: horrible, horrible, horrible. After waiting in a tremendous line, we were given our room. Amazingly, as we walked in the room a lady was in her robe on the couch frightened by our entry..she actually yelped. Strike 1. We explained to the front desk what had happened...with no apology (not even to the poor lady) we were given a second room. Where's are luggage? Strike 2. The front desk claimed it was in the room...the concierge claimed it was on the way up. 30 mins or so later, I went back downstairs. Well, they lost the luggage. Strike 3. I had to look through piles of bags to find my bags. No apology, nothing...I was an inconvenience. Also, the bag guy gave me a look like I should tip him. In summary, check-in takes about an hour or so. Pretty cool, eh?3) Facilities: I enjoyed the dome bar - - had a fun time sipping a couple of pre-dinner drinks and a night cap. As noted by other reviewers, the hotel does offer a taste of luxury and old world beauty. The breakfast was a nice touch and reasonably good. 4) Room: A little blah...but it had everything that you would expect from a 5 star hotel. Obviously very clean and all the usual amenities. I just wish there was something more exciting about the place, but that's just me.5) Service: I guess my opinion in this regard may be skewed from check-in. Nevertheless, why can't the staff smile? Not sure if this is a policy decision or if they are all just that miserable? Oh well. I will admit that the word must of spread about my check-in experience and the manager sent my girlfriend and I a bottle of wine..a nice peace offering.Overall, we had a blast in Madrid. We just wished that we would have continued to stay at the Hotel Urban or tried another hotel for our final night. The Palace didn't do it for me.
