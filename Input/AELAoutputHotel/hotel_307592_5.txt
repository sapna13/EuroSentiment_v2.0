{"text":"Charming luxury - enjoy !! When we arrived we knew that we expected to say WOW a lot and we did. The photographs of the three pools stepping down to the ocean do not do it justice - beautiful. Our room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ready so we had lunch √à√\u2020\u2022?lemongrass satay (yum) and duck salad. We were upgraded to a suite with a pool and it took our breath away (28). We booked our holiday through Diane Embree [--] - as recommended by other posters on TripAdvisor √à√\u2020\u2022?and we suspect the upgrade came as a result of the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨mbree Effect√à√\u2020\u2022?. We were booked on a deal where we stayed for 4 nights called a Wellness Package (or something similar). Our only criticism would be that we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fit in all the things that were included!! We had a cruise on one of the outrigger boats (with others but they were all charming) where the snorkelling was lovely, a massage, a pedicure (we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have time for the manicure), a Balinese massage on the beach, an amazing two and a half hour body treatment in our room √à√\u2020\u2022?all included in the package √à√\u2020\u2022?tremendous value. Would recommend you take your treatments your the room rather than in the beachside cabana. My husband had a back and shoulder ache. The lady in reception offered a healing session in lieu of his manicure which he accepted with alacrity. The healer was a sturdy Balinse bloke who tied up Allen like he was spaghetti putting him in positions I can warrant he hasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ been in since he was in the army (if then!!). The experience was not entirely pleasant but it was clear he knew his anatomy. Not going to say it was a miracle cure as this is a long term problem but he eased the ache significantly and a week on his work is still giving benefit.The beach is fine but it is volcanic sand and there is a fair amount of surf so personal choice if it is your type of beach or not. It isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ mine but this is more than adequately compensated for by an amazing pool down at the beach club area with its own bar and restaurant. Breakfast (also included on the package) was lovely and all a la carte. Other people didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem to eat lunch but we enjoy a starter and a glass of wine and all were delicious. Dinner was fine √à√\u2020\u2022?the food was good but if I was honest not great however we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really get much great food in Bali. Excellent steak though.It is odd being in a hotel where you never sign for anything but very nice. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to spoil surprises for people (or create disappointment if they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ happen) but every night there was something in the room to make our holiday more special. We did miss a TV in our room √à√\u2020\u2022?we are not honeymooners and do need a bit of external entertainment assistance from time to time. The free internet compensated a bit.There are fun things about the hotel too √à√\u2020\u2022?particularly the custom buggies to move you around. There are a lot of steps in the hotel but we managed √à√\u2020\u2022?with a few exceptions √à√\u2020\u2022?only to go downstairs. Oh and I must mention the performance by the local children. Usually this is the kind of thing to make me run in the opposite direction however by coincidence we arrived just as the show commenced and they were fantastic, delightful and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go on too long. Just perfect entertainment.So thank you Amankila for our upgrade, our amazing holiday and making us feel so welcome.
