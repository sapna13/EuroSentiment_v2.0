{"text":"Fantastic experience I don't know where to begin. This hotel from start to finish was amazing. By far the best service I have ever experienced anywhere. The reservation process was smooth and easy and it just got better once we arrived. The staff at the Omni really goes that extra mile to impress their guests. It was my mom's 60th birthday and they had champagne and a lovely piece of cake waiting for us when we returned from our day in the city. The door man was so charming, he handed my mom a rose and told her happy birthday. The check in process was quick and efficient. We arrived early and had no problem getting our room. I requested the lowest floor available, the man at the front desk was very helpful and friendly. Our room was beautiful and comfortable. The beds are super soft and the bathroom was very nice as well (huge tub, nice bath products!). The hotel provided a black towncar to take us to dinner, the driver was helpful and also very nice. My only regret was that we only had one night at the Omni. I can't wait to return with my husband on our next trip to SF. We visit the city 3-4 times per year and the Omni is most definitely my favorite hotel ever. It is a very short walk to Union Square (about 10 minutes) and the cable cars run in front of this hotel. North Beach is also very close. I can't say enough good things about this hotel and would highly recommend staying here! It just goes to show you that there are still places out there that put the customer first and go that extra mile to make their guests happy. Bravo Omni..
