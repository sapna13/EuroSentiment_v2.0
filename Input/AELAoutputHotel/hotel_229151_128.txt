{"text":"You probably can't go wrong here. This hotel is a welcome respite in a city of questionable lodgings. The decor is classy and warm, and it has an old charm that for once *doesn't* mean run-down and cramped.The room we stayed in (four nights) was small. Not quite Manhattan small, but definitely not spacious. Enough room for two people and two suitcases. The bed was comfortable and large, and the hotel staff was more than willing to give us extra pillows. We had a view of some other rooms' windows (very close by), so we had to keep the curtains closed at all times. If possible, I'd recommend asking for a room with an exterior view.The bathroom was clean and luxurious. My only gripe with the bathroom was that the towels were a bit too small. Chalk that up to Americans wanting everything to be oversized!The breakfast buffet here is pretty decent... I think we paid 14 euros per person, and we got fruit, cereal, scrambled eggs, pastries, etc. Standard, but fresh and well-stocked. They gave us free (small) bottles of water in the guest room every day, which is a nice touch.Unfortunately, I think our guest room was right above the kitchen area, so every morning around 7am, we heard the swinging doors to the kitchen and the clanging of plates right through the vents in our room. It wasn't a huge deal, and might not be an issue in other rooms, but you might want to bring earplugs just in case, if you plan on sleeping past 7am.Another minor gripe is the hotel's strange policy of wanting you to leave your room key at the front desk when you leave. The keys are on a keyring that has a magnificently posh tassle on it... which would be cumbersome to carry around, anyway. But this means that you have to wait in line at the front desk to get your key or drop off your key. In other words, allow yourself a few minutes on the way back to your guest room. ...I'm reluctant to mention it here, but you have to wonder how easy it would be for a thief to get into a guest room by simply asking the staff for a certain guest room's key by number. They didn't check our ID or anything when we asked for our key.In all, we'd recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Amsterdam. The neighborhood is quiet but close to everything (we're big walkers and were able to walk everywhere). You probably can't go wrong with this hotel in terms of comfort and value.
