{"text":"I'm fussy I'm fussy about where I stay. I like a comfortable bed, quiet, clean interesting space, kind staff, beverages in the AM. Hotel Camper fit the bill plus and one of the high lights of our trip to Barcelona. First a word on noise since this seemed to be a concern in some of the previous reviews. There was none. The hotel was an oasis of calm in an active, festive and throbbing city. The double glass doors to the lobby shut out all street noise. Jazz vocals played in the background. Our third floor bedroom was silent, the roof top sitting area was peaceful and as a bonus allowed a view of the nightly firworks. With the unfavorable exchange rate on the dollar and the exhorbitant price of even a light snack, having a more than adequatre, healthy 23 hour day and night buffet available was a cost saver and so convenient. Though the Barcelona food is a treat, there's too much to do in the city to be caught up in restaurant searches three times a day. Plus the food with it's emphasis on oil can be heavy. We enjoyed the hotel's fruit and salad. The bed was the right firmness and comfy, the room was dark, neat and elegant.My concern about the neighborhood was unwarranted. We were careful, the usual no swinging pocketbooks or back pant pocket valuables. Several blocks from Rambla on a well frequented street we felt safe night and even early morning going to our airport transport with luggage on tow. The location was perfect, a short walk to the action, but off the main drag. The staff was sweet and helpful, a little short on usual hotel concierge service. Worked out fine for us, we like to find our own way.Would love to come back and\/or stay at another Camper boutique hotel elsewhere.
