{"text":"Love The Hotel and People This was our second holiday at the Club Bali Mirage and to say we returned expresses exactly what we feel about the Hotel. It is a great place to relax and chill out. The Management and all the staff at the hotel are extremely kind and helpful. Whatever you want, if they can possibly provide it, you will always get it. We have travelled to many holiday destinations the world over but this is definitely our favourite. There is as much or as little as you want to do. The pool is so warm and cool and never overcrowded. We went on the catamaran most days, weather permitting, and it was absolutely fantastic. The activities are ongoing all day. This year my husband even painted a picture!! If you are more energetic then you can always join in the fun in the sea or in the pool with organised activities. We had a beautiful suite overlooking the pool and reef. There was always something to look at when we were on the balcony. The room was cleaned perfectly daily, clean sheets and towels daily, and anything else you needed then you just ask for. The food was delicious and as much as you wanted to eat. If there was nothing you fancied then the chefs would try and oblige by cooking something special for you. There are some lovely places to visit in Bali - of course depending what you want to see - just book a taxi and you can go where you wish. There is a free hotel bus service every day, to the shopping centre. Hope to be back next year.
