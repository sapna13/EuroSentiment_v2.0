{"text":"Great Stay Stayed at the El San Juan hotel for 4 nights. The trip to the hotel is $22 by taxi and takes 5-10 minutes. Hotel: The hotel is very close to the airport but you do not see planes taking off and landing. Had a regular room, which was fine. The bathroom is very small and there are no balconies. Most of the rooms are not on the beach; you could see the ocean from our room if you looked to the left. There is a 24-hour supermarket down the street that has everything you need. The Supermarket is in a plaza that has a bank, a curves and a pharmacy. The supermarket sells all kinds of liquor, beer, and wine. We bought liquor and carried it into our room. The casino is small and deals blackjack abnormally, which gives them an additional edge. We went to the Ritz and played in their casino, its much larger, has more games, you can walk there or take a short cab ride. At night the hotel has live entertainment in the lobby. The drinks at the hotel are very expensive, $8 beers, $10 rum and cokes, $12 pool drinks, etc. Food:We had breakfast at Starbucks, which is in the lobby. For lunch we found a Mexican\/Spanish restaurant next door to the hotel that is owned by Ed Figueroa (first PRican to win 20 games in the major leagues, played for the 78 Yankees) and had great lunches there. For dinner we ate at The Palms in the hotel that was great as usual. We ate at a place called Risces in Old San Juan that was great (15 min cab ride) and a place down the street next to Burger King and across from the Intercontinental called Mi Casa (that may not be the whole name but its Mi something, has a white sign). Everything we ate was excellent. We also went to the rooftop bar\/restaurant at the El San Juan called Brother Jimmy's, they had great bar food (wings, quasadillas, etc). Pool:The pool is really nice; there are 2 main pools with plenty of seats. There is a swim up bar that opens around 11. The beach is nice also; it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ public so you can bring your own alcohol. Weather: The weather was perfect for 3 out of 4 days. One of the days it rained on and off for much of the day, the other days were sunny and very hot. There was a 6.1 magnitude earthquake when we were there, the hotel shook, but everyone was ok.Overall:The only thing I can think of that I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like was the smoking rules; you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ smoke anywhere except the beach or outside the front door. No smoking at the pool, in your room or the casino. This is a positive for most but if you like to smoke a cigar its somewhat of an inconvenience. Everyone we spoke to was from NY\/NJ or Boston so it was a good crowd (besides the Red Sox fans). The next time I go to PR I will stay at the El San Juan Hotel because its convenient, and the food is great.
