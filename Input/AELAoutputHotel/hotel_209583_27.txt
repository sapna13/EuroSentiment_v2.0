{"text":"FABULOUS, WONDERFUL, PARADISE Let me start by saying the Punta Cana airport is very hot but a nice experience. We did not have a hard time gettting our luggage. We got to the resort check in lasted about 10 minutes. The room was beautiful my room number was 2070 bloque 1. The air conditioner was ice cold when we walked in the room. The room was very clean and smelled good. The mini bar was stocked with everything. The food was great and a big selection. Do take imodium ad or pepto bismol. The beach is beautiful and the pool was awesome it feels as if the pools is on the beach that's how close the beach is. The staff is great hard working people they are there when you wake up and when you go to sleep. The resort is super clean and huge. The night entertainment is wonderful make sure you go to see the shows. This resort was great for me and my family. Both my daughters loved it ages 11, 6. I would go back in a minute. Those of you who like the pool make sure you wake up early by 7:45a.m. to go put towels on the pool chairs they go really fast. No need to worry in the beach always chairs they have plenty. Don't pay attention to the bad reviews it appears some people just can't be pleased. THIS RESORT IS TRULY PARADISE GO AND HAVE FUN YOU WILL NOT REGRET AND DON'T FORGET TO POST YOUR POSTIVE FEEDBACK THIS RESORT DESERVES IT ESPECIALLY THE STAFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
