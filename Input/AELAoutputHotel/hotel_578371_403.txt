{"text":"Dissapointing My fiance and I stayed at the Majestic for our honeymoon last week. I have to say we were greatly dissapointed. First of all, upon check in we were told they needed a document I didnt have and they charged me an additional $1000. This was supposed to be returned as soon as they sorted this out, but the return is still pending on my credit card. We had dinner our first night at the seafood restaurant (outside dining). This was the worst meal of the trip and we avoided this restaurant and the steakhouse (both outside) for the rest of our trip. We enjoyed the breakfast buffet and the Japanese restaurant. I tried to stick to local foods - Mahi Mahi is their local fish and always tasted fresh. The traditional dominican rice and beans were always seasoned well and fresh, we loved the churros served at breakfast. Our bed was terrible and the canopy fell down twice in the middle of the night. We also had a problem with face cloths (I noticed this came up in a previous post) we NEVER got them!! Finally the last day we received three. One morning we woke up to a blackout. There was no electricity or water for about 3 hours. This was very frustrating (and unsanitary). We enjoyed the pool, had fun kayaking and the animation team was pretty good (Although if I hear It's Raining Men one more time I will die.) It seemed very family oriented, I would consider returning one day when we have children if the food wasnt so bad. Oh - on our last day we saw a roach in our room. I was grossed out and ready to return home.
