{"text":"The quintessential Hyatt experience I travel frequently for business and am a bit ashamed to admit that after a long journey, I often get that home-sweet-home feeling when I walk into the Hyatt. This week, the Grand Hyatt Tokyo put out the welcome mat for me.While not nearly as opulent as the Park Hyatt, the hotel's cross-town cousin glamorized in the movie Lost in Translation, the Grand Hyatt will satisfy even the most discerning traveler. The hotel staff greets you at the door, eager to relieve you of your bags and escort you to check-in Once upstairs, the rooms look familiar to those who frequent the Hyatt -- dark wood accents, a 37'' flat screen TV and a comfortble restroom with sunken tub and pulsating shower. (Gotta love when they include a loofa!) After you've been out exploring, you'll return to turndown service that's a real treat. Upon entering your room -- lights dimmed, comforter folded down, soothing sounds coming from the CD player -- you'll look forward to crawling under the sheets and lulling yourself to sleep. Other hotel highlights include: --a full service gym with a wide range of cardio equipment and weights --a friendly concierge, armed with maps of the city and the metro, as well as restaurant recommendations galore (grab some sushi off the conveyor belt on the lower level of the Metro Hat building)--easy access to Roppongi Hills, Tokyo's premiere shopping plaza--close proximity to the Roppongi metro station on the gray line Just one disappointment to report: the breakfast options at the cafe are somewhat limited and uninspired. Otherwise, treat yourself to the Grand Hyatt and enjoy all Tokyo has to offer from one of the best hotels in the city.
