{"text":"delightful hotel and great location I stayed at the Covent Garden Hotel last weekend for my birthday. This hotel is in a superb location just off seven dials in Covent Garden and is gorgeous - how often I have had to sacrifice lovely rooms for great location. But at the Covent Garden Hotel (CGH) both were great. I also got a very warm √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢appy birthday√à√\u2020\u2022?at check in.The hotel is beautifully designed by Kit Kemp and each room is individual. Apparently Kit oversees every element in every room and I can certainly say that ours was lovely √à√\u2020\u2022?beautiful soft furnishings and lots of personality. The smellies broke from the boutique norm of Molton Brown and L√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©?ccitane with Miller Harris√à√\u2020\u2022?delightful range. The room was beautifully laid out with a cosy sofa and lovely lamps √à√\u2020\u2022?it felt very English in an unstuffy way. The bedroom was big by London standards and had a canopied (and very large) bed which was unexpected. I have stayed at the sister property the Charlotte Street Hotel which was equally lovely also. The CGH has a restaurant onsite and 24hr room service. Whilst we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat in the restaurant I can say that the food was good from room service (and prompt too!). We had drinks in the bar with friends before going out (to my birthday party) and on our return √à√\u2020\u2022?the cocktail menu is great and the wine list wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ all at the top end - a good mix in terms of price.Only downside √à√\u2020\u2022?we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have long enough to take advantage of all the bells and whistles, we were offered a complimentary massage which at any other time I would have leapt at! But I had a birthday party to go to. Also I found the bed a little bit hard although my husband thought it was spot on.Lovely stay and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be back.
