{"text":"Had a Great Time We stayed at the PC Princess from July 7th to July 14. We were 2 couples - Tommy  Joanie and Bobby  Denise. We were in building 5 #5106  #5004. We requested to be near each other but on arrival there was a problem. Bobby  Denise stayed in building 4. The next day we again complained  they moved them into bulding 5 to be near us. Of course we tipped the front desk. The rooms were clean  the refrig always stocked with plenty of beer. Even Budweiser that my husband requested along with Presidente  Soberana. We overlooked the pool  ocean view. We had the VIP plan which allows you to make reservations ahead of time for the restaurants which is a great idea. That was worth it. We did upgrade our 20 minute massage to 55 minutes  it was well worth it. The beds on the beach were great and the huts are too. Never had a problem getting a spot - plenty of space. The beach is gorgeous as is the ocean. Sometimes you did get sea weed but it never bothered us  the cleaning crew was always cleaning up. We did try to book the free motorized sport which was a boat ride but they told us it was booked for the week  we did this our 1st day there. So we weren't that happy about that. Our husbands went deep sea fishing  caught a marlin which made their trip great.We have been to the DR 5 times and love the people and the hotels. This resort was great because it wasn't too big like some of the others. You have the option to use all the facilities at the other 2 sister hotels which we did. We met people from all over the country (Atlanta,Georgia (Andrew , Nicky  friends)  Saratoga, NY. Also our friends from Canada - Sav  Leanne  Lena  Tom. Wonderful people. They made our week wonderful. The casino is nice. We had some fun there too. As for tipping - I noticed at this resort they were looking for tips all the time. We are all tippers but it seemed to be at times too much. Hands out a lot more than usual. But we tipped anway  made the best of it. The Pool was beautiful  again met great people there every late afternoon after the beach. The tram ride to the other hotels was a lot of laughs. Sometimes the driver went to fast  other times nice  slow. The food was average at this resort. Plently of food and a lot of choices. The lobster everyone said was great - me not liking seafood ate steak which was okay. You had plenty to eat and enjoy. I didn't care for the mixed drinks so drank plenty of water  once in a while a rum with diet coke. We agree we would return to this hotel in a few years because we did have soo much fun  liked mostly everythig about it. If anyone has questions, please fell free to e-mail me at trip advisor.
