{"text":"Worked well for us. Suggest renting a car. For starters, I booked this last year using Starpoints when the hotel was still a Westin. Fortunately, the Wyndham honored this. I believe I might have felt differently if I was paying big $$$ for the room.We rented a car through Budget at the airport. I highly recommend this. Puerto Rican drivers scared me a little.I think that the hotel is stunningly beautiful. The lobby has a great view of the beach and the Ocean. The grounds are impeccably maintained. The staff was very friendly and efficient.We stayed 5 nights in a junior suite. The interior of the room was great. However, as a previous poster said, our view was of the roof of the 4th floor- very bad. Also we had some constant noise from the AC units on the roof. If I had paid mucho $$, I would have complained, but I did not.The self parking was very poorly run. We paid $15\/day instead of $20\/day for valet. I did this because I did not want to have to tip every time we picked up the car. Every time we wanted to get the car, we had to have the ticket validated near the lobby, then go to the parking garage that took 2 elevators. A waste of time.The pool was great, and the beach pretty nice. We enjoyed going to the hot tub around 9 PM. We were usually the only people there.I like to play tennis and called the tennis center looking for someone to play with. They set me up with another guest which was great. Nice courts. Note: they charge $10 per rental of a racket so bring your own if you can.We avoided the hotel restaurants after reading so many comments about their excessive cost. Instead, we ate at local restaurants which we enjoyed. Lots of fried bananas.We took excursions on our own. We went horseback riding in the rainforest, hiked El Yunque, kayaked bio bay, snorkeled and visited Old San Juan. In each case, arranging things ourselves, and driving ourselves saved about 40% from what the hotel would charge. The bio bay was diminished by the full moon- beware. For us, the highlight was our first snorkeling trip. We used the Salty Dog. The captain and crew were terrific. The snorkeling was amazing.Also be advised that the concierges and towel collectors are hawking a timeshare presentation for Wyndham. We had heard about these and were curious, so we attended. The hotel offered breakfast, a 5 day 4 night future trip in either St. Thomas or Florida and either a couples spa treatment or $75 credit. They promised no high pressure. Our sales rep was long winded, but when we said no, so accepted it. The breakfast was a joke- water, coffee and packaged muffins. At checkout they had double charged me a few days for parking and cleared that up.All in all, we loved our trip and the hotel was a pleasure.
