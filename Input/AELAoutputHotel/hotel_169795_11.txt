{"text":"Great location at a good value Galeria Plaza is a great top-end hotel in the center of Mexico City. The hotel is ideally located in the Zona Rosa within two blocks of the Angel de la Independencia and Paseo de la Reforma. Its central location makes it very easy to get to the historical center or Chapultepec via taxi (40 pesos during the day) or Turibus (100 pesos for all day use). It is also withing walking distance of Avenida Insurgentes with its Metrobus transit system. The hotel has a taxi sitio in front.The hotel staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I accidentally booked my stay to arrive a day later than my actual arrival. The staff worked with Expedia.com to cancel my Expedia reservation (even though it was withing 24 hours I did not get a penalty) and then gave me a new reservation matching the Expedia rate. The concierge was always helpful and answered any questions we had.The rooms were spacious and comfortable. The entire floor we were in was non-smoking which was a pleasure, as many hotels in Mexico continue to permit smoking in all the rooms. Note that the beds in this hotel are somewhat harder than average. If you like extremely soft beds, this could be a problem.One final comment about the neighborhood. The Zona Rosa, is very hip and happening with lots of night life. However it is also the center of the gay community in Mexico City. The scene is equivalent to any major city in the U.S.; however, if this sort of thing bothers you, you may want to look for a different neighborhood altogether.Tip: When taking a cab from the airport, Galeria Plaza is in Zone 4, $152 pesos as of Nov 07.
