{"text":"Decent hotel, decent price...... Stayed for 5 nights in a delux room. We knew the hotel was a little out of the way, but felt the access to the bus to to\/from the airport and the fact that it was above the metro system was an advantage. Also like to get out and about in places that are not always in the centre of things. Hotel handy for shop accross the road for drinks snacks etc.We arrived very early (9.30am) and a room was not ready which we expected as the hotel was full from the night before, but the staff did all they could to find a room at the rate we had paid but none were clean,so we were offered a upgrade at a reducd rate to the club foor. We normally stay on the club foors but find ourselves increasingly cutting our day short to return for cocktails, and getting up for b\/fast when really just want a little lie in, so on this occasion we just booked a normal room at a good price for Tokyo. We waited with a coffee for just under an hour for a room to be ready.Room quite a good size, a little worn in places and quite drab in decoration. But everything you needed including a safe (which is in the bedside cabinet). Comfy bed, ok linen but the bathroom was a little dated but clean, shower over bath which was very low to stand under, although the toilet was an laugh as everyone knows who has been to Tokyo. All the bits and bobs you need in the bathroom as far as shampoo etc. were there. Only real gripe was the amount and size of towels, but you could ring up for more.Room faced the expressway which was well soundproofed from the traffic, although could hear bathrooms a little from other rooms. Eventhough we were next to the lifts we never heard them.Access to a tv come pc in the room with internet access was good, but you do pay if you use the internt on your on pc, which was fair enough.Shops below the hotel handy as well. Did not have b\/fast or use the bars but there was quite a selection of eating places in the hotel to choose from if needed.All in all we wanted a decent hotel at a fair price with easy acces to get around, which is what the Royal Park provided, if I was to go to Tokyo again, if the price was good we would stay again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":651,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":647},{"endOffset":686,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":682},{"endOffset":686,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":682},{"endOffset":936,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":930},{"endOffset":936,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":930},{"endOffset":936,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":930}]}
