{"text":"Ideal for Lads Weekend Away First things first, this is not the place to stay if you want a romantic break away with your partner, nor is it ideal for older travellers or those looking for a bit of comfort. However, if some of the previous reviewers had an bit of common sense they would have figured that out quite quickly from the price of the rooms. When you pay for a skoda don't expect a merc. This hotel does not make itself out to be anything other than what it is --- basic accomodation, (mainly) for young people looking to have a good time who are not too fussed about where they stay. If you're worried about decor and can afford to take the time to pick out all the faults in a place you've obviously got way too much time on your hands. The bed linen was clean, the bathroom\/toilets were spotless and the hotel was within walking distance of all the major attractions. The person who mentioned something about rats\/mice has obviously little understanding of a city thats primarily built upon a waterway system. Amsterdam is old and full of canals, no matter where you go it will be suseptible to rodents because of this. This is not a reflection on the hotel itself so much as the city structure as a whole --- personally we found no sign of any infestation. To sum up, this is not going to win any prizes for comfort, it is basic but it's clean where it needs to be and it's right in the city centre --- what more do you want?
