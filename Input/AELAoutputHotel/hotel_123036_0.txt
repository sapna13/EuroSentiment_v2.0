{"text":"Slightly Off the Standard I was in town for the Microsoft World Business Intelligence Conference. To save a little for our company and to keep with the expected standard, we chose the Hampton Inn Downtown. Most everything was right on where I would expect for a Hampton. The bed was great. The room was very clean as was all areas of the hotel. The front desk staff was excellent.Where this property fell a little was in a couple of areas. First, my high speed internet did not work. I relocated and still, it was down. I travel 2-3 times per month and do not have issues with my laptop. I proved this 2 days later in CT by hooking up at that hotel just fine. Hampton tried to right it but after the first move, I was uninterested in moving again as I have an air-card that I can use to connect. Second, the hot breakfast on our three mornings was just OK. They took the cheap route with plain scrambled eggs, etc. Other Hamptons (See Carmel, IN review) have omelets and other foods with a little extra pizazz. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate the free breakfast. It was good - just not in the uppr tier for Hamptons.Last, I think parking there is a pain. They have a garage with a low ceiling and Thrifty gave us a small SUV. Too many cars park in the ouside SUV spots instead of in the garage where they can actually go. They should take more care in regulating this. This is especially true since they charge $12 per night to park. Being just outside of the core downtown area, I think that is pretty steep.Overall, I would stay here again and am a loyal Hilton\/Hampton traveler. I think this property needs to find the extra 1% that will set this property out above the rest. ","annotations":[]}
