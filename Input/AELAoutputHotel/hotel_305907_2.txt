{"text":"out of city center, but decent i had a difficult time figuring out how to get to this hotel. but that is more an issue with the system at the airport - than the hotel itself. this is a really nice hotel. the concierge desk people were very good. and the rooms are good. during my stay the first two nigths were great. but on the third night, the night before my big presentation the next day - a couple with a screaming baby moved in next door! so i just sucked it up and went to do my presentation. when i returned i politely inquired to the front desk if i could change rooms... but i wanted a comparable room (wouldn't mind an upgrade for the trouble of packing a day early essentially). so front desk said okay. then i was taken to my new room -- smaller and further from elevator! in addition, the new room had two burned out lamps and lacked a bathrobe. i don't usually use the latter, so no big deal, but you get my point that they don't pay attention to details. so i told front desk i was not happy. they just said whatever and offered to give me the original room back! so basically, i was inconvenienced, and when i politely addressed the issue = i was downgraded (at same price). they insisted the smaller room had a better view?!?! so, i guess i would describe them as a 3 star in four star clothing. in a pinch, good place = because new town plaza is attached; so you can pretty much get anything you want from there, and the MTR has a station in the plaza. also, bus A41 goes right to the front of the hotel. and at the time i stayed there is was a HK$21 trip = good value. the other thing, my original room faced the apartment complex and i got free wifi. when i was put in my new romm, poof, no wifi. and the price for getting the internet is HK$100 a day.
