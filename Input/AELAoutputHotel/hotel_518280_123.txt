{"text":"Highly recommended! My husband and I spend Labor Day weekend in NYC. We found Hotel QT through tripadvisor and also various recent publications. Hotel QT was modern, fresh, the free breakfasts were AWESOME and the service was great too! Can't beat the location. We orig booked an E room for $220\/night, but got ugraded to a B room. Although the room was still small, the furnishings maximized the space. The platform around the bed created seating space, and the deep window ledges allowed for some storage space. I loved the two huge windows in the room looking toward times square (we had a corner room). I was really impressed with the iHome unit they had, so we could play our iPod in the room. The shower was amazingly large, and I liked the separate shower\/sink\/toilet areas. I agree with the previous posts - a place to hang wet towels would've been nice, but we made do with what we had.My appreciation for Hotel QT grew even more when we moved to the Comfort Inn Midtown for our last night (we used a free nights' stay at Comfort Inn). Comfort Inn is noticeably older. The room was about the same size as Hotel QT's E room, but felt smaller b\/c of the traditional furniture. The bathroom was TINY compared to Hotel QT. Perhaps, though, this isn't a fair comparison since Hotel QT's B room is considerably more expensive than Comfort Inn's.For our next trip to NYC, we will definitely look into staying at Hotel QT again. If you can afford it (ie, get hold of the lower rate rooms), go for it! Otherwise, Comfort Inn Midtown isn't *too* bad of a second choice.
