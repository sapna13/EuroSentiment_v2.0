{"text":"Excellent Stay Stayed at the Meriton World Tower for 3 nights from the 26th September. Booked a 3 bedroomed apartment to cater for 5 people and was not disappointed. All rooms were lareg with the main bedroom ensuite fantastic. Great place to stay for a family wanting space and privacy should you want a bit of time out. Kitchens were very well equipped and great as there was a Coles Food Store on the basement level of the complex. But if you did decide that you wanted to eat out, then you could take advantage of a huge choice of eateries close by to the Meriton. View was absolutely stunning - we did not feel the need to pay to go to the top of the Sky Tower to get the same view.Rooms were very very clean, staff at check in and check out were courteous, friendly and profressional - even when dealing with a rather demanding obnoxious guest checking in the same time as us. Facilities i.e. pool, spa, gym great.  Found the location to be excellent - only found it a 20min walk to Circular Key and this was only due to the fact that there were so many people on the streets it slowed you down. But close by to Market, Darling Harbour, which also could be accessed by Monorail. In all this was an excellent choice and absolute value for money for our short family stay in Sydney. In amongst the hustle and bustle of the city, but once you escape to your apartment you are surrounded by the peace and tranquility of your own space. Would definitely recommend and stay here again.
