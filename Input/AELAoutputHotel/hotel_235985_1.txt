{"text":"Great place, A few minor hiccups Hotel Porta Faenza is situated right in the heart of Florence, walkable to all the major attractions of the city as well as the train station. However, it was a bit tricky to find as you have to understand the utterly bizarre numbering system for street addresses in Florence (businesses in Black, homes in Red, or the other way around, I forget √à√\u2020\u2022?and two unrelated sets of numbers, Google Maps even puts it in the wrong place) √à√\u2020\u2022?and we found the wrong #77 and had to call the hotel to be redirected. However, this wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a very big deal and once we got there we were very pleased with the superb staff (exceptionally good English speakers, very US tourist friendly) who helped us immensely as we got oriented to the city. The room was very clean, very cozy and nicely decorated √à√\u2020\u2022?oh, and internet access was free, a rare treat. The bathroom was lovely as well, though the water, it seemed, was √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢ard water,√à√\u2020\u2022?with a bit of a sulfuric smell. It wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ overwhelming, but if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e sensitive to that, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ certainly noticeable\/worth mentioning. The other problem was that the shower was small and leaky and I realized too late that it caused me to flood the bathroom! We soaked up the water with our remaining towels, and went about our day. We were bummed out when we came back and saw that no one had cleaned the room! We called the front desk and asked for more towels (the bathroom was dry by now but we had no towels left) √à√\u2020\u2022?and they gladly brought them and seemed very surprised and distressed that our room had not been serviced, so I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ imagine this is a regular occurrence. We were only there the two nights, so I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure they would have taken care of it the next day if we had been staying longer. The breakfast buffet was generous and delicious. Overall we had a great time in Florence and enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Porta Faenza, despite the hiccups which I can only imagine are the product of a relatively new hotel (I think??) getting the kinks worked out. All that said, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° still recommend it pretty highly if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a reasonably priced place to stay that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ in the center of everything, and has the feel, if not the finesse, of a higher-priced place.
