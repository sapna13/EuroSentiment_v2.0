{"text":"3rd time and still great Spent Christmas at the Melia Caribe Tropical and found the Hotel gets better each time. I don't know why anyone can complain about this Hotel, the staff were absolutely wonderful, extremely friendly and with emailing the Hotel before hand got the exact room I requested. The checkin was painless we drunk champayne while we were given our keys etc and then taken to our room by golf cart. We did not go Royal Service as we have always found everything to be first rate anyway. The room was the nearest to the beach, infact the view from our terrace was the beach. The room was spotlessly clean with clean towels everyday. Booking the many restaurants each day was no problem, we booked them from our room around 5pm each day. My favourite ones were the American Grill and the Mexican. Did not think the Japanese was that good and the French ones did not like at all. Overall I found the food very good and could always find something I liked. Why do people think this Hotel is too big?. When I go on vacation to Europe I do not go to one bar each night or one restaurant, I have a walk round and visit several. All I can think is these people do not like to walk.and prefer to stay in one place for the duration of their vacation.Having spent 15 or more vacations in Dom Rep I can certainly recommend this Hotel. I think its one of the best. ","annotations":[]}
