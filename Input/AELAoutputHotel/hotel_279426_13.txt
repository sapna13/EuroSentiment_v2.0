{"text":"Avoid Adagio This hotel is NOT worth the money. Listed on many sites as a 4 star hotel- it could not be farther from the truth. Its true that the lobby is beautiful, but your not STAYING in the Lobby! We paid $160 a night, for an executive suite for 5 days, a rate we found on hotels.com. The pictures (and verbal description on their website and hotels.com) explained that these rooms are 400+ sq ft, with sleeper sofas, updated bathrooms, expansive views, etc. This was not the case. Yes, we were on the 16th floor, but the room was small and the bathroom was straight up gross! There were multiple challenges that, should they happen in a four star hotel, would have been met with accommodation and courtesy- something that hotel adagio did not offer. They did not notify us that there was a annual scheduled fire alarm for the time we were there, and while getting ready to go out to eat for our anniversary- I had to walk down 16 flights of stairs in heels. Our electricity randomly shut off (including a\/c) six different times and twice random people entered our room while we were hanging out (the front desk had issued our room to other guests giving them access keys by mistake). Another important thing to note is that they do not clean the rooms. The bathrooms were filthy. They did not replace the soaps or clean anything in the room- other than change the sheets. We had mexican take out food the night before, and when we came back the next day (after the room had been cleaned) the food was exactly where it was when we left. There is NO WAY I would recommend this hotel and I would not stay in the hotel again. ","annotations":[]}
