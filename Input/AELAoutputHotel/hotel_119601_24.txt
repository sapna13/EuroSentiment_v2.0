{"text":"So Quiet! So Friendly! Our stay was so quiet, we were very surprised! Be sure to request a room in the back...Mouton Street side. They really do keep good tabs on your requests because we didn't once have to remind them about anything. It was all there waiting for us. The rooms were a good size and so was the bathroom. The room was also very clean and the bed was comfortable. The view was an alley way, but we did not stay for the view. We stayed to spend the weekend in the city and sleep soundly at a good price.I cannot tell you how nice the front desk people are. Check in\/check out was a very fast experience. These people are prepared! It's they had been waiting for you to walk through the door all day. Wonderful! We are so very glad we stayed here and will stay here again. It was a very good deal. We also felt very safe there. Something that I have not felt in other motels on Lombard or in other parts of the city. This motel is close to everything and one block away from a major bus line that takes you through the heart of the city. Shopping is also close by. Union St is a must to look around. Perry's is a great place to eat breakfast as well. It's only three or so blocks away and the desk people let us park our car after we checked out just so we could experience Perry's. Parking here is safe and free! ","annotations":[]}
