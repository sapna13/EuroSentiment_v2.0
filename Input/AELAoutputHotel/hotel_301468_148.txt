{"text":"Nice hotel but location not so great The Mandarin is a great hotel but the location does let it down. Whilst for business guests I guess this is not so much of a problem, but for tourists who have a few days, I would not recommend this place so much unless they got to grips pretty quickly with the transport options.Hotel itself, cannot fault. We didn't get any Molton Brown toiletries that I read of in one review - maybe this is just for Club guests? Incidentally the hotel tried very hard to flog this option to us - it just didn't seem to make economic sense. The breakfast was wonderful but we found the restaurant prices obscenely expensive. Made the mistake of eating at Mortons one night (we'd left it very late to eat, our feet hurt too much to go out and it was the only place that would take us at 1030pm at night in the hotel) and I was shocked by the rip-off prices. S$ 20 for a Martini, when you can get a fabulous one with views to boot at New Asia Bar at the Swisshotel for S$12? S$35 for one tiny crab cake? I refused on principle to order a main course as I felt that to charge those sort of prices for something that would cost a quarter of the price outside was taking the michael. Service was annoyingly American, with waiters wanting to 'present' the menu to us instead of just letting us read the menu! Next thing they will be giving a slideshow. Plus they never let us alone for a minute. Not the place for a romantic dinner.The concierge was not well informed on bus routes - I guess he is more used to helping business guests and hailing cabs. We wanted a bus to the Orchid Gardens and was told that there was only 1 bus that didn't quite go as far - not true. Luckily the bus driver helped out and put us right. There's a bus that takes you right there BTW.This leads me to the location. Not great for tourists. Whilst you can walk, in the sapping heat that's not always an option. City Hall MTR is about 10 mins away and not much use if you want to go to Chinatown or the Quays as this involves a nightmare change at Doby Ghaut. My recommendation is to go across the road and get a bus from Esplanade Mall. The bus maps are easy to work out, they are cheap, and air conditioned! First 2 days we used taxi, then graduated to MTR, but finally worked out the buses were the best way to go. There are loads of buses that go direct to Orchard Road.Next time we visit Singapore, we'd choose the Fullerton. Great hotel in a very central location.Don't bother going to Raffles for the Singapore Sling - what a disappointment and waste of money! DO visit the Swisshotel on Stamford Road and head to New Asia Bar for great cocktails at sunset. We enjoyed Clarke Quay area very much at night, and had the most wonderful brunch at Marmalade Pantry in the Palace Renaissance mall on Orchard Road. Shops don't open until around 1030\/11am, so it's great to go there for a late breakfast before the shops open.
