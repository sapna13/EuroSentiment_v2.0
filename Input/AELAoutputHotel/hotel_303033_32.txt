{"text":"Impressive place but ...... I stayed at the Ayodya Resort Dec 22 √à√\u2020\u2022?28, 2006. Occupancy was ridiculously low and the place felt empty. Generally, the resort presents an impressive fa√ã√©?ade. However, it appears that the rooms and general facilities are suffering due to the striking downturn in occupancy seen throughout Bali. We stayed in a Grande Ocean View Room (actually we had two rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?since we are a family of four). Although very clean, the rooms are dated and due for refurbishing. Beds were comfortable. Negatives - only petty things really. Grande Ocean View room occupants are to receive a fruit basket on arrival √à√\u2020\u2022?we did not receive one even after calling the front desk. Should also have received 20 min of free internet access per room in the business center each day √à√\u2020\u2022?had to argue with staff to avoid being charged. There is no ATM (cash machine) in the hotel which is unbelievable given its size and relatively isolated location. Breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?Sorry, but certainly not up to par with a hotel of this stature. There is a buffet breakfast provided but it is very, very basic in nature when compared to other similar hotels throughout Asia.Positives √à√\u2020\u2022?We enjoyed the large pool with plenty of loungers. The beach was very clean and the small group of vendors was kept at bay by a very clear delineation between the grassed hotel grounds and the sand beach. Vendors were not allowed to come on to the grass and pester the guests, although they did their best to pester guests from the sand !! The gardens, sculptures, waterfalls and lagoons are fantastic. Disregard the earlier comment regarding swimming in the lagoons. These lagoons are of course man made but have naturalized and are a very beautiful and unique part of the overall landscape master plan. There are birds, fish, lizards and other harmless things living in the lagoons which give the property a more authentic feel.The staff were generally well behaved √à√\u2020\u2022?no complaints there. Overall we enjoyed out stay at the Ayodya. I was sorry to see the low occupancy and know that the hotel must be struggling to maintain standards. ","annotations":[]}
