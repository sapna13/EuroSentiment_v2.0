{"text":"Interesting I booked this hotel for the first 3 nights of a 5 night stay, as the last 2 nights were paid for at the Pan Pacific. I selected this hotel based on the review sbut when I arrived I was initially disappointed. The lobby looked great in the photos but was a bit dated when inspected in person. Staff were very helpful but when I got to the room I thought it was a bit small. The room had been recently renovated and all the fittings were good. The bathroom was spacious but the room had a very strange feature. There was a huge window from the bathroom into the main room. There is a blind that you can pull down for privacy but the issue is a night, if one person goes to the bathroom and turns on the light then the entire room is filled with light. If you want a room with a view, good luck. I would check when you book your room as the only room with a view are the front rooms that face Scott St. Internet access was free, which was great and the hotel is well located for people planning to shop around Orchard Road as it can be hard to grab a cab in the area on the weekend but you can walk back to your hotel. Also the free mini bar was a nice feature. If you want to base yourself near restaurants then I would pick somewhere else. This place is a good location for shopping and bars\/nighclubbing.An interesting point is that this hotel is owned by the Sultan of Brunei, so it tends to have a large percentage of Muslim guests. You will find a copy of the Qur'an instead of a bible. This is not a criticism - just an observation.I moved from this hotel to the Pan Pacific where the rooms were much bigger, with great views, but were far more dated and they charged for internet access, etc. If I was going back I would probably choose Royal Plaza for value over the Pan Pacific.
