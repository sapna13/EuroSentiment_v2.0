{"text":"The most amazing staff! We just spent 8 days at these hotel with 2 kids and I have to tell you how amazed we are by the service we received. The staff of this hotel is amazing, paying attention to every detail and request we had and the concierge was very helpful in booking our day trips. At times I ordered something for my room before I got in the elevator and it was delivered 2 minutes later. The room was impecable with a beautiful view of the city. The bed and pillows were very comfortable and the A\/C was fantastic. The bathroom has everything you need for shaving,a comb and nice shampoo and conditioner plus creams and many other things. The location is also very nice if you take the time to explore the area. First of all you have Ginza in a 15 minute walking distance and two metro stops that will take you anywhere. Do not be afraid to use the metreo because it's easy to learn (fo;;ow the color for the line you need and the number for the station) and every station has an attendant who speaks english and gives directions. If you stay at this hotel, always get off on the 3rd floor and use the overpass to get to your metro or walking destination. You have an AM PM across the street for water, fruit, beer and many restaurants in the building next door for dinner or take out.Again, for the money you are getting a very nice staff and a great room. Enjoy Tokyo!
