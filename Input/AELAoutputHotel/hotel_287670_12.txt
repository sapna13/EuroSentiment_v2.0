{"text":"nice hotel but one rotten apple on the staff Banys is a good choice for so many things--location, price, cleanliness, etc. The rooms are spare but stylish and comfortable. Another nice touch is that they supply free bottled water and fruit. There is no need to pay extra for the breakfast. There are cafes on either side of the hotel where you can get a good breakfast for a fraction of the price. We were a party of seven, with four rooms. After one night we decided to switch rooms--my aunt and uncle were going to move into our room and my husband and I were moving to a different room. This was okayed by the front desk. Someone told us the room number we'd be moving to and that we could move our luggage there. It was still being cleaned, but the maid let us bring the luggage in. My aunt and uncle brought their luggage to our old room. While my husband was down the street somewhere, I was waiting in the hall for the room to be ready, which was just supposed to take a couple more minutes. Then I heard angry footsteps approaching from the elevator. It was another guy from the front desk who was in a fury because we had already put our luggage in the room. He yelled at me in Spanish and broken English (including the word stupido) and then stormed off to shout at my aunt, who was waiting in the lobby. He was angry because we had moved our luggage into the rooms before they were ready. My husband, who is fluent in Spanish, talked to him afterward and told him he had overreacted and that he shouldn't have yelled at us, that we had been told we could move the luggage. He gave my husband a grudging, ungracious apology. A couple of days later my uncle observed him yelling at another hotel guest in the lobby. We all wondered why this person chose a career in the customer service industry.
