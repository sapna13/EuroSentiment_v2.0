{"text":"Good for families We just returned from a 4 night summer stay at the Pointe. At the summer rate of $99 per night this hotel is a great deal and good for families. The 2-room suites are very much in the Embassy Suites style and quality. Nothing special, but nice to have the extra space for either a family or business traveler (I wouldn't call it resort quality). We requested and got a pull out sofa in the living room for the kids. It also had a small, but nice, balcony. Perfect for watching the amazing monsoon thunderstorms. The swimming pools are great for kids. The restaurant by the pool is nothing special, but perfect for a relaxing lunch or dinner while the kids swim. They call the Falls a water park. It's really just 2 big swimming pools and one water slide. Not a water park, but still, a great place to swim for my kids that aren't around pools much and it's easy to keep an eye on them. The resort has a nice little work-out room, but unfortunately they charge an extra $10 per day to use it. The best thing about the resort is that it sits on the Phoenix desert preserve. You can hike for miles, right from the hotel, in beautiful natural desert. Yes, you can also play golf and tennis, but the desert is a real treat. The down side of this hotel is that the restaurants are very expensive. I guess that it to be expected, but if you don't want to spend the money, there many inexpensive places within a short drive (great inexpensive Mexican food just a few blocks south on 7th street).
