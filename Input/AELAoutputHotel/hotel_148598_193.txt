{"text":"Stay but BEWARE! My wife and I celebrated our 15th wedding anniversary in seperate beds. We booked our room through Expedia and requested a King bed. Upon arrival we were given a room with two queen beds. We sleep in a King at home and were unable to sleep in the same bed in the hotel. Bumping into each other, down conforter was too hot... We called to complain and were quickly dimissed by the front desk person, claiming, there is nothing we can about this, I'm very sorry. End of story. I asked for the Hotel Mgr and got his assistant, Benjamin. He explained a few things and offered to keep his eye on a King room should one come available, it never did, not even a call. So I suspect that booking through expedia was not apealing to them so they chose not to give us the room but another guest. So be it. The valet staff is not good at doing there job. You almost have to instruct them in how to do it properly. The staff is in need of proper trainging in how to charm guests into falling in love with the property and its ambience. Rizt Carlton \/ Four Seasons style.The restaurants are ridiculously under cost food wise. I won't complain about price because the price points are fine. The quantities\/quality are no where close. I'm not a quantity focused person. I recognize quality, I'm a Chef  Restaurant owner. On a good note, the grounds are spectacular. The tennis courts are very nice. The beach is very private and well kept. Overall, the tangibles are good the intangibles is where they need to improve. We did not like the local restaurant Antojitos Puertoriquenos, very overpriced for dinner. The owner worked for the resort as a Tennis Pro, he must've gotten tips on how to gouge customers from the Food  Bev. Mgr. Go to Palmer Bakery for a real experience, it's rough around the edges but the food is Spectacular for what you pay. The Pork, Roasted Chicken, the sandwiches, yucca, its all great. It's across the light on the way to El Yunque, right past the gas station. The service is as gracious as it gets. Good cheap pastries also. RENT A CAR! Rent a CAR! Do it at the airport.! I called ahead for a pick up at the airport and they sounded so nice over the phone, Si senor, no hay problema...Wham $240 for four people R\/T! Ouch, I was livid. No mention of this at all when I called two days earlier. I canceled the return trip and rented a car. Do it at the airport its easy and fast, we used Budget, $173 for four days.Old San Juan is a total rip off when it comes to food, its pretty mediocre and the prices are stupid. El Toro Salao is pathetic, no exageration. DO NOT GO. A great restaurant is Ramiros. You will love everything about it. Exceptional service, spot on saucing and excellent desserts.La Parilla in Luqillo is pretty good. The fruit shakes at the little stand up the road in El Yunque are really good. You'll see the cut-outs for photos and a small gift shop. Richies Restaurant up a ways from the resort alon 968(?) I think has a great view go for lunch, not dinner. Stay away from the Hilton, not good. Well I hope I've helped, we will be back. Oh, go horseback riding, book through the Concierge. Also do not miss El Yunque, unreal! Enjoy.
