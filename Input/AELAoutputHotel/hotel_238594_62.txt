{"text":"MonteCarlo lives up to its great reviews We spent 4 nights (Post Cruise) at the MonteCarlo and loved the hotel. Our room (202) was one of the refurbished rooms. (Staff told us the second and fifth floors had been redone.) The room was large, had a sitting room, a small balcony overlooking Las Ramblas and a large bath. It had new wood floors, quality contemporary furnishings, adjustable bed (fun to sit up and read or watch TV at night), in-room safe, mini-bar, nice closet with storage shelves, a shelf for luggage, two flat screen TVs, nice quality linens and pillows, two bed lights for reading, etc. The sitting room had a wonderful bay window overlooking Las Ramblas.  Watching the action on the street is great fun. The noise is NOT an issue since the hotel has used electric rolling shutters, double sets of doors and a heavy door between the sitting room and bedroom to block the sound. We slept great.The bath had high end decor and fixtures - interesting stone counters, walls and surrounds, high-end Grohe fixtures, whirlpool tub, shower, bidet, toilet, a good hair dryer, bath scales and the usual nice toiletries. Everything you could want was provided.The staff speaks English and are outstanding. They willingly make restaurant reservations, provide help with transportation, maps, and other info. The housekeeping is very quiet and out of sight but excellent. The room was immaculate always. They never knocked on our door and distrubed us to clean. They simply always came while we were gone.We frequently used the free computer with internet in the lobby and took advantage of the breakfast buffet ($11 euros). We appreciated that it stayed open until 11 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. on weekends.We plan to go again to the MonteCarlo. It is very user-friendly and a great place to stay. It could not be in a more convenient location for everything (metro, bus, taxis, tourist sights, restaurants, grocery store, fun and action), and the staff and service are terrific.
