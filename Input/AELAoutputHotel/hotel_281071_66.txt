{"text":"The reasons to stay at the MO Look, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not quite a Ritz Carlton or Four Seasons experience in terms of service and employee talent level but there are plenty of reasons to pay the money and stay at the Mandarin Oriental. Plenty. Such as:Location: At Columbus Circle across the street from Central Park. Easy walking commute to all the areas you want to be in midtown and great sightlines in a spectacular building.The mall\/ Whole Foods: The MO lobby is on the 35th floor of a skyscraper that houses a nice mall with four or five high-end restaurant choices and an enormous Whole Foods with a large selection of prepared foods. If it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ unusually cold out or raining, this is an invaluable perk. We went downstairs in the morning (well, my wonderful wife did) and got great, organic breakfast items and we ate them in our room, saving tons in the process.The lobby lounge: Plenty has been written here and none of it exaggerates the view and the atmosphere. Awesome.The room: Bigger and better than many NYC high-end hotel rooms. Fantastic view. Well appointed and functional. Top notch. Modern but classy. Bathroom was superb.Gym: Small but free, which is not the norm in many hotels these days. Good cardio equipment with TV√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ in them. Excellent indoor lap pool. We booked through Platinum Am Ex and received a room upgrade, a 4 PM checkout, a $100 spa voucher and continental breakfast each morning. All for $630 or so. Well worth it. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe recently stayed at both RC√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ in NYC and The Sofitel and enjoyed them all but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be MO from now on for us.
