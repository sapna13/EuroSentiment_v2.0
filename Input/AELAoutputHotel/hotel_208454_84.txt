{"text":"Special Break in a good hotel A Hotel that lives up to its reviews, rooms were clean and serviced twice a day and had no problems, the bed is one of the best I have ever slept in. This trip was for 8 days for our silver wedding aniversary and whilst we were given a room on the 19TH floor the free champagne enjoyed by others never arrived even though they were advised. Free internet access in lounge was great, reception helpful and efficient, doorman good, bell boys to busy chatting most of the time. One of the conseirge team was a little up himself but generally good.The hotel is expensive even on a deal but well worth it as room was a good size and bathroom was what europeans expect, nice and big and seperate shower was excellent. Lots of hot water all the time.Did not try the Red Flame as there are lots of places to have breakfast, Grand Central is worth it for one morning and its just 2 blocks away. Another favourite was Cuttichines at the Rockerfella Centre for those who want a healthier option.If you do Staten Island Ferry make sure you are on the right hand side or front or end otherwise you miss the statue of LibTips, do Brooklyn Bridge at Night the views are unforgettable, do top of the Rock as that way you can photograph empite state building, however disappointed with evening views as we did a dawn and dust ticket. Dinner between 6  8 is hectic and for lunch try one of the deli's by Bryant Park and sit in the park and watch the world go by.
