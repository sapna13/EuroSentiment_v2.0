{"text":"Great Resort.....just some minor changes needed. We recently returned from our trip to D.R. It was my first trip to a Non-english speaking country so I had prepared myself for an adventure. Overall my fiancee and I had an absolutely wonderful time. The service was great, the drinks were good (Im not much of a drinker so it was mostly wine and a rum tonic or as they say ron tonic for me) and the disco was really fun as well. The property in my opinion is bigger than most. I think they were going for a more tropical feel and I think they did a good job. They had many different animals around the property like peacocks, ducks, woodpeckers, swallows and many different types of fish. It is a huge property but they do provide a little shuttle service that runs a route on the resort that will take you to the reception area from your room or you could choose to walk through the mangroves for a scenic route that took us about 5-10 mins. because my fiancee kept stopping.To maximize your stay I would suggest a couple of things,1) Get the V.I.P package. We felt as if we got a little extra from our trip than what most people were telling us who didnt get the package. Plus if you're not used to their drinks having a cold heneiken or a glass of bailey's as my fiancee did really makes a difference. And you would have to pay extra without the V.I.P package.2) If you dont do this already, prebook your seats. Its ok going down but coming back it gets tricky. I had one couple who acually ended up with one sitting in the fron of the plane and the other way at the back. Trust me its one less thing to worry about.3) Tip the staff. I know a lot of people have a problem tipping especially when we already paid what we paid for the trip. But common sense will tell you that with the many workers that they have its hard to monitor good customer service. And dont panic, it does not have to be much. I took about $50 US in singles and the most I tipped one person was $3 and we felt like royalty. Was that fair? Maybe not, but we just added that to the cost of our vacation and everyone was happy plus remember too that this is a poor country and the money you spent on the trip doesnt go to them directly so a litle bit to us, goes a long way to them.4) You dont have to get a safe. They charge $4US a day or $25 flat for the week. We didnt do that. We just locked everything up in our suitcase when we left the room and everything was fine and plus we left a $1tip for the same housekeeper everyday and she was really nice to us.5) Bring small bills. The biggest bill we brought were $20's. You will have a very difficult time getting anything larger changed.6) Be prepared for very little English. Im surprised that some people get upset at this. You're going to a non-english speaking country, just try to sit back and enjoy yourself. Also there are a lot of Europeans, especially French. So you're surrounded by Spanish and French all the time but the French isn't so bad, its kinda like being back home in Toronto.Those are the major things. If you can do them I pretty much guarantee that you will have a great time as we did.
