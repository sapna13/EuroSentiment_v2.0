{"text":"wonderful city, wonderful hotel We chose the Fairmont for a 10 day holiday stay because of its location and a good price for a 5 star hotel. (and after reading reviews on Trip Advisor) It didn't disapoint in any way. We previously stayed at the Sheraton Towers 4 years ago and enjoyed that, but wanted a more central location for 10 days. It was a wonderful experience, we felt so relaxed after our stay in SIngapore and that was certainly due to the Fairmont. We will definetly return next year for another holiday in this wonderful city. Many friends had said 10 days was a long time in SIngapore, but we still haven't been to the zoo, Changi or Sentosa, so there is plenty to do there!Our room was on the 21st floor (quick lifts) in the South Tower. Very comfortable and quite spacious with a view on the pool side looking out towards the Padang. The Raffles City Shopping Mall attached is lovely, with a sensational Japanese restaurant bazzar downstairs.The turndown service was great, lovely to come back each night to tidy room, soft lights and music and fresh towels. The bathroom was good, large with a goood sized bath, and a good shower that did splash a bit onto the rest of the floor. The airconditioner was silent and easily adjustable from the bedside console, as were the curtains and lights. Our room came with breakfast included and we alternated between the more traditional restaurant and the poolside buffet, service was personable and very responsive. We felt very well cared for. The buffets were wonderful, fresh tropical fruit juices individually prepared, cooked western breakfast on demand and Chinese and Malay fare with a wonderful array of pastries, the fresh fruits were outstanding. Breakfast on til 11 am as well helped jetlagged guests from Australia!The Fairmont staff were always welcoming and responsive. We had an extended checkout until 4 on the day we were leaving, and the offer of using the courtesy lounge by one of the staff whilst we were sitting in the foyer with our suitcases waiting for a taxi.Cleaning staff were always evident, and housekeeping responsive to our requests for cleaning whilst we were at breakfast. Sheets crisp and changed daily, (only on the last day of 10 days was a card left to say if we didn't need sheets changed to leave card on the bed, sure more water could've been saved!)My husband swam every afternoon in the circular pool on the 8th floor, never too crowded and for some reason a pleasant breeze blowing!Position is wondeful, CityHall MRT is at Raffles City Shopping Mall which is attached to the Fairmont. We walked every day, walking distance to the National Museum, History Museum, Peranakan Museum all highly reccommended. Easy MRT to Chinatown, Little India, Arab Quarter, Orchard Rd, Newton Food Markets, and on and on. Across the street is Raffles with a nice bakery, and good range of restaurants and bars. As you can see we loved the city and the hotel experience was a great one, perhaps the South Tower made the difference for us to the previous post, but thanks to TRipAdvisor we had read previously that the South Tower was the way to go. We will return.
