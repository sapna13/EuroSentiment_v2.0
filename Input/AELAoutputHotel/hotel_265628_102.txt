{"text":"Fun and casual, important things done right! Stayed here for holy week in March 2008. Much has been said before so I'll just touch on the areas I feel necessary:Flew Air Transat out of Canada, flight delayed approx 2 hours, otherwise greatCheck-in, room not available right away, came back in 1 hour and it was ready.Rooms, very basic but clean. We requested king bed but got 2 doubles, not a big deal, pushed them together. Brought our own pillows and I would highly recommend this, made for good sleeps. Maid service was good. Towel art left for us on 2 days out of 7, fridge always restocked.Food at buffets was good, nice variety and well cooked\/presented, A la cartes, tried all except steakhouse and gourmet. Liked the Mexican and Japanese the best. Seafood\/Mediterranean was terrible. Lunch at the beach bbq was fantastic, buffet lunches there also good. Soft serve ice cream available, yummy.Beach, as we are used to in Punta Cana, beautiful. Powdery light sand, turquoise water. Windy on most days, water too strong to swim in the ocean on 2 of our days but didn't affect our stay. Unlike Bavaro beach, there is no resort directly next to the Sirenis on either side. Walk for about 20 mins either way and you'll encounter Dreams on the right and Excellence on the left. Beach seemed endless for walking.Pool, we didn't use it much but it was nice with shallow and deeper sections, nice pool bar.Animation: Exceptional! They worked very hard to entertain us and chat. Good variety of activities for all ages. They go from 10 am to 1 pm at the beach. Then break til 3 pm when they come back from 3-5 with more activities at the pool and beach. Kudos to them for a job well done.Service...this is where this resort truly shines. All the staff are phenomenal. From the waiters to the busboys to the reception to the entertainers and bartenders. These people must love their jobs because they're all very happy and happy to help. We tipped here and there, giving more to the people we saw regularly who really took care of us but service seemed great regardless of whether you tipped or not.Nightly Entertainment: Very good and varied. Fantastic dancers and good humour one night with audience participation act. House band sings in the lobby each night and again after the nightly show. They do their best with the same 10 songs. Keep your ears open for the oddest sounding version of Every Breath You Take you've ever heard! hahaNightclub: Drinks are not free here for all guests, only certain bracelets get free drinks from specific tour operators. Good music, good atmosphere, fun disco.Drinks are good, most had a good amount of alcohol in them. Local liquor though, not much top shelf stuff. I heard that if you ask for Bacardi and Dewalt's etc, you'll get it. I'm not a huge drinker so I was perfectly happy. My husband, being more of a connaisseur, would have enjoyed more top shelf stuff.This is a very solid low-glitz 4 star resort with amazing staff. Don't expect too much in the way of luxury, especially in your room, but you'll have a blast. If you don't have fun, it's not because they didn't try their best. The size of the resort is perfect. The guests come from all over and people watching here is fun. My husband and I loved this place, we found it to be both fun and relaxing and would return in a heartbeat.
