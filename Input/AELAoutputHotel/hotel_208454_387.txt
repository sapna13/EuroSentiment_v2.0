{"text":"Excellent This is a GREAT four star hotel. I think it's important to clarify that -- it's a FOUR STAR hotel. It's totally not the Four Seasons or anything else that is five star, so I don't understand why people go there expecting it to be at that level. However, if you accept that it's a four star hotel, you'll probably find it's the BEST four star hotel in Manhattan.Stayed there for a week during late March this year, and had an absolutely lovely time. Absolutely no dramas during our stay, and we found everything to be clean, efficient, well managed and friendly. I booked a King Suite via their website on the '3 night getaway' rate, which was tremendously good value. The 7 full nights in this massive 650 square foot suite was just 2942 USD, which is remarkable value for a room this size in New York in my opinion. The suite itself was absolutely lovely. Plenty of room to relax in, which is vitally important if you are in New York for a blazing 7 day tourism extravaganza, and you come home heavily laden with shopping bags every day :) Rooms in NY tend to be a bit smaller than other cities around the world, so this wasn't the largest suite I'd ever been in, but it was an okay size. Of particular note is the bathroom, which had the most wonderful deep soaking bath tub that we made good use of almost every day.Concierge was excellent -- we wandered down to Daniel and said we needed a nice restaurant to have dinner in on Saturday night before our Broadway show, and he very quickly got us into an award winning restaurant nearby. His efficiency and professionalism was quite amazing.Reception was also fantastic, but it depended on who you spoke to. Brook \/ Brooke was absolutely sensational. She had so much enthusiasm and was so incredibly friendly, that we couldn't help but have a huge smile on our faces as we checked in. Every time I needed to come down to reception, if I saw Brook I would make a bee line for her because she was so lovely.The bed -- oh my goodness. Yes, people rave about the Sofitel bed and I was always like sure, whatever, but then I got in this one and I totally understand what everyone is on about! They put this very VERY soft featherbed thingy on top of the mattress, and it turns the bed into an absolute slice of heaven. We were often thinking about it while we were out and about :) Great down pillows too.Room service was good, although they did make a mistake once, but quickly rectified it without any hassle. The food was very nice.The downstairs restaurant has been badly slated in past reviews, but we ate dinner there on our first night and found it to be very nice, although the service was a touch slow. We cannot comment on the breakfast because we never ate it there. For breakfast, as has been mentioned in previous reviews, head down the street to the Red Flame Restaurant. This is a kind of 'diner' with lovely big breakfasts, fast service, and a real cool New York street ambience. People come in and queue up at the take-out counter for bagels and coffee, while we sat in one of the numerous booths and just soaked it all up. The waitresses may not be Minnesota nice, but they are super fast and efficient, and ice cold water will be on your table just as you sit, with coffee not far behind it. We had breakfast there every morning, trying different specials and can recommend a stack of things! (great poached eggs, home fries, omelettes)Okay, back to the hotel!Niggles: the cupboard for hanging your clothes in was very small, especially for a suite. However, we managed to get by. We didn't get a fabulous view, even though we were on the top floor. The view was of some unrecognisable buildings, so if you want a view of Chrysler (which you can absolutely get from this hotel) please make sure you request precisely that well in advance.The water pressure in the shower was perhaps below average.On the whole, we had a wonderful stay here and I cannot give this hotel anything less than full marks. I would have paid two to three times the price at the Four Seasons, and I'm sure the experience would not have been that much more comfortable to warrant it. They have great staff at the Sofitel, it's in a fabulously convenient location, and our time there was hassle free and completely pampered. What more can you ask for? Get it on a good rate, and stay there!!!!
