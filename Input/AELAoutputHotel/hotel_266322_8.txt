{"text":"Some really good, some really bad Okay, so first, the good. The staff is really friendly and nice. The rooms are large and the decor is really cute with a huge super comfy bed, a giant full length mirror and a big screen tv.Also, you should definitely eat at their restaurant. I had the unusual sounding chorizo mac and it was great!So, then the bad. First of all, there is only wi-fi in some of the rooms and they won't tell you if your room doesn't have it when you check in.The bathroom is tiny and all white and looks like a motel 6 bathroom. They put no thought into it. There's a nice sink\/mirror area, but there is absolutely no lighting. Even after I moved an extra lamp over there, I had to keep going outside as I was doing my makeup because I couldn't see what I was doing and kept getting streaks all over myself.So the first night I got there, I thought I'd check out the rooftop bar that was supposed to be so great. Well it would have been great if the staff had told me there was some kind of lesbian party going on up there! Some big woman came up to me and pulled my hair REALLY hard!None of them were hotel guests, they were all just a big group that was together so they figured I was one of them and it was okay to assault me?!? So then all I wanted to do was get away from all the people and hang in my room for the night when I discovered they put me in a no wi-fi room and I would have to hang in the lobby to use it.I guess it would have been a better hotel if I were a guy, since men care more about tvs than makeup lighting and would probably be thrilled to have some strange scary woman pull their hair.
