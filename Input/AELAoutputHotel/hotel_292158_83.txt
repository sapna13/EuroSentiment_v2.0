{"text":"Great, relaxing vacation with beautiful beach I stayed here with my fiance for 7 days in may and we had a wonderful, relaxing trip. We stayed in a standard room which was very clean and basically served its purpose as a room to sleep in, but not much else. But we did not go for the rooms, we went for the beach!The beach at this resort is beautiful - they do a good job of leaving many of the trees to provide ambiance and shade versus some of the other resorts we saw which just plowed down all the trees to create a larger beach. The only complaint we have is that people get up early to get a chair under a hut, and save the chairs with their towels. After the first day, we learned to get up and reserve our spot around 8 am and then left to get breakfast or to take a walk. We noticed this didn't seem to be the case at other resorts-so its too bad it happens here.There was a good variety of restaurants-we were not limited. We enjoyed the italian and the seafood restaurants the most!The nightlife was not much for us, but we did attend a few shows. We are American and found the Michael Jackson show to be entertaining. The staff was very nice and pleasant to speak with - I also went to the spa one day and the staff was excellent.The price and value could not be beat, and the beaches were just perfect. We would recommend this resort and come back again. ","annotations":[]}
