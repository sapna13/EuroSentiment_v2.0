{"text":"Love the Avenue- great bargain, great location This review is a little dated- i stayed at the Avenue Hotel in April of 2005...After a long search for the right hotel, I decided to book the Avenue Hotel for a 5 night stay in Amsterdam. I have been to the city previously, but stayed in a hotel far outside the central district. This time around i was looking to be closer to the action.The Avenue offered very reasonable rates in a good location. This is the perfect hotel for those looking to see Amsterdam on a budget, but do not want to deal with the hostels. it's a clean, modern hotel in a good spot. If you're looking for a 4 star luxury hotel, this isnt your place.A short walk from the train station, the hotel is in a central spot for walking the city. Restaurants, bars, cafes, museums and shops are all within walking distance.. we had no need for trains or cabs for our entire stay.The rooms are typically European - clean, but very small. Our bed was at best a double size (definitely not a queen) but my girlfriend and i got used to sleeping in it after a night. The bathroom was modern, and the room was kept very clean by staff. We had no issues with any noise- but since we were in the back of the hotel, i cannot comment on the front rooms.The included breakfast buffet standard, and a good way to save a few $$$.. the typical scones, muffins, eggs, teas and coffees were offered... if you get tired of the same old, try one of the breakfast cafes on the block.. there's one right up the road run by a woman from Seattle.. she was friendly and the food was great.The hotel also features a small lounge\/bar area with internet connection. You have to buy internet access to use the computer. The connection (as of 2005) was very slow, and generally not worth using if you could avoid it. The bar area was generally not crowded, and closed before midnight every night. Overall, I was extremely happy with my choice of the Avenue.I wasn't staying in Amsterdam to hangout in my hotel, so all i wanted was location, value, and cleanliness. With the Avenue, you go 3 for 3.
