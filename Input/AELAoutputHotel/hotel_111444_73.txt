{"text":"Great location, grand lobby, so-so room I stayed at the Fairmont for a conference that was taking place in the hotel. The location is really great. I hadn't spent much time in this area of Boston before, and I really enjoyed the area. In addition, the hotel facade, entryway, and especially the lobby are undeniably impressive. If you are used to bland chain hotels, it's certainly fun to stay at a posh, red-velvet kind of place occasionally.The hotel restaurant was very formal with a strict dress code. We ate one night at the bar instead, which was very nice, with lots of dark wood and comfortable seating. The menu was a bit limited and seemed generally overpriced. On the other hand, there are many, many good restaurants within easy walking distance. The concierge was very approachable and helpful in choosing places to eat, providing area maps, and giving directions. The area seemed safe and walkable at night -- lots of people about. One night we took a nice stroll down Commonwealth Ave (with lighted trees) to the Boston Public Garden after dinner.As for the room itself, I was less impressed. (I had the same experience at the San Francisco Fairmont years ago -- the public areas are very well-kept and impressive, but the rooms are small and somewhat show their age. It is a 100 year old building, after all, so I guess it's not surprising. Also, I think the rooms might vary quite a bit. A colleague signed up for the frequent-guest club at registration, and she said her room was quite large and comfortable. I did not sign up, and maybe they put me in a less-nice room since I was also paying a discounted conference room rate. When I got to the room, I could hear and feel the cold wind whistling through my window, which was open a couple of inches. It was completely stuck and would not close. When I called, they sent a facilities guy within a few minutes who banged on the window frame for a few minutes with a hammer, then partially unscrewed it and reset it in its tracks while I waited and he did get it to close. Needless to say, I did not risk opening the window again for the rest of my stay. The bathroom was very pleasant, with a period feel to it, and very nice soaps\/shampoos, etc. The bed was comfortable, no complaints. I would have wanted a larger desk if I was doing much serious work from the room. It was decent, but somewhat cramped.All in all, I still give it four stars because the building, ambience, and location are definitely above average. Just be aware that you might run into a few quirks due to the hotel's age.
