{"text":"Great Stay at Hotel La Perle We stayed at the Hotel La Perle for 8 nights in late April, booking with the hotel directly after reading many reviews online here at TripAdvisor. We found the hotel to be just as described by other reviewers. We stayed in an executive room on the top floor facing the courtyard. It was very quiet with nice air conditioning. It was good sized by European standards with even a small sitting area by the French windows facing the courtyard which was very nice to relax at the end of a day of sightseeing. The hotel staff was very friendly and accommodating, helping us in every way possible. We did not eat the breakfast they served as it was expensive. The location of the Hotel LaPerle is wonderful. It is possible to walk to many sites. We did use the metro extensively, using a Carte Orange Pass. There are two metro stations very close. The bank just a block away on Blvd. St. Germaine was a great spot to use the ATM with our debit card and get cash for the day. We loved the whole area, the restaurants, cafes, shops, ambiance. We walked to the Luxembourg Gardens. The Rue de Buci area just across Blvd. St. Germaine was especially fun. We'd stay at the Hotel La Perle again, no doubt. We had a wonderful Paris visit with this hotel as our base.We did ask the front desk to order an early cab (6:00 A.M.) for us on our day of departure. It was not a Taxi Parisian as hoped, but was a shuttle service. They told us it would be 45-50E. It was 60E to the airport, but could have been the early hour.
