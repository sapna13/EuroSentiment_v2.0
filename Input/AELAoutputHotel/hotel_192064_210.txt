{"text":"First Class Stay in London My wife and I recently had a 5-night stay at the Chesterfield Mayfair Hotel in London and had a wonderful (if expensive) time.The location was good for our needs. A 2 or 3 block walk takes you to Green Park station for the underground. Green Park, and of course Buckingham Palace are also nearby. There is a terrific pub (Red Lion) just 3 blocks away for probably the most reasonable food we had in that part of London. There are also many other pubs and restaurants in nearby Shepherds Market 1 block from the hotel.The standard room was supremely well-equipped and quiet, if small. The double bed was two smaller mattresses on a double box-spring, but very comfortable nonetheless. The bathroom was elegant, with nice features, but quite small. It did suffice however. I had to remind the staff 3 times about a water issue to do with the shower, but it was no big deal. The AC was good even with the very hot weather we had.The hotel has many places to eat, all of them expensive. Everwhere in London is expensive when it somes to food, but this hotel is not by any means a food bargain. It is very easy to spend hideous amounts of money here even if you don't drink. We ate in once and were pleased, but it was nothing special.There was no included breakfast.The staff, and there are many of them (lots of guys in uniforms standing around everywhere) were very efficient and friendly.Re value for money, it depends on what you want. We wanted a hassle-free stay and we got one and paid dearly for it. If you like to hang around the hotel and soak up the place, then it would represent good value for many. If you just want a place to sleep as you tour the town, you might do better for your dollar elsewhere.I would stay there again if I could afford it.
