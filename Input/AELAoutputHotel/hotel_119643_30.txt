{"text":"Stay away if noise bothers you The Hotel Del Sol is okay for what it is. However if noise is an issue, this is not the hotel for you.We enjoyed the use of colour in attempting to convert a 60's motel into something more current. However, at the end fo the day, it remains a 60's motel. No bathtub. No hooks in the bathroom. Over three days, used up bath soap was not replaced. Too few electrical outlets resulting is so many things added to an outlet that I started to worry.Rooms were small so that even at $229 for a one bedroom, 3 people were cramped. Breakfast was coffee, juice, fruit and either overly sweet doughnuts (for breakfast????) or little bagels that had to be cut with a bagel cutter that did more to mash the bagel. And the NOISE!!!!! If you kept all of your windows closed, it was okay. However, with a slightly open window, you were kept awake at night by street traffic, arguments in the street or hotel guests noisily departing at 6:45am. Even with your windows closed, if you were so unfortunate to stay at the hotel as a group of middle aged folks on motor cycles, who loved to rev or even idle their hogs, the entire building literally shook.$7.99 per day for internet. OUCH!For the price, I was not impressed.However, location is always a plus and one of Hotel Del Sol's advantages is its accessibility to key areas of the City. One and one half short blocks away a #30 Muni bus will take you to Fisherman's Wharf (except for the trip to Alcatraz, why you would want to go there, I don't know) in five to ten minutes and to Union Square in 20-25 minutes while passing through North Beach and Chinatown and great views of Alcatraz and Coit Tower on Telelgraph Hill along the way. The trip alone is worth the price of a ticket. If you will have a car, free parking is a major plus to be factored into the price.A friendly and helpful day and afternoon staff. Night staff could not tell me how to access messages.The hotel is close to the fun restaurants of Chestnut Street and an easy walk from the upscale shops of Union Street.So, for the location and the free parking, and if you want to keep your windows closed at all times and avoid their breakfast and the internet, it is a reasonable choice.
