{"text":"Loved it - Wonderful Honeymoon! Our recent honeymoon at the Ritz Carlton in Bali was beyond amazing. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. Of course the food and drinks are much more expensive at the resort than outside in the local towns, but it was worth it to enjoy the excellent service and convenience of staying at the resort. We stayed our first 7 nights in a Deluxe Ocean View Suite - the room was beautiful and we had turndown service every night (in addition to regular room cleanings). There are not too many TV channels there, but who needs TV when you're in such a beautiful location? Our last 4 nights were spent in a Private Villa - total luxury. The private beach at the Ritz was definitely a hike, but well worth it once you arrived down there (recommend that you bring some snacks with you). We did not book where the morning breakfast was included (which made it pricey for us - about $30-$35 pp!) so we would recommend booking where your breakfast is included (a majority of guests seemed to have this option). Sunset cocktails in front the pool were superb, you can't beat the views. Sami-Sami had wonderful Italian food, we ate there a couple of times. Zen had some of the most amazing sushi we've ever had, we ate there a couple times as well and highly recommend it. We enjoyed it all, it was a truly amazing honeymoon and we can't wait to go back.
