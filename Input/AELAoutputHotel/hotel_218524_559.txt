{"text":"An Excellent Bump My wife and I were able to spend 10 wonderful days at the Excellence from January 24 to Feb 3 this year due to overbooking at the Sirenis Tropical. This overbooking seemed to be quite frequent at a number of resorts in Punta Cana this year; however, I am not complaining since our stay at the Excellence far exceeded any previous all-inclusive we have ev er been on. We met a number of people who had been bumped from other resorts to the Excellence.This was our first trip to the Dominican since 2001 (we have travelled to Cuba the past 6 years), and we very impressed, not only with the Resort but more so the staff. The service was, as they say EXCELLENTE. The staff really know how to make your stay enjoyable. They work very hard every day and always with a smile and HOLA. Juan, the little man at the pool bar was a real gentleman who always had a smile and always made sure your glass was full. People who complain about the service should maybe wake up and smell the roses. The staff work extremely hard to make everyones vacation enjoyable. So what if you had to wait at some of the ala carte restaurants. You're on vacation so chill out, for heavens sake. I forget how many people I heard complaining about the bad service because they couldn't be seated right away It wasn't bad service, it was just the pleasant young hostess trying to do her job and keep everyone happy.My wife had occasion to visit the Resort Medical clinic due to a severe reaction to a little spider bite. The doctor did an excellent job in getting her looked after. Again thank you for the great service.Rather than go into great detail regarding the features of the resort, I will try to summarize very briefly some of the highlights:The Beach - 10 straight days of red flag. The beach is gorgeous but very rough every day. The Pool - Excellent. Very clean and quiet. No problem getting a chair. As mentioned, Juan took good care of us to make sure we had a cold one at all times.Restaurants - Excellent. No where did we have a bad meal. The service was great and the food good. The buffet for breakfast had lots of choice , omelettes of choice, fresh fruit, breads, etc.The Grill, the French Restaurant and the Chinese restaurant were our favourites.Grounds - The grounds are immaculate, well manicured. Lots of chickens and turkeys running around; beautiful flamingos in the pond at the front of the resort.Spa - very beautiful. We did not use the services, but people we talked to said their services were excellent.Entertainment - Hit and miss. The staff work v ery hard to make their shows enjoyable for everyone. The Michael Jackson show was well done as well as the Circus show and the Magic show. However, they started a little late (10:00 p.m.) The sax player near the lobby bar was great..Checkin and Checkout - Painless. No hassles. When we checked in after being bumped at 2:00 a.m. in the morning the gentleman who looked after us was great, and fully understood our inconvenience. No hassle checkout when we departed.In closing Nolitours, who we booked through in Canada came through big time. We were able to stay at the Excellence for our whole vacation, without the hassle of moving from one resort to the other which was nice. There was also compensation for our inconvenience of being bumped. So this was a nice gesture from them and was appreciated.This is a great Adults only resort, and we would recommend it to anyone who wants a romantic getaway. You will not be disappointed.
