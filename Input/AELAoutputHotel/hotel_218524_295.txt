{"text":"Nice vacation, but traveler beware! My wife and I just returned from our trip to Punta Cana where we stayed at the Excellence Resort. This is a couples resort so no children. Many honeymooners. Upon arrival on the island, a bus will take you to the resort. Be prepared for an hour+ ride as this resort is the further distance from the airport. The roads near the airport are fine, but they get narrow and bumpy as you get closer to the resort. When you check-in at the resort, they may offer you a room upgrade to their 'Excellence Club'. They promised services that they failed to deliver on such as daily fresh towels for poolside, daily newspaper, and some other services. We did receive massages as part of the upgrade and these were very good, but again briefly hassled at the spa. The spa is nice although the jets were not working in the spa tub. Overall I think this upgrade was a ripoff for what one pays for it. I suggest you think twice if they offer it to you. We experienced that the electricity in the room would go off daily for no apparent reason usually in the late afternoon lasting a few minutes to up to 20 minutes. The room AC stopped working and we were without it for one day. Trying to get it fixed was a hassle. We tried room service on our first morning where we called up and order coffee, assortment of fruits, and pastries. They said it would take 55 minutes to arrive. We waited and waited. Three calls and close to two hours later, it was finally delivered. They call that 'Carribean time'. This is totally unacceptable for what was ordered. After that we gave up on using room service again. There are 8 restuarants. The food is plentiful and decent. However, you will find the meats are heavily salted as I believe they use alot of salt as a means of preserving the meat in the warm climate in the absence of decent refrigeration. Along this line, my wife got severe food poisoning on the trip. We discovered that she was NOT alone. About 30% of percent of the folks we spoke with said that they also experienced some sort of food related illness. This is way too high! I suggest you bring stomach meds just a precaution. The booze at the bars is fine although I found all mixed tropical drinks are very, very sweet. Most are premixed and not blended at the time of order. Many times communications is very difficult especially if you don't speak spanish. Take this into serious consideration and be prepared for this. The evening entertainment is decent if you like to watch mainly dancing and lip sync. We most enjoyed the jazz-saxophone music played most nights on the plaza and at the Martini Bar.The main pool is expansive. It is nice, clean, and warm. Be aware that it is only 3-4 feet deep. Great for cooling off and floating in. They have no deep typical swimming pool. The beach is nice with plenty of loungers and huts for shade. However, if you like to swim or wade in the ocean forget it as the ocean is too rough. On all days there were warning flags telling people to stay out of the water other than in one small section.There are scheduled program activities daily and you can take excursion trips. We took one excursion out to an island that was decent. The island is poor and there is really no place to wander or go on your own. In summary, we had a nice RR type of vacation. We made the best of their service and resort activities. However, given the very hit and miss service, difficulty with communication, and the clencher being that my wife got severe food poisoning (like no other time on any other carribean trip), this is not a resort or island destination that we'd consider returning to.
