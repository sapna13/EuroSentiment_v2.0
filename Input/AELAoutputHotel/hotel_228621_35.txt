{"text":"Good hotel, location a bit distant I stayed here with my partner on May 2006. The location is a bit distant, about 10 minutes walk to the metro station from where it takes about 15 minutes to reach the center of Barcelona. However, we got a very cheap price for this hotel so we decided to book. There is a beach nearby (5 minutes walk) with all services: toilets, shower, kiosks selling food and beverages. Also there is a big shopping center about 10 minutes walk away. There are not much restaurants in this area and especially not good ones - they are selling some cheap, frozen food made in the microwave so you have to go somewhere else for a dinner.The hotel is new, very clean with nice interior design and the rooms are comfortable. The room was a perfect size for us but there should have been more space to clothes for example - we don't want to keep our staff in the bags if we stay in a hotel for a week or more. The bathroom was very nice and there were shampoo, soap, shower caps and so on. There is no lock in the bathroom door which might bother someone. We stayed in a non-smoking floor but our neighbours seemed to be having some kind of a noisy party and they started smoking in their room. All the smoke came to our room as the air conditioning is probably desingned for non-smoking purposes. I complained about this to the staff and they promised to take care of it. We didn't notice any smoke after that night so I guess the staff took care of it. The breakfast was great: toasts, pastries, cheese, ham, vegetables, eggs, bagon, coffee\/tea\/hot chocolate, juice, fruits and so on. Some mornings there were too much people at the same time so we had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table. Also some mornings the staff had difficulties in responding the amount of people - coffee, tea and milk run out as well as coffee cups and plates. So people had to wait over 15 minutes to get cups and coffee... We also had a lunch at the hotel one day which was a mistake. I had some fish which was accidentally left raw and was awful, like a chewing gum. I only ate the side dish and complained about this to the waiter. He said that he would speak with the chef and then came back with our bill - with no discount of the fish which I wasn't able to eat as it wasn't properly cooked! I told him that I expect a compensation and he replied that the chef had tasted the fish and found it perfect. After arguing with me for a while he asked his superior from the reception to join the conversation and we continued this argumentation as I wasn't willing to pay for the food. Finally the boss promised that I would get the meal for free - after I had told him that I didn't want to continue arguing anymore and promised to pay for the food. However, this kind of incident shouldn't happen in 4 star hotel. If a customer says that food is not ok, it's not ok and that's it.
