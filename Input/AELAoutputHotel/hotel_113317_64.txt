{"text":"Excellent Choice of Hotel The Hotel Casablanca is an excellent choice for a stay in New York. It is very central, and located close to Times Square, and although it doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have great views like some of the bigger hotels may have, it is a little quieter due to being just off Times Square, and is much more friendly and personal due to the size of the hotel. All of the staff were extremely pleasant and happy to assist with any requests. We really enjoyed the complimentary continental breakfast each morning (I had expected that we would eat breakfast out a few times, but we really didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel the need to so in the end, and ate in the hotel each morning). There is a choice of cereals, croissants, pastries, muffins, yoghurts, fruit salad, bagels, boiled eggs, cheese and preserves. There is tea\/coffee\/hot chocolate available all day which is a nice touch, and in the evening there is cheese and biscuits, and wine which is also complimentary and a nice way to tide you over until dinner. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ drink much, but really looked forward to the good selection of cheese, and occasional glass of sparkling wine each evening. The rooms were also of a high standard, as was cleanliness throughout the hotel. Our room was a little small, and did not have great storage space for unpacking, but I think this is pretty standard for New York hotels from what I have read, and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really bother us. The only gripe we had was that although there is free internet, the connection wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ great. I am not sure if this was because we were on the 6th floor (I think I read this on another review on here), or because of the amount of business users in the area, as it did seem to improve at the weekend. Again, this was only a minor thing for us, and there is a PC in the lounge area for use (along with a printer) which was better if you need something quickly. The hotel also had a nice little terrace area just off the lounge where you could sit outside amongst some greenery, however as it rained pretty much most of the time we were there, people didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use it much at all. Overall, our stay was excellent, and we would definitely return to this hotel again for the great location, friendly staff and tasty cheese and wine\/breakfasts!
