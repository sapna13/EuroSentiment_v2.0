{"text":"Overall Very Good My wife and I stayed at the Le Meridien for seven days in July. We arrived early on Sunday morning from New York and our room wasn't ready. Not a big deal as we were there so early that we didn't expect it. I'm an SPG Gold Member and they told us that they would put the room cleaning on a priority list and that the room would be ready in about 1.5 hours. We went for a walk on Las Ramblas, had a cup of coffe and returned to the hotel about 1.5 hours later. The temporary lobby in the bar\/restaurant area (renovations in the actual lobby) was absolutely packed with new arrivals waiting for their rooms. To make a long story short, we waited 4 hours to get a room and didn't get that one unitl I spoke to a Manager about the situation.Luckily, that was the only negative we experienced. There were room and lobby renovations going on, but there was no noise to speak of and the work did not affect our stay. The room was a renovated one on the 8th floor with a patio and facing Las Ramblas. It was good size for Europe, modern\/clean and verything worked fine. The location of the hotel was perfect for sight seeing and the staff was very helpful. They really don't have a concierge as such but use the front desk people in that capacity. They were helpful and very friendly. The buffet breakfast was teriffic (well stocked at all times) and the breakfast help were responsive and friendly. We ate two meals in their restaurant and it was o.k., but not great. We wound up having a great stay and would recommend this hotel to anyone. ","annotations":[]}
