{"text":"A decent stay Just came back from one week at the hotel and in summary, it was OK. We paid $200 (a special return rate) a night for a tennis court view room which I think was over priced for the stay. This is definitely like staying at a lower end Hyatt or Hilton. And unfortunately, there are more cons that pros. PROS: shuttle bus to hotel is convinenient and easy to find at the airport (although this was $60 pp RT); staff is very nice; pool is great especially for small kids; views from pool over the caribbean are spectacularCONS: Food is over priced and quite average. Tthe other family we were travelling with ordered room servce for breakfast for 3 people (1 child) and it was $100!!! During one lunch, I ordered the 3 mini burgers and essentially got White Castles. And they charged $12! And the resort is in the middle of no where so we were not about to take cabs with 2 children all over Fajardo in the search of food. The hotel is outdated and needs some spiffing up. Floors and bannisters are worn. Room furnishings OK but outdated. COMMENT ABOUT THE PALOMINO ISLAND: It's OK. The kids had a fun time on the ferry boat, but the island is nothing special. It's a standard beach with a restaurant and bar. And if you think about it, it's a pain to take a ferry to the beach so we only did this once. This was a family vacation that was planned last minute and I had read the reviews before going so I my expectations were not high. Our goal was to spend some quality family time relaxing which is what we did. If you are looking for high end, go some place else. It looked like they were renovating and supposedly, LXR has taken over, so maybe in a year or two, El Con will be restored to the reputation it once had.
