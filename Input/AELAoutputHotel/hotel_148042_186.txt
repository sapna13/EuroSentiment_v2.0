{"text":"beautiful, if only they could manage to clean my room The hotel is beautiful -- the beach, the pool, and we really enjoyed the spa. The most significant problem we had was getting housecleaning to make it to our room. We stayed for four nights and had no problems the first morning, but a dismal experience in the following days. The highlight was definitely the spa and fitness center. The facilities were excellent and the wide array of fitness classes were a strong feature. The food -- we ate at both Mare and the new Mulinas -- was excellent. Major problem: getting the room cleaned by a reasonable time (and one day they never came 'til the turndown).I came back to my room at 4:50 pm the second day to find still no one had come to clean. When I called, I was told that they worked from 9 to 5:30 pm, so they would probably be along soon. :( I was very disappointed by this standard and told him that it was not appropriate for any hotel, let alone a Ritz Carlton; but the gentlemen told me that they had a lot of rooms, so this was how they did it. He was willing, he said, to put me down to get service earlier for the next day, although he said this would just mean some other room got serviced later. I asked that cleaning be completed by 1pm (that's my standard, even if it isn't theirs). The next day, my husband returned at 1:45 to find no cleaning had been done and went to the front desk to get I'm so sorry. I will call them, it will get done right away. By 3, still no cleaning. As a breastfeeding mom away from her baby, I NEED to be able to relax and pump on time, not waiting and calling and waiting and calling to get know I can relax and pump uninterrupted. The manager was apologetic, but was not able to actually get things done right. ","annotations":[]}
