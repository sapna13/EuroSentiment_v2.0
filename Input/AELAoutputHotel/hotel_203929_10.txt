{"text":"Great hotel for the price and location! My wife and I spent two nights in Florence and booked this hotel after reading reviews on Trip Advisor and comparing it with other area hotels. This one seemed like a great choice given the reviews, the price, and especially the location. We were so close to everything we wanted to see in Florence and we were able to walk everywhere. I was pleasantly surprised the hotel staff was very helpful and welcoming, since this was our first time in Europe and I had heard European hotels are not generally known for their hospitality. The staff even gave a great restaurant recommendation, La Loggia, in front of the Piazza Michaelangelo overlooking the city, which was an elegant and romantic restaurant with incredible views.I left the rental car in front of the hotel and an attendant took it to the nearby garage for the two nights (around $40 USD for both nights) we were there. Tip: Garage is available until midnight. Luckily we got there just before so we didn't have to park it on the street until the morning when the garage opens up again.The room was very comfortable and clean. Luckily they gave us a room that faced the back and not the main street which I knew was noisier. I believe it was room 32 and it's just off the lobby. The bed was very comfortable and the room looked modern with newer furniture and bathroom. We used the safe that was in the closet for valuables and locked our luggage just in case, but it was definitely a safe hotel.The breakfast was included and since we don't usually have a big breakfast, the bread and delicious capuccinos were definitely a plus.All in all, a great hotel for the location and price. It was clean, safe, comfortable, and friendly. For what we were looking for, it was the best.
