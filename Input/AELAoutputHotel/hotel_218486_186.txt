{"text":"tips go a long way The grounds are lovely and the beach is excellent. the complex sits on the beach, where there is always a team of entertainers doing crazy stuff. we found that to get any quality of service it was necessary to tip. Particularly in the restaurant. Look out for a guy called Mario, a few dollars a day goes a long way. he's a nice guy who kept us swimming in coffee at breakfast and alcohol at night. He made our holiday special for us and treated us like royalty just for a couple of quid a day. lots of spanish visit this hotel and do seem to get preferential treatment, but dont be put off. Our kids 14 and 12 had a great time, we hardly ever saw them. They were free to eat and drink what they wanted when they wanted. The 24hr snack bar did amazing pizza's and here you could help yourself to soft drinks and tea and coffee. reception are not very friendly but most other people were. Some people suffered with tummy ache, but I drank and ate so did the kids and we were all fine.the monster truck safari and the carribean festival are two great day trips I would recommend.monster truck takes you into the mountains to discover the real Dom.rep and its people. This trip is a charity organisation and funs the local schools.Carribean festival, a catamaran take you out into sea where you snorkle with sharks and stingrays. First time snorkelling for me I was scared but its very safe and I enjoyed the experience. on way back boat becomes a party and rum and coke flows freely.I'd do both these trips again.
