{"text":"A lovely resort After we booked, we looked at some of the reviews and the mixed comments gave us some concerns. We needn't have worried.We travelled with Thomsons and had an excellent flight. It was on time and their extra legroom is great. Transfers were a bit slow, and the other hotels we dropped off at were huge. Ours was a bit smaller, but not much.The reception area is big and open and airy and efficient. Then we had the train ride down to the apartments. This is nearly half a mile through the mangroves, but didn't take long.The room we had was conveniently placed, quite near the restaurants, pools and beach. We had some teething troubles with the air conditioning and with a water leak in the bathroom, but these were resolved reasonably quickly once reported to guest relations.The main buffet restaurant served an extensive range of dishes which should be enough to satisfy most palates. The biggest difficulty was getting a cup of coffee at breakfast - they always seemed to be running out of cups! They also didn't quite seem to grasp the concept that you need hot! water to make tea.The a la carte restaurants were a varied bunch - from excellent Italian and Mexican to poor Chinese, with Brazilian and Dominican somewhere in the middle. One problem we found was that apart from the lobby bar (nearly half a mile away) there was really nowhere around the restaurants to sit and have a quiet drink before and after your meal.The beach was lovely - and was kept exceedingly clean. The animation team was really aimed at a much younger audience than us, but they put in a lot of effort. The multi-lingual evening entertainment was mixed in quality - but nevertheless popular. Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our two weeks here and would recommend it to anyone.
