{"text":"Great hotel, no complaints! We stayed at the Europark for 4 nights in August '08. We booked two rooms, a double and a single as there were three of us. The rooms were clean, spacious and very comfortable. An unexpected bonus was that the rooms had adjoining doors which was very convenient and made it feel as if we had one massive room. The rooms had everything you could ask for of a 3* hotel and more. Modern design, large comfortable beds, very good air con, large powerful shower, a free safe and minibar which was handy for keeping our own drinks cold. The location was in the more residential Eixample area but it was only a fifteen minute walk to Las Ramblas in one direction and La Sagrada Familia in the other. The Placa de Catalunya was also only about fifteen minutes walk away which is where we got off and on the A1 airport bus, this is a quick, easy and cheap way to get to and from the airport. You will wait no longer than ten minutes for a bus in either direction. There is no need to get a taxi. The hotel staff were very friendly and helpful and all spoke very good English. Checking in and out was quick and easy. They were happy to keep our bags in a cupboard behind reception most of the day as we had a late flight home. I would recommend this hotel to any one going to Barcelona. It is probably the best hotel experience i have ever had. ","annotations":[]}
