{"text":"What you on the web site is what you get My wife (mid 40s) and I (early 50s) returned last night from this slice of paradise. We were slightly apprehensive based on some of the negative reviews. We now wonder if the negatives stayed at the same resort we did.What were we apprehensive about?1. Ride from the airport. Yes, the road is narrow and has many potholes, but the ride was not a life-threatening experience as others make it out to be. We enjoyed the ride and the opportunity to see the countryside and the towns in which people live.2. Tipping. We did not feel compelled to tip in order to get good service. We felt comfortable giving a tip when we received good service, which was most of the time. It is a good idea to have a good supply of one dollar bills for this purpose.3. The room. The room was clean and lovely. We had plenty of room for two people. We had more than enough towels and washclothes and the room was straightend twice a day. The main thing about the room is, you really are not in it very much except to sleep and change and it is more than enough room for those activites. You also have a balcony if you want a place to eat if you order room service.The resort grounds are beautiful and well maintained. The staff is friendly, fun and most of the time helpful. As everybody else has written, the pool is beautiful and clean. The reserving of chairs is a problem and the management is working on the problem.The food was good and we enjoyed having the opportuntity to eat at different restaurants. Just like everybody else you find your favorite. Also, if you eat dinner at the buffet, you receive the same service as you do in the other restaurants. Here are some suggestions: 1. If you get to the resort in between meal times as we did, and nothing is open, you can order a pizza from the Italian restaurant and don't forget about room service. They don't have a menu, but you can just tell them what you want and they will bring it to your room. 2. Also, the first night we were there we were handed a wine menu with prices. This is only for people who don't or won't drink house wine. If you want wine just tell them you want a glass of white or red wine and they will keep filling it and filling it and filling it.3. Lastly, I suggest you take the Spanish classes they offer at 10:00. They are a lot of fun and it helps get you involved. The staff really likes when you use Spanish and they love to teach you Spanish.Just read the good reviews and bypass reading the bad reviews. I don't know where these people visited, but they didn't go to Dreams in Punta Cana or they just are VERY and next to IMPOSSIBLE to please. Have as good of a time as we had!
