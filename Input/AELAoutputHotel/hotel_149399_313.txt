{"text":"Relaxing and fun We stayed at the Melia Caribe Tropical from Oct6-13. We opted for Royal Service, although since we were vacation club members with RCI, they were reluctant to let us upgrade. We ended up having to pay the extra $30.00 pp\/per night to get the services of RS but ended up staying in a regular room with 2 double beds. I was glad that they even let us upgrade, so it kinda became a running joke throughout the rest of the week. Upgrading to RS was definitely worth it though. We hung around the Gabi Pool most of our trip. I loved the little stand by the RS pool that would pretty much make whatever you wanted. The steak skewers were delicious. Also there are covered beds that my husband and I took advantage of for afternoon naps, since the beds are pretty much the most uncomfortable things that I have ever slept on.The food was decent, but I definitely was ready for some real American food by our last night. We ended up going to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe which was expensive but very good. I loved the French restaurant and the Japanese. We did the Japanese twice it was so good.Staff seemed very friendly, especially Benji, who would always take us back and forth from our room to the beach and vice versa. Sofia in the RS lounge was always very helpful as well.The only problem that I had with the staff was the people who do the vacation club tour. DON'T DO IT! It is such a waste of time, and if you say no, they are very rude to you afterward. We were told we would receive a gift for taking the tour even if we declined membership, but when we did decline, they told us that we wouldn't be receiving anything. After brief convincing I told them that we better receive something after they just wasted 2 hours of our time, and they reluctantly gave us $70.00 Melia dollars.All in all, the trip was great. I wouldn't go back only because my husband and I don't like to visit the same place twice. Very beautiful though, and we have great pictures to prove it.
