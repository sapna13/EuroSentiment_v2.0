{"text":"Not a 4+ My wife and I just returned from the Oasis. Given what we paid, it was very good value. However, it is not a 4+ star and I would not pay the book value. Staff and service are very good as is typical of a Dominican 4 stars we have stayed. The room was large and clean. The beach itself is very nice and there are plenty of chairs.On the downside:The buildings are very close together inhibiting the view of the ocean. Our building backed onto a grimy residential\/business area that would be seen as you enter and leave your room. The wine was a vile concoction that a wino would think twice about consuming. A la carte restaurants: Italian good (I had the beef tenderloin), seafood okay, American grill not so good. We were able to order good wine at $35 per bottle at the Italian.Hot buffet breakfasts are always a challenge. Oasis did not do well. Scrambled eggs, french toast and pancakes were not warm. Lunch and dinners were good.Mixed drinks were passable with the exception of pina colada which were bad. One I had at least worked well as a laxative. We had to endure a gauntlet of badgering merchants who set up on the property several nights however this is typical of Punta Cana resorts.There was no live band. A garden area featured a large cage of budgies. It is a great feeding station for rats. On one evening we saw one feeding inside the cage on what looked like bread.Overall we had a good time and would consider Oasis again at the sale price we paid.
