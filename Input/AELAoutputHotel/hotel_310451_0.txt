{"text":"Delightful place! We stayed here after 3 days in Old San Juan to relax. The hotel was great, check in was quick. I had requested a first floor room (my husband recently had a knee replacement) and they gave us one just off the pool and a very short walk to the sea. The room was pleasant and had plenty of room in the closet and drawers and tons of cabinet space in the bathroom. Also a small bar area with coffee maker and refrigerator. There is a Walmart just a few exits away and I went out and got some snacks and drinks and a $3 cooler to take to the beach. The hottub was huge and actually had a few good jets. Everything was quiet all the time. There is a beach bar, but it is not associated with the hotel, so you can't charge to your room. But they make great mojitos and pina coladas. The wine bar at the horel is very nice. They will serve you in glass or to go cups, if you want to wander. It's a little pricey, but we found every thing to be in Puerto Rico. The restaurant is wonderful. Don't mind the prices. You get more than you pay for. I had some of the best (and biggest) salmon I've ever had! Even the burger is good (we split one one evening and it was plenty). The little coffee shop had great lattes and provided us with all the ice we needed.The desk was friendly and helpful.The pool bar was not open a single time while we were there, that was a disappointment. The rest was great.
