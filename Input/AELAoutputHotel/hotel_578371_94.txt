{"text":"Not A 5 Star!! NOT A 5 STAR!!!I know the hotel is in the carribean and things are a little differant there ,but all these people that rave about how great this hotel is, have in my opinion never stayed in a 5 star hotel.GROUNDS.very pretty and plants and flowers kept watered pruned and looking great hats off to the guys in green who keep the place looking great these are the guys who deserve a tip, working all day outside in the heat.RESTAURANTS.French restaurant is the only one where the food is of decent quality and where you can almost believe you are in a 5 star resort.Make sure if you buy wine there and you pay in cash keep your reciept or you may later be accused of walking out without paying,( long story).Buffet restaurant good choice but most things are let go cold apart from things that are cooked infront of you , also some of the cooks use the same tongs for raw meat as cooked beware!!.The staff in this restaurant in my mind are the hardest working and most friendly.Steak Fish restaurants can be hit or miss steak ok but staff hurry you and all are not friendly and they are always looking for a tip.ACCOMODATION .Standard junior suite are not any way near 5 star standard while they are kept clean, bed sides are stained showers broken showing wear and tear ,ciggerette burns on bed cover also they smell very damp.Due to a problem we had which was down to the hotel, we were upgraded to a Majestic Colonial Suite with seperate sitting room double balcony and terrace with hot tub , now this was 5 star standard could not fault the room in anyway ,nothing like standard rooms .BEACH.wonderful clean white sand.SUMMERY.Hotel looks nice and is nice but if you want a 5 star resort with 5 star service you will not find it here unless you book one of its top suites then at least you will get a decent room.Devon U.k ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1630,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1625}]}
