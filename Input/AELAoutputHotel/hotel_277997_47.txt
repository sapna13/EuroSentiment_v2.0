{"text":"Disappointing Service, Adequate Room, Great Amenities I have stayed at this resort three times; I'd expect my most recent visit will be my last, though my overall fondness for the Hilton amenities might override my disappointment with the poor service I experienced recently.Problems: at check-in, I requested a change from the non-smoking room I had reserved on the Hilton Web site to a smoking room, as my non-smoking traveling companion chose to stay elsewhere. I arrived at my (somewhat hard-to-find) room, weary from a very long flight, only to discover that it was a non-smoking room despite my request. I called the front desk and was told that I could move right next door (to a room that was similar, though slightly less desirable), but when I moved into the new room I discovered it was also non-smoking. I called the desk and was told to go ahead and smoke in that room; they would bring an ashtray.Additional problems: I departed from my room on Sunday at about 11 a.m. and returned around 10 p.m., only to discover that the room had not been cleaned. I called the guest hotline and was told that it was too late to have the room cleaned but that I could have fresh towels and coffee; when I inquired about the reason the room was not cleaned, I was transferred (without further assistance or apology) to the front desk. The front desk personnel stated I must have left the do not disturb sign on the door (I hadn't!) and offered to have the room cleaned immediately, but as I was ready to sleep I declined the offer in favor of the fresh towels and coffee alone. (They arrived within about 15 minutes.) I never received any explanation, apology, or adjustment. An additional disappointing feature was the $13.95 per day fee for internet access (with VPN), essential for staying connected with work while I visited Phoenix for a family emergency. It worked well and was easy to set up, but free wireless access would seem to be an expected amenity at a hotel of this type.The hotel setting is attractive, with views of mountains and city lights. (Warning: for some rooms, one is faced with a very steep walk to\/from the only parking options.) The suite was comfortable--and, as usual, the beds, linens, and toiletries were perfect. This room was far less luxurious than the two others I had experienced at this hotel, though. Housekeeping (when offered!) was excellent, and the room was very clean. I liked the two-room arrangement and the flat-screen televisions in each. The AAA rate on the Hilton site was great.It's too bad the service was dreadful. From a hotel of this type, I'd expect much better--and, from my experience, it's possible to find great service at comparable locations in the Phoenix area.
