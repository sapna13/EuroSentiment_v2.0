{"text":"Absolute paradise The hotel property was stunning. Everywhere you looked it was lush and green. And the layout of the lagoon just looked endless with the way it wrapped around the resort. Our room was a Deluxe Lagoon View room with a King Size bed. Everything from the bed to the bathroom was great. It was kept so clean and the design of the room was very up to date and modern. Our view of the lagoon was everything we expected...we had breakfast on the balcony every day. We restricted our meals on the property to the Cafe Lagoon and in-room dining as it was quite expensive which was to be expected. We came as Starwood platinum members and the service was outstanding. We just loved how every hotel staff we encountered could remember us and address us by name. Everyone was just so friendly and would greet us every time we would pass by. For those who plan to travel around Bali or want a more active nightlife just keep in mind that the location of the hotel is in the southern part of Bali. So it is not as central or as close to the busier tourist areas such as Kuta, which was about a 20 mins taxi ride away. But this is what we preferred for our stay. It was such a relaxing environment to be in that the only thing we regret is that we didn't have the time to stay there longer. We would definitely consider going back there. ","annotations":[]}
