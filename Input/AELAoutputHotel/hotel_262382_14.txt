{"text":"Hotel fine...but the service~! The Citigate is in a reasonable location and is quite well appointed. The room I stayed in was clean, well fitted out and very pleasant. On this basis, the hotel provides good value for money, at least at the discount rates available online.The service, however, was appalling. It was completely unprofessional and almost laughably inept.For example, when I arrived I requested internet access. I was told that this was available in the room (though the price, I should add, was absolutely absurd). When I got to the room, there was no cable.I rang downstairs and was told that one would be sent up. After half an hour, and very sick of waiting, I went down to reception to get a cable myself. After a long wait (both receptionists were in a nose-to-nose fight with a Chinese tour leader), I was eventually handed one. I took it up to my room....to find that my keycard no longer worked. Back to reception and more waiting.6 hours later, as I was just drifting off to sleep, the reception desk rang.....apparently, they were 'too busy to bring a cable up to me and could I please come down and pick one up?'. I pointed out that I had already been down (many hours before) to pick one up...and they hung up on me. Charming folk.Unfortunately, the whole stay was like this.Anyway, not a bad hotel and it would be a fine option for a cheap Sydney stay in a reasonable level of comfort were it not for the truly awful service.
