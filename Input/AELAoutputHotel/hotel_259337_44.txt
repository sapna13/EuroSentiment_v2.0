{"text":"The Good ,the Bad,  My husband and I visited the GPB June 22nd - June 29th for our honeymoon. Our flight went smoothly and we actually arrived early, around noon. Our ride there was interesting to say the least, I think a couple of people actually feared for their lives due to our crazy driver, who would pass anyone at anytime regardless if there was on-coming traffic! When we arrived to the resort we were prepared to hang out in the lobby with some drinks until check-in time @ 3 pm. Unfortunately, 3pm came and went and our room was still not ready. At 4 pm our room was ready, luckily it was worth the wait. Our room was the romance room and it was perfect, plus we were only feet away from the beach. We had flowers on our bed and complimentary fruit and rum. The first couple of meals we had were a little disappointing, but after the first day they continually got better. Despite what you have heard you can go to the nice restaurants as many times as you want for dinner, we loved Bamboo and Mare Nostrum. We only did the buffet one night and that was plenty.The Good: 1. stunning beaches and plenty of available lounge chairs. 2.The excursions- we did the Outback adventure and Stingray Bay. On the Outback adventure it was one of the first times we were surrounded by Americans(which was nice), we had an excellent guide named Alex, and we actually got good beer for the first time. It was really eye-opening to see the real Dominican Republic. Stingray bay (aka Carribean Festival) was a blast, doubledecker party boat, snorkeling by the reef, swimming with sharks and stingrays, fab entertainment, and mamajuana. 3. Our room, beautiful, big, clean, and by the beach. 4. The resort staff- always friendly even though most did not speak fluent English. 5. The Michel Jackson show was fun - just make sure you sit at a table or they won't serve you The Bad: 1. The buffet food was no bueno except for the breakfast food. 2. The tram was a joke, we usually walked faster!The Ugly: 1. The Drinks- reg bar drinks were okay but were bottom quality liquor. We drank water at dinner, their table wines and beer (El Presidente) were sick. The best drinks we had were when we mixed our own drinks (rum coke) in our room and the beer from the Outback Excursion. 2. Lack of Beachwear - I have no problem with people going topless or wearing a speedo, but please only do so when you look good doing it and I'm not talking about having a perfect body, but at least be under 180 lbs.All in all we had a great time and I would recommend this resort, just make sure you are prepared for it not to be perfect and not to see many Americans unless you travel in the winter.
