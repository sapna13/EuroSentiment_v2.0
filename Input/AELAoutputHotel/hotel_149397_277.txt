{"text":"Will Never Return I have been to several other Caribbean locations: Bahamas, Jamaica, St. Lucia, Grand Cayman, etc. so I had high hopes for the Bavaro Princess. Instead, I was greeted with a really awful honeymoon suite which was no different from a normal room except it had a jucuzzi tub that wouldn't drain after we used it, hotel employees who spoke no English and were hard to communicate with, bad food, and ended up coming down with an illness that put me in the ER the day after my return. We ended up asking to be moved out of our supposedly better honeymoon suite to a regular room closer to the water that was at least redecorated and seemed cleaner than our other room. The resort itself is beautiful-- with peacocks, flamingos roaming the grounds and a lovely beach. However, very few rooms (a handful) are within site of the beach and there were no 24 hour places you could get food because all the beach restaurants are closed. My husband was starving at 5:00 one day and there was no where to get food-- unless you buy chips or stuff in the overpriced convenience store. The food, especially at the breakfast and lunch buffets is severely substandard and even though I was careful not to drink any of the tap water, I came down with a horrible stomach illness. When we got massages, the employees don't leave the room for you to undress and there is no modesty with a sheet or towel the way it normally is when you get massages. The masseuse even started taking my husband's shirt off him when we both hesitated to get naked in front of two strangers. The massages are NOT worth the money, so I wouldn't waste your time or dollars. I also was charged $5 US for 4 Rolaids in the resort store when my stomach was hurting so badly. Most of the employees were very nice and friendly, but the fact that the vast majority of them don't speak English, it is hard to communicate and get points across.  It is a beautiful place and much less expensive, which is why we took the risk. But, after having our experience, we would recommend you save up and go to a more sophisticated, professional resort elsewhere.
