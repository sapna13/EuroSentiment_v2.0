{"text":"romantic, exellent spa and small hotel .. don√à?√¨t miss this in Bali... My husband and I have a 10 year anniversary and decided that this small beach hotel where you have the sea 15 m from your own house is a good place to be..The house had a big room with windows to the sea and a high ceailing. Every house in surrounded by flowers and a walking path.The bathroom, three steps down, had a shower and extra outdoor shower within walls-fantastic!The Spa in the end of the hotel-area was fantastic with running water and a fountain. The staff was very good and we had massage 3 times and was very pleased every time, we really recommend it!The food and drinks was exellent and the staff was very helpful.The pool-area is very nice but not so good if you have small children that can√à?√¨t swim.We liked this hotel because it is small, you can have all your meals here and the staff is very serviceminded. All the food is coming from the gardens and farmers nearby.It√à?√¨s very calm and nice at the evenings and the sundown are fantastic..We had a guide for a half day in Singraja and saw the library with scrifts from 1819 and earlier written on bamboo, weaving factory, foodmarket, and visit a place were the make the instruments for the Bali-dance-performances. We also had a lovely lunch at a garden where all the veg are grown that the hotels uses in there meals.At the gourmet hotel Damai we had our anniversary-dinner, suited 4 km from Lovina beach in the slope of the mountain, sorrounded of trees and coffeplantations with an incredible view of the coast.They served the best gourmet dinner in Bali with excellent wine, a dinner to remember..Thank you Puri Bagus Lovina for a wonderful memory...The swedish family in 104..
