{"text":"Not worth the price Stayed for 2 nights, paid √à√\u2020√ü?25 plus taxes and the iniquitous 2% credit card surcharge per night for a double room. Although Amsterdam is notoriously expensive at this time of year, I don't think that the two-star Apple Inn warrants such a hefty bill. Come to think of it, that 2% really grates. It's just as much a gouge here as it is when Easyjet et al do it. Contrast all this with our next admittedly weekend night at the SAS Radisson in Brussels' Wolvengracht. √à√\u2020√ü?35, no fuss, no bother and NO SURCHARGE.On the postive side it is in a wonderfully quiet location (if you want that sort of thing) and very easy to reach from Central Station on the no2 tram (more like 20 minutes than the 10 mentioned below). BTW this tram goes past the Dam and the Leidseplein both of which are worth a stop. In fact the whole route is littered with things to see and do.The problem is that the quality of your stay is going to be heavily influenced by the room that you get, and the nature of the building gives rise to some of problems. Steep stairs are par for the course, for example, and the adaptation of the original buildings are bound to give rise to an unusual environment in places.OK, firstly, avoid 43 and 42 if you can. I'm not sure about 42 inside, but 43 is a triple at the back on the ground floor with an en suite shower\/toilet room which is tiny to a fault. You literally can not turn round between the door and the sink. OTOH it all works fine, but they did need some new towels too! Even two-star towels shouldn't be unravelling at the edges. The real problem with 43 (and 42) is that they are under the first floor communal (breakfast) area and you get a seemingly constant scraping of chairs at all hours.Breakfast is the usual cereals\/coffee\/juice\/cheese\/ham\/bread kind. The choice is good and when we were there it wasn't too busy at all (the 2 hour window 7-9am seemed fine). They did seem to run out of stuff and we found ourselves asking for coffee and bowls for example on subsequent days, and it should have been better.The acid test is, would I stay again? Sadly, no.
