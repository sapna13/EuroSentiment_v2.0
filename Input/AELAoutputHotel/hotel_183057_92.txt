{"text":"Mixed bag This hotel was a disappointment in some ways, nice in others. The biggest problem I had is that it just isn't that attractive. The lobby is dimly lit, as are the hallways. I found it depressing. The room lighting was a bit better, but still not great. The towels in the bathroom were skimpy. Not thick, and pretty small. I expect more from a 4 star hotel. The continental breakfast was ok, except that the first day we arrived about 20 minutes before it ended, and they had stopped replenishing the food. The juice pitchers were empty and sitting there. There were other choices that they seemed to have run out of (I had been there earlier in the a.m. for coffee, and there was a far greater selection). There is a business center, but they charge $10 per 15 minutes, which after having stayed at 2 hotels that had free internet access, seemed ridiculous.We were erronously charged for internet use and 3 phone calls. When I pointed it out at check out, they promptly and courteously took them off. On the positive: the staff was courteous. They have a small fitness room, and also have complimentary guest passes for a local gym about a 7 minute walk away. Well worth the trouble. It was a great gym, with a separate workout area for women, and classes.The hotel fitness room had a leak and was closed when we were there. I asked for an adjustment on our rate. They declined, but then surprised us with milk and cookies in our room later that day and a nice note from the manager (not sure if they saw the irony in that, but my kids did!!). It was a nice gesture.Overall, the hotel was ok. We stayed there because it was a suite, and it was not as roomy as I had hoped, but maybe that's to be expected downtown in a big city. I probably wouldn't stay here again, as I think there probably are better choices, but I'm not sure.
