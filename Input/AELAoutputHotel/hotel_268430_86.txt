{"text":"A Few issues but overall A great hotel! Would Def Come Back My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel from July 17-23rd. 7 Days and 6 Nights so you could imagine we put some thought into our choice of hotel. We read many reviews on trip advisor and we chose to stay here. For the most part we had a great stay. We did have some issues though. We arrived at the hotel around 11:00am. We had an early flight into San Juan that morning. When we arrived at the hotel we were told that our room was not ready which was to be expected since check in was at 3pm. They did store our luggage and we were able to change and go to the beach\/pool. we were told that we would get a phone call when our room was ready. well we never got that call. finally aroud 3:30pm we inquired about our room and we were given one at 4pm. We got to the room on the 6th floor and as soon as we opened the door the room was humid. We walked in thinking perhaps the AC was not on. As we walked into the room I slipped on the carpet. The carpet was completley wet. My boyfriend then decided to use the restroom and the floor had foot prints all over the floor. I sat on the bed which was rock hard and turned on the tv and none of the channels were working. I finally got off the bed and realized that my pants soaked b\/c the bed was wet due to the humidity in the room. I then heard a noise from coming from the celing and it was a malfunctioning smoke alarm.This was enough for me. we took our things and went downstairs and told the front desk that we needed to have our room changed. we let her know everything that was wrong and appologized. We were given a new room at 5pm. at this point i was exhausted and i wanted to sleep. This new room was an upgrade. It was located on the 7th floor. I was scared to open the door but im glad we did. the room was very clean and smelled good. we had a beautifal view of the ocean. I couldent believe that this room was in the same hotel. everything worked properly in this room and from here on our stay was great. The Pool, and beach are great. Yes the airport is accross the steet and you hear some planes but honestly im from New York and eventually you dont hear the planes anymore. The staff here is very friendly. The casino is a pretty good size but you do get some locals in the weekend. Particularly this young group of buys that think they run the place. other then that the casino is great. All the resturants in the hotel are great too. Wh had on issue at the buffet at salsa and that was resolved with a free meal. This hotel is very customer service oriented and try their best to accoadate your every need. This is a very relaxing atmosphere and is also great for kids. great music every night in the lobby and they have a great happy hour as well. This hotel is convenient to San Juan and if you dont want to pay for a cab jump on the A-5 bus for $.75. This hotel is convenient to all and even with the issues i had i would definatly come back. All due to the customer service i did recieve.
