{"text":"Good and not so good... Went on a 3 day business trip with my wife and then a 1 day pleasure stay.The hotel overall was nice although it is showing some of its age.Some areas near the hotel were nicely designed\/landscaped\/maintained. BUT, other areas had a 3rd world appearance, e.g., an employee side entrance\/dock and my pet peeve the guest parking lot. Parking was $7\/day but guests should be paid to park there! It is absolutely 3rd world atrocious, could never pass in the US especially an Embassy Suites and ESPECIALLY an Embassy Suites that requires paid parking. To go from the parking lot to the hotel required not stepping in sizable potholes, tripping over broken\/uneven pavement, soiling and wetting shoes and luggage.Check-in was disappointing--I have been a Diamond VIP for years yet am still aggravated that attention isn't paid more closely to upgrade requests per online reservations...in fact, automatic upgrades should be the norm for Diamond VIP (but isn't) despite my communication to Hilton--too much variability between hotels0. After checking in to the room, I proceeded to go back down and politely inquire for my original request of an ocean view and was graciously given another room but still an unnecessary hassle.The pool is one of the best features of the hotel (NOTE I am not much of a pool fan). It is large and sweeping with 3 different areas\/levels with cascading from one to the next, with shade from palms interspersed. Water quality was very good with no obnoxious chlorine smell (which actually is an indicator of possible by-product of bacteria kills).The small beach is fairly nice with great breezes and surf since it is located on the windward side of the island.Of particular note was the entire lack of mosquitoes and bugs. [Let this be a warning--see my yet to be written piece per our stay at the Hilton in Ponce on the leeward side (southern) of the island 2 days later.]The breakfast was typical Embassy Suites level. However, a dinner meal turned out to be disappointingly bad.The manager's reception has booze but nothing of note to munch on, although the Caribbean band set up near the pool was great.The fitness room was being refurbished and I was VERY disappointed in the temporary digs with lack of equipment and not cool enough--only 1treadmill was operating--NO EXCUSE.Our room overlooked the plaza\/pool\/beach but noise was not a problem. The band usually quit around 11PM. We had problems with a sluggish shower and toilet drain which required maintenance 3 different times.Overall attitude and service was good but not great--I guess I am too used to great attitudes and service from Mexicans (don't bash me, my wife is a Mexican).Getting to the hotel is not easy but was tolerable in my trips between it and Arecibo about 55 miles away to the west.For 3 nights Tue.-Thur. we paid (my company) $139.99 + 7$\/day parking + the usual and unusual fees\/taxes. Our 4th night Fri. was $149.99 plus out of our pocket.Overall, my wife thoroughly enjoyed her time at the hotel and I did too although I have higher expectations of quality\/consistency of Embassy Suites ","annotations":[]}
