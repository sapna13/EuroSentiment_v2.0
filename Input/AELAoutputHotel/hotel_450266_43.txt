{"text":"Loved every single thing We just got back from our honeymoon which included 3 days in San Juan then 3 days at the Bravo Beach Hotel in Vieques. I urge anyone who's going to try to book suite 9. You walk into a huge room that's completely white except for the dark wood that lines the bed and C shaped couch. There's a modern feel to the room but it's not overstated at all, rather just nice clean lines and really comfortable. A door leads to a dressing room with an extremely large dresser, closet racks and more storage. This room is open to the bathroom which is more traditional with blue tiling. The patio is amazing! It's like 15'x20' and overlooks the pool area, but you also have a roof area from the room to the right that you can get up on and this thing is about 40'60' and overlooks the ocean. It's just a beautiful beautiful room! We ate at a few places but the restaurant at bravo was the best by far. They serve tapas which are like little dishes that I'd never had before. Try the pork and steak dish, because there were amazing. The monfongo fish was average. The only thing that wasn't amazing about the property was the beach, and it's not because the beach was bad, it's just that there are about 10 beaches on the island that are breathtaking, but none of the hotels are on any of them. They're all secluded and off of dirt roads so please rent a jeep or you'll have trouble getting around. I'll be happy to answer any questions regarding puerto rico or vieques. Both places were so amazing and I can't wait to get back there.
