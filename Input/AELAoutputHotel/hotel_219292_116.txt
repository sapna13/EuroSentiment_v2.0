{"text":"Crappy breakfast but otherwise nice hotel Checked into The Wyland with wife for 6 nights and had booked kitchenette with breakfast and airport transfer package. airport transfers were fine as they are handled by another company. first night was traumatic as the noise from the main street is deafening. requested to change rooms the next morning but the 2 ladies on the front desk did not feel sympathetic. they said they could move us to a smaller room which is not as noisy (facing pool). we accepted. i believe we were on 9th floor which was much better. one thing that really annoyed me was the deceiving promotion of free breakfast each morning you stay at this hotel. this is the first hotel i have ever stayed in where they classify a coffee and a muffin as breakfast. this is ordered at the new coffee shop (mind you this coffee shop is owned by another company). so if you were planning on having cereal or fruit for breakfast forget it. in summary;i would not recommend the kitchenette rooms as they are too noisy (all face main road); dont order the kona coffee as its disgusting and have breakfast across the road at ihop. if you want to use internet in lobby be prepared to wait as every man and his dog wants to use it also. apart from that the atmosphere is cool in the lobby and the pool\/landscaping is nice.i would definetly stay here again if the rates are on special again.from Aussies from the land downunder ","annotations":[{"endOffset":35,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":31},{"endOffset":35,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":31},{"endOffset":748,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":742},{"endOffset":761,"mention":"muffin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Muffin"],"startOffset":755},{"endOffset":809,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":803},{"endOffset":809,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":803},{"endOffset":836,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":830},{"endOffset":836,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":830},{"endOffset":836,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":830},{"endOffset":1072,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1066}]}
