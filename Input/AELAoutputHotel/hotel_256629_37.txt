{"text":"Absolutely Terrific!! We had quite a different experience than the previous reviewer... it was absolutely amazing!! We arrived at the hotel at around 8:30am, hoping for a room, but of course since it was so early, we didn't expect anything. The manager on duty was extremely friendly and called housekeeping to service our soon-to-be room. We also upgraded to the Plaza Lounge (for $85\/day, less if you're traveling alone). He sent us up to the lounge where we enjoyed hot and continental breakfast, coffee and tea. Around 10am, the manager came up to escort us to our room -- this is a little longer than what we had anticipated, but we can't really complain since official check-in time is 4pm. Room was very clean, modern, chic, comfortable and bigger than expected! I heard that some hotels in the CBD are small, which is true (our friend was staying at a large 4-star hotel nearby and his room was Manhattan-tiny!). The upgrade includes unlimited internet access, complimentary turndown, 2 pressings for clothes and all-you-can-eat-and-drink beverage and canapes hour -- red, white and sparkling wine, liquor and mixers, beer, soft drinks, sparking water, fresh oysters etc. Needless to say, with all this good food, we hit the gym, which was very well-equipped. Overall, excellent service and a stellar hotel!I would agree though that there is limited selection of food options immediately near the hotel, but after a 5-10 min walk you have a plethora of restaurants of all varieties. Note: many places are closed on Good Friday -- we ate Chinese dimsum for lunch and Chinese for dinner that day :) absolutely amazing ","annotations":[{"endOffset":506,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":500},{"endOffset":514,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":511},{"endOffset":1086,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1081},{"endOffset":1552,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1545},{"endOffset":1581,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1574}]}
