{"text":"Warm, Friendly, Home Away From Home Hotel My family of 4 (2 adults, 13 year old and 10 year) arrived in Florence by train and proceded to walked from the station to Hotel Europa. We strolled along enjoying the city of Florence and found the hotel in less than half an hour. We took the lift to the first floor and were greeted warmly by Robert and his family. We were shown to our lovely quad room and were happily surprised to have such a spacious and clean room. On arriving, I came down with a head cold and felt quite miserable. Fortunately, there is a pharmacy across the road where I could buy homeopathic remedies to relieve the discomfort so that I could continue exploring this beautiful city.The owners provided us with excellent directions, travel advice etc during our stay. I had decided to do a tour with ArtViva to visit the Uffizi Gallery but had not made arrangements prior to leaving Australia. The owners suggested that ArtViva was the best tour guides in Florence. Yes, ArtViva is the best tour guide company in Florence and yes next time we travel to Florence, we will organize booking other tours to the Tuscany region prior to leaving Australia. Wonderful to know that the owners of Hotel Europa are interested in providing the best advice to their clients.The hotel is very central to the restaurant precinct. Robert's wife suggested that we have dinner at Zar Zars. Our children loved this restaurant so much that we ate every evening meal there.Our teenage boy was most impressed that the hotel provided free Internet access so that he could keep in contact with his friends back home. Thank you, Hotel Europa. Warm hospitable hotel in the heart of beautiful Florence. We would recommend this hotel to any family group staying in Florence.
