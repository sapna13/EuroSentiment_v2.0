{"text":"Awesome - BUT First off I must say that I picked the Outrigger on the beach after reading mostly good reviews regarding the hotel. Their seemed to be a theme with the complaints being, the lifts, the exhaust fans from the cheese cake factory or the walls being to thin. Despite these we still felt that it sounded the best, not to mention it was the 4th most popular at the time.Now, my wife and I were on our honeymoon and we travelled 10 hours from Australia. We were really looking forward to a good rest and a sleep in for a day or two, after the stresses of wedding prep. Our flight arrived early morning so we were at the hotel by about 10am. Rather than go on and on about the staff and Hawaiian people in general let me just say that they are all the friendliest and most professional people going around. The customer service anywhere you go is more than you can ask for.Ok, check in at the hotel is 3pm, but the staff found us a room (ocean view which we paid for) no problems. It was room 721. This is where I put in my only complaint about our experience. The hotels walls must be made of tissue paper. 6am the next morning we could hear every word spoken from the room next door like they were standing on our bed and talking. Then the cleaners start at about 7.30am in the hall ways and they can be heard quite clearly as well. THIS WAS OUR ONLY COMPLAINT. We quietly complained and were moved to room 1522, which had no common walls, without any fuss at all. You could still hear the cleaners in the morning, but it was much better.Another good thing about being on the 15th floor was that you could use the express lift which only goes to floors 14 to the penthouse, so I suggest you ask to be put on 14 or above if you can. The location is awesome, walking distance to really good shopping (and Ala Moana if your keen). It's on the best part of the beach also. There are washing machines and dryers for hotel guests to use and right near there is a small sandwich shop that makes pretty nice sandwiches for when you are all steaked out.Recommend: dolphin experience at sealife park, pay the 7 bucks for the guided tour of the Missouri, don't bother getting up early for the Arizona as the line will already be very long. We went around midday but no later, hire a car and explore, the Plantation Spa in the Penthouse and dinner at the Westin next door. Get the filet mignon with the chocolate and whiskey sauce, it's unbelievable. Well hope this helps in any way.
