{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Spot! After reading the previous reviews, we were pretty confident about staying here. You should be too....Location...It is in a really good spot...on the right side of Dam Square. It's on a quiet but safe street. The trams are very near and very regular. we used to get the 16 or 25 (i think) from the other side of Dam at times when we were too tired, but it can be walked easily . It was about a 5\/ 10 minute walk from Dam. No bothers. Just near the Heineken Brewery. The Hotel...The room was really clean, comfortable and spacious enough. We stayed in a triple room (Room 17). We were very happy with the bathroom everything was spotless and clean towels every day. Breakfast...Continental breakfast, oj, tea\/coffee, boiled eggs, bread, jams, crackers. Good to keep you going 'til lunch..Nightlife...Leidsplein, Cafe de Waard is good for music. The irish bar was alright, even though we sat outside. When the bars close at 1 a.m. ask any barman where Biblos is. It's just around the corner but make sure you go around the right corner. When Biblos closes at 3a.m. ask those barmen where Bourbon St. is. It's all great craic. All of the locals are really friendly and really know their languages. Can't wait to go back to Amsterdam and will definately stay here again! P.S. Make sure you go to Volendam and Marken to see windmills, cheese farm and clogs and a ferry ride with Lindburgh Excursions. Must do a canal ride as well.
