{"text":"Don't assume that you will be able to have dinner here. Very nice room, not huge but we have stayed in smaller 4* hotel rooms in London.We had dinner in the hotel restaurant on the first night of our 4 night stay. The food was fabulous if a little expensive. We decided that we would economise on our lunches out and eat in the hotel restaurant every evening. We attempted to book for the next evening and were told that they were full for the next two evenings and closed on Sundays. This was not actually true. they closed for three evenings. So we were staying in a 4* hotel but unable to eat there in the evenings.We had booked for breakfast, and, after reading reviews here I was interested to see if we would be offered a cooked breakfast. The earlier comments were correct. It seems to be a closely guarded secret that a cooked meal is available. We were told 'it's a buffet'. I said actually we would prefer a cooked breakfast. This was immediately agreed to. I asked for bacon scrambled eggs and tomatoes. They had run out of bacon (9.15 a.m.) but offered sausages instead. The food was beautifully cooked and presented. The weekend morning staff were very obliging but again no offer of cooked food was made, but quickly provided when we asked for it.They ran out of bacon on Monday too. How strange to do that twice in four days, but the sausages were an excellent replacement.Food was very disappointing in the other places nearby.We were not told that the hotel restaurant sometimes opens for lunch. If we had known we could have had a leisurely lunch after checking out while we waited for the time for our eurostar journey back. Instead we sat at a pavement cafe in a torrential thunderstorm eating Italian food. There is no way of walking into the restaurant at the moment without leaving the building and coming back in a door further down the road because work is being done to the passageway through.Monmarte in general was very dirty and down at heel. It is 20 years since we last visited and we won't bother to go back again. The staff were 'mixed' some very nice and really helpful 'Nicholas'and the female staff particularly, but most of the male staff were very 'Parisien' in thier attitudes(and not in a good way). Generally the hotel was good but little things could have made it better. Our luggage was stored for us after we checked out but it was filthy when it was brought back to us. Not a big problem but a reflection on the hotel nonetheless.
