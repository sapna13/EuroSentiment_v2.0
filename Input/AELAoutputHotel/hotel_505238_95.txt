{"text":"Good Quality Hotel Just got back from a weekend stay at this hotel which I booked on lastminute.com for my Mum's 60th birthday. Getting to the hotel via taxi was easy and not too expensive, around √ä√£¬¢25.Check-in time was adverstised by lastminute at 2pm and when we arrived we had a bit of a delay in checking in, but it wasnt a major problem. Leaving bags wasnt a problem though. Rooms were nicely furnished and the free mini bar with water and beer was a nice touch (only one bottle of beer a day though!). On the first day we headed into the Diagonal Mar shopping centre which has a great selection of shops, and the bars\/restaurants outside on the 3rd floor offer somewhere to handy and reasonably priced to eat and drink if you cant be bothered heading back into the city after a hard days sightseeing!After trying the tram, we found the metro station which was much easier. Buy the T10 which allows you 10 journeys for about 7euros - its good value if you're there for a weekend. The Metro is really simple to use and quick to get to the centre. Didn't try the hotel for breakfast or dinner as there are other options in the cafe opposite or in the shopping centre. The area around the hotel is fine - part residential, part commercial. Some interesting buildings nearby too. Tried the pool on the 23rd floor - nice and warm (even in Oct!). Its a bit of a novelty factor really, but an enjoyable experience.Overall, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind the Metro and wants good value in a nice hotel.
