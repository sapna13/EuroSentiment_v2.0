{"text":"Fantastic hotel! We stayed in this hotel over the Easter week-end and let me just tell you what a fantastic time we had. We flew from Shannon to Paris Beauvais airport, shuttle bus dropped us at the Port Maillot, which is only 2 stops away by Metro from the hotel, but we decided to have a little walk and less than 10 min later we were in the welcoming lobby of the Royal Magda Etoile. Check in was so quick and efficient that in no time we were going up in the tiny elevator to our room on the 6th floor. As mentioned before √à√\u2020\u2022?rooms are small but have everything you need, bed is extremely comfortable and bathroom is full size with a bathtub with a very good water pressure in the shower. Our room no 611 had a lot of windows which made our room feel very bright even on the dull, rainy day (yes, the weather was very bad all week-end). We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have breakfast in the hotel, but it smelled lovely every morning in the lobby. Location of the hotel is fantastic; you are 2 min walk from the Arc de Triomph, Champs Elysee and metro station. You are only few minutes away from great selection of restaurant, bars, shops and etc. And this good location means a lot, especially if the weather is so bad and rain is just pouring non-stop, we could run to restaurants, metro and even La Duree (for some macaroons) without getting soaked wet :) Check out was as quick as check in and took less than 5 min, giving us time for a cup of coffee before our bus trip to Beauvais airport. Despite the bad weather we had an amazing week-end in Paris and we would like to thank all the fantasticl staff for making our stay so pleasant. For the price you pay for this hotel I would rate Royal Magda Etoile as a hidden gem of Paris.
