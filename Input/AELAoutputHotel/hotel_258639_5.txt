{"text":"Nice 'n Clean! I had the pleasure of staying at the Dorchester on 7-10-08 thru 7-13-08. This was a girl's escapade! My friend  I were quite impressed with the hotel. We were almost certain that we were going to be staying in a DUMP based on the reviews we had read. However, it was definitely the opposite! Whatever you do: DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS...THEY OVER EXAGGERATE!THE STAFF: Pleasant  helpfulTHE ROOM: Two very comfortable queen size beds, with white sheets  a white bed spread, which definitely lets you know that it is clean! We requested a renovated room, so we had hard wood floors, which were swept  mopped daily. The bathroom was small, but clean. Towels  toiletries were stocked daily. The 19 inch tv was out-dated , but who cares? We came to South Beach to par-tay!!! The a\/c unit was an oldie, but goodie. Our room was aleast 60 degrees or cooler (burr!). Other reviews complained about the walls being thin, but we didn't hear anything. We slept like babies for 3 nights!THE POOL AREA: Was decent. There was a poolside bar. Happy hour was daily from 7p-8p. Only cheap liquors were free!THE HALLWAYS: You could tell the carpet was worn  old, but they filled the hallways with a pleasant air freshener daily.THE LOBBY: Was very artsy  contemporary. Having an ATM was very convenient  safe. The piano was a great accent to any photo shot!PARKING: Seemed to be a little congested, but workable.***Just keep in mind that this is NOT a 5 star hotel, only a 3 1\/2! For the price, it is definitely a steal! Very convenient to SB  just a quaint, comfortable, clean place to stay if you are looking to explore more of South Beach and not the actual room! Perfect for a girl's or guy's trip only! Wouldn't plan a romantic getaway here.
