{"text":"Hotel Casci is Wonderful! We stayed at Hotel Casci for the second time for two nights in September, and once again, we were extremely pleased with our overall experience.I can't say enough about the warmth and friendliness of the staff. We felt like family being welcomed back, although we had stayed for only one night back in September '05. They truly go above and beyond to advise and help, whether you stay for a night or a week. My husband and I were traveling with my parents and my brother this time, and I set everything up directly with Pierpaolo via email. We were given a very good deal for a family room, with a large bathroom, and in addition to museum reservations, he booked restaurants for us.The Casci feels more like a 3* than a 2*. For starters, and as previous reviewers have mentioned, you cannot beat the hotel's location, within walking distance from so many sites, including the Duomo, the Accademia, San Lorenzo, etc., and a huge plus for my parents, who are in their 70's. In addition, the hotel is EXTREMELY clean and the rooms are very quiet. I believe all the rooms have mini-fridges, which is a huge plus, and though not fancy, the beds are just fine, and we found there was enough storage space for all five of us and our 2-weeks' worth of luggage.The breakfast is perfect, the breakfast room lovely, and the service is excellent. They will make cappucino, caffe macchiato, etc. There's also parking available (at a daily rate), which is such a great help, as you'll want to get rid of your car immediately upon arrival. And, when you check out, they give you a lovely Toscana calendar, as well as excellent directions, and more importantly, a warm farewell. I will continue to highly recommend this hotel to all who are visiting Florence, and I will surely stay again the next time I'm there.
