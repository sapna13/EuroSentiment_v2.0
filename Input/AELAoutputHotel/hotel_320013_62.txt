{"text":"The Conrad is one of the best hotels... period! My wife and I just completed a five night stay at the Bali Conrad Resort. From the minute you check in, the hotel provides a wonderful experience.I have so many great things to say about the hotel so I will get the two cons out of the way (and I really had to scrape to come up with them)1. The sound dampening in the room isn't that great. You can hear the room above you put the toilet seat down or get in the shower.2. The rooms were equipped with analog clocks that present two problems. One, if you wake up when it's dark you can not see what time it is. Two, the tick tock from these little things got so annoying I eventually took the battery out.So now the pros:1. The grounds are beautiful and immaculate. I woke up early one morning and when I looked out the window I saw the staff literally sweeping the grass.2. The rooms are large and comfortable. The bed is great and the bathroom with the huge bathtub was wonderful. When we checked in there was a basket full of roses and orchids on our bed for us to take a bath in.3. The pool and beach are great. When you lie out, the staff bring you in a little basket cold towels, a water spritzer and two bottle of cold water. The pool is the perfect temperature for a dip after a day of sun bathing. 4. All of the hotel resteraunts are very good. Although they are overpriced for Bali standards (30,000 RP for a soda which is over $3) they are less than what you would expect at a similar resteraunt in the states.5. By far the best pro this hotel has to offer is the staff. They were the most attentive and friendly staff I have ever met at any hotel anywhere in the world! They always have a huge smile on their faces and will bend over backward to make your trip everything you expected.If you are planning on staying in Nusa Dua, this is the hotel to stay at. If you're ever unsure what you are getting, take a walk down the beach and look at the other properties. It will make you feel a lot better about your selection.One note on the area. Nusa Dua is not near much as far as cultural Bali goes. If you really want to get out and explore the real Bali, you're better off staying in Ubud. If you do make Nusa Dua your home base, make sure you get dinner one night at Bumbu Bali.Also, I would strongly suggest joining the hotels club. As a HHonors Diamon member, we were given free access to it. However, even if you have to pay for it (USD 25 a day maybe?) it is well worth it. You get free breakfast every morning, afternoon tea and early evening drinks\/canapes. You also get 15% off all of the resteraunts as well as the business center and laundry. As soemone who has travelled primarily in the USA, I was skeptical the club would be any more than cookies and soda. However it is far more than that and well worth it!
