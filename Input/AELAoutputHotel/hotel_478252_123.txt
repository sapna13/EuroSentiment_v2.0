{"text":"Would recommend this hotel, fantastic!!! We stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe, Punta Cana side for 2 weeks. We booked our holiday through Thomson travel agents. When we first arrived to the hotel there were some maintenance works going on at the front which was really annoying because you couldnt hear the receptionist. But the reception is so far away it doesnt effect your stay. We went straight to our rooms on a little cart which was driven by the bell boy and our suitcases were on the back. They even took our suit cases up to the third floor which was handy. The room was nice and big, very clean and the air conditioning was brilliant as it was sooo hot!!! First thing me and my boyfriend did was head to the beach to see what it was like. Amazing, clean and well kept. There are plenty of umberllas on the beach so you will find somewhere to sit as the beach is huge. We used to sit on the beach in the morning and swimming pool in the afternoon. I must say every day you will see staff walking around picking up any litter!! They take pride on keeping that beach clean. Just annoys me when you see people leaving their plastic cups\/cigarette buts on the beach...they get picked up very quickly though. And the same goes for the poolside. There are plenty of bins everywhere. Poolside was a bit busier, but still we got there in the afternoon and we still found a lounger every day. We sat at the main pool near the beach. Now down to the food. We went to 4 a la cartes. Mexican, garden grill, japanese and gourmet. The best was Garden Grill and Japanese. The Gourmet was a bit strange but still we tried it. We heard good feed back about the other restaurant el pascardor which is a fish restaurant. Shame we missed that meal due to being back late from an excursion. The buffett is good, ive been to other all inclusives before and this one was by far the best. Breakfast was a selection of everything you can think of. Lunch we always had near the pool and the food isnt kept there for to long, you will always see them replacing the food with freshly cooked food. There pizza is really nice. Ok you will get board of some of the food but hey you got to expect that. I must say i did like the fact that every night in the buffett they will have a themed night, like Italian or Chinese. The room was cleaned every day by our maid which was nice to always come back to after a day out. She done all her little art work with the towels and flowers which was nice. We left her $1 a day. We went on 4 trips:Soana island - amazing, the best trip of the whole holiday...get to go on a paddle boat, then speed boat and after you had lunch on the island you get to go back on a caterman.Monster Truck Safari - really good, got to see different bits of Dominican and how they live. We visited a school and even a vodoo witch doctor which was a bit scary.Ocean World (swimming with dolphins) - we went by aeroplane which was only an 18 seater!!! Swimming with dolphins was amazing. We saw the shark and sea lion show but there wasnt alot else to do there. We did get a bit board.Speed Venture - you get your on speed boat per couple, my boyfriend drove it and thought he was James Bond...was really good fun and you get to stop off and swim with tropical fish which was amazing.The hotel overall was very well kept, you will always see them keeping to very high standards. Staff were brilliant, there were some struggles with the language but us english are used to that going to other european countries. It wasnt a problem. Oh and they will give you a little passport which will tell you about the hotel and will have a map on. You will need this when you arrive as the resort is quite big. And to be honest it doesnt make any difference which side you stay on (Bavaro, or Punta Cana) they are exactly the same!!Also if you are searching to find out what the weather is like out there,ignore the weather forecast's as it is always wrong apparently. Its boiling hot and sunny and you get the occasional storm which clears quickly. If you are going to this hotel, enjoy....me and my boyfriend certainly did and we would recommend it to our friends and family so that must mean something.
