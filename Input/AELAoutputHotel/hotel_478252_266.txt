{"text":"Don't sweat the small stuff I have been to Punta Cana six times, each a different resort. All of these previous resorts had had mixed reviews; but I found each of the places I had stayed...Great!!Just got back, 1st week in March.The Bahia Principe is a great resort, awesome villas, beautiful grounds, great beach area with lots of beach chairs and plenty of shade from the sun (if you so choose). The staff was great (mostly).I had plenty of reasons to have a negative review, be angry and I could have done a lot of complaining while at the resort. But, really it's all about the attitude. I had, unlike all my previous stays in Punta Cana, problems with checking in, with the restaurants, towels, and with food. But I chose to have a good time, and I did. The problems are trivial, and if you focus your energy on the negative, then you'll be miserable; just move on and you'll have great time. The best I found was the beach, plenty of shaded resting spots, also the live band and stage were great, the Japanese restaurant--don't miss it. Least liked... ... nothing really, for the money, I got way more than my money's worth regardless of the little incidentals. Though, I would not reccomend it to my friends, only because I found it too big--it's like 5 resorts combined in 1; and there are way more people (depending on timing of course) than there are facilities. But, overall, the resort is a great place to visit. ","annotations":[]}
