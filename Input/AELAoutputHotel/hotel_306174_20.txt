{"text":"Only an Eyewash and a Complete Sham Hi, I stayed at this place for nearly 4 weeks and I had to stay there since there were no other hotels available. The only positive I can write about this place is it proximity to Orchard Road. After that there are only negatives to list out:a) It is mentioned in the hotel facilities that there are In-house movies - But what you get is a TV, which airs the 6 free channels and one of the channels shows an english movie once in a while!b) Healthcenter with Sauna - What you get is a nearby massuer belonging to some other private person, who offers only Paid Massages and nothing else!c) Free Breakfast - There are only 6 food items, which are repeated every single day!d) Reception - The worst lot I have seen. I was to receive a very very urgent mail and was enquiring with them for 3 days as to whether they had received anything for me and despite having received the package 3 days back, they kept telling me NO! I had to finally contact UPS and get a confirmation from them as to whom they had given the package to!e) Coffee House and Cyber Cafe - They are paid and belong to some private party other than Grand Central!f) Swimming Pool - It is so tiny and so shallow that it should be called a 'Bath Tub' rather than a Swimming Pool.Towards the end, I would just say that people should avoid this place unless they are desparately looking for staying somewhere near Orchard Road!
