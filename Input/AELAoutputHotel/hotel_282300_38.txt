{"text":"Walls made of paperboard We stayed in this hotel for five nights around New Year's Eve 2007\/2008.Pros:- We booked it for a rather attractive price during the holiday season (~ EUR 130 per night, incl. breakfast)- Clean- Well sized rooms and beds for the price- Good location (I cannot understand why other reviewers are complaining about 'safety' ... I think it's a very nice area, close to the city center as well as the yacht port  beach)- Amazing breakfast, well organized even when the hotel is fully bookedCons:- We first got a room with two small beds instead of one big bed. After the first night we were given another room with a nice king size bed.- We were sometimes wondering if someone else was in our bathroom, but it was just our neighbor going to his own loo. I cannot imagine how a newly built house can have so thin walls.- Our room was located at the end of a corridor, close to a service room. So starting at 7 am we could hear the maids running in and out of this room all the time. I am glad I had my earplugs with me.- The heating (Barcelona is not in the Caribbean!) stops as soon as you take out your key card to leave the room. So when you come back, the room will be freezing cold. And if you leave a second card in the slot, the maid will remove it.- When we wanted to spend a nice afternoon in the spa (EUR 14 per person and day) we were warned at the spa entrance that both sauna and whirlpool were not well heated. So of course we abstained.We will probably not book this hotel again.
