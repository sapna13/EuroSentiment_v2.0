{"text":"Don't do it. We arrived at hotel piccolo to find no parking or assistance with parking in the busy streets of florence  then no lift within the drab little hotel  having to drag our luggage up 3 flights of stairs to find an exceptionally rude person at reception who offered absoloutely no help whatsoever when it came to recommending restaurants or directions. Then to my absoloute horror, the toilet was actually inside the shower there was no barrier between the two  no space to move. The internet connection is terrible  the attendents had no idea of how to work it. Then when we made the decision to leave the hotel in order not to ruin our florence experience they charged us a higher rate at a minumum of 2 nights even though we only stayed on night. I would definitely recommend people NOT to stay here. In my experience having a good hotel base makes the trip much more enjoyable - my partner  I both sacrificed alot more money than we planned to find another hotel  pay the increased rate hotel piccolo decided to charge us at the last minute after telling us originally that they would not charge us a penalty for staying less nights. We ended up staying in Il GUELFO BIANCO which was an exceptional hotel the rooms were huge the service was great - they saved our florence experience. If you want to enjoy Florence DO NOT GO TO HOTEL PICCOLO. I have a photo of the bathroom  will load it on here when I have a chance - a picture speaks a thousand words. ","annotations":[]}
