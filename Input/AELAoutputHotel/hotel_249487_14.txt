{"text":"Absolutley loved it! I stayed at the San Juan Water  Beach Club from Sept. 3-8 and all i can say that it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is literally 5mins away from the airport. The employees at the hotel were reallyyyy friendly. They would greet you every time you come in, and at times some of the front desk agents will greet you by your first name...excellent customer service skills. The bell boy in the morning and evening were really kind. They know all the places to go and will tell you how to get there. Also, Kevin the beach guy was very cool and down to earth.I asked for a room upgrade with a better view and the accommodated us the very next day with an ocean view room! Our rooms were really nice and clean. The bed was a king size very comfortable. Our mini bar was full and they had a basket full of snacks and some other products that we might need for an extra charge. The cool thing about the room is that they had and Ihome where you can plug in your ipod an listen to your own music. Also the blue lighting was ok...but it makes the hotel unique. Bathroom was small, but clean...no complaints..and cable TV. If I had to suggest something for the hotel i would suggest them to upgrade their TV to a Flat screen...it would make the rooms feel more chic and modern.The beach was literally across the street from the hotel...was absolutely beautiful. The roof top was really nice and chic. The pool was really small...and i didn't spend too much time in the roof unless if it was in the evening. The drinks were really good but a tad expensive. We had some drinks at the Tangerine bar and the bartender (young guy around mid 20's) was sooo friendly and yet he made great strong drinks. If you do want to save money a block away was a Walgreen, you can buy some snacks and beer and not waste money at the hotel...it will cost you!We didn't have dinner at the Tangerine restaurant, we went to Mi Casita which is a 5min walk from the hotel and i highly recommend it for breakfast and Dinner (inexpensive) and sooooo yummy try their Pork Chops and Mofongo...it's soo yummy!Old San Juan is about a 45min bus ride from the hotel. It is totally worth it and beautiful. If you do go their, you must go to La Bombonera in Calle San Francisco...delishes pastries and Cafe con Leche...so delish!Overall, i loved the hotel because of the Chicness, friendly employees, and the convenience of the beach. I recommended for young couples who likes to enjoy the night life at the roof top or just fun vacation goer's if you're looking for just plain boriness...stay at the Holiday Inn!
