{"text":"Returned Dec 29, 2006. Before I start me review, I must say that after reading all the review before my departure I was very worried, if we picked a good location. Most reviews were very bad. But you have to see it to believe it.........SO, here is my review.Lets start with the airport, transportation and check in. All were great, did not wait long at all. Everyone is very friendly and happy to see you. Everytime we needed services at the reception, we had to problems and they helps ASAP.The hotel, it was great, very nice, we stayed at The Club, its the new section of the the bavaro resort. It was beautiful, and we were able to use both resorts. We had a garden view and superior room. Rooms were clean every day, and our maid Aurora was the best, we left gifts for her every day. And we always had fresh towels, flowers, and hot water.The beach was the best ever, I travel a lot and this hotel and beach was the best I have been too. The water was great, and always waves to have fun in. We had sun for the full 7 days of our stay. It rained at night twice, but we didn't see it.The food, I can't believe how good the food was. My daughter is very fussy, and she found something to eat all the time. The sepcialities restaurants were great!! Chinese was our best, the the steak house was good too. Can complain about the food it was great and had good flavor too.........We went on the Mountain View Safari, wow if you do excursions this is a must. This was the greatest part of our trip, it's a must see. Expensive at $80us per\/person but worth every dollar. I traveled with the 2 daughters and my niece and we all agreed this was the best. this location is great if you have kids. There were kids everywhere. And since it was Christmas they really went all out of the visitors. The night show were great and on Christmas day they had a Santa riding a horse on the beach. I don't know what else to say, before I left on vacation I read a lot of comments and I was worried, but to be honest, I don't know what some people were talking about. this place was the best. Yes there were some french canadians complaining about everything, but heck your in thier country and its third world what the heck do you expect. Considering that it's a third world country I think the Bavaro was great........... And the people and the village we visited were all great too.......... We would definitely recommend this hotel and we would go back in the future.Phyllis, Kahnawake, Quebec.
