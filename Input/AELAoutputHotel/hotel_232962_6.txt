{"text":"Fine hotel in a great location with friendly staff I stayed here as part of a conference, and found it to be a fine, pleasant property with a good mix of local character and modern amenities. The staff were all helpful, friendly, proficient in English, and efficient. I found the rooms to be spacious and quiet, and the morning breakfast was very good. Although it didn't vary much from day to day, there was enough to choose from to make each morning different.My room on floor 3 ended up being too warm for my taste, but the windows didn't have screens, so I didn't feel comfortable leaving the windows open for better ventilation (plus the windows shut out street noise, which can be quite noticeable in the city). It would have helped to have a TV remote, a clock in the room, and a bit more explanation in the room (how to dial using the telephone, how to use the room control system, internet connectivity). But what the room lacked in explanation, the staff made up for in helpfulness (happy to give directions, provide wake-up call).I'm not sure if internet works this way in all the other hotels, but internet service was purchased in advance by the hour, and could be spread out over several days. So, your time on and off the internet was measured (be sure to disconnect when you're not using it), and I ended up spreading 10 hours of purchased internet over 5 days (but I didn't figure out if there was a way to monitor how much time you had left).The hotel was a great location for my conference in the Fortessa di Basso, and is very close to the train station. It was right next to a street market, which was interesting to browse through, and close enough for a nice walking tour of all the sights of Firenze. Overall, a very pleasant stay and I would recommend it for visitors to Florence.
