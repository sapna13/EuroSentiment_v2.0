{"text":"Perfect for us! Background: We are in our mid-twenties, travelling for leisure and some adventure. Spent 8 days, all on Oahu. Booked this Hilton (standard room) through TripRes.com , which gave us a rate of $157 per night, with the 8th night for free.Location: Yes, the hotel is NOT right on the beach, but it's NOT FAR from it. It's an easy 2-block walk ( you can see the beach from the ocean side windows of the hotel from the higher level floors). It's on Kuhio Road, which is one street away from Kalakaua, the busy,popular road. Mapquest this prior to booking so there is no confusion about the location. There is an ABC convenience store right across from it (which was great for things we needed to pick up, here and there) and 1 block away from McDonalds, Haagen Daz, and other restaurants. I actually preferred this location over the other busy ones.Parking: It is valet only, for $20 \/ day but with in\/out priveleges. It worked out well for us, though I understand ppl's concern with the price. We liked the convenience of just being able to pull up and not worry about parking or walking far. We were always in \/out of the hotel and this worked out best for us.Room: We got the standard mountainview room, which was good for us. Newly renovated. Very soft bed! Great flat screen t.v. with lots of plugs to use with your laptop, your camera, or any other gadget. The only thing that might bother some ppl is that the bathroom has glass windows that overlook the bedroom. BUT, they did put blinds on them, so you can close them if you're sharing the room with ppl you are not that comfortable with. There is an in room safe, fridge,ironing board, and best of all, a cuisin-art coffee maker with FREE kona blend coffee,tea,etc . This was a great treat, as we had coffee every morning, and they even provide the portable cups so you can take your coffee out with you! As for noise, we were on the 19th floor, and there was no street noise to speak off from up there. Housekeeping: Was always on point! One day my bf left something upstairs, and as he walked up to our room, the housekeeper was there. When he said he left something in the room, she first asked for his keycard, made sure it swiped correctly on the door, before really letting him in!!! My bf appreciated this act as it assured us an extra sense of security. We always had fresh towels, new mugs + coffee everyday. We left a tip of 1-2 dollars daily. Internet: There is FREE internet in the business center 24 hours a day. OR, if you brought your laptap, there is FREE wifi hot spots in the lobby and in the pool area. You only paid for internet if you really wanted it in your room. But if you're only checking emails, doing small things (like my bf checking bball scores and our flight info), then it's super convenient to just walk to the business center and use it all for FREE.Any other questions, feel free to msg me here!
