{"text":"Never go there if you have a choice... I took my clients to attend a international conference there at Melia bali, Nusa Dua. The hotel looks alright\/ average appearntly, just like any other hotels in Nusa Dua. Most of the staff seemed friendly on the first day. The problem was the interior was old, and some parts are way too old. Some reviews mention the rooms were smelly, I wich it was that simple...There was one night I woke up at 3pm by this smelly fume in my room, then I turned the lights on and realised that it was smoky in my room and I started to feel dizzy and could not breathe properly. I called the house keeping and went out to wait on the balcony. The maintainance guy came and checked the room and found that the engine of the A\/C was burnt. Imagine, if I didn't wake up by myself, I might have not woken up anymore... Later, I had to switch to another room at 3:30am. Also, one of my clients left some USD notes in his pants which was left in the room. He came back in the evening, found the room had been made and the USD were gone. We talked to the manager and the security guy came to my client's room to go through every single item in his lugguge as a standard procedure of inspection. Later they told us that the staff who made up the room was a senior supervisor who had worked there for more than 10 years, and we were asked to proove that the dollar note did not slip out from the pocket by any chance. On the last day before we checked out, we spoke to the sales manager who were in charge of our group and he said that he was never informed by anyone about those incidences and he was truely sorry, that was the best he could do. We quicky checked out the hotel and went to the airport. My conclustion is that there are 1000's of hotels and resorts in Bali, I probably don't need such deadly expereinces anymore.
