{"text":"Great value, as advertised SUMMARY: Believe the hype on this and other review sites - Hotel Casci is a find. Great location with 4-star service at a 2-star priceCONTEXT: We had two rooms for 3 nights at the Casci in early Nov 2006. Prices (after 10% deal and seasonal discounts) were 63 and 90 Euros for a single and double respectively. Arranged reservation by emailing the hotel directly (best price we found). Clientele during our visit was about 40% American, 40% non-Italian European and 20% JapaneseTHE PROPERTY: The hotel is rated 2 star which is fair for the accomodation, breakfast, etc - but the service is more representative of a 4 star (more on that below). Very centrally located - midway (~5 minutes walk) between the Duomo Piazza and David \/ Accademia. Even the Uffizi, Palazzo Vecchio and the Ponte Vecchio are no more than a 15 minute casual stroll. Numerous shopping and dining options also in close proximity. And, if you are going further afield, the hotel easily arranges taxis when needed.The rooms (we stayed in 12  14) were simple but did have small TVs (with BBC, CNN and various Italian stations) and a safe. Beds were somewhat hard for our liking, but not overly so. The level of cleanliness really stood out, especailly the bathrooms.The hotel is on the 2nd (3rd for US readers) floor, but does have a small lift - very helpful with luggage as the typical Florence floors are significantly higher than most modern buildingsSERVICE: The Lombardis, especially Pierpaolo and Carla for our visit, were top notch. Consistently friendly, helpful and available. Before we arrived, they offered to make museum (Uffizi and Accademia specifically) reservations, which even in low season saved us a number of hours waiting in line for tickets. While in residence we had a few simple business-related issues (faxes sent and received, emails, photocopying) to take care of which was all handled professionally and quickly - definitely exceeded expectations for a 2-star tourist hotel. In fact there is a PC in the lobby with free internet access, alternatively you can 'buy' access to a wireless router if you prefer to use your own laptop.FOOD: Breakfast was plentiful but not memorable. You might have to share a table as the dining space is relatively small. Do understand, this is not just bread and jam \/ preserves, and maybe a piece or two of sliced meat or cheese that many cheaper hotels offer in Europe, but do don't expect haute cuisine or in fact much in teh way of hot food. The buffet includes boiled eggs, toast , fresh and packaged pastries, yoghurt, fruit, a few cereals and some packaged cheeses, spreads.
