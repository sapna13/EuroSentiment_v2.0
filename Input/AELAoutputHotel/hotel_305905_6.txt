{"text":"Great middle of the road hotel The Royal Garden is a great middle of the road hotel. Hong Kong, and especially mainland China tend to overstate their star ratings - many times leaving travelers disappointed w\/ the $$ they are spending. In the TST East section of Hong Kong there are only a few really nice hotels to stay at: The Grand Stanford, Shangri-la, Intercontinental and the Royal Garden. The Royal Garden is probably the lowest on the list as far as upgraded, luxury rooms, but it is also the least expensive. It also happens to be in the triangle of the best area in TST East. The only downfall is you do not have a clear view of the Harbour -- but who cares, it's all about the location and EVERY restaurant in HK has harbour views, you will see the Harbour plenty during your stay in HK.Ok, back to the hotel... Great breakfast buffet, but it doesn't open until 6:50 am. Noise can be a factor in the hotel as it has an open atrium style floor plan -- meaning all of the rooms open out to the large atrium (sort of like a garden apartment) and there is a noisy restaurant on the main floor along w\/ a piano player -- and he goes until around midnight or so. The beds are pretty comfortable and the TVs are extra large flat panels. The lack of wireless internet is a drag, and the fact that you must pay for it makes it worse. However, like I mentioned before, the location is prime and worth the trade-off.Try the Martini bar on the first floor - but beware of the cigarette smoke.
