{"text":"Interesting but acceptable We recently stayed at the Hotel V in amsterdam during our 14 day europe backpacking tour. First i have to say it is the most expensive hotel we have stayed at during the entire trip (124 euro). I did not realize how expensive hotels in amsterdam are if you don't want to stay in a hostel (hostels in amsterdam are a little shady if your not single and wasted.) Anyway, the hotel itself is located just outside of city center, not neccessarily a bad thing. There is a tram stop just at the corner so it is ver accesable, i believe Tram #4. More importantly when you are not completely with it after midnight the night bus is #355. The entrance to the hotel is a flight of steps that leads you to the lobby with a nice reception area. I guess the lobby person thought we were fit so she stuck us on the 4th floor. Typical amsterdam style, steep stairs that curve around. The room itself was pretty nice. The decor is very 70's with large cushions and weird looking furniture that has no purpose. The bed i have to say sucked. It was two twin beds pushed together, with wheels on a hardwood floor. Needless to say if you are with your significant other, over time there will be a big hole between two beds perfect to fall into. It was quite annoying. The bathroom was nice with a decent shower and good water pressure. The absolute best thing about the hotel is that it is quiet. In addition they provide a fan which is also nice.Overall its a decent hotel. The price is very elevated, but it is at par with most of the other hotels in amsterdam. The distance from the city center is not really as bad as some have made it, i believe its actually better in a way if you are looking for a quite place to sleep.
