{"text":"Good place to stay but don't get pressured into buying a time share My husband and I bought into the Melia Vacation Club program 4 years ago when we first visited the Dominican Republic. We loved this resort as did our then teenage sons and the program was reasonable. We've since visited other Melia properties and have been disappointed in many of them. We have also tried every year to go to the property in Costa Rica only to be told that this one is generally impossible to get because Vacation Club Members who have this property as their home base use up the available time. In fact, we were told by the booking agents based in Miami that the Paradisus Playa Conchal shouldn't even be part of the program because it's so hard to get. This year, they tried to upgrade our program which is three times the price of our original one (33K vs. 10.8K). On the surface, it's interesting if you're an inexperienced traveler. We are not. We travel a great deal and have come to realize that the Melia properties vary from place to place and that they are not always the best ones to stay in. So, do not get pressured into buying into their program. Their sales people are very slick and try to make you feel positively stupid when you turn them down.We're fortunate that the Paradisus Punta Cana is our home base because this property is really the best one they have in our opinion. While the Paradisus Palma Real (about 15 minutes away) is brand new and very glitzy, we (and our sons) prefer the Paradisus Punta Cana. It's much friendlier with a warmer, more hospitable atmosphere.My big complaint, however, as a vacation club member is that they always try to find a way to extract additional funds -- like charging us $100 extra per person (mandatory) for their Christmas dinner which was far worse than their regular meals. They also don't treat vacation club members with the same deference as regular hotel or royal service guests because you have to work at the desk with the vacation club employees. They probably feel that since that you're a captive audience, they don't have to go out of their way for you or worry about you not coming back.If you're planning on going to this property, you'll have a wonderful time. Go as a regular guest and make sure you stay away from the timeshare salespeople. If they tell you it will only take an hour, beware -- you'll never be able to get away in under three hours.
