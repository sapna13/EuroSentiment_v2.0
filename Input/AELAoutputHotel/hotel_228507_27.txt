{"text":"Better Places to stay Stayed at the Barcelo Sants for 2 nights and after the first night I seriously considered checking out! An indicator of things to come is when you go in search of the train at the Airport to be told that due to building work its not running but there is a free bus. Approaching the train station\/hotel you quickly realise how extensive the building work is! Trying to walk anywhere from the hotel involves an obstacle course and the need for a face mask to avoid the dust! Twice I tried to walk and twice I gave up and walked back to the train station to get the metro.While I stayed there the was a constant noise and vibration from industrial concrete breakers that goes on well into the evening (past 9pm!) and starts again early morning. I felt very sorry for the airline staff that are constantly checking in during the day, obviously looking forward to being able to stay away from the airport and see a bit of the city only to be faced with a building site and little chance of sleep during the day!Add to this the dust the work creates coming into the hotel, very hard beds, tired looking rooms and paper thin walls  doors and noisy toilets I would not recomend this hotel at the moment. Oh and watch out for the scolding hot water coming out of the shower, trying to get warm water takes time and skill, I ended up running a bath for safety sake! I hope the development of a fast Airport rail link might prompt the hotel to re-vamp the rooms until then I would avoid! ","annotations":[]}
