{"text":"Just Awful First of all, I'd like to say that this was not my first stay at this property. My friends and I were return guests because we'd been so impressed with the property during our first stay. When it opened in 2003 we had been among some of its first guests. We had a great time then and very much looked forward to returning.What a difference 4 years makes. As has been mentioned by a number of reviewers here, a soap opera was being filmed during our entire stay. If I'd been alerted to the fact that the property would pretty much be monopolized by the cast and crew, I'd have chosen another property. There were times when the lobby, the restaurants, the beach, or the pool were not available to us.We also found that the restaurants and larger bar in the hotel closed at 5pm! That was definitely not the case during our first visit. There was no experienced, capable concierge available during our stay. Another disappointing change from our first visit where the concierge was knowlegeable and helpful. Apparently, all their contracts with such vendors as major car rental companies, and tour operators have been severed. We had to rent a car and drive to excursions and sites ourselves. The staff at the pool charged with dispensing towels, cleaning lounge chairs etc., needed more than retraining. They needed to be fired. They were downright rude. When we requested towels the young man on duty said in spanish to his two female co-workers Toallas grandes para las gordas. Translation: Big towels for the fat girls Unfortunately for him, 3 of the 4 of us are spanish-speaking.Add to all that the furnishings are shabby at best, the beach was absolutely filthy and they've added a playground area around the pool for children that was also filthy and needless to say that as a seasoned travel and a travel agent, I'd never recommend this property to anyone.
