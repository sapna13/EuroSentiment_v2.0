{"text":"Stop reading all these reviews... If you are reading endless reviews of this resort...my advice is to stop right after reading this one. I worried myself sick reading all of these before our honeymoon...so much that I was holding my breath that our honeymoon would go well. Imagine being nervous and all worked up about going on vacation...it makes no sense at all! TripAdvisor is great...but reading all of these reviews will make you nervous as heck going into a vacation where you don't need to worry at all.1.) If you are from the US - don't act like you have attitude and derserve more than others. Use some Spanish words and say thank you and please in Spanish. Don't go up to the bar and mumble, Beer. Americans make up about 10% of the resort...Europeans make up about 70% of the resort.2.) Drinks - their local beer is Presidente and is the equivalent to Budweiser or Coors Light - it is good beer. I drank about 20 of them a day (they're smaller than US ones). Order them 2 at a time. Their rum is good, too. Mixed drinks will be watered down...so if you wanna get tanked...ask for just rum  coke or hit the hard liquors without all the fruit mixers. They have bottled water at all the bars  restaurants - it is fine! La Pina bar is the best...Carlos  Moises are the nicest dudes there. I often tipped the good service we had at all places.3.) Food - be smart and you'll be fine. Order the local Mahi  Dorado fish (because you're supposed to eat fish in the Caribbean) and have them grill it - tastes awesome! The fruit was all safe for us, as well. Don't go and eat at the pay restaurants...only advantage you get is the air conditioning. The other sitdown restaurants are all decent. If you are used to eating in 5-star NYC restaurants and expect that from this resort...then you should go somewhere else.4.) Rooms - we had an oceanfront room in Block 6 and it was really solid! Left a $1 in the mini bar each day and a $1 for housekeeping - with both we well taken care of. Couple of bugs here and there...but it's all part of the experience. We had some bug bites (didn't really feel them until we saw them) - bring some spray. We had a few problems with our room key\/lock one night - but they fixed it right there.5.) Beach  Pools - both are real nice...especially the beaches. Best sand ever! Quiet around beach area and plenty of chairs in both sun  shade. Warm ocean water! Lots of topless European women and European dudes wearing meat hanger bathing suits...so don't be surprised at that.6.) Check In\/Check Out - both were super easy! If you arrive before 3:00 or so...you may have to wait to get your room...but that happens in US hotels, too.7.) Other Bavaro Resorts - go check them out if you have time. Casino pool crowds was pretty slow so we went there a couple days. Actual Casino was ok - $5 BJ tables and not too crowded.8.) Spend the $20 for the week to get the English channels on the tv - there is always some downtime in the room and having those channels helps. I even got to watch the Yankee game 2 nights in a row...plus you get a bunch of free movie channels. Beach massage = $25 - it was decent. There are shops at the end of the resort - bargain like crazy with them - pretend you are in Chinatown - cigars  booze, t-shirts, jewelry, etc. You can usually get them down about 100% from their asking price. They will HOUND you, though, as soon as you get near them.Again - read enough of these reviews and eventually it'll make you sick! Go on your vacation knowing how to have a good time with your wife, friends, or family and you will be fine.
