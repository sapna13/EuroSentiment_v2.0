{"text":"Not impressed... Grand Palladium Palace Just got back from a 7 nights package at Grand Palladium Palace Punta Cana on Aug. 29, 2008. We choose this resort, because in 2007 we stayed at G P Kantenah in Mexico and liked very much the resort and services.I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to give a bad review to G P in Dominican Republic, but my personal rating for this hotel is not more than 4 stars. Definitely not impressed and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ meet my expectations. The resort is huge with a bad layout and the only 24 hour restaurant with snacks is located in a very far corner (sports bar) accessible only by the mini train running between the 4 hotels. If you need a snack while on the beach√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2022orget it! What about families with children, when a kid wants something√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬£OW√à√\u2020\u2022?Bar service is very slow and I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see a happy face when you ask for a drink. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ almost kind like you feel ignored, while the staff is doing unessential things instead to serve tourists. Tipping doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ help much. Everybody was complaining about this.Rooms are ok and maids are working hard to do the cleaning and changing towels. No problems with AC. Instead we had 4 black outs with no electricity, the longest lasted 30 minutes.Restaurants. Breakfast, modest selection. Bacon was present only every other day, an omelet takes forever to get. They are not used to serve more than one or two person at the time. There are things you are used to see every morning for breakfast that are missing.Lunch is served at the restaurant on the beach from 12 to 4 P.M.Again, just ok. If they run of something don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect them to refill it. (I.e. some chesses). Better luck tomorrow!I had trouble one day to find vinegar for a salad and the chef helped me by scooping some from a sauce. (Nice!!!)Beach is nice and you can find a spot under a pallapa if you like. Reserving your chair early is recommended.The pool is not very large and in the afternoon is almost impossible to get a chair. Some tourists dragged chairs from the beach and put them on the side, right on the grass. Evening entertainment in the lobby is performed by a local artist or a band with no talent at all. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see people dancing on their music.The shows start at 10 P.M. and we find them very far from our hotel.Overall, I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ recommend this resort to any of my friends. We are not picky travelers and we know exactly where we going that is not like home and we have great understanding and appreciation for this people, but we expect something for the money we paid. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to feel like I have to wait minutes to be served at the bar when is nobody around but me, ask for a coffee and there is no cup on the table to pour it, or sit with a plate in front of me that I finished eating five minutes ago while the servers are dancing!My complaint is mostly for the poor service.This has been our third time in Dominican Republic but I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l return.
