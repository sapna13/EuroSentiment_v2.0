{"text":"Basic, no frills but satisfactory Spent several nights here based on the largely positive reviews. Pros: quiet but central location just a short walk from the train station and tram stops, comfortable beds with warm soft comforters, above average continental breakfast (with a pleasant array of cheese and cold cuts in addition to the usual toast and juice), very helpful front desk who are eager to offer tips about Amsterdam and eagerly look up info for you on the Internet. Well heated rooms. No street noise at all in back rooms (and I bet the canal side is fairly quiet too as there is hardly any traffic). There is a small elevator. Cons: room (a double) is indeed quite small, and no view in off street rooms (although it is quiet accordingly). our bathroom was so-so in terms of cleanliness (the shower is one end of the bathroom and is not separated by a tub or partition, so water can get all over the floor; there was a musty odor to the shower and curtain). decor is charmless. Smoke (both kinds) and chatter from other rooms often drifted into our room, which happened late at night given a high number of young late night revelers the week we were there (or maybe every week in Amsterdam). Somewhat pricey for what the facilities were, but I guess most central Amsterdam hotels tend to be pricey. Overall an adequate experience, but somewhat disappointing for the money. The helpful staff help make up for the underwhelming facilities.
