{"text":"Great resort My wile and at stayed at the Grand Palledium Bavaro from March 22nd to March 29th 2007, and I have to say it was an exceptional experience. This was our first time to this resort in Punta Cana, we've been to others rated 5 stars and they did not compare the quality of the Grand Palladium. The flight with Air Transat there was a bit cramped, however the service on the plane was great and very friendly flight attendants . If you are looking for a resort with great food and beaches this is the place to stay, one word of advise, if you are looking for a hut on the beach I suggest you get up early between 5:00 and 6:00am to reserve one with your towels on the lounge chairs, don't use the beach towels supplied by the resort, bring one from home because if you lose your towel it's not a big loss, if you lose the ones provided by the resort, there is replacement value of 20.00 US per towel. getting back to the food, the buffet at the Cathedral restaurant is awesom, if your a picky eater, don't matter, there is definitly a choice for all taste, I enjoyed the buffet better then the A La Carte. The service at the hotel from the porters to the waitress and waiters, to the ground keepers, front desk etc... are the best my wife and I experienced. I highly recommend this resort and we will definitly go back, one more thing, go on the excursion with the bavaro runners and ask to be with Eddy the tour guide, he knows the culture and keeps things interesting and Fun.
