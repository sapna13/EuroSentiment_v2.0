{"text":"Greatest beach but... Okay, so I read all the reviews I could find before I actually left. I was nervous about everything. I was at the Grand Paradise from december 24th to january 7th.First, the actual check-in was a breeze, a nice cocktail was awaiting us. The process actually took less than 10 minutes.The room. I had writen an e-mail requesting building 6 or 3, the ones facing the pools, and I got exactly what I had asked for. I was in room 6210, second floor, huge balcony overlooking the pools and I even had an ocean view. The room is quite big, tv, fridge, chairs, 2 double beds, a dresser, a good size bathroom with bath and shower. The toilet\/bath is separated from the vanity area (sink and mirror). The room was ALWAYS cleaned and we never had problems getting towels. You do have a problem with the water pressure during peak hours (5pm-8pm). The fridge got restocked everyday with what we liked (do talk to your maid and tip her and she'll give you the moon). The floor was washed often and not once did I see a bug of any sort in my room. So be reassured about that part.The pools are beautiful. Plenty of chairs but they do get taken very fast. The pool bar is often crowded and you'll get pushed over sometimes. Don't bother tipping unless you visit the bar very often... The jacuzzi is quite icky... don't go in there, the water is always murky...The BEACH, what can I say, it's the best thing going for this resort. The sand is like powder, the ocean is gorgeous not or almost no debris ( compared to the beach in front of the Bahia Principe, disgusting!!!). You do have to get up very early if you want to get a palapa. But for me, a chair in the sun did just fine. No problem getting that! Be very careful, they give you a card that you exchange for a beach towel. If you loose the card or the actual towel, it will cost you 20$! Has I did, I suggest that you bring your own old towel that you don't mind loosing...The animation is ok but I got bored of hearing awa-yim (aquagym) and dee-yay (d-j) very soon!!!! The nightime shows are a bore, a mix of karaoke and lipsync...The staff is ok , they are very accommodating. Beware you single ladies of the locals who are VERY touchy-feely...Now for the bad!!!! THE FOOD IS REALLY BAD. I'm not a fussy eater. I like to eat good, wholesome food. A simple grilled chicken, a little veggie on the side and some fruits. I had trouble finding that!!!! The buffet is always stocked with fish or pork in SAUCE! The veggies are either too cooked or in a SAUCE. The food is not good at all. Even the a la cartes are disappointing. The only good one is the Manglar and it's Chateaubriand. If you like fried foods, pizza, fish and pork , you'll be in heaven! There's always fresh fruit available and the breads are really good (not if you're on Atkins though!!!) If you do go there, bring your own snacks 'cause a bag of chips will cost you 5 $ US in the gift shop!!!Be careful of the agents who tell you they'll arrange for you to go somewhere to buy stuff. They will charge you more than if you bought your souvenirs at the airport!!!! The vendors come in every friday night and you can make excellent deals but be firm and stand your ground. Be aware that some of the vendors will try to sell you fake larimar and amber. If they're legit, they'll scratch a mirror with the actual stone or light a lighter to it to prove to you that it's real (plastic melts and does'nt scratch...).So, overall, if you are lookin for a clean hotel, a superb beach and you like fish, pork, sauces and fried foods, you will be pleased. 2 weeks for me was WAY too LONG!!!!
