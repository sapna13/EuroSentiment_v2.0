{"text":"Brilliant Base for Barcelona!! I booked this hotel for myself and my sister for a 3 night break. We took the bus to Catalunya from the airport which took 20 minutes. The hotel was a mere 5 minute walk from the bus drop off. We checked in straight away at 10am, our room was a great size, very clean and quiet. (we stayed on the 3rd floor).We thought the hotel was brilliant, you could not fault the location or the helpfullness of the staff. The pool was a great bonus to have and even though at tad small, it was great to have a dip and cool off which is all you needed. The only let down was the price of the drinks. Very expensive - 3.30 euros for a fanta by the pool. There is however a spar (turn right out of the hotel) a 2 minute walk away so I would advise stocking up there and keeping drinks in your fridge in the room. The hotel was fantastic base for getting around Barcelona, you were in short walking distances to the Barri Gottic, El Triangle, La Rambla and more. If you stay on the hotel road and walk all the way down you get to the harbour which is about a 15 minute walk away. Altogether, we thought it was fantasic and when speaking to other guests in the hotel they thought it was great too. I would not take much notice of the negative comments made by people on some of the previous reviews on this hotel!!
