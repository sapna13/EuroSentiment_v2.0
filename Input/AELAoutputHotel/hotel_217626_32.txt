{"text":"Often A Great Choice I have now stayed at The Benjamin a number of times on business trips to New York - close to my firm's NY office, it has become the default choice, assuming availability. It can be quite expensive, as can most places in New York from time to time, but I highly recommend it with one very important condition: if you can book one of the two room suites (most of the accommodations are of this sort), it is terrific. If you can book only a regular room, you might look elsewhere.For the price, the two room suites are excellent. There is a living room, with pull out couch, chairs, desk, TV, and kitchenette with microwave, coffee maker, and refrigerator. The bedroom is a bit smaller, but with a very comfortable bed, a closet, and a small but adequate bath. One can spread out a bit, set up work in the sitting room, use the kitchenette for coffee, etc., and obviously reserve the bedroom for sleep. The single rooms are deficient largely because all in the same room the fridge and icemaker make noise, light comes in from the door, and the rooms are a bit cramped. (On my most recent visit, notwithstanding my loyalty to the establishment, I was summarily downgraded to a regular room, and was not nearly as comfortable as usual.) A few of the rooms have small balconies and great views; others are tucked inside and, while lacking in view, are super quiet. Depends on your preference.The rooms are well-lit, with a reasonably well-functioning, though a bit noisy HVAC system. The Benjamin's specialty is its sleep concierge service, with multiple pillow choices, etc. There is a fitness center -- small, and can be crowded during the morning rush, but I've never been shut out of a workout. It has two ellipticals, two recumbants, and two treadmills, and a small assortment of weights and weight machines. The hotel offers spa services. I have never eaten in the restaurant, but the bar is pleasant and uncrowded. The staff is always polite and professional, and if you show up more than a couple of times, will begin to recognize you. High speed internet (wired) is reliable, and as another nice touch, each room as its own printer and fax machine, most USB capable.The Benjamin is not the height of New York luxury, for sure, but it is a great and reliable alternative to the behemoths around it in mid-town east. It's a short walk to Park, to the many restaurant choices in the 50s around 2nd and 3rd, and of course to most east side subway lines. If you can book a suite, and the price point for that is similar to a regular room at the Waldorf or similar establishment, grab it; you will be pleased and comfortable.
