{"text":"Overpriced, overrated All the travel advice you ever read warns you not to turn up in Florence without booking a hotel in advance. I should have listened. I've been there many times and remembered walking by Albergo Firenze and thinking that it looked like a rather nice little place, so when I changed my plans at the last minute I decided to turn up unannounced and see if they could fit me in.The problem is that it promises much but doesn't deliver. The lobby is lovely and the staff are friendly and helpful. They had one room left - a large triple, which they readily agreed to give me, a solo traveller, at what they called a reduced rate. Which seemed reasonable until I got upstairs. For 103 Euros I got a depressing room with broken youth hostel furniture, dirt around the edge of the bath, ludicrously soft foam mattresses and threadbare linens. There's little or no soundproofing so you hear everything from the hall, even late night arrivals who are clearly trying to tiptoe in.Florence is an outrageously expensive city and for your money you'll probably get less here than anywhere else in Italy. But even in overpriced Venice the same amount at Ca dei Dogi got me a gorgeous room. I don't mind simple budget hotels with plastic furniture and no frills, and I've stayed in many around Europe. But they tend to charge 60-70 Euros a night tops, even in the most expensive cities like Paris or Barcelona. This place certainly shouldn't be charging more than that.
