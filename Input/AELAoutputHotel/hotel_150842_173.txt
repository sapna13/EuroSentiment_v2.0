{"text":"Wonderful and Relaxing!!! My husband and I just returned from a beautiful week at the Iberostar Dominicana! We have stayed at other resorts but the overall experience and the sheer beauty of the place cannot be outdone. The food was delicious, the room was very comfortable and the service was friendly and fantastic. The rest of this will not be your typical review however, as we went to the DR for a purpose.For us, the main reason we went to the DR and chose Iberostar was to RELAX with class. We are from the Washington, DC area, and in our late 40√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂. We both work hard and needed a break from jobs, kids, traffic, bills, etc. We found it here. From the moment we arrived, we felt relaxed.We spent a lot of our time on the beach. I know some people like the pool, but we went for the beach. The beach is without a doubt the best in the Caribbean. The sand is so soft, and the water a beautiful blue-green. We found a palapa near the beach bar at the IB Bavaro (next door) and enjoyed the beach scene. We enjoyed frozen cocktails and specialty drinks, listened to the waves or the music from the bar, and had fun with the bartenders and the other guests. Speaking of the guests, the Americans were in the minority and we loved it! There were no loud, drunken men, and nobody from √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬£ew York√à√\u2020\u2022?complaining constantly about EVERYTHING.By Day 2, I decided to really cut loose and relax. While my husband went to the bar to get us drinks, I did what many women did and dropped my bikini top! Upon returning to our palapa, my husband was surprised at my spontaneity, but loved it. And I have to say to all the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√©merican√à√\u2020\u2022?women who haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ gone topless; just do it!!! It felt great and talk about relaxing, WOW!For much of the remainder of our vacation, I stayed topless while sunning, swimming in the sea, or walking the beach. This was my way of saying, I am in another country on my vacation, and I intend on staying loose and relaxed. I did not feel out of place and thoroughly enjoyed it. We returned to DC relaxed and ready to resume our duties. My husband and I cannot wait until we go again in the Fall.The Iberostar Dominicana was exactly what we needed. ","annotations":[]}
