{"text":"Has everything Just returned with my wife from a lovely 3 day stay at the Hotel Jazz over our wedding anniversary. This was my seventh visit to the city and the best hotel so far. Location is excellent just a minutes walk from an airport bus stop which was handy as we didn't land until late. There's a metro station and numerous bus stops all within 300m of the front door and a walk of no more than 5 minutes gets you to Placa de Catalunya and Las Ramblas. Our room was excellent with a massive bed. Ours was on the fifth floor over reception, so not facing the main roads and was quiet with the balcony door shut. As mentioned on other reviews you can hear\/feel the metro trains going under the hotel but only just. The air conditioning was very effective and quiet and was too good and had to be turned off on our first night as we were too cold!! For the days we were there it was very hot and the pool ,although small, was a welcome relief following a day of taking in the sights. The hotel had two PC's that offerred internet access and we were able to get free wi-fi in our room on our PDA. Breakfast was expensive but was very extensive with choices and if you are capable of eating lots of food in the morning you could have got your money's worth. Our room had a minibar fridge which we stocked up with drinks from the little shop round the corner which was much cheaper than the hotel prices. We had room service one afternoon by the pool which was relatively cheap and tasted nice. All in all a great short break and if we go back to Barcelona we would stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
