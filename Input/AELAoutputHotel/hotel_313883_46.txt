{"text":"Last Resort! We have been very fortunate to have travelled to many countries and stayed in a variety of hotels and this is certainly far from our best experience.The main objective of this trip was to relax in tropical surroundings, sip nice cocktails, chill and do nothing!The Positives- The Beach is abolutely beautiful, far nicer than what I experience in the North of the Country.- The ocean was fantastic, bath warm and no rocks \/ stones. Only slight drawback was that it got a little choppy near the shoreThe Negatives- The service. I made an official complaint regarding the service which we received. The standard of english spoken at this resort is very poor, however a smile is a universal language! Not here! I was made to feel on several occasions when asking for something (especially a drink at one of the bars) that they were doing me a huge favour! The hotel is definately aimed at non-English speaking travellers.- The Pool. The two pools at the resort are quite large. They did attempt to clean the pools everyday, but its more than a one man job and takes longer than 30 minutes. The pools weren't disgusting, but there was a lot of debris from the surrounding trees.- The Food  Drink. This is not our first AI holiday, but it was th first that we wanted to skip meals throughout the day. The selection is fairly limited (especially if you want to avoid the riskier items like uncooked meats and shellfish). The pasta station was safe, but after two days was getting tiresome.- The rooms. The rooms are reasonably clean and the beds are OK, but the decor is tired and the cleaners could be better (I reaslise that they earn next to nothing, but how hard is it to wipe dead flies off walls and windows).Overall, the location is very good and neighbouring hotels looked nice. If you've booked here, try and get moved!
