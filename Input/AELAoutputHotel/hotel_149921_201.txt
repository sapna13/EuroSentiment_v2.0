{"text":"No thank you, Caribe Hilton I was very disappointed. I did a lot of research on properties in San Juan so that my family and I would have a great vacation. (husband, myself, and two kids 2  7). Despite the reviews I had read for months (thinking the people were overcritical) I booked it anyway. I had a rate of 230 per night but felt that with all the promises it was worth it. The lobby is beautiful and the Starbucks is good...the private beach was fine...We arrived on the last flight into San Juan and arrived to the hotel about 11pm...we were not taken to the room until about midnight. It was an ordeal getting checked in and I was a HIlton Honors member. I had requested an upper level floor...I was given the Garden Terrace (if you get this...change it immediately). We had to take an elevator down to our room. People joked and asked if we were sleeping in the basement. The Garden Terrace is a decent hotel room with a dirty patio...with dirty cheap patio furniture...overlooking the facilities area with the exception of the plants\/foliage that is place in front of the patio. There are walkways on the other side of your hedge. I did not feel it was worth staying at the hotel in that room for 230 a night (along with the 5 dollar per person...including children...surcharge per day...that's an extra hundred dollars on the bill). I spent two hours on the internet (wifi was an extra 15 dollars a day) looking for something else...not an easy feat during spring break...but we found something great and I am pleased that I was given the room otherwise I probably wouldn't have been motivated to move. If you want more choices for restaurants and shops...Isla Verde is better located. ","annotations":[]}
