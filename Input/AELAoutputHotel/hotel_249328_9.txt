{"text":"Great location Stayed here for 3 nights. There were 3 lads in total and we stayed in the triple room here. We arrived to find a very basic style room with old furniture and wallpaper. After a couple hours of settling in we actually grew to like this room. There were 3 large windows that opened up and overlooked the main Damrak street. This was a great view and had a window ledge below all the windows which was useful for putting stuff on or sitting on whilst you stared out onto the street. We could not have asked for a better location. Central station was literally at the top of the road (5 minute walk). The famous Grasshoppers coffee shop and restaurant was literally across the road and the red light district was about 3 streets away. I would recommend that you try out a bar named √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??EASERS√à√\u2020\u2022? This is about 3 hotels down from the Manofa. We spent all night in there. Theres fit waitresses that serve you drinks all night and there sound girls. We spent all night chatting to them and eventually dancing with them. We are planning to come back here and most likely will request this room again as its ideal. The shower was always working and powerful. The bathroom was not dirty it was crystal clean and I do believe looked like a new toilet and basin. Personally I would recommend this hotel for groups of lads as the location is ideal. I would not recommend this hotel for people who are picky about where they stay. If you are picky we spotted a nice looking hotel named the Tulip Inn not too far from here. Looked rather posh.
