{"text":"A very satisfactory Parisian hotel We spent five nights at the Artus over Christmas this past month and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The hotel was clean and the service was responsive throughout. There is no question that the principal concierge Sanjay is a master of his profession and his attention to details and anxiety to be helpful was truly outstanding. The rest of the staff were also extremely helpful. The rooms, as with most Paris hotels, were small--we had a 'superior room' that had windows into an inner courtyard; very quiet, nicely appointed--and much more storage space than the allegedly 5-star hotel in which we had been staying in London prior to our arrival. No closet, true, but the armoire proved adequate along with some shelves. We found the heating to be fine--responsive and quiet.A major plus for the Artus, is that just outside is the virtual center of the Left Bank--rue Buci and its extensions are great places to just 'be' for a while; good cafes, a number of satisfactory restaurants in the vicinity--we enjoyed the branch of Leons of Bruxelles--amazing mussels--just at the opposite corner of Buici and Blvd Saint-Germaine-des-Pres. Walking distance to Notre Dame, Ste Chappelle, the Cluny Museum--tho' we try never to walk to a Museum, the Louvre (ditto) and if you are really fit, the Musee Orsay. Two Metro stations are close at hand and some very convenient bus routes.Our rate was not cheap--I think it was 243 Euros--it included a very fine breakfast that included eggs and bacon\/sausage, plus pastries, breads, cheeses, fruit, toast and some fine coffee. The only glitch was that one morning when the regular breakfast room server was off, a request for decaf coffee produced hot water and some powder. The rest appeared to be brewed and hearty decaf coffee. One drawback was that the wireless internet access in the room was on a pay basis. A free PC in the lobby offered no-cost internet access. I would strongly recommend this hotel for its staff, its facilities, its overall hospitality and its location.
