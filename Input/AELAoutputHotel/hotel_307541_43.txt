{"text":"heaven at the Bali Hyatt We stayed at the Bali Hyatt for 5 nights as part of our honeymoon in Asia and we had a fantastic time. I was a little concerned after reading negetive reviews about the hotel but after staying there I realy cannot understand why people can write anything negetive about this wonderful hotel!We arrived after a short flight from Singapore and the welcome we received was unlike any welcome I have ever received at any hotel before. the staff sat us down and made us feel at home with a lovely cocktail and a flower garland. We arrived quite early and our room was not ready as we had booked a sea view but we were happy to sit by the pool until our room was ready which was 4pm. The room itself was a good size with a lovely view of the gardens and sea and although a little musty this was understandable because of the humidity.The pool area at the hotel was beautiful and the staff were fantastic. I can't understand why people complain about the pices at the hotel. we ate luch 4 times, dinner twice and had drinks by the pool every day (happy hour at the pool bar!) and our bill was only √ä√£¬¢120 for the two of us at the end of the holiday which we thought was fantastic in comparison to European prices. Fair enough it was more expensive that the resort restaurants but was worth it for the convenience.Restaurants in resort were fantastic and so cheap! We booked a driver for 2 days (Dean) who was fabulous and we got the chance to see the 'Real' Bali by doing this which was worth every penny.We can't praise this hotel enough and we can't wait to go back. we did venture out to Kuta but felt it was little built up but was great for a night out and shopping. Sanur was perfect for us though. ","annotations":[]}
