{"text":"simply the best A travel agent friend recommended this place. I had booked a cheap flight to Bali for a week and really hadn't considered staying in Ubud.....am so glad I was persuaded otherwise, as although I'd never stay in Kuta\/Legian\/Seminyak again, I would willingly come back to the Maya.I had a pool villa, although the resort was so quiet when I was there that I could have even stayed in the main building and had the pools to myself. I have never felt so spoilt in all my life - room with television and dvd\/cd player, big bathtub, my own pool, and the only sound I could hear was the river running below. I found it hard to want to motivate myself to go into town (but guilt motivated me to at least try once - the hotel had a free service).I ate a couple of times at the riverside cafe, down by the spa - the food was fresh, healthy (I still remember the gazpacho with prawns very fondly!) - oh, and the menu was very inexpensive here (surprisingly so, given the cost of the hotel and nearby spa treatments). The main bar also had great service and I can highly recommend their local cocktails (I can't remember all the ingredients, but I had one with ginger, lemongrass and vodka that I can only describe as perfect).I did go into the spa for a massage - it's more expensive than in town, but the location was wonderful, and once I saw the view from the bathtub I was tempted to include a bath treatment too. I chatted with some of the staff - there are still things that they wanted to improve (one of the main ones was something to reduce the insects in the rooms........the only thing I can suggest might have been missing was a mossie net over the four poster bed, but then again, I liked sleeping with the door open too so am in part to blame for the number of visitors I received! Otherwise, rooms were sprayed regularly to reduce bugs).If, like me, you need the odd holiday where you need to slow down, this is the perfect spot. Oh, and the free internet in the library meant that I could easily send an email home to everyone to make them jealous too!
