{"text":"Fantastic holiday at natura park We stayed at natura park resort for a week and it was really fantastic. I really do not understand the people who write bad reviews about this resort.The resort is very beautifull and everything is clean. The people are very friendly and always happy.The beach was super. There were more then enought chairs and most of the time we managed to find a place with a little bit of shadow. The ocean was great, there was a reef right in front of the resort where you could snorkel and see a large variety of fish. We went snorkeling every day and we enjoyed it every time. The resort has a beautifull garden with some wildlife. There were tropical birds everywhere. A lot of ponts with bridges and trees and tropical flowers, even flamingos.They offered a very wide variety of food. In the morning there were 10 different kinds of fruitjuices, smoothies, milk, different sorts of tea, coffee...you name it...you could have it. There were different kinds of cheese, eggs prepared in every possible way, saucises, panncakes, croissants, maybe 20 types of bread, fresh fruit, cornflakes, muesli, bacon, different sorts of vegetables, tortillas.....everything you can imagine for breakfast....you could have it.In the evening it was the same.....there was an italian buffet every day, there was showcooking every day, a large dessert buffet, fresh fruits, fish, meat, vegetarian food, even a special wellness buffet. The food was prepared very well and we did not get sick of it one day.The room was very big, with two big beds, a big terrace with furniture, AC, a fan, even a dressing with plenty of space even to store your suitcases. The bathroom was with a seperate toilet, a bath with a very good shower with enough pressure and nice warm water. There ware tissues, a make up mirror.....and is was clean.There was a bit of moisture at the ceiling....caused by the AC but besides that the room was perfect.The first day we had a problem with the safe, the key did not fit....but we called front desk and half an hour later everything was solved and the rest of our vacation was without any troubles.The only point that I could say that was not perfect was the fact that when we arrived we received our key and we had to search for our room for ourselves. I would have preferred that someone had showed us the room. But for the rest everything was just perfect.You could drink all day at several bars, even cocktails. There were some bugs in the room the first night, but if you complain about that.....you should not go on vacation to a tropical place. I had a spray with me, problem solved.Anyway...I can only recommend this resort.I would go back any time.
