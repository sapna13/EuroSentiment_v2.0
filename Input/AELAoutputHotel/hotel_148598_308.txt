{"text":"expensive and not so safe. We just came back from a conference in PR. Many people stayed at the hotel, some at the Villas which are considered separate from the hotel. The Westin is pretty standard, what would you would expect. There were some general complaints from the attendees I thought I would relate. First, there is a daily $40.00 resort fee that is tacked on to the hotel rate, which most people thought was little high. They charged $10.00 for a Pina Colada. Compared to the rest of the island, this is very expensive. A glass of Orange juice cost $5.50. Interestingly, despite charging a resort fee, there are signs stating swim in the ocean at your own risk. There was a lifeguard stationed at the beach daily but clearly was just there for show. I know this because, I experienced a near-drowing incident while there. I'm a fairly strong swimmer but got caught in the waves; I yelled for help repeatedly but the lifeguard was too busy staring at the sand, and was not sitting in the designated lifeguard chair; elevated , he might have noticed my distress. Fortunately, I managed to get to the shore but my situation could have ended badly. I told the manager about the incident, but the days following, I noticed that the lifeguards showed little interest in watching the water. Comparatively the Ocean villas were much nicer and with the availability of te kitchen, I thought was a much better deal. The rates for these are as quoted and no hidden charges upon checking out. Unfortunately, this resort is very far from town and the airport ($60.00 to airport, $80.00 one way to town). We went to Old San Juan our last night, and realized it would have been nicer to be near Old San Juan with the multitude of restaurants, shops and cafes; very quaint. If you stay on the resort, you have little choice but to pay the exorbitant prices without a great deal of luxury which makes this hotel in my opinion overrated. ","annotations":[]}
