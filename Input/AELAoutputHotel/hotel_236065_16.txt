{"text":"Hotel Brian Booked this hostel after seeing the good reviews on here. It was very easy to find, in a good location close to the Dam Square but not actually in the red light district, so pretty quiet.I paid √à√\u2020√ü?45 for the room for 3 nights which I felt was good value. All we needed on arrival was √à√\u2020√ü?0 for a key deposit, we paid in full the next day.If you are used to self-catering and 1* accommodation, you will be happy with this place. It is very basic, but comfortable. I had booked a double room through hostelbookers but they only had a twin with bunk beds on the day. I was not happy about this, but the bottom bed was ok for 2 people for a few nights. The room also had a sink, chair, wall-mounted shelf\/table, open wardrobe and a safe which didn't work. It was small and functional, but clean and didn't smell. Smoking is allowed in rooms.The 2 friends we were with had not booked, but as we arrived fairly late at night the staff let them have the available quad room (2 singles and 2 bunks) for the same price. We ended up using this as a kind of living room through the day. My friends said their single beds were too short.I personally didn't feel that the staff were overly friendly, but they weren't unfriendly either and we had no problems with them. We did often heard them arguing with each other and with other guests, though.The building was nice and warm and the shared shower (there is one on each floor), though a little musty smelling, was clean and the water was hot and powerful. Towels and bedlinen are provided, but we had to ask for the towels.The walls are very thin and you can hear every word in the next room. The stairs are very steep and narrow, but there is a quad room on the ground floor which is easily accessible.The reception area has about 6 tables of four where you can sit and relax, though the chairs are the typical coffee-shop chairs, hard and uncomfortable. Smoking is allowed and there is a computer with free internet access and a TV. Breakfast is served here from 8-9.30am, I didn't have any, but it seemed to consist of mainly eggs and bread.There is a little kitchen where you can make tea and coffee and cook food if you want to.Round the back of the hotel are some prostitute's windows, but it is about a 5-10 minute walk to the proper red light district. Within a 5 minute walk from the hotel there are lots of coffee-shops, restaurants, Central Station and tram stops.I would recommend this place for travellers on a budget, backpackers, groups of friends and younger couples. I would not recommend it for people with children, people with mobility problems or people who like luxurious hotels that they can spend all day in.
