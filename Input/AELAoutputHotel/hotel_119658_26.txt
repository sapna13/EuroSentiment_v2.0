{"text":"Great location We spent 7 days at the Castle Inn at the beginning of this month. Booking the hotel was really easy and Varsa came back confirming the booking and rest of details. Getting to the hotel from the airport is very simple as it is close to Van Ness ( 101). In less than 30 minutes you are there. The location of the hotel is excellent for traveling around ( 49 miles scenic route, Napa, Marine County,..) and also for using public transportation as the cable car taking you to the center or to Fisherman's Wharf is at two blocks distance. There are also a couple of buses at Van Ness which takes you downtown.Although some people at this site complain about noise, the only noise that sometimes was disturbing was the neighbors' one. The walls seem to be really thin and anything happening next door is like if was happening inside the room. We were at one of the middle rooms of the third floor and from there we hardly listen any noise from the nearby avenue. Room was OK and better than what you can expect from the price you pay. It is modest but very clean and with no carpet smell ( something that sometimes you cannot avoid at US or UK hotels where there are carpets everywhere). We did not use the microwave or the fridge as we spent most of the time out either traveling in the area or just enjoying the city. I understand that these facilities may be better appreciated by families traveling with children.Last, I would like to highlight the great information provided by Varsa on arrival, letting us know about highlights, things we should not miss and other tips. The same in the mornings, making sure that everyone can get what they want for breakfast. She really cares and makes you feel like at home. By the way, the same cannot be say about the other person who was there when Varsa was off. I recommend the Castle Inn for group of friends, families and everyone who wants to explore the city and enjoy holidays. ","annotations":[]}
