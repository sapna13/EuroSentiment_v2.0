{"text":"Not a 4 star hotel by UK standards A contemporary hotel in a good location (Monumental metro literally a 100 yards away), Sagrada Familia 10 minutes walk away. We spent 3 days exploring this great city and didn't spend a great deal of time at the hotel. I have to say that it's not safe to assume that a 4-star hotel will have similar facilities to a typical 4-star hotel in the UK. There were a number of negatives about the hotel that didn't ruin our break, but certainly compelled me to inform others who thinking of booking a stay here.Negatives:* Lack of hotel facilities - an excuse for a bar in the reception area.* Single beds pushed together to make a double - apparently only 4 rooms in the hotel have double beds, make sure you double check if you are getting a double bed in advance* Beds are the firmest I've ever slept on - fine if you like them that way but very hard.* First time I've ever come across this in any hotel but twice around midnight, we came back to the hotel only to find a sign in the window stating 'back in 5 minutes' and the doors locked! We never felt unsafe in the area but a single female traveller might not take too kindly to having to hang around outside the hotel at that hour....* One single toiletry item - shower gel, typical theme in the hotel, a feeling of a lack of facilities.* The biggest issue for me was the fact that the hotel only offer an ironing service and do not provide an iron and iron board to the room. This took us by surprise and if we'd had all the clothes ironed we brought with us, it would have cost over 100 Euros. Perhaps this is a typical policy in Spanish hotels (I've had a similar thing in Athens) but it's a warning for those on a longer break that there is a risk of significant additional costs.* Staff were miserable and we felt like an inconvenience to them at times. A complaint about the twin beds was met with a shake of the shoulders and upon checking out, the receptionist didn't ask if we'd had a nice stay or even said thank you or goodbye - not a big issue, but evidence of a lack of good management and customer care.There is no way this is a 4 star hotel, yes the rooms are nicely furnished, but the sheer lack of facilities made it a three star at best with a BB feel.I would rarely stay at the same hotel twice as it is, but there is absolutely no way I would stay at this place again. I'm sure there are much better bases from which to explore this wonderful city from.
