{"text":"Historical hotel with old world flair, top notch staff. We booked with Fairmont website as they advertised the rate of $150.00 US per night, which for this grand old hotel was a very good rate over the Thanksgiving weekend.Even though the main entrance is located on the street level you need to take either the escalator or elevator up to the check in lobby\/desk. Check in was quick and accurate. My special request to have a small extra fridge and a inroom coffee maker was honoured without charge, a hotel perk. Check out was just as easy with no surprise charges or special fees on the bill.Parking is not within the hotel but across the street behind the hotel or you can have valet parking for 32.00 per night. **TIP** Street parking is free in the evening as we parked our car right in front of the hotel for 2 nights.The room offered plenty of space and light. You can open your window (1 foot) to get some fresh air. Fairmont hotels offer green choices including a recycle waste basket. The only downside to our stay was the beds which were old, soft and saggy and the old clunky television. The washrooms were well appointed with an excellent showerhead power. The towels were in good quality and soft as were the robes and slippers.The gym is an oasis with cozy change rooms and lockers. They offer a large jacuzzi but a small pool with a lane open for lap swimming. The pool was quiet at night with a glass roof and the low lights made for a relaxing swim. The gym has 2 areas one for weights and the other for aerobics equipment (bike, treadmills etc) The bikes and treadmills had individual tv's and 2 staff members available all times. The stars of this hotel should be noted, the top notch proffesional staff and EVERY single time we had a conversation with them (reservation, room service, front desk, housekeeping, gym and others) they smiled and said Would there be anything else we can do for you? The staff are well trained in guest services.The hotel is located in the hub of downtown Seattle in a safe area to walk around. Many nooks and crannies to explore in this architecture delight. If the rate is right we would return but would like to see them replace the beds and tv.
