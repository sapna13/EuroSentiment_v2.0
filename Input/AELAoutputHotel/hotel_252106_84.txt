{"text":"A lovely pleasant stay My husband and I stayed at this hotel from the 5th to 8th September 2007 for a mini break and we had a lovely time. It was our first visit to Berlin and we found the location of the hotel to be idealy located and very convenient to everything. We took a city bus tour and a boat tour which was recommended by the hotel which was very good and inexpensive lasting approx. 4 hours. Public transport is very good either by train or bus. We did not have our children with us but there is lots of activities for children. Berlin Zoo is just of the main street and also the aquarium. The hotel itself is very clean and very well managed with lots of helpful staff. Reading all the comments on the hotel I would not consider it luxurious and I don't think I would consider it 5 star. I had booked the room over the internet and we just got a basic room - when checking in we were asked if we would like to upgrade at a charge of √à√\u2020√ü?0 per night. (we didn't). Having said all this if I were to go back to Berlin I would probably stay there again. Restaurant 44 is a lovely restaurant but my husband was surprised that an award winning restaurant would have weeds growing on the balcony and the out door furniture was very unkept looking. Staff in the restaurant were very good and helpful. Overall a good stay. ","annotations":[]}
