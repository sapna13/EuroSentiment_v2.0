{"text":"Great experience, Great Room, Great Location - Loved it! It was our first trip to NYC, and we knew we wanted to be centrally located - so we started by literally pointing at mid-Midtown on a map and chose the Omni Berkshire Place pretty much on location alone, with the exception of a good experience once at the Omni in Chicago. The hotel  staff totally exceeded our expectations! The Deluxe room was clean, had a great layout, and was far more spacious than I was warned hotels in New York would be. This may sound a bit strange, but I was ecstatic with the bathroom as it was huge, had a high shower head (I'm tall), and had very bright lights  lots of counter space to spread out all of my personal care  beauty products for 5 days. Also, the room was virtually sound proof  the beds were extremely comfortable. The staff was always friendly, we could easily get a cab or town car at every hour of the day\/evening. Housekeeping did a great job, the concierge was a big help, and there was a cash machine in the lobby, which came in handier than I thought it would. You don't have a young, hip vibe here, but it's a nice, solid place that felt good to come back to after a long day of exploring.Staying here, you are virtually steps from St. Patrick's Cathedral  Fifth Avenue, blocks away from Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Broadway, and Central Park - they are all easy and pleasant to walk to. The subway is quite close as well. I might stay in a different section of Manhattan a time or two on future visits to broaden my experience, but I'm sure I'll be back at the Omni again and sincerely recommend it if you're looking for what we called Manhattan 101 during our trip. I never tried the restaurants at the hotel - there were plenty of dining options in close proximity that are good quality and reasonably priced. ","annotations":[]}
