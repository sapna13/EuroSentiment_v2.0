{"text":"Great Vacation !! I was there from dec. 18 to dec. 25 with my sister and we had a great time!!we traveled with sunwing and loved the service and the food. At the airport, everything went well and the bus took us to the hotel in less than 20 minutes. The room was ready and we didn't had to wait.The service at the reception, restaurants and bars was most of the time perfect !!!! A lot of smiles and the tips are appreciated but we didn't feel that we had to give any to have good service.I want to say thank you to Nicholas (adult pool) and to denny (window's buffet) for the excellent service !! The food at window is great (and i'm a peaky eater) .... i always manage to find something i liked, we always had a big variety of choices. The white wine is o.k. For the a la carte restaurant, we went to mare, very good and the fact that you can hear the ocean is great ! we also went to da mario (italian) good service but we didn't like the food but i spoke with others and they just loved it. so it depends on your tastes and what you take. we went to amerian grill tex mex and this was our favorite..... great mexican food .... we went twice... perfect nachos and fajitas !! Perfect service and great ambiance !!you don't need any reservation for the a la carte restaurants , only for the japanese one but we didn't go there.The beach is fantastic ..... white sand, a lot of palapas and available chairs. It was a bit windy while we were there but it was still good to be on the beach !! a little of seeweed but the workers was taking them out in the morning.we went to only 1 show and it was o.k. The maid service was great, we had the fresh towels in our room before 4 pm. the fridge was restock every day. we had a room in the block 6 (room 6304) and it was a standard room that was renovated .... we didn't really had hot water and the pressure was low ... but it was o.k. It was really clean, the bed and the pillow was firm enought. we had 2 double beds. We had a balcony very private. We never had any problems with the beach towels. We return them at 4h00 pm and took fresh ones in the morning at the beach. The resort is very weel kept .... you can always see the workers cleaning and fixing things. It's a small resort... everything is close and we liked it !!! The 24th, we had a special chistmas diner at the buffet... live music and the food was incredible ... better than usual ... even the wine was better ... a lot of see food !We only got out of the resort once and it was to go to Don Lucas ... they came and pick us up for free and to us to their store. You will see people working in the cigar factory and you will shop in the store (cigars, alcool, souvenirs, paintings ...) a lot of nice things .... we really enjoyed going there !!No problem and no waiting for check out.My vacation was perfect and i would definatly go back again !!
