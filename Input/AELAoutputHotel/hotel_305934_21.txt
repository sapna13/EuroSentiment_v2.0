{"text":"Great Bargain My mum and me stayed at the Stanford Hillview for 10 days in November 2007. Overall, this a great hotel for seeing the sites of Hong Kong. It was a short walk (5-10 min) to the subway station and just down the road to the shops. Whilst it is situated on a steap hill, there are numerous secret ways to get to and from the hotel once you get to know the area (you can almost walk the whole way through a shopping centre which is much nicer than negotiating the busy streets).The hotel itself was basic but more than adequate for our needs. The room was big enough for us and our luggage. There was also a small table where we ate our breakfast in the mornings. The beds were comfortable and came with these extremely large pillows. We had to remind the staff to vacuum our room about half way through our stay. I think this had more to do with the fact that they were not use to people staying that long than being unclean. There was also good english TV chanels for when you needed to put your feet up.This is a great hotel for a girls getaway or the like as it is cheap ($100AU a night for me and my mum) and close to pretty much everything (including both the cheap and expensive shops and places to eat). The hotel has a shuttle service which takes you up to the ladies market. We caught it twice and then got the train home when it was late. We also caught the airport bus from the bottom of the hill.Sure you can probably find a nicer hotel in Hong Kong but you will pay for it. This hotel had all we needed for a great holiday in Hong Kong. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1069,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":1065}]}
