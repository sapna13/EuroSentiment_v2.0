{"text":"Very good choice for Tokyo Stayed there for two separate periods in November 2008. First stay was a great twin room on the 6th floor, huge (for Japan, mind you) room and beds - both beds were nearly queen size, so we just shared one bed and used the other to jump around in. The next stay, we got a standard double on the 13th floor - tiny room, bigger bed. Slightly claustrophobic bathroom, but we managed. We booked the big room through our European hotels.com portal, and the tiny room through the japanese portal. Which might explain the difference. They cost about the same. Cheap for Tokyo. And well worth the money. The restaurant isn't great, but there really is no excuse for dining at the hotel in Shinjuku anyway. Even if you're jetlaged and can't be bothered - there's McDonald's, KFC and Wendy's down the road if you're a really desparate noodle-hater.The location is just fantastic. It's right around the corner from Shinjuku station, we took the Narita express straight to the stration and five minutes after exiting the train we were checking in. There's a subway station even closer, and Yoyogi station on the JR Yamanote line is just down the road - a better choice than crazy (but lovable) Shinjuku. Oh - And there's an AM\/PM across the road, and a Family Mart close to Yoyogi station, for any convenience-store-needs.We will definitely return - but next time, we'll settle for the big twin room, and avoid the double.
