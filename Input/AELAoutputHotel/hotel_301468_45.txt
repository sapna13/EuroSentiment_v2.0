{"text":"Just OK I stayed in the hotel for 2 days as a business traveller. My room was a Junior Seaview suite. My feelings with regard to this place is mixed. The location is alright but not really within walking distance to the cool shopping areas, and the coastal view is a bit gloomy. Its not really something for a holiday sort of stay. For business use, it was excellent location wise - very close to the financial district, yet still luxurious. Fairly quiet corner of the city.Optically, the building is pretty hideous (as is much of Singapore from this time period). Inside its obvious that it has been upgraded (a lot) inside - recently. The lobby, elevators and restaurants were definatly of 5 star grade. The front desk service and lobby staff, also. (classic asian style service, tons and tons of employees). The rooms themselves were not really to my liking. I mean, lets keep it real here - the room price of a suite - is under 500 euro - so compared to europe or attractive parts of the US, it's not exactly expensive. But... The bathrooms had dated style marble - which was not very nice, the ligthing was generally poor (which is never a good sign), the windows \/ sliding doors were of original vintage, which detracted from the luxury feel. The AC was sort of weird, if you put it on 20c, it was meatlocker cold, anything above 20c (incl. 20.5) equaled 35c++ and very high humidity. Weird. The carpet was nice, but never felt clean. The amenities were plentiful. The minibar and TV was very 1990's. Generally the room just didn't feel crisp in any way. Scrapes and stuff all over the place. The closets stank like they had been closed for 15 years. Also, the shower had nice long black hairs in it, not so nice. ;(Cleaning (besides from the hairs) was mediocre. So... I guess... Not horrible, not great. Personally, I wouldnt go there again.Oh, the Mortons steakhouse at the hotel was as good as the ones in the states. Very very nice.
