{"text":"ROYAL SERVICE or ELSE... At first, we noticed the amount of people checking in and after a few minutes we figured...standard room, NO WAY. We spend an additional $600 to UPGRADE to Royal Service and every penny was worth it. For starters, you get assigned a BUTLER. Yes people a BUTLER. You can either do it yourself of call him for anything and I mean ANYTHING. We had room service 2 or 3 times a day (included with Royal Service). We got all of our restaurants reservations confirmed up to 48 hours in advanced. We did not find any limits at this resort. SPANISH is this country's official language. Don't we get pissed off when people come to the US and refuse to try to speak our language?...well, now have some common sense and do not [-----] if people speak in their native tongue... we are not saying they do not speak English; but not fluently like you and me, SO GIVE THEM A BREAK and enjoy your vacation. Now, if you are a cheap skate (we saw lots) and want to do it the European way (not a single PENNY of out your pockets EVER!!!) you should stay at home OR face the music. Regardless of where you go, and especially at under developed countries... it is common knowledge that these people are exploited. So you know 80% of these resorts are owned by European chains√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ßo figure. We took $50 in $1 bills and after 5 days we had experienced the best service we've ever had for an additional $10 a day. To us, that is not a bad deal.We travel every other month. We have been in Europe, Asia, South  Central America as well as the Caribbean. GOOD SERVICE HAS ITS PRICE. Even though Europe is one of the continents where we noticed people are not accustomed to TIP like us in the US....Money encourages the worst staff in any part of this planet, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be cheap, a few dollars can make your vacation memorable. Carry a stack of singles and $5'sWe did have two episodes that where corrected by management. Everywhere we go, the first thing we do is introduce ourselves to the general manager or head HONCHO. It has always kept us ahead of the game. We did read several reviews from people that should be vacationing in Beverly Hills or Daventry in east London where SH.. does not stink. Adapt, adapt, adapt. We are extremely spoiled in the US and that is fine... this is why we remain here. But learning about other cultures and people's customs is what we love the most about traveling. Melia Caribe tropical gets 4 STARS. ROYAL service gets 6 STARS, INCLUDING THE TIP! EA. ","annotations":[]}
