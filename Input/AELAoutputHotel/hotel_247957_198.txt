{"text":"Will Go Back To Cozumel We checked out the reviews on this resort before we went but just thought some of the negative reviews were from people with extremely high expectations. Well, they were right. We arrived with our family (6 people) We had booked 3 rooms.(Never received them)  We are Platinum Plus First Club Members of the Occidental\/Allegro Resorts--- this supposedly gives you extra benefits. They gave us 2 rooms joined by a living area with a small pullout couch with a extremely worn 2 inch mattress. This is all fine if we had gotten a terrific deal on this booking, but we paid dearly!!!!!  The next day I went to the members desk to receive help with the room key card and the guy kept questioning me on who was in room 17303??? Finally I realized he wasn't saying 17203 and explained the rooms we had. I questioned him if we were suppose too have a third room which we had booked, but he insisted NO. Upon checking out my daughter could see the computer screen. There, on the screen, was our room numbers plus the third room, 17303, we never got. I'm so disgusted they would lie and not give us the 3rd room we obviously paid for. We checked out 17303(the third room) and it was not occupied.  Also, all six of us had cold showers one of the evenings. There was a huge 4-5 inch cockroach in the tub. Poor lighting in our room. I can stand all of this if they charged accordingly but they don't. Needless to say, we will go back to Cozumel next year.
