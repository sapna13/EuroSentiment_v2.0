{"text":"Great Resort My wife, 2 boys 10-8  parents went over x-mas. We booked in Aug with little research on the resort or the DR. I was somewhat worried after reading some reviews, however I have learned to avoid Tripadvisor since you just can't please everybody.We had a great time and would go back in a minute. The resort is huge, secluded and very nice with upgrades in process. Food was good, plenty of selection, plenty of bars with waitresses on the beach bring you drinks. The wait staff is very friendly and polite. Nobody got sick and they stock plenty of beverages in your mini fridge in the room.Beach was great, not rocky at all. Plenty of tikis and chairs, with a nice breeze. Really nice to walk around 2 miles to the north, the resort is secluded and not stacked with others. The pool is huge, plenty of floats, unbrellas and chairs. They also have a huge inflatable iceberg for kids to climb. There is also a nice req area with tennis courts, pool\/ping pong tables and b-ball hoops.The entertainment was fun, not Vegas but they work really hard, all of the employees bust their bee-hinds all day. Tipping is not needed, however bring some singles since they work really hard. They had a good x-mas show and even had Santa fly into the beach on a chopper and ride a horsedrawn carriage on the beach to give all the kids a gift.Kids Club looked nice and they seem to take very good care of the kids. We don't send our kids to it since the purpose is a family vacation, not daycare. One guy had a hell'ion of a kid who slipped and needed stiches and he was going to try to sue, sad, especially after seeing the way his kid acted he should have been deported.We've been to Beaches Negril  Turks and I'd take Dreams over them, plus it's several thousand cheaper. We both speak Spanish, however the employees speak good English  French to accomodate anyone.By the way, PC airport is very easy and nice, no problems at all. you do have to buy a $10 entry card, but no problem getting in or out.Once again, this was a great time and the resort is only getting better with Dreams taking over. Hope this helps since this resort should meet 90% of everyone's needs for a great vacation.
