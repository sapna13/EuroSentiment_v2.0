{"text":"On arrival, I had to break up a fight in self-park lot between about 15 hummingbirds. They were MAD and apparently √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√≥ouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get along√à√\u2020\u2022? The stay went up from there. The room was very comfortable. The porter showed me how to work the wood burning fireplace in the room. This confused me since Bel Air is in Los Angeles, and August is the middle of, like, summer. Later, I had to wait about 30 minutes for a seat at the bar √à√\u2020\u2022?the place was packed with (rich) locals. The food was terrific, but got cold as I spent too much time talking to the bartender who was fascinating and, much to my surprise, was NOT AN ASPIRING ACTOR!Seriously √à√\u2020\u2022?I have stayed at more 5 star hotels than I can count. And I rarely arrive at a property and say √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂?ow √à√\u2020\u2022?this is cool√à√\u2020\u2022? Well, I said to myself when I arrived here. The grounds of this hotel outdo the nicest botanical garden I have ever visited by a wide margin: comfortable, calm, thickly wooded, and just beautiful. This is just a stellar property and managed accordingly. If there is a nicer hotel in LA, I haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seen it. This one ranks near the top of my list worldwide of any hotel in any category. If you go, make sure to greet the pet swans near the front pond. I would note that this hotel is not terribly near the normal attractions you would want to see in Los Angeles, so a car is necessary.The only complaint I had with my stay was the morning paper was the *despicable* NY Times. I had expressly asked for a WSJ, but apparently they have trouble, in LA, getting the weekend version of the WSJ. This, for a hotel of this caliber, was a little hard to believe √à√\u2020\u2022?
