{"text":"Ohhh what a wonderful time Not sure why everyone has a problem with the Grand Paradise!!!! My husband and I just got back and oh what a wonderful time we had. The only problem we had was that the site for the Grand Paradise is very misleading....we thought that we would be in a room that was close to the beach but instead we were placed at The Club, which is approximately a 15 to 20 minute walk. But the benefit The Club has the swim up bars and two of the restaurants (one buffet and the other al a carte). The staff was very friendly and up beat. My husband and I would go out in the morning and sit by the pool and then go back to our room for a late afternoon nap and our room would be cleaned. We would then go out for supper and our room was cleaned again while we were out in the evening.The only other problem that we had was that you had to go really early in the morning to put your towels (7:30 a.m. Dominican time) on the loungers at the pools to get a good spot as every one would go early in the morning and get a spot and then go back to their rooms to go to sleep until the pools opened or what every they had planned for the day (tours, etc). You had to get up even earlier to get a spot on the beach (5:30 a.m.). Mind you we got a very rude french lady and her daughter who moved our towels because they wanted our spot. Was not happy about that....
