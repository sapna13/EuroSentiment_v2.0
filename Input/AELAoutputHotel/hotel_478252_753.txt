{"text":"Fabulous hotel This was our second visit to Punta Cana having previously stayed at the Melia Caribe a couple of years earlier. We were worried that compared to the Melia this hotel would disappoint but overall this is a lovely hotel that caters for all travellers.Although a large resort you can walk from reception to beach within 15 mins or jump on one of the regular trains that run every 10 mins or so. We chose to walk due to the large amount of food and alcohol we were consuming!There were lots of families with small children who appeared to be well catered for entertainment wise with discos and performers in the early evening. Equally for those parties who wanted to eat and drink until 6am in the morning the Carribean village area accomodated these needs also!We went on the trip to swim with sharks which was a big disppointment. As scuba divers we had higher expectations and assumed it would be an open water experience. In reality the sharks and sting rays are held within a small pen in the middle of the ocean which does little to resemble their natural habitat.We found booking into the restaurants very easy despite the fact that the hotel was very busy - every room full! Everyone we spoke to had different views on which were the best ones to eat at! We enjoyed the French and the Mexican (we ate at all but the seafood) but to be honest the food was similar at all of the restaurants.The hotel is very popular with Canadians, Italians and Spanish who really know how to party!! The British appeared to be in the minority or you didnt notice them above the noise of the Canadians! The beach front pools are very busy and noisy with entertainment and drinking competions etc. However if you want to avoid this you can move onto the beach which is much quieter and also cooler due to the breeze. Also the pools within the complex are very quiet and ideal for relaxing. The beach was beautiful but the sea was spoilt somewhat by the masses of seaweed. Never seen so much of the stuff! May have been brought in by recent storms.If you plan to do any scuba diving be warned that you probably wont want to dive at the hotel even if the conditions allow (they didnt when we were there). Instead you have to make a lengthy trip to Caterina island. We didnt bother as it seemed like too much hard work in the heat!In all this holiday was great value for money and everyone we saw appeared to have a fabulous experience. The resort is beautiful and the food and drink plentiful!
