{"text":"The Very Best Nine days over Thanksgiving week with my wife, son and daughter in law, 2 year old Grandson, and 12 year old niece. The two rooms with Royal Service were located right next to the Royal Service pool and beach, just perfect.We took advantage of everything that Paradisus Punta Cana has to offer, scuba, snorkeling trips, catamarans, horseback riding, the eco walk with monkeys and parrots for the baby (several times!).  When you combine Royal Service with this lush and beautiful resort, you have a vacation that you would have to work very hard at to be able to complain. The beach is magnificent with warm breakers to play with and miles to walk. The pools are dramatic with terrific bar service.  We dined at every restaurant and found the service first rate and the food good to excellent. The wine flows freely with excellent choices from Chile and Argentina that were pleasent surprises. Not all restaurants are open each night, so check the schedule so that you are not disappointed. Reserve at the Japaneese and Romantica, both exceptional. There is a little language barrier if you speak english only. This is an international hotel with guests from all over the world so the staff is not there just to please the english speaking Americans. They are dealing with several languages at a time. I noted one person getting frustrated trying to order a fancy martini in the chinese restaurant from the Spanish speaking waiter! Even in this case the staff eventually got it right and patience prevailed.On our last night my family surprised me with a 60th birthday at the Japaneese restaurant. They had baloons, candles  cake and made a big deal, even sending me little gifts from Royal Service to my room. Special thanks to Marianna, the Royal Service Manager.Just a note, we have cruised, owned our own Villa for several years, stayed at many very nice Hotels and this was the most enjoyable family vacation ever. We will be back!
