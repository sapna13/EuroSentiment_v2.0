{"text":"Good downtown Seattle hotel My family and I stayed there for three nights during a vacation stay to Seattle and Vancouver this month. At a price in the low-$200s, we thought it was good value. It's an easy walk of several blocks to the Pike Place Market and everything else downtown. (Beware, part of this walk is uphill going or coming back. Choose your poison if you're sort of out of shape.) Numerous top-shelf restuarants are nearby, including the incredible Wild Ginger, which is just a block and a half away. The rooms have a clean contemporary feel. Our rooms (we stayed there before and after going to Vancouver) were outfitted with high-def televisions, mini bars, and safes. The rooms start on the 14th floor and go up from there (the garage is below) and offered great views. The hotel's business center is open 24 hours daily, and Internet is available there for a nominal fee. The Top of the Hilton restaurant offers great views of the city. We tried the breakfast buffet one day, and it had decent, but limited standard fare (sausage, but no bacon! was my 6-year-old daughter's complaint) for the money. Some of my party ordered off the menu for breakfast and loved the food. The Top of the Hilton is also open for lunch and dinner and has a small bar, but we didn't go up there for anything but breakfast. The lobby bar and lounge is comfortable and is laid out in vignettes that feel like your living room. The staff is very, very chatty and friendly and the concierges are very knowledgeable about local restaurants and attractions. The manager personally greets people as they check in, and thanks them for their business. Very nice, genuine touch. Nice hotel, whether you're in town for business or pleasure.
