{"text":"Simply the best My husband and I had the pleasure of staying at the Chancellor for 4 nights at the beginning of December and loved it.This is the second time we have stayed here, and after a break of three years we didn't know if it would still be as good, and it was even better!!It is spotlessly clean, had the most comfortable bed out of everywhere we stayed whilst on our six week vacation, is in the best spot right at union square, and has the best and most efficient staff that we encountered.This, I am sure is because of the General Manager Mr Wes Tyler, who we had the pleasure of meeting while we were visiting. He cares about the hotel's reputation and it shows in every aspect of the running of the hotel.Breakfast in Luques restaurant was faultless every morning, and the staff were friendly and very efficient, especially Yesmie ( I hope this is how her name is spelt) she was probably the most efficient wait person I have ever encountered.Susan at the tour desk, who I believe has been there 35 years, knows everything there is to know about SF, so it worth picking her brain for information.All, in all, we had a wonderful time at the Chancellor and plan to go back in about eighteen months.Hotels can make or break your holiday, and this one certainly makes it. As my husband kept saying whilst we were there Why would you stay anywhere elseCongratulations Mr Tyler and staff on a job well done!! ","annotations":[]}
