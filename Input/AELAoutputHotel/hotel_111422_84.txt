{"text":"Definately would return For a truly nice hotel you cannnot beat their price. BUT ... it is a little off the beaten track ... if you cringe at the thought of walking along sidewalks on high traffic roads and taking public transit or dishing out for cabs, or paying $20 per day for the honor of a parking space, this is not your hotel. Shuttle service worked fantastic for going to Harvard square where we took the subway, but we never were able to take the shuttle directly downtown. It was always booked or full. Hotel was very clean, staff extremely friendly and informative -- as was all of Boston in our Chicago-esqe perspective. It is in a very safe area. We know because we took public transit or walked. Pool area was hot, but if you wear your suit and get in, the pool temp was just fine. Hot tub was very large and fantastic for relaxing with family and friends and soaking those tired tootsies from sightseeing. We didn't try the restaurant as it was too pricey for us, but there were fantastic places to eat in Harvard square (again, you need to take the shuttle or a cab). To my knowledge, there is no restaurant, or convenience store less that 6-8 blocks away. Hotel was also fine with having food delivered and provided a stack of take out menus for us to use! Drinks were about $8 each from the bar (they were always ample size and most refreshing), bottled softdrinks and water were $1.50 each. Your room has a fridge and there are liquor stores in Harvard square and also a Whole Foods grocer about 6 blocks away. Housekeeping was top-notch and friendly. We made special requests to housekeeping on two nights and all were accomodated with smiles within a 1\/2 hour.
