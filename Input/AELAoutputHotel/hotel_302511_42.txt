{"text":"I would stay here again There were a couple of negative reviews here recently but to me they seemed minor, so I decided to chance this hotel for a one day stopover and it is just fine.I booked on the hotel website and the price was lower than other similar quality hotels downtown. It is about the same distance from the airport as the city hotels, but it was nice to see a different part of Singapore. Check in was fast and efficient and the rooms are modern and comfortable.The desk in the room has a multiple country power point (great idea that more hotels should copy) and broadband internet costs about $25 SNG per day. I have to have a little rave about the bed...I spend about 100 nights a year 'on the road' and really notice when I score a great bed, and this bed made the grade...good firm mattress, cool, soft, duvet and a range of pillows thick and thin, soft and firm. Sleep heaven!There is a large entertainment strip up the road from the hotel with outdoor restaurants and bars, but I was too tired after my flight from the EU so I dined at the hotel and chose the BBQ buffet. Great selection, but watch the price - it is advertised as $32 SNG but that is without tax and service charges...two beers and the buffet ended up costing $78 SNG. Not great, but not bad for the huge selection of different dishes on offer, with everything from fresh seafood to asian specialty dishes and BBQ cuts.All up a nice, positive experience. And did I mention the bed? Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1420,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1416}]}
