{"text":"Best address in town! This is a hotel with perfect location and low prices when booked through some booking sites like hotels.com or booking.comThe Park Hotel has finished it's renovation and the result is quite stunning. Very modern lobby with big library (mainly art books), friendly people at the reception, rooms (I had a Superior double which is a standard room) are a bit on the small side but have all the space one needs. I was first given room 121, on the noisy street side (where the tram goes) but could easily change to one on the opposite side of the corridor, room 214, which are totally quiet, also no noise from neighbouring rooms. Very modern style, which I normally don't like but this was quite wonderful. The shower room and toilet are in what looks like a cupboard, but narrow. Taking a shower by the big rainfall shower floods the toilet floor and the entry hall floor and I had to put a towel over it. Big flat TV (32 inch) on a wall right in front of the bed (at least in room 214 , in 121 it is a bit next to the bed). Very romantic is the ambient light behind the bed, which has 7 colours to choose from, creating a very romantic atmosphere when being in bed together (but I was alone). Bed was the nicest I have ever slept in, quite soft. Nice toiletries of the Dutch brand Rituals. Minibar has reasonable prices, no space for own drinks but enough space to move the water bottles out and then put own drinks there. Small desk, 2 chairs. Double glazing, double curtains that quite block out daylightBreakfast (till 10.30 AM) is pricey (23, 50 Euro) but abundant, the most elaborate international breakfast in town as the hotel says. I doubt that, but it surely is impressive, Eggs any style made to order. There were only young people eating when I took breakfast on a Sunday, in the modern, stylish restaurant MOMO. I think this is THE hotel to stay in Amsterdam.To reach it easily, take tram 2 or 5 from Central Station, get off opposite Rijksmuseum (one stop after Leidseplein) and walk back a little. If you also need quietness and booked the cheapest rooms (Superior Double) then ask for a room with numbers 109 to 115 , 209 to 215, etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":158,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":148},{"endOffset":158,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":148},{"endOffset":1270,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1266}]}
