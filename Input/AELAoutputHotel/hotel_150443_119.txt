{"text":"Fantastic experience!!! Wow!! I can't say enough great things about our experience at the Condado Plaza. We went this past weekend for a pre-celebration of my 30th birthday and found the experience to be extremely enjoyable. First off, the decor of the hotel and our room were pretty impressive and chic. However, even before seeing either, our great time all began with outstanding service from Henry Neumann - if you have the opportunity to meet him, please do - he's the best and very knowledgeable, helpful, you name it! He answered all of my questions and concerns prior to coming and even gave us a complimentary upgrade to the ocean view room. Thank gosh! The view and the sounds of the ocean can't be beat. We loved the staff at the pool - Sterling, Joey, Juan (trivia king) - they were all wonderful, accomodating and made our pooltime a ton of fun. My boyfriend is a big gambler and he had a great time in the casino too. I read a recent review of the Italian restaurant's service - I must agree that was probably the only downfall of the entire place - it took over 35 minutes to get our breakfast. BUT, I guess we didn't mind so much b\/c we just enjoyed the view and being on vacation, we weren't in a rush to go anywhere! Oh! And with regards to the steakhouse, please note that you'll pay a pretty penny for drinks. I think we stopped in for 2 glasses of wine and it cost us about $40! However, there are so many great restaurants, shops, etc. right next to the hotel and down the street, so there honestly is never a lack of anything to do, see, etc. In fact, we had a tough time trying to pinpoint where we should eat next! Also, everywhere we went, the people of Puerto Rico\/Condado\/Old San Juan were so incredibly gracious and hospitable. We'd go back in a heartbeat and when we do, we wouldn't consider staying anywhere else. Thank you for the wonderful stay! :) ","annotations":[]}
