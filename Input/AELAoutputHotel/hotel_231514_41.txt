{"text":"Nice small hotel We stayed at Hispanos Siete Suizas in late April 2007. It was a nice pleasant small hotel, service was very friendly at the front desk, they were quite accommodating. I asked it they had wireless internet, and they said no but they have ADSL for free and will give you a LAN cord. That was a big hit for me! I upload my photos in the evening and share with my friends and family back home.The suites are smallish, but comfortable, with a sitting area in the living room, and two separate bedrooms with its own bathroom. Rooms are clean and bathrooms are well stocked daily. We stayed on the first floor directly above the restaurant, and there is some residual noise in the evenings since people eat so late here. I would ask for a room higher up if I had to do it again, but we booked last minute and I believe the hotel was full.The restaurant has a very nice ambiance, the food is quite good, our dinner for two with a bottle of wine and a shared dessert came to 85euros. Breakfast in the morning is included in the price of the room, and the buffet is ample, with scrambled eggs, meats, some of the best chocolate croissants I've ever had outside of France! The neighborhood around Sagrada Familia is a little less nice than some of the other areas, Barcelona in general is a bit dirty, but the people are very friendly and have alot of pride in their city, so it kind of makes up for the lack of cleanliness outside. Definitely take the Bus Turistic, get a two-day pass that allows you to see most of the city, stops at all the major places. The Metro is extremely easy to use, a 2 day pass costs under 10euros OR you can buy a Barcelona card for 19E that includes entry to some of the museums.I would stay here again if I came back simply because it was clean, friendly, well-priced and included FREE high-speed internet connection - that is a rarity in most hotels today. I've been ripped as much as 10E an hour for a connection!
