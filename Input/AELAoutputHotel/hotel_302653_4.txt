{"text":"Who gives a twin room to a honeymoon couple?? After many hours of trawling the internet for the best honeymoon deal, we decided upon the Hotel Melia Bali.28+ hours travelling later, we arrived into Bali and made our way to the hotel without any difficulty - minus my suitcase but these things happen, it had never left Dublin as far as we can tell, unreal... We arrived at the hotel at approximately 7pm on a Sunday evening, and to be honest, we could have been the king and queen of sheba, the hotel wouldn't have cared less. We were rushed through the check in process (we reiterated that we were on honeymoon, as per our booking) and were given a room key that we assumed was for the type of room that we had booked. The bellman with the one suitcase on board brought us off to our room and upon entry into it, we realised that they had given us a twin room. Who, in the name of fortune, gives a honeymoon couple a twin room (and we were staying there for 2 weeks)? So needless to say, we made it clear to the bellman (who had approximately 10 words of English) that we were not happy with the room. He rang reception and we were told to wait in the room while they resolved the issue. We have never been so unimpressed by a hotel in our lives and we have both stayed in many locations around the world. My husband finally said that we needed to physically return to reception as they weren't bothering to sort the room out by phone and the bellman went off and got us a double room. However, there was absolutely nothing for us for being a honeymoon couple - all the special treats that you read about when booking, they just don't exist! Talk about taking us for a ride for booking with them.The holiday went fine bar the fact that the beach bar (and even the piano bar on occasions) were sold out of the main bottles of spirits on a very regular basis. I am a Pimms drinker and can honestly say that I was able to have a Pimms No 1. cocktail for about 4 days out of the 13 that I was there. Not very impressive....To cap it all off, when we went to get our taxi from the hotel back to the airport, we realised that the hotel charges 45,000 rupiahs more than the airport price - that is, it cost 95,000 rupiahs to get from the airport to the hotel but 140,000 to get from the hotel to the airport. Logic anyone?So there you have it. We were not impressed at all with Hotel Melia Bali - we would never stay there again and would definitely not recommend it to anyone - I would hate for anyone we know to have to go through the unfriendliest check in staff ever. The fact that it was our once in a life honeymoon just makes it all the worst for us.
