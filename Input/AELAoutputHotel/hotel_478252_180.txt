{"text":"Good resort but watch your belongings My husband and I just came back from the Gran Bahia Principe. This was our 6th time in the caribbean. Been to Cuba 3 times, Punta Cana twice and the Mayan Riviera once. In a nutshell, good resort. Beautiful!! Beach is far from resort, however, the tram is always available to take you. For a 5 star hotel, I was suprised that some of the things like safety deposit box, and the banana boat were not included. We had to pay $35 for the box. Not a big deal deal but at 3 and 4 star hotels we have been to had the box included.Don't leave your belongings on the beach or by the pool. My husband had his sandals taken, his prescription sunglasses taken and I had a beach towel from home taken, on 3 separate occasions.The food is excellent, the service was good too. Good variety.The beach is....heavenly!!!! Miles of white sand and turquoise water. You can't ask for better.Pools are nice too. Kept very clean.There are vendors on the beach, about 45 min walk on the beach or you can take a boat taxi for about $5 per person. You must barter with them cause they will try and get more form you. The vendors are very aggresive so be prepared. They also want a lot of money for their goods so you really have to be firm and bring them down to what you are willing to pay. A neat experience though!! There are plenty of vendors right on the hotel property also in the courtyard so you really don't have to leave the resort if you prefer not to.The rooms were kept very clean. The maids really like little gifts from us. Things like cosmetics, toothbrushes and paste, and candy. They like anything really.Overall, a great time!! Beautiful place!! Aside from having our things taken, we had a good time, ate well, had great beach time. We would go back.
