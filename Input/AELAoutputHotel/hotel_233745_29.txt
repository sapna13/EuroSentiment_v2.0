{"text":"Ruined our engagment trip This review is dedicated to Thierry, the receptionist at this hotel.It has to be one of my worst hotel experience in memory: It went down hill right from check in. Very indifferent and arrogant. They made us feel marginalized like Afro-Americans in the 1950's. Remarkably, the room it self was lovely...We stayed in the Theodore de Banville room. Nice view...Very tastefully decorated, but a littel dated looking. Anyhow, the negative certainly overshadowed the positive very quickly when we discovered they told us we will lose the room the second night.( This is after confirming our booking directly with the hotel while we were in Toronto ). The second room was very frumpy and dated looking..rather tired. In each room, there was a bowl of fruit that looked like they were picked out of a garbage bin...beyond rotten...actually petrifying. I asked front desk to please remove the disgusting sight. They grudgingly did that, but later charged us for fruit and mineral water on our bill when we checked out. Unbelievable.That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not all. There was construction going on in the main foyer. They started at 8:30 in morning. Sure, if you are a business traveler, you wouldn't care as much because you are leaving early in the morning. But, we were on a romantic vacation trying to sleep in a few hours. When I tactfully requested them to please give a few hours to sleep, they were rude and said they can't because of scheduling. Well, what about our schedule??Who cares if its a romantic hotel in a wonderful area if the staff \/management decides to ruin your romantic holiday ? I had planned to propose to my girl firend in Paris that trip, but forced to wait 4 more month when we went to NYC because this trip was so depressing. Nothing like giving some one your hard money so they can insult you and abuse you.There are many, many romantic hotels in Paris with out this hassle.
