{"text":"Still sick!!! After reading many reviews on the Princess we decided to give it another chance. We were there 4 years ago and I got sick then. Not as sick as this time but my gut was not right for a month after returning home. The reviews seemed that there had been some improvement with the food but my experience was again, not good.  Yes, the beach,the rooms,weather are very good. Thats why we went back. The setting is beautiful,if only they could get their act together with the food it could be a 5 star resort. I was there one day and a half and I got diarrea. I was very careful and also had no drinks but bottled water and 2 beers. By thursday I had to go to the clinic. A very nice Dr. in the clinic on the grounds prescribed me anti- biotic, pills for my bowels, pepto bismol and intravenous drugs for 2 days, to the tune of $430. Nice vacation, I spent most of my time in the washrooms. I have never had anything like that in my life. I am back to work this week and still I'm on gatoraide for my electrolights because I'm feeling so weak.  It's not hard to figure out why people get sick. The buffet food is NEVER hot. It sits there room temp for hours. Sure there is plenty of food but all of it has no taste and is sitting there growing bacteria. I even tried a hard boiled egg,thinking that was safe. It was so over cooked,black yoke that just disentegrated it was so dry.My husband ordered a caesar salad at the Tex Mex and it came like soup with so much dressing on a hot plate.Don't bother trying to make a caesar if all you have is iceberg lettuce. The food is a joke. Will I go back? Never. I can spend my money in many other places with a nice beach and not get so sick ,it ruins my holiday. I went knowing it was not gourmet, I did not expect that. The only word I can use to describe the food is slop. By the way a wedding party had 5 sick people and another young couple from England were sick.My husband spoke to another lady that was ill also.  The animation team are so irritating. This is supposed to be a adult resort. I can make my own fun. I don't need someone pulling me out of my chair to teach me dance lessons or play volley ball. The music they blasted at the pool everyday was for their pleasure only. The same 4 songs every day. I did not see anyone else looking like they enjoyed it. as a matter of fact some people got very mad at them in the pool, they were so pushy and overbearing. People tried to ignore them but its pretty hard when the music is blasting and you can't get away from them, they just take over for 3-4 hours every afternoon. Go somewhere else!!!!
