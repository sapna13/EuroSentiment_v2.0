{"text":"A Little disappointed My wife and I stayed at the Ritz for two nights before going on to St Barts. Our impression of the hotel, generally, is that it is quite nice, and up to the Ritz standard. We were left somewhat disappointed with our room. We requested, and received, a room on the club level with a balcony overlooking the ocean. The rate was $1900\/nt. The problems were as follows: 1) The size of the room was no larger than a standard room. We knew in advance what the rate was, so there is no complaint there. We just thought that for this rate we should have a more substantial amount of space; 2) Our room was infested with ants. Don't ask me why this is not our number one complaint. Nonetheless, it was frustrating. We contacted the hotel who replied, (not joking) What would you like us to do? We asked them to send up an exterminator. They did, however, the ants returned in force; 3) The Ritz charged us a 10% per day resort fee. This meant an additional $190\/nt to use the hotel's facilities. This really irked me for some reason. I would rather they simply raised the room rate by an equal amount. Does a family of four staying in a $400\/nt room really use 1\/5 the facilities that my wife and I used during our two night stay? This just felt like it was unnecessary gouging. I did not complain about this charge, so I do not know what the management's position is on the matter.Now for the really good. Eveybody at this property went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They are truly warm friendly people who took every opportunity to try to please us. We really appreciated their hospitality. The pool area was clean and a great place to fall asleep while my wife was out spending money ( er, sightseeing, I mean). Since we travel through Puerto Rico frequently to get to St Barts, we will be staying here again. We will pay the outrageous 10% resort fee, and we will sleep in a room way too small for $1900\/nt. We will even try to beat back the ants - though we wish we didn't have too.
