{"text":"Would stay there again... Myself, 2 friends and 18 year-old twins have just returned from 5 nights at this hotel and we thought it was fine. We had a problem with checking-in, in that the hotel asked for a voucher that we didn't have. The front desk staff, although pleasant, weren't very helpful and we ended up having to contact England on numerous occasions, although we felt it should have been down to the hotel staff to contact our tour operator. However, on our 4th day, I spoke to Jason, the Front Desk Manager and he was excellent. I just wish we'd spoken to him on the 1st day. Maybe it was because of the Sterling\/Dollar exchange rate, but we didn't have a problem with the cost of anything. We ate breakfast once in the hotel and never expected it to be the cheapest place to eat. Hotels never are. You always have to eat out to get the best prices. What we did have a problem with, was being understood, despite being English. We were in MacDonald's asking for a bottled water and they kept trying to get us a Quarterpounder! In fact, everywhere we went, the service was very slow and 'laid-back' to put it mildly, to the point that we felt we weren't really in 'America'. All of our party have visited many different destinations in the USA and Miami doesn't compare to the normally excellent standards of service elsewhere in the States. Having said that, we liked Miami - you just have to take the rough with the smooth. Having read some of the other reviews, we didn't have any problems with our rooms and yes, our water drained from the basin fast enough for us... We were given rooms next to each other and found them to be spacious and really clean.We deliberately picked this hotel, as although it was out of the centre a bit, we wanted somewhere with a big pool area. Most of the hotels in the centre, either had very small pools or no pool at all. The pool attendants came round during the day with cold towels, ice-lollys and smoothies which was a nice touch. I've noticed none of the other Reviewers have commented on the Spa and\/or Health Club. We only used it to shower and change due to having a late checkout and found it to be excellent. Free shampoo and soap and use of towels made it really convenient. .All-in-all, I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to my friends.
