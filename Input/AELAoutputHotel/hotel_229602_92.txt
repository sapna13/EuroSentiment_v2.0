{"text":"We felt like Parisians! This hotel is very charming, with the location being the greatest asset! We loved feeling like we were in a local area, with the street market and wonderful cafes around. Also, the metro stop is just around the corner so it is convenient to get other places as well. It is clean, with wonderful staff who were very helpful . The only problem we had was leaving at 4 a.m to catch a flight and trying to communicate with the night front desk clerk (his english was a lot more limited than other workers) as to why our taxi we had asked him to reserve was not there. We were getting frustrated, and unable to hail one that early in the morning, when he finally communicated to us that he had spoken with the company and one was on the way (although 45 min late). He zoomed us to the airport so it all worked out fine!The rooms are clean and sort of bed-and-breakfastish...not near as modern as all the other hotels we stayed at in Europe that had flat screens and modern furnishings but very clean and well taken care of. There was a strong smoke smell one night so we feared the place was on fire, but that same hotel clerk told us it was from another apartment next door or something.... The highlight of our room was the view! We requested an Eiffel Tower view so we could lay in bed and watch the Tower twinkle on the hour! This was one of the highlights of all of Europe for me! Overall, great experience, great location, great staff, great view... definitely stay here! ","annotations":[]}
