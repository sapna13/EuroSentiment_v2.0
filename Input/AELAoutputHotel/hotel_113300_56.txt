{"text":"Brilliant Hotel We stayed in the Omni for our honeymoon late last year. We had come from Aruba and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ arrive until after 9pm, wrecked. The location of this hotel cannot be beaten in my opinion. St Patricks Cathedral is literally around the corner. Our room was good, small enough but what we expected in New York. It was very clean, the bathroom was nice, not noisy, very nice hotel staff √à√\u2020\u2022?especially the concierge. I would recommend Smith  Wollensky for steaks √à√\u2020\u2022?you can only get 16oz steaks which I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat so rather than waste food I ordered the lemon chicken √à√\u2020\u2022?which I was told was a WHOLE chicken!! So go here hungry √à√\u2020\u2022?great steaks and well worth a visit. BICE Italian was recommended by the concierge and we loved it √à√\u2020\u2022?really great staff, food, wine and general atmosphere. We also ate in Water√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Edge. This was nice √à√\u2020\u2022?very expensive and the yacht was broken the night we went. They were under pressure because of the yacht being broken so I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think we saw it at its best. Still it was nice. We did A LOT of shopping √à√\u2020\u2022?our favourite was Bloomingdale√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂. Macys was too crowded and Bergdorf Goodman too expensive. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget to avail of the 11% discount for visitors in Bloomingdale√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂  Macys. We went to the Guggenheim museum √à√\u2020\u2022?worth a visit and hired bikes in Central Park which was brilliant. Pershing Square Diner beside Grand Central Station is somewhere we went for breakfast √à√\u2020\u2022?highly recommend it. We will definitely be going back to New York and we will definitely stay in the Omni. Oh and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ well worth joining the Select Guest programme √à√\u2020\u2022?free coffee  juice every morning.
