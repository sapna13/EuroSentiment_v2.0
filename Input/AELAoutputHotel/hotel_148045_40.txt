{"text":"Do NOT Stay here! I just returned from my stay at this hotel in Puerto Rico. I had a terrible experience. Two elevators were being worked on during my stay which made it incredibly difficult to get around the hotel, especially with a stroller (stairs were not an option). I even had to use the service elevator at one point which was dingy. The employees at the casino were rude when changing my money so I decided not to even bother losing any money there and left. Our tub was clogged for two days (and the tub showers were sunk-in and not very big). The maid service took our wash cloths and didn't replace them. There wasn't any hot water. The best it got was lukewarm. The phone in the room didn't work. You are stuck at the hotel and the prices are outrageous. Spend your money on a nice hotel elsewhere where you at least have the option of going out for reasonably price meals. Another member of my party had a problem with her credit card (she was paying cash at checkout, which they said would be fine). Then, when she had reached her limit on her card, they proceeded to lock her out of her room and not let her charge to the room for lunch (she was at the private island and had to skip that meal). They had to get the manager to even let her in her room to get cash to pay them. They then wound up telling her that they would give her a credit, but then wound up charging her instead, which pushed her over her limit so her credit card company is now charging her extra. I would not recommend this hotel at all. The price was definitely not worth all of the headaches and the inconveniences.
