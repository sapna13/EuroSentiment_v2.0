{"text":"Amazing Hotel - Top Notch in Hong Kong The Mandarin Oriental hotel (this is the original one and it recently in the last year completed a renovation - this is not the newer Landmark Center location two blocks away) was flawless. From the moment the uniformed agent met me outside customs and whisked me away to the hotel in a large, new Black Mercedes sedan to check in to the remainder of my stay, it was perfect in every way. Even though checking in at 3am (delayed flights due to weather in China), the hotel staff was ready for me. The room was a harbor view room complete with binoculars to look across the harbor from Central. Hermes toiletries abound. The bath area was incredible, complete with soaking tub and a FULL range of toiletries for all needs (nails, teeth, shaving and much more). Beds were very comfortable. VERY ample supply of free bottled water. State of the art flat screen TVs. Very large in room safe. Terry cloth and silk roabs as choice. Slippers that actually fit large feet like mine. The health club on the 24th floor was amazing too. Very large. Nice facilities overall. Breakfast was included in my rate at their buffet on the mezzanine level was first rate. Car service back to the airport was also flawless, except for a small wait for my pick up due to heavy traffic near the hotel. Once at the airport, a uniformed valet took me all through the process right up to security. Very nice. I cant wait to go back!
