{"text":"Better than you could ever expect I travelled to Japan for the first time by myself back in August\/September 07 and travelled around the country on a rather small budget, but treated myself to two nights stay in the Park Hyatt at the end of my trip... and boy did it give my whole experience the send off it deserved!!The hotel is immacuately decorated and beautifully presented. Staff were very kind and attentive, and although I felt a little out of place turning up in my Jeans and T-shirt combo, they were very polite, with a smooth check-in (with an unexpected complimentary upgrade to a suite!!), and a tour of the hotel whilst on they way to my room. Also they remembered my name for the whole time I was there and always said hello when I passed them in the hallways\/doorways which is a nice touch.The room was seriously impressive; I had the choice of city\/m.fuji view or bay view at check in and went for the mount fuji option, although low cloud kinda spoiled that bit, the views accross the city were unsurpassed. The room itself was huge (i'm pretty sure it was larger than my entire flat!) and well kitted out, and the beds (a choice of two for just one man? that's luxury! ;o) ) were extremely comfortable.It's location really isn't an issue if you enjoy discovering the city on foot; it was only a 15 minute walk to Shinjuku station via the government buildings and underground walk-way, and this being Japan it always felt safe. The room service was also impressive, as was the restaurant\/food.Having worked in a 5* hotel myself I could fully appreciate everything the staff of the Park Hyatt did to make my stay the most enjoyable one I have ever spent in a hotel. If you're considering it, whether you want to find one of the best Tokyo hotels to stay in, or you fell in love with it watching Lost in Translation, seriously; go there, experience it, and enjoy it!!
