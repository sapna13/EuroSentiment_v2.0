{"text":"Service, what service ? We arrived at the Renaissance on Friday still expecting work and renovations to be taking place and they were......The hotel was certainly not 5 star, walking around the corridors was like being in a college or hospital, the overall feel was not one I would feel relaxed in and certainly not up to European 5 star hotels.Our purpose however was to use the hotel as a base for the city, we did not use the restaurant facilities so cannot comment on those.The hotel lobby had a rather pungent, sewer smell to it on occasions, again not the sort of thing you would expect from a 5 star hotel.This leads me on to Expedia, whom we booked through and booked on the phone with one of their agents at a call centre. We expressly asked for twin beds and were told the booking would be done on that basis.On arrival at the hotel we were told it was a double bed only room and no other rooms were available. At 4pm in the afternoon we asked for a put-up bed to be installed in the room, reception said that would be done after chasing them many times.We checked again later in the evening and on returning this was not done and we were told no more put-up beds were available.We managed to change room to a twin on the following day.So in summary, this sort of hotel is not and should not be 5 star, I also would not rate their service based on our experience. For the same money you could get a better deal in the City without doubt.In addition to that, I would not book any hotel accommodation with Expedia ever again after being told one thing, then on arrival being given another.The hotel did little to help us, so would never return to that chain again.Hope this helps...
