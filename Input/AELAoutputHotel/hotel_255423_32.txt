{"text":"great location and nice little hotel honestly its a great small hotel in the vicnity of Sydney CBD. we did not knew where Surry Hills was, but seriously its a great location especially if you are in dey for holidaying.Sydney CBD is only about 10 minutes walking and darling harbour about 15. the walk itself is great as you get to see and absorb sydney on the way.from the moment we walked in to the hotel we were well received by very informative staff. the hotel looked modern and new age. they seemed very helpful and explained about the normal routine and as well as the area around us. even earlier when we made over their website which does resemble the hotel i found it easy, maybe we are just used to the internet. we rang he hotel to get more info about the hotel as this was our first trip to sydney. the reservation staff were more than helpful in assisting our queries.When you see not so good reviews of the hotel you have doubts and dilemna especialy when you have been recommended with the one. it was the same case for us but we did went with our gut feeling and took a chance and i am glad we did it; it is a good value for money consideiring other rates other sydney hotel charges.we booked a standard room and was given a room on the 4th floor and we were happy with the room.actually we were complimentart upgraded to a bedroom suite overlooking the main street, which was a nice touch. the view is really nice especially at night when you Sydney skyline at the back drop.we had a quite drink in the little bar where the bartender was really lovely and made us feel comfortable.with our 3 days stay at the hotel we were overall very satisfied with the service the rooms etc. however one lift was down one afternoon for about couple of hours but they do have 3 lifts in total but a little wait was required.would definately recommend the hotel for its location price friendliness and general cleanliness of the hotel.
