{"text":"We will not stay again We stayed 4 night from December 27 to 30, 2006. We checked in a room on 2nd floor. The location is not easy found but it is quiet and the room is adequate. We saw some tiny little ants in the kitchen area. I cleaned up and wished they will not return. I also noticed some holes in the blanket caused by clothes moth.The 2nd day the ants again were in the kitchen when we return to the hotel in the evening. We noticed that the ants were not only the kitchen, but some also in the ceilings of living room and bathroom sink area (the area just outside bathroom). I called front desk and reported the situation. I was told that at this time of the year, ants are everywhere in Florida. We do not live here therefore we do not know if this is true. I was promised to get it cleaned by maintenance people or we will move to another room.The 3rd day when we got back to the room, the kitchen was not cleaned and ants were everywhere. The shower head in bathroom had problem too. Only half of water came out the shower head the other half came out the bathtub tap (the lower tap). It was fine the first 2 nights. I called the front desk and was given a room on 3rd floor. We moved to 3rd floor. In the elevator, we heard and saw some other guests moving up too. We realized that we were not the only room had ants problem.The exhaust fan in the bathroom in our 3rd floor room was not working. I reported to the front desk the next day morning. The female staff said:√à√\u2020\u2022?I will get maintenance people to fix it today. But do you NEED the exhaust fan?√à√\u2020\u2022?I replied √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∫√Üf cause we need it.
