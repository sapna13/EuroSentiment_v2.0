{"text":"We've always loved it - but this last time was a real let down. We stayed at the Singapore Ritz Carlton on Aug 22 - Aug 24th, 2008.We've stayed there many times before, and we've always enjoyed our stay.While making the reservation online, we've requested for a King Bed - Non Smoking Club room.Upon check-in, the room given to us, had a very strong smoke-smell.We asked for a different room and we waited outside our room.In about 15 minutes or so, a Club concierge came and took us to our new room.It's slightly bigger than our first room, and most of all, it smelled nice.After a while, we then found out that the Menu option didn't work from our TV. It took a couple visits from the engineers and they said they'd call us to see when they can fix it.Hours passed, we didn't get a call back. We finally tried the Menu on the TV and it was working. At night when the engineer finally called, we told them the TV has been fixed.Friday night - we're at the club enjoying our in-room dining food. They turned off the lights because the fireworks were about to start.A club staff asked if we could still see okay. We said we're fine, and we'll just wait a while since the fireworks would only take 15 minutes.We're able to enjoy the fireworks because it was dark in the clubroom - there's no glare from the mirrors. There's some music that was being played, and it was timed nicely with the fireworks.Saturday night - we're at the club again, waiting for the fireworks.The lights were never turned off\/dimmed. And there's no music like it was on Friday. We're seeing our reflections in the mirror because of the lights in the club.While we're checking out on Sunday, I mentioned this to one of the male club staff. And he said, because some of our guests were still eating, we could not turn off the lights. We then said, well we were eating on Friday night, but you turned off the lights anyway.He repeated the same comments, and we left it at that.I'm assuming there's some VIP guest that 'reserved' the corner dining area at the Club. I noticed the staff were surrounding the couple with the baby and everyone kept greeting them. I'm guessing the lights were left on for them. I don't think this is fair for the other Club guests. If there's a VIP guest with special requests, then the VIP guest should dine in his room instead of sacrificing everyone's enjoyment at the Club. I think it's a selfish gesture and I don't understand why the Club staff obliged the request. The lights should be dimmed for the fireworks as it was on Friday night.So, we've decided we're not returning to Ritz Carlton Singapore, since we don't feel that we're being fairly treated as other guests.It's quite sad actually, we've always loved the Ritz and we've been going there for years, but I guess it's time to move on and find a better place.
