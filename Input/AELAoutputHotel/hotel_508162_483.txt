{"text":"Dream Vacation This was our first trip to the Caribbean and it won't be the last. The worst part of the vacation was the ride to the resort and Being from Labrador...That wasn't too bad.  Right from the start we were treated like royalty. We were greeted with champagne and hot towels. Our luggage was taken care of and the fun began. The staff was very friendly and helpful, the rooms were amazing with our very own patio  they were very clean. The only complaint I have about the food was that there was too much to choose from and we ate too much. It was all great. The beach is just like we see in the magasines...long sandy and very clean. The pool was to die for and was great to cool off in on those hot hot days.(we especially liked the swim up pool bar) The lounge chairs were hard to get but we caught on pretty quick and my Brother in-law got up extra early to save us a spot. There was always something to do thanks to the great and energetic entertainment team. I especially like Dominican 50 cent. He always made people laugh. They were all great and treated everyone the same. Our favorite hang out was at the Baracuda bar with Wilson the bartender...He was our favorite(or as he would say...Family) I can honestly say that this was my dream vacation come true and I can't wait to go back again. I recommend it to everyone. You won't be dissappointed. ","annotations":[]}
