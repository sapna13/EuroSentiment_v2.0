{"text":"Great hotel in a central SF location! My partner and I stayed in the Orchard Hotel for our first visit to San Francisco. Having read the reviews on TripAdvisor we decided to go ahead and book for 7 nights direct on their website.After reading in a TimeOut guidebook that if possible you should get a suite we contacted the hotel about this and although we didn't want to pay to upgrade, they were kind enough to put us as requesting an upgrade if one was available at check-in. To our joy we found out on arrival they had put us into a king suite for free!The room was great, we had views out onto Bush street and down to the financial district, a separate living room to the bedroom and a wonderful bathroom with both a good size bath and a large shower cubical. My only criticism of the room is that I was expecting a more modern look to the rooms, although the d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was not to my personal opinion of a boutique hotel it was still new, clean and comfortable.We had 2 televisions in the room (one in the bedroom and one the living room) although these were old CRT screens when I would have expected flatscreen technology. The living room also had a DVD player with a library of DVDs available from the front desk. Free wi-fi was also included in the stay, which came in very handy with checking back home and when booking some tickets during our stay.On our first evening we used the room service to eat as we were a bit worn out from flying, and the food was very good - I can highly recommend the risotto!Overall this is a great hotel, the staff were very helpful when we needed them and were always available to offer information or to book a towncar\/taxi to various locations and back to the airport.
