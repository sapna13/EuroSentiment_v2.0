{"text":"Not recommended to family with children We booked 2 contigous junior suite because we have 4 young children. When we arrived we do have 2 rooms but not in the same building. The Clerk at the reception is pretty arrogant, his attitude is that you had no choice......First night of our arrival, 2 of my kids had food poisoning.Fortunately we brought lot of peptobismol and immodium.We are a family with 4 children from Montreal, Canada. Bought an all inclusive one week (June 22-June 29) with three dinner a la carte. Mychildren over 10 years old could not be admitted because they don't wear long pant. This is never advertise or publicize in any brochure except in front of each restaurant with a little notice.Don't come here unless you can speak spanish. I noticed that employees that do not speak english are somehow nicer than employee that speak english. They have a lot of German tourists. They act as if they owned the beach. I saw an incident between a young french canadian couple and the german gang. They just tossed out the belonging of the young couple because they installed within the german zoneIt is true that you have to wake up at 6a.m. in order to reserve yourhut. Be careful, because on our last day, after installing our towels, we went for breakfast for 30 minutes, on our return, we foundother people at our hut. After explaining they accept to leave and welost two towels.The food is mediocre, The beds are so soft that you can feel the springs. Wonder if they used recycle mattress.In resume don't choose ANY resort belonging to the Fiesta Hotel Group. They just change the name to Grand Palladium in order to lure international tourist but sadly they are not up to the standard.
