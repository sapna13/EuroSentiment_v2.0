{"text":"Perfect Accommodations My wife and I stayed at The Seven Bridges for 7 nights in June\/July of 2007. Our stay at the Seven Bridges was excellent. The rooms had a lot of character and were decorated with amazing detail (as mentioned by many other reviews and you can see great pictures on the Seven Bridges website). We stayed in room number 10 which is at the very top of the building. The room was very warm and cozy and really gave the feeling of what it is like to live in a canal-side home with its views of the back garden and sloped roof - especially when laying in bed on a rainy morning and listening to the rain drops bounce off of the roof. Even the walk up the winding staircase to our room added to the character and charm of our stay. I agree with another reviewer who stated that walking to our room each night felt more like we were staying at a friend's home than in a hotel.Gunter and his staff were extremely friendly and helpful in every way possible. It was a delight to see them each morning when they delivered our breakfast (a breakfast which often kept us full until dinner) or down in the reception area.The location is great as it sits on a picturesque canal just a couple blocks from Rembrandtplein (square full of cafes and a tram stop). We were able to walk to most locations - Leidseplein, Dam Square, Albert Cuyp Markt, the Jordaan, the Museum District... There is no doubt in my mind that we will stay at the Seven Bridges again the next time we are in Amsterdam. Thanks Gunter!
