{"text":"Overall a Great Resort Just returned from a three night stay at the Caribe Hilton. This is a great resort, we had a wonderful time. The open air lobby is very nice and all of the staff we dealt with were excellent. The pool and beach areas are both very nice. You can rent kayaks and pool\/beach toys at the hut which is located in between the beach and the pool area. There were waiters on the beach on the weekend, but not the weekday I was there. Also, on the weekend, there is yoga on the beach at 9:00 a.m. which was very good.Not to be overlooked is the small cafe in the spa building which is located at the end of the beach, in a seperate building from the hotel. They make wonderful fresh, made-to-order wraps here which we got for lunch everyday and took out onto the beach with us. They also have breakfast items and smoothies. The wraps were only about $10 each and much healthier than the menu at the pool bar.The store just across the street is a great place to go to stock up on water, beverages, and snacks. The rooms do have a refrigerator so you can keep your snacks cold. The rooms were very nice, the beds were great. The balconies are big enough to enjoy a cup of coffee on and feature a small table and two chairs.Having a Starbucks in the lobby was great. A coffee and a bagel in the morning will run you about $5.My only negative remark would be not necessarily about the resort but about Puerto Rico itself. The shoreline is very built up, one high rise hotel or condo building after another. The buildings just seem to be on top of each other near the water. It is not a deterrent once you familiarize yourself with the resort, but when I first arrived I was a bit disappointed with how congested the area was.
