{"text":"Very good location Booked a last minute weekend in Amsterdam so not all hotels were available. This hotel is entirely satisfactory but I could not describe it in the glowing terms that other contributors have done. I had booked it directly on the Marriott website and had requested a non-smoking room. When we arrived at the hotel there were no rooms available so we left our luggage with the concierge and went for a tour of the city. On our return we were allocated a room on the second floor which was a smoking floor. As soon as we stepped out of the lift we could smell the cigarette smoke and the smell in our bedroom was even worse. My husband went down to reception and requested an alternative room. We were then allocated a room on the sixth floor (a non-smoking floor) and this was much better - it is just a pity that we had not been given this room in the first place. The bedroom itself was very comfortable. The people in the room next to us had breakfast in their bedroom and left their dishes outside our room. These dishes lay there all day and were not removed until the evening - not what I would have expected from a hotel of this standard.The breakfast was very good and there was a very large choice at the buffet. The staff in the restaurant were also very pleasant and helpful although the staff on the concierge desk were less helpful.As mentioned in other reviews the situation of the hotel is very good but I think there are probably better hotels in an equally good position.
