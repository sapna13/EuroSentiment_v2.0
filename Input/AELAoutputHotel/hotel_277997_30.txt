{"text":"Overall... great stay! My husband and I visited as a last relaxing trip before our new baby is born next month. Overall, it was a wonderful and relaxing stay filled with great service and beautiful views.Check in was perfect. Tony led us by car to our Hidden Valley suite and explained everything about the resort and best places to eat while at the resort.Our suite on the top 4th floor was great with a comfortable bed and living room suite. When the flat screen went out suddenly the first morning, they were there with a new one within 5 minutes. WOW... great service again!The food was very good at Pointe in Thyme. We ate there for the buffet breakfast complete with a custom omelette station. The hamburgers there were fantastic as well. Do stay away from the Mexican Cantina... food was not that good at all.We played a round of golf there at the resort at Outlook Mountain Golf Course. It was in great shape with immaculate fairways and greens, course can be very challenging playing from tips. (Just stay on the fairways!!)The spa was probably the most disappointing part of the trip. My husband and I both got massages.... the therapists were good however the spa is VERY SMALL and CRAMPED. There is no spa-like experience there so I did cancel my facial for the following day.The pool is great complete with a slide. Although being 33 weeks pregnant I couldn't do it, my husband enjoyed the indoor slide! I loved laying out and getting some great sun. There were children everywhere at the family pool but there are 3-4 other smaller pools at the resort, one being for adults only.The only part I was not happy at with was when our bill came the last morning, they had double charged us for a dinner and added about $5.00 additonal to a tip. When we questioned them, they immediately took it away... just disappointing they do things like that to unsuspecting guests.Overall though, we loved our stay and will bring our children back in a couple of years! Phoenix is beautiful!
