{"text":"Way to go Prince Kuhio Family reunion on Oahu. I booked two mountain views rooms for six nights. On arrival we were told the balconys in our rooms would not be usable. I politely asked for room changes and we were given executive ocean view rooms on the 33rd floor with working balconys. We had another family member coming for two nights and he was also given an upgrade, even though it was a weekend, to this floor.Rooms are newly refurbished. Bathrooms are beautiful and have Hans Grohe shower heads. Although small it is the nicest bathroom I have had in any hotel.Rooms are small with two double beds and storage is limited. Perfect for two but would be crowded for four. Rooms are bright--with yellow and fuschia decor. .. a bit intense for me but well done. Beds are exceptionally comfortable. Plasma t.v. a nice touch. Views from the balcony wonderful...but wish there were chairs out there.Public areas of the hotel are very attractive with generous use of granite and marble. MAC 24\/7 has a good pulled pork sandwich and salads. The size of the pancakes will feed four. There are many other places to eat in the area....try TIki's for lunch or dinner.The hotel is still being refurbished and the only issue was that we were told water would be turned off from noon-4:00 one day on the 26 floor and up. We knew this the day before and were not in the room for most of that time.Service from staff was exceptional...from the valets in charge of parking to the housekeepers. Very professional and friendly. Executive room was always well stocked with soda, coffee, and food. Staff there were also very good.We called for a 2:00 check out on one room. No problem (it was a Tuesday). All in all, although the rooms are small for a Hilton, this was an terrific hotel experience.
