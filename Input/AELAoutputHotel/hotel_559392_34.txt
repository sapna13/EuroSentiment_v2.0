{"text":"Decent budget accommodation My wife and I stayed here for several days in March, 2007. I booked this hotel on Expedia as it received fair reviews and was quite cheap for Singapore.It is not within convenient walking distance from any of the touristy sites in Singapore, however, is very near a bus stop and is about 5 stops from Chinatown. Also, it gets regular taxi traffic if one prefers that mode of getting around. It is also fairly near the Harbourfront station area. Bus service in Singapore was 90 cents (Singapore) per person\/per trip, which is quite cheap and several routes pass by the hotel. We used the bus service to get around while staying at Harbour Ville and they have the numbers of the busses that pass by their hotel on their business cards for your convenience.The rooms are small, but the AC works well and there was adequate hot water. The bathrooms are also small and the toilet areas tend to share real estate with the shower. Each room has a small TV that gets about 4-5 stations incl. a movie channel.Breakfast is served every day except Sunday and includes coffee\/tea\/juice, fried hot dog, cold baked beans, scrambled egg, toast with jam and peanut butter and possibly fried potato.Staff there were courteous and business-like, but don't expect to be romanced!A cabbie pointed out to us that the hotel has a reputation for some prostitution traffic, however, this wasn't as issue during our stay although we did see a woman who appeared to be on the job at about 1 AM. Certainly, this is at least partially due to the fact that the hotel is across the street from the industrial harbour area where ships load and unload and there are probably some visitors in town in there with some needs for female attention!Again, our rooms were quiet on our two seperate stays here, however. I suspect whatever traffic of that nature the hotel might get is reserved for floors other than where longer term occupants might be staying. I just thought this was important to note. We saw numerous Chinese and Malay tourists staying there while we were there.For our needs, this accommodation was perfectly fine and allowed us to save some money on our overhead while in Singapore.I would recommend Harbour Ville to those on a budget who don't mind taking the bus and having a small room when they travel.
