{"text":"Better than expected We just returned from a week-long vacation at the Esj towers. After reading some of the more recent reviews on this site, we approached the vacation with trepidation. I'm glad to report that our accomodations were much better than expected and that we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. We rented a 2 bedroom condo through a private realtor, Palm View Realty. The agent, Alma, was helpful in securing apartments for my family as well as my sister's family. The apartments were spacious , clean and well maintained, even if they were somewhat old. We had a nice balcony with a beautiful view of the ocean. We did not have any maid service for the week and I felt our unit could have been provided with more clean towels but this is variable from unit to unit as my sister's apartment was very well supplied. We found the hotel pool to be very nice. Although not as fancy as a resort style pool, it was fairly large and very clean. There were plenty of lounge chairs available and a kiosk from which to buy drinks. The beach in front of the hotel was nice but unfortunately, there was a lot of seaweed in the water and we had to walk down the beach a distance in order to find clearer water in which to swim. The access to the beach from the hotel was through the parking garage but this was a short walk and no big deal. There was a boat rental stand on the beach right in front of the hotel where we were able to rent jet skis or go out in a banana boat. We found the workers in the hotel to be very pleasant, especially the host in the restaurant from which I bought coffee every morning. The hotel had a game room, pool tables, ping pong tables, a business center and a decent fitness center. Although not luxurious, we found this to be avery comfortable and convenient place to be.
