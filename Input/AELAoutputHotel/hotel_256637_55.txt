{"text":"Great location We stayed at the Sheraton on a saturday night for a friends wedding. We were given the $275 weekend special which includes parking and breakfast for 2. Note that the parking is free, but an extra $10 for valet service. We weren't given the option of parking the car ourselves though. Check in was quick and efficient.  The room was clean and spacious. The bed was soft and very comfortable. We had a shower and bath. Despite being on the 18th floor, the view was mediocre of surrounding buildings. No balcony or open windows made it a little claustrophobic. Also, no smoking unless you request a smoking room. We visited the bride and grooms one bedroom suite. It was large with a small balcony overlooking the harbour  park. A fabulous view. A small bathroom  toilet considering it was a suite though.  The bar stayed open until 3am and had a large selection of beers, wines and spirits. Staff were very friendly and willing to help where they could. Our only compaint was at breakfast. Dont arrive between 9-10am. We had to line up the get a table, this took 10mins. Then there was a long line to get hot food and another line for the egg chef. It was 30mins before we were sitting down with food. Being a large group, we had tea\/coffee in thermous pots on the tables. This coffee was dreadful, but the cappacino I got was lovely. There seemed to be a limit of 1 coffee or tea being made for each person The choice of food was adequate. The usual array of hot foods such as bacon, baked beans, grilled tomatoes and mushrooms, sausages, pancakes and eggs benedict which was delicious. There were 2 egg chefs making all things eggs. Yoghurts, pastries, fresh fruit, cereals and miso soup. The food was fresh  delicous but selection not as large as some other 5 star hotels.  The dining area seemed inadequate for the number of guests there. I went to get juice and when I came back, my plate with half my breakfast was wisked away too! I then got up to get more food (joining the back of the line again) and came back to find my juice had been taken and the table being cleared. The staff seemed rushed and stressed and didnt know we were still eating, despite a coat being on the back of my chair! Overall we had a terrific stay, but only compaint was the long wait for breakfast.
