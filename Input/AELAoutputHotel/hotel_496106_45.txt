{"text":"Once is enough Unfortunately I did not take the advise of a previous reviewer and I ended up in Room 203. What he didn't mention is the beer deliveries that commence each morning. Each keg as it is delivered at about 8 am is slammed onto the sideway. The finale is the noise as the empty beer bottles are sent dwon a conveyer to be loaded onto the truck. All this at about 8am.The design of the room was brilliant and unique. The sheets nice, mattress could have been better.The service was spotty. Some were pleasant and helpful at the front desk, some had an attitude - I think it is a age issue - all of them pretty young.There is no help in to the front door even if you are struggling with two back and opening the door. I think they must be amused to watch. No bell man. Though they did find me help to get my bags up the stairs. Though I was on my own on the way out. No elevator.I thought the location to be a bit out of the way in terms of downtown. There is a street car stop that makes it easier but if you just like to walk like I do - it is a hike.The cafe was great - I enjoyed the yougart, fruit and granola dish. Lots of locals like it as there hangout. I wasn't too disturb by the evening activities but i see how some unexpecting guests would be. There are three bars and they are very well known. Noise wasn't too bad the days I was there.Definite a place to stay at least once but for the price they charge I expect better service and attention and afternoon beer deliveries. ","annotations":[]}
