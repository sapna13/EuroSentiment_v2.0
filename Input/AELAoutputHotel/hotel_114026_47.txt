{"text":"Great Location Stayed at the Waikiki Parc Hotel one night recently and was impressed with the hotel itself and it's friendly and courteous staff. The hotel is a boutique style hotel, it's a high rise, but doesn't give off that feeling. The lobby is quaint with a more modern sheik look to it, with blue lighting in the entrance hall way, funky furniture in nonobtrusive bright colors in the lobby, this hotel is definetely on the up and up. The security is good, in which it requires a key to use the elevator to get to the different floors, which is nice. The rooms are small, but are okay. The shutters on the windows are a nice touch to the room, as well as the well backlit mirror in the bathroom and behind the bed in the room itself. The linens were most luxurious and comfortable, however the bed I wouldn't say as much comfortable. The breakast in Nobu was okay, they gave a 50% off coupon for breakfast during check in which is why we went, however the breakfast selections are limited to 4 selections only, french toast, an omlette, a japenese breakfast, or something simply like a muffin, very limited selection, although the food we had (french toast) was good and kids eat free with a paying adult (not sure of the age limit for the kids eat free feature). We were on the 22nd floor and had a view of the beach through the grounds of their sister hotel across the street the Halekulani, which by the way is very posh!! The views were okay, nothing spectacular. The lanai was small, big enough for 2 people, but no more than that. Access to the beach was quite easy with exiting the back side of the hotel and walking down a short walkway to the beach in front of the Halekulani. The pool area at the Waikiki Parc leaves a lot to be desired. The pool is very small, it's outdated in it's look, it's nothing luxurious, it's very basic and personally I felt the bottom of it felt quite slimy. There were ample amounts of towels available in the pool area with them being refilled often. There is no beverage\/snack service in the pool area, just a soda machine. There is no jacuzzi either. There are some cute sun beds that are covered to shade from the sun, which were nice. However, with the angle\/direction the pool area is located in, it didn't seem to me that it got that much sun anyway, thus not making it a great place to lay out. I didn't check out the fitness area, so I can't comment on that.I can comment on the staff and being VERY helpful and very friendly. The bellmen went over the top to provide service, both with delivering your bags to your room, retreiving them upon your departure and being more than happy to store them if you need them stored either prior to or after check out. They also offer what they call a hospitality room so if after you check out you need a place to shower or freshen up, you can do so. For example if after you check out your flight isn't until later in the evening, you can utilize the room free of charge. Also, a nice added touch is they have 2 bottles of water, one still and one bubbly that are complimentary in room when you arrive, much more than what other hotels in Waikiki offer, which is usually all pay for drinks in the room. The hotel does offer day rates for rooms just needed for the day, if for example you would like to stay longer after check out, if your flight didn't leave until later in the evening and you wanted your room available until at least 7pm, they offer a $115 rate, which is nice,, a little expensive, but nice for families who may be traveling with little ones that need to have a place for them to nap or just take a rest. Overall the hotel was fabulous, their sister property the Halekulani next door is absolutly gorgeous and they offer signing rights at their restaurants for patrons who are staying at the Waikiki Parc Hotel, which is nice. The Halekulani restaurants are very nice, the food is immpecable and the views are stunning!! Both properties are nearby the beach, lots of food venues and restaurants, as well as chic boutique shopping and only a 5 minute walk to the International Market Place and the Trolleys!!
