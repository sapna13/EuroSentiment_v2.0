{"text":"Someone please give the breakfast staff some training! Different people value different aspects of a hotel when they travel, so I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l just list what I liked and what I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. Then you can see whether there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ stuff that will bug you out, or stuff that you just simply don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care about so this will be a great hotel for you.The pluses for me:The room was one of the most quiet I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever stayed in, anywhere in the world. What bliss to NOT hear slamming doors, noisy neighbors, TVs, and cleaning staff shouting at each other in the hallways.Found the ironing board and iron very useful for last minute touch ups.The shower was hot and powerful.Hair dryer was excellent as well, I hate those weird contraptions that are stuck to the wall, and emit the weakest lukewarm air. This is the type of powerful hair dryer I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° use at home.The room had very clever use of space. It wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a very large room, but the designers made it feel airy and comfortable.Plugged my Sony Ericsson Walkman phone straight into a jack, so could listen to all my own music through the TV. Excellent.I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find the location that much of a problem. I prefer to be away from the touristiest areas anyway.Bellboys were friendly and efficient, especially one guy from the Philippines on the morning we were leaving.The minuses for me:Each light switch came with this really bright diode that stayed on at night. Someone had drawn black marker all over it, so I assume it bothered other people at night too. It was so bright that in the end we ended up sleeping with the blinds up, so as to not notice the tiny pinpricks of light that somehow managed to light up the whole room.They only change linens on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, unless they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºoiled√à√\u2020\u2022? There was a sign to that effect by the door. Many hotels have a cardboard or plastic sign that you put on the bed if you want your linens changed, but this is the first time that I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe seen a hotel have this sort of set arrangement in place. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not a neat freak or anything, we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e staying in a hotel in Taipei right now, and we only request that the maids change the linens once every three or four days, depending on how we feel. I just think that it would have been nicer if the choice had been left to the guest, rather than the hotel.The worst thing for me was the service at breakfast. Waiters were trying to take our plates whilst we were still eating, and took plates away even when we were still using them. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even eat that much or take that long, but it felt like they just wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ leave us alone! I thought it was just bad luck on our part, but we saw this poor business guy having to shout at a waiter, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂ ALREADY told your colleague TWICE what my room number is!√à√\u2020\u2022?The breakfast staff were very intrusive and in your face, and I found this to be an annoying way to start the day. And although I normally never have the buffet breakfasts because I tend to eat very little in the morning, I still thought that the spreads should have been more generous and refilled more often. How ironic that had they not upgraded us, we wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even have gone to the buffet breakfast!All in all, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° probably stay here again, but would skip the harassment that breakfast turned out to be. Oh, and I was going to write all these comments down onto the comment card, but when I had left the hotel I noticed that the guest comment card wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even pre-paid. I was about to go to the airport and had too much stuff to do to go hunt down a post office in all the rush, so I never did it. ","annotations":[]}
