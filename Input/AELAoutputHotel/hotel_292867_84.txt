{"text":"Satisfied with the CCP experience Our visit to the Caribe Club Princess was a 5 day, 4 night experience booked through my company (travel company) via Apple Vacations. I selected the VIP package based on the minimal amount of price difference between that and the standard room. I requested a king sized bed, and an upper level room, and got both with no problems. We were situated in 2311 with a wonderful ocean view. In our opinion, the VIP package was worth the extra money-- a great massage, internet (which we did not end up using), an hour of motorized watersports (took the boat excursion up and down the coast, circling the shipwreck and heading south past the hotels for a dip in the shallows), and of course the premium dinner. We ate at El Pescador and it was definitely worth it. I had a massive platter of fried lobster that was fantastic. I found that most of the positive reviews on this website held true. We had no issues with the maid service, our concierge Alex was great and very helpful, our Apple Rep. Tony was also great. We did two nights at the buffet for dinner, and one at the Italian restaurant. The food was serviceable enough for our tastes. What else can I say? The activities staff was nice and did not press you into anything you didn't want to do, and the two Jose's at the pool bar were very entertaining! All said we had a wonderful getaway, well worth it!
