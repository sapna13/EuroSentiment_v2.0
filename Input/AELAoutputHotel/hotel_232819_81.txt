{"text":"Nice hotel, great location We stayed at Hotel Preciados for a week in January. My husband was visiting on business, and I tagged along as a vacationer.We found the hotel to be clean and well lit. The desk staff was very helpful, and all spoke at least some English. Oscar checked us in and was the most helpful. We arrived very early, around 9am, and were able to check in right away. It is in a great location near Gran Via and Puerta Del Sol. Great shopping, restaurants, and bars nearby as well as the Metro station at Callao. The hotel offers free wireless internet access in the rooms, as well as two PCs in the basement guests can use to access the internet. We also very much liked the free mini bar. Our room was on the small side but the furniture was well positioned to allow for movement and the closet held all our belongings. We stayed on the 3rd floor, facing Calle Preciados, but had no troubles with street noise - double sets of doors on to the Juliet balconies and the mechanical shutters blocked out all noise (and light, which was nice for sleeping in!).A few minor negatives we noted. First, the towels in the bathroom smelled very strongly of vinegar. They appeared otherwise clean. Also, the room had a very slight musty smell. There was an air freshener in the bathroom that dispensed a minty spray every 20 minutes or so. Finally, the 1\/2 wall in the shower did not keep the water inside the shower, and we had a puddle on the bathroom floor after each shower. Generally the positives far outweighed the negatives.
