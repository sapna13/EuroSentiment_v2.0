{"text":"Loved this hotel! We chose this hotel for our Honeymoon, so our expectations were high. We booked using priceline, and got a great deal on air fare plus hotel. First of all, it was a snap to get to from Narita airport. You can take the airport limosine bus (for the same cost as taking the JR, without the hassle of luggage on the train) from the airport and it will drop you off directly at the Crowne Plaza Metropolitan. The staff was extremely courteous, spoke english well, and very helpful. I had originally booked a standard corner (a bit larger) economy room, but decided to upgrade to an executive king room, since this was such a special stay for us. I was able to do this by emailing them, they responded promptly, and let us pay for the upgrade upon check-in (only about $100 extra per night). The room was absolutely amazing! We had a king size bed, mini fridge (which they stocked with drinks everyday), safe, huge gorgeous bathroom, complimentary robes and slippers (brought fresh everyday), and 2 large windows with spectacular 24th story views of the sprawling city below. We were in love with this room! There was even a tray of fresh fruit waiting for us when we arrived, which was great for two tired jet-lagged newlyweds. These executive rooms were on the exclusive Metropolitan floor, which was accessible only by our room key cards. During our 8 day stay, we used the Ikebukuro station nearby to access the JR and subway, which allowed us to easily get to ALL the sites we wanted to see during our visit. The Ikebukuro station is a major hub, and is a stop of the big Yamanote line that encircles the city. We did not miss out on one thing, and had little trouble getting around, even when multiple transfers were necessary. We even made a day-trip to Kamakura (took about 1 hour on the JR) to see the great Buddha and Hase-dera temple, and had no problem whatsoever (except forgetting our umbrellas!). There are lots of restaurants around, plenty of varieties of food, and lots of shopping near the hotel. The Metropolitan across the street had a huge department store, and 2 floors of restaurants. Be sure to visit the Mos burger across the street from the rear entrance for a truly Japanese fast-food experience! We also found a great restaurant on the last day called Tapa, which was in the basement of a building on a nearby corner. I dont recommend breakfast at the hotel or anywhere, as the cost was high. There are 3 convenience stores nearby that have fresh fruit, pastries, canned coffee, and juice for a light breakfast in your room for cheap. Orange juice was put in our mini-fridge daily. We also picked up beer, bags of chips, rice cakes, sushi, and salads for late-night snacking. The convenience stores are: 7-11, am\/pm, Lawson, and FamilyMart. It is expensive enough eating out everyday for lunch and dinner, save your money on breakfast! I recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Tokyo. We had an exciting and adventurous Honeymoon, with plenty of relaxation time in the great room and awesome bathroom (extra deep tub and rain showerhead). It was convenient, the staff was wonderful, and Ikebukuro is an up-and-coming district with a plenty of restaurants and shopping, and a fun night life. Don't overlook this truly great hotel!
