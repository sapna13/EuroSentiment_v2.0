{"text":"Good But Not Great I went to NYC for the KIROV WAGNER RING CYCLE. Taking my wife and 14 year old son in tow; I decided to book the CASABLANCA HOTEL because of the great reviews in TRIP ADVISOR. Well....I wasn't that impressed. Now, I have stayed in at least 20 different hotels in THE BIG APPLE, my favorite city, and can't say that this is the best in the city. Sure the location is great; the service is good, for what it is. There are only a few people on hand to perform the services. Quoating from the movie CASABLANCA...YOU MUST REMEBER THIS!!! THIS IS NOT A FULL SERVICE HOTEL.!!!! It is a small hotel and not at all glamourous. We had a suite and still had no view; which I feel is very important to the overall ambiance of what makes a great hotel. We enjoyed the free breakfast and newspapers in the morning; and we liked having free WI-FI in our room. The suit was OK. Nothing to brag about. Nice shower though. The place was always clean. the front desk does everything in their power to help you in any way they could. There are 2 restaurants on both sides of the hotel; one a diner and the other Italian. Both were great. I tried to get a cab on night 4of the OPERA and couldn't. Maybe it was just the time, 5:30 P.M. but I was almost late. I had to hire one of those rick-shaw drivers on bikes to get me to LINC0LN CENTER on time. He kicked ass to get me there and I just made it to my seat in time. Everybody has their own idea of what a great hotel is. I have vacationed all around the world and know what GREAT is. As I have stated, this is a small hotel; and if you like a nice lobby, you won't get it here. If you like great room service..you won't get it here; wll I say that it is very limited and I say again that they do the best they can with the little staff they have. If you want ambiance...you won't find it here. If you want glitz and glamour...you won't find it here. The suit we stayed in was subjected to a lot of outside noise. I think there was some construction going on, but it didn't hender our sleep. I went down to check out the cheese and wine and thought it was a nice gesture. OK...the bottom line is this...if you like a small hotel with little or no service...then this is it. The location is great, problebly the best thing about the hotel. My wife says that the hotel was good not fair. She didn't like it that there was no ice machine; but could get ice if we called for it. She says that they were accomodating; but no view. She would liked to have had food service in the room. She thought the suite was nice. I had read and read the reviews on TRIP ADVISOR and booked because of the reviews. So I thought I would write this review to try to help others who might want to book this hotel. NUMBER 1 HOTEL? Not by a long shot!!! WORSE HOTEL ON TRIP ADVISORS list? Not by a long shot!!!!!!!!!!!
