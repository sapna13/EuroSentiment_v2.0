{"text":"Liked the Paradisus Punta Cana My husband and I divided our vacation to the Dominican Republic b\/t the Paradisus Punta Cana for the first four days and the Paradisus Palma Real for the last five (see our review over there- we preferred the Palma Real greatly). We had a nice check in\/ welcome drink and were taken to our room- we had a RS Ocean View room though we chose not to do RS. This was great, but WAY far from the main building. Our concierge was HORRIBLE, as was the whole foraging for dinner that took place. Nothing was ever available and for the first two nights we had to settle for room service in our room. Our concierge claimed he would take care of everything for our dinner reservations, not to worry- thank God we sensed he was a flake and we fought for our own reservations- of course found out that he hadn't done any of the reservations as we feared. If you choose to put faith in your concierge- get your dinner reservation IN WRITING. Our vacation took a turn for the better when we discovered the Gabi area. We paid for using that pool for the day and got our massages up there\/ ate lunch. SO much nicer than the actual resort- which I would call 'fine'. The pool is nice, not luxurious. The beach was beautiful but there was a sandstorm when we were there, and when that was over it just wasn't very convenient to move from the beach to the pool. We spent a lot of time walking around and that's just not relaxing. Our last two dinners were at Vento and that was something outstanding at the resort. It's less expensive than the Palma Real and I'm happy we went to this one first or it really would have been a letdown. I would pay the extra money and go there.
