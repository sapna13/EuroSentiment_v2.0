{"text":"Will not come back I'm staying here for a convention in Barcelo Convention Center which is adjacent to the hotel. I would never ever stay her again if not for the same reason.The hotel staff is not happy at all. They are very rude and never show a smile. They hate their job. At least that is what you get if you don't tip. BTW all-inclusive says tips included. Do not enforce that provision. You must tip if you want a smile.Nightly shows are very unprofesional. Not that I'm expecting a broadway performance, but have been to many properties alike and shows are far far better.There's good food, but the selection is not enough if you are looking for something healty or a kid's meals. Beverages take from 2 minutes to 30 minutes to arrive, you may be lucky... Or not. My wife also got a stomach-ache (read about this in another review). Got yogurth and veggies. Went to the farmacy for some pills. 10 pills of a basic stomach-ache drug that normally cost 3 USD were sold at 19 USD.This is not the only case. Forgot your deodorant? 2oz deodorant for 12USD. And the classic the farmacy is not associated with the hotel. Come on! They rent the space from you. You must enforce fair prices at your premises! Not wal-mart prices but double at most, not 7 to 10 times more expensive.We got a nice, clean room. Beach is great. Service does not exist. They do not care about guests. There's noone to complain about anything. Noone would listen. They just don't care.Will never come back.
