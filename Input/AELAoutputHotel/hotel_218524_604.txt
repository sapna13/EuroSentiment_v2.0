{"text":"The best all-inclusive we've found! My wife and I just returned from 10 days at Excellence Punta Cana and want to share our opinion. Bottom line, this is the best all-inclusive we have ever visited (we've been to six...not a lot, but this place is something special). Very romantic and luxurious. You can get the details about the property off the web site, but we want to give you our overall pluses and minuses.First, the positives:1) The facility (buildings, pools, architecture, layout, landscaping, etc) is stunning! An enormous lobby and adjoining areas with vaulted roofs and polished marble; spacious and luxurious rooms (we were in Garden view and were very pleased); a large theater for nightly entertainment, beautiful gardens and fountains, plenty of beachfront and poolside chairs, hammocks, beds and shades. The beach is endless and wonderful to walk. The nearest resorts are quite a distance away!2) The staff is immpeccably trained, very friendly and accommodating, and seems sincerely interested in your having a great time. On occasion there are language barriers (like trying to special-order something in one of the restaurants) but many staff have a great command of english. Even the groundskeepers and construction workers smile and greet you every time you pass by. I can't remember all the names, but several waiters were extremely friendly and delightful to talk with...And our thanks to Madeline at the Concierge desk...she helped make our Valentine's Day very special.3) The variety of restaurants provides something for every taste. We especially liked Chez Isabelle (french), Spice (asian) and The Grill (steakhouse) and ate twice at each. Toscana (italian) was very good...Barcelona and the Lobster House were disappointing and we never ate at Agave, the mexican restaurant. The food is well above average...don't expect The French Laundry or Daniel...this is the caribbean after all...but my wife and I were very happy with the quality of the food offered.4) The diversity of guests...Americans, Canadians, Brits, Germans, Russians, Dutch, French...and these are just the folks we met. We like the international feel of the resort.5) Premium liquor...we are gin drinkers, and had Bombay Saphire (our poison of choice), Beefeater, Tanqueray, and Gordon's to choose from. Chivas Regal scotch, Grand Marnier, Frangelico, Bailey's...as much as you want. And the tropical drinks are tasty and cold. Waiters take your order on the beach and around the pool...what could be sweeter?6) No kids...we love our grandkids, but getting away from screaming rugrats is important too...enough said.Now some negatives:1) While the beach is beautiful and well-appointed, the surf at the resort is rough and the current is strong! While we were there you were not allowed out past your waist...the lifeguards are very vigilant! The body surfers and boogie-borders loved it, but just standing in waist-deep water was a workout. Luckily there is a quiet and beautiful sheltered swimming area about 500 yards down the beach south of the resort (but no lifeguards). And the pools are fantastico.2) No brewed Decaf coffee...only instant decaf. So we drank high test for a week...we survived.3) Lots of smokers. At home I've gotten used to public areas being smoke-free. But between the Europeans, the American smokers, and the lure of Dominican cigars we often had to move around to avoid tobacco smoke. Luckily much of the resort is open air and the smoke quickly cleared.4) We are tennis players, and the tennis courts are shaky...right now they have open two clay courts (actually compressed shale with sand on top) and one hard court under renovation, but the pro says they are converting to two hard courts and one clay court. The pro, Rolando, is a very amiable guy, a good teacher, and does a very good job with a very limited facility. Court time is free, lessons are cheap, and Rolando will set you up with other guests with whom to play.I sure hope we don't sound too negative... these minuses in no way diminish the extremely positive regard we have for Excellence Punta Cana.Would we go back again?...IN A SECOND!Would we recommend it to friends and family?...already have!If you want a romantic, isolated, adults-only tropical experience with much better-than-average food and drink...this is a place to consider.
