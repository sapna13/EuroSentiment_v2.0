{"text":"Great Base We Stayed at the Miramar on a stop over to Mauritius and I had to drag my husband to Hong Kong screaming and kicking all the way I then had to drag him away, we loved it. This hotel was a fabulous base to see Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, we couldn't have chosen better for the price. The Lobby is beautiful and the restuarant clean. The breakfast would keeps us going for the day. Full English , continental through to my favourite dim-sum what a start. The rooms were very clean with coffee\/tea facilities. There is also a mini bar but as with all alchohol in Hong Kong its expensive. The staff were helpful and friendly. The main shopping streets are located all around this hotel and the Star ferry a ten minute walk down the road, the bus stops and underground are just outside also. The back street restuarants that surround this hotel are too many to count, we found some amazing places and never spent more than √ä√£¬¢20gb per evening meal. While there we experienced the best ever excursion to Sha Tin the race track, we where picked up locally and escorted to the track, a private box with all tickets, food, drink and guide included, it was absolutly fantastic and well recommended. We also jumped onto some of the many ferries that took you to tiny islands, some with no traffic, what a pleasure. I cannot really say enough about this holiday how exciting, invigorating and amazing it truly was. Go for it. ","annotations":[]}
