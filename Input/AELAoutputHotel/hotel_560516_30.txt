{"text":"wonderful vacation - great people We arrived at the airport which is lovely and tropical. It was a piece of cake! They take your pic's, pay the $10 Per person fee and get your luggage. It was a breeze. We took a cab to the resort which was set at $34 plus tip. We arrived at the LTI reception where we were greated by Fernando who took us to Cayena reception where we met Barbara. We received a welcome cocktail and were checked in. Barbara  Fernando speak excellent english. We were told that the Cayena is a private club (due to the timeshare people) and has private restaurant just for Cayena guests for breakfast  lunch (until 2:30) We met another couple from our plane also checking in and had lunch with them at EL Cano. The menu is excellent  they have a salad bar  breads also. There we met the crew of Bartender Antonio, waiter-Gotier, and manager\/waiter Pasqual. They are fantastic. All thru the week they were full of energy, always smiling, and couldn't do enough for you. It made you feel like family. The room was lovely (Room 116) It was the bottom floor corner unit with 2 double beds, a sitting area, a jaccuci tub and a corner sitting area, outside back deck and a grassy lawn area with an outrageous view of the beach and water. Unfortunately we were getting hit by the tropical storm NOEL so we couldn't really enjoy it for the 1st 4 days!! Finally Wednesday we had a break of sun. The dinners were at the main Buffett which had an OK variety, but I would much prefer to sit down at a restaurant  get served. My husband liked the Buffet though so it's a matter of preference. We went to the specialty restaurants -Seafood (which only had 1 item on the regular menu of fish) everything else was chicken or pork *unless you want to order off the other menu with a sur-charge. The Italian restaurant was good with many choices of Pizza and one Calzone which was good. This was low season so they only has one specialty restaurant open per night. We went to the show the first night but it wasn't too good. It was a bunch of guys from the audience dressed up lip singing to American female artists, but since most of the people were from Germany  Peru they didn't know the words and it was kinda silly. On Holloween they had the buffett restaurant decorated and the show was really good. They had a guy dressed as Michael Jackson  the crew did a dance routine to thriller among other songs like Rocky Horror. On the down side, we didn't have H OT water throughout our stay. We went to reception several times, but there must have been a problem in fixing it. We had to let the water run for 20 minutes to get some warm water if any  all the jaccuci's were cold (including the one a the spa??). Since it was raining and cool, it was hard to warm up. The room walls seem paper thin and you could pretty much hear everything. The Cayena  LTI grounds are beautiful  clean  kept up. There really weren't many bugs except for a few spiders, and little ants on the beach sand. They had a cleaning crew clean the sea grass daily that accumulated from the strong surf. We would recommend this resort for timeshare exchange  would definately go back. We met such nice peope, and the staff could not have been better (especially in EL Cano Restaurant)We will definately return.
