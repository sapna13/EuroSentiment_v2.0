{"text":"Fantastic Hotel This whole trip was a birthday gift for my boyfriend so I did do my research. The images online of the hotel looked fab so when i got there to say I was shocked was an understatement...The hotel is extremely impressive. The initial greeting from the staff on booking in was so polite and the hotel itself appeared very modern and clean. We stayed on the 3rd floor which was fine. Again, very very clean and well lit with lighting sensors so that you dont have to faff around looking for switches. The room was beautiful. It was absolutly fantastic and again so clean. Very modern. The staff in the bar \/ resturant were lovely. Greeted us everytime we entered and couldnt do enough for us. They went out of their way to make sure that we enjoyed our stay. Very Polite and really made an effort. we had breakfast at the hotel only which again, was fit for a king twice over... The hotel was located pretty central and unless your really idel and cant be bothered to absorb your surroundings then really walking to the main attractions like The Brandenburg gate should not be an issue. It probably took about 20-30 mins to walk Tiergarten and it was really pleasent along the way. Local cabs will stop for you at the hotel location - just thumb them - and they will tell you the places to go. All in all this hotel is finely located along the River Spree and is dead romantic in the bar on the evenings when it gets dark and there is little noise. The staff are great and we will definatly be going back there again.!!!!!!! ","annotations":[]}
