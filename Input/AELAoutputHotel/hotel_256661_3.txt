{"text":"Great location for a great price We stayed at the Travelodge Phillip St twice in July 08 and booked online through their website and got quite a good rate. The hotel is easy to find and located between two train stations (St James and Martin Plaza). I would recommend using Martin Plaza station if you have heavy luggage as they have escalators where as James St has lots of stairs). The hotel is part of the NSW Leagues Club and there is shared reception. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. The doorman for the Leagues club (Kiwi) was very helpful and assisted with our luggage, food and lifts. Being from a rival state (during State of Origin time in Sydney) everyone was in good humour and made us feel welcome. Both rooms was clean with a queen sized bed single lounge chair, free pay TV, small table and two seats. There was a small kitchenette with basic cutlery\/crockery, a microwave, kettle and bar fridge. The bathroom was reasonable with a walk in shower (good for accessibility).Our air-conditioning\/heating wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ working in our first room but was fine on our second stay. There was considerable construction noise on the Phillip St side hotel in a nearby office building which went all night (on a Friday). Our second room faced Elizabeth St and there were no problems with noise. Being a guest of the hotel, you had temporary membership and were able to access the club restaurants and bars. There was also a bottle shop downstairs which exited onto Elizabeth St. Drink and meal prices were very reasonable and the pub style meals were satisfying. Two computers with paid internet were available on level 6 near lifts and vending machine.
