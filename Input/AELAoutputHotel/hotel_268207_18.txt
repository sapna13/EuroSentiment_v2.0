{"text":"great for family vacation We had a great stay at this hotel when traveling with our 8 1\/2 and 5 year old. We had a room with 2 queen beds which was plenty big for us and the bedroom was closed off from the living area which meant when the kids went to bed, we could still stay up and hang out (and they could slip out into the living room in the AM to watch TV and not wake us up right away). The hotel had a great breakfast every morning--scrambled eggs, taco shells, potatoes, cheese, french toast, pancakes, cereal, oatmeal, etc. The indoor pool was small but just fine for our 2 kids every morning and no one besides us ever seemed to use it. We were able to park for free in a small lot right behind the hotel--we were told by the staff that we were parking at our own risk and were warned of a recent break-in back there but it's an extremely well-lit area, visible from the hotel rooms and we had no problems leaving our car there for the 5 days we were there. The location is about a 10 minute walk to the nearest T station (North Station) and getting around Boston was very easy from this stop. The water taxi was also only about a 10 minute walk from the hotel and took us right over to the aquarium. It's also about a 10 minute walk to the North End which made for lots of great Italian dinners and pastries. Oh, and there's a small playground area in Paul Revere Park which is across the highway from the hotel and on the way to the T station. It's a pretty scenic location too, located right on the Freedom Trail and the wharf with some really nice views of boats and a very cool bridge that is lit up at night which the kids really liked. All in all, we were very happy with our stay, although it was a little pricier than we usually spend on a hotel. But...I guess considering we were all able to comfortably live within one room, our breakfast was included, we had a pool available, and we ended up not having to pay the $30+\/night parking fees, it all worked out okay!
