{"text":"OK - but needs polishing Just returned from a week at the Grand Oasis. Stayed in one of the upgraded 'Master Jr. Suites' - really just a large room - in building 7. I believe this is the newest building. Good:Very nice room, good housekeeping service. If they were short on anything when making up the room, they would return with it later. Strange thing about the room is a little lack of privacy in the bathroom. The head was in a small cubicle with a frosted glass door like a shower. The shower is large, polished stone, and has a glass door. Both open on to the main room, so if one person uses the sink, you're a glass door away from the toilet. Not a major problem for us, but some might not care for it. Check-in and check-out was smooth and quick. The property is big enough, but not too big. Beach itself is clean with soft, white sand and calm clear waters. The weather was very warm, with afternoon rain most days, but plenty of sun earlier. Never swam in the main pool, although it looked nice and was large. The pool next to our building was very nice. Staff was helpful, and language wasn't a problem. (I know a smattering of Spanish, but you could get by without.)OK:Grounds are nice, but could use some cleaning and sprucing up. I thought it strange that the maids picked flowers from the grounds to put in the rooms. They would have looked better on the grounds! Food in buffet and theme restaurants was OK. We always found something to eat, but nothing that made us say, wow. The shops on the resort have mostly tourist merchandise - souvenirs, cigars, etc. - plus some snack food and HB products at the usual inflated prices.Poor:Service in the restaurants was inconsistent. One time you'd get immediate service, and the next you'd be asking for someone to bring water and take a drink order. There are shops on the beach adjacent to the resort. Supposedly this is because the beach is public. However, I didn't see any shops by the two resorts just north of ours. The vendors are constantly hawking their wares, even at the shops on the property. (Beach vendors aren't allowed on the property, but there are the time-share guys, cigar shop guys and a few others on the grounds.) It wears a little thin after the first day or so. We couldn't use our own phone cards. We bought a 20 min. card from the Apple rep. for $15 that worked. I think this is by design. Other calling methods are very expensive. I never got my ATT international cell phone to work. It detected two networks, but wouldn't connect.
