{"text":"First Trip to PR...definitely not the last I booked a last minute 4-day trip with my boyfriend; so, the rate was not at all unreasonable. When we arrived on a Thurs., we immediately found a white cab to take us to the hotel for about 10 or 11 USD. Since this was short a trip, our main concern was just to get a great tan! And just about every morning, we laid out at the Blue Flag beach El Escambron just a 2-5 minute walk away. It was absolutely gorgeous, but my bf did complain that it is a family beach and that man-made rocks blocked the waves. It never rained for more than 5 minutes. Anywho, the Normandie Hotel is very nice, but the evening reception is unfriendly\/unhelpful. My bf found that we got most of our useful info from the bellhops and the budget rent-a car agent across from the front desk. We were originally assigned to a 2nd floor room next to the N lounge, and I had requested a new floor but the receptionists threatened to charge an extra 40 bucks or so per night. Luckily when we tried the room key, it wasn't working and they gave us a room on the 5th floor, which had a great view of the ocean and the El Caribe Hilton next door. The room was cleaned every day by housekeeping. The room was comfortable, and more or less we had no complaints. Because of the proximity, we took the local bus to Old San Juan every day to eat and shop. The food was surprisingly expensive, but i guess they're catering to tourists after all. We did make it to Pamela's at Numero Uno guesthouse in Ocean Park for dinner, which was hands-down the BEST meal we had on the island. Another major highlight was a a tour with Eco-Action tours to Fajardo to swim with the glowing plankton. The tour guide, Peter, picked us up from the hotel for a 40 min ride to Fajardo. He and 2 others led a group of about 20 to the biobay. It was pretty stinky but the experience was well worth it. I would definitely recommend PR for some RR. Would I stay at the Normandie again? Maybe. It is very close to Old San Juan and a short cab ride away from New San Juan. The only thing was that not much is around there but the beach. The food in the hotel was generally overpriced with small portions, but we did like the night server at the Cafe, who was super nice and helpful but he was the only staff there who was taking care of the cafe and room service; so service tended to be slow. All in all an enjoyable stay but much too short!!!
