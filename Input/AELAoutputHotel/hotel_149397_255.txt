{"text":"what you pay is what you get Our family of 6 (kids ages 16, 14, 12 and 7) vacationed 6\/6-6\/13 at Bavaro Princess. The most recent reviews really seem to accurately assess BP. So, I will just try to hit on some of the topics we had concerns about before we went. We paid less to stay here than other all inclusives and I would say we got our moneys worth. The resort is beautful, well manicured with a wonderful beach( plenty of shaded huts). Yes, it is huge but the tram shuttle is convenient and easy to use. The rooms are large(no problems with odors or bugs) and the maid service was fine. Definite water pressure problem but really no big deal. There is a sewer odor by buildings 20-21 so I would avoid them. The food was okay, (I am blessed with children who are not fussy eaters) so we could always find something to eat, some days were just harder than others and there was always a pasta bar at dinner and lunch. Lets face it if you are looking for exceptional food don't stay at an all-inclusive. Trust me nobody starved. Ala carte restaurants were average and a nice change of pace from the buffet, but service was bad(didn't get our order entirely correct at any one restaurant). The one buffet we really didn't care for was Dominican night(thursday), but as mentioned didn't have a problem finding something to eat. My only real complaint would be the service at the pool\/swim up bar. Pretty ridiculous to only have one bartender for a 15 stool swim up bar. We gave him a nice tip the first day but really didn't get very good service. Other workers(waiters, maids, maintenance....) were polite and helpful. Night time shows nothing exciting and not much else to do at night except for lobby bar(which had the best drinks) Outside the resort forget about shopping, I'm use to bargaining in Mexico but these people were uncomfortably pushy and rude. We just turned around and went back to the resort. So, if you're looking for a reasonably priced vacation at a beautiful laid back resort with average service and food and not a big night life Bavaro Princess will suit your needs.
