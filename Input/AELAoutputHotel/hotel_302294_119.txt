{"text":"Disappointing One of the most disappointing hotel stays we have had for years. Having read the reviews, we had high expectations of this hotel, but were sorely disappointed.Booking through hotel site √à√\u2020\u2022?Major hassles. At some stage used the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ on-line email facility. Received a reply from them only AFTER our 2nd day there! Eventually wrote to an √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂\u2020nappropriate√à√\u2020\u2022?email address that I found on the site and received a reply and booking.Reception √à√\u2020\u2022?physically what we would describe as a Sixties horror √à√\u2020\u2022?over the top and cold. (Know this is a personal like\/dislike) On check in, NONE of the things that we requested on the online √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂?isitors profile√à√\u2020\u2022?that they require you to complete when booking, seemed to have made it to reception. We were allocated a room with everything but what we requested. Granted it was sorted out, but why bother with completing this form if noboby pays any attention to it anyway. Room √à√\u2020\u2022?When you pay US$200 plus for a STANDARD room, you would in most places in the world expect to walk in and have some √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂?ow√à√\u2020\u2022?factor. The only wow we had was one of disappointment. The room is a reasonable size, but it is basically stock standard. As stated in other postings, the balconies do not allow for any √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Üitting outside with a drink and enjoying the view√à√\u2020\u2022? Apart from the high concrete balcony, there is no furniture on the balcony. It is inexusable that in a hotel of that class there is no furniture on the balcony.Bathrooms √à√\u2020\u2022?Separate bath, shower and toilet, but small Staff √à√\u2020\u2022?Nothing to complain about, but not what will be remembered as warm and friendlyFurnishing - Beds were comfortable, pillows were not. The rest is so so for a hotel of this class.Accessability to restaurants and shopping √à√\u2020\u2022?right next to a few big malls, else Orchard Road, Clarke Quay, etc easily accesible by taxi (at present the only viable option)Prices - we found the price of food and beverage in the hotel quite expensive. As stated in previous postings, the mini bar is not well stocked, so you either buy from a nearby supermarket or pay the room service prices with all the added charges.Business services √à√\u2020\u2022?Considering that Singapore is such an IT centre and the price of internet elsewhere, it is ridiculous what the hotel charges. Did not use other services, so can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ commentGeneral √à√\u2020\u2022?They are renovating the hotel and we had the cables running past our balcony which limited our view and privacy. At the very least, these rooms should have gone at a heavily discounted rate. Know this is Singapore and hotels are expensive, but stayed in other √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√∂xpensive√à√\u2020\u2022?cities where we had much, much better value for money. ","annotations":[]}
