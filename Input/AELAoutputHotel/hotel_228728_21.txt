{"text":"Almost a 5 Star This is a really nice hotel in a great location. The room was small and modern, but incredibly well designed and very attractive. The bathroom had what was by far the best shower I have ever encountered in a Paris hotel in over 30 visits. The staff was universally welcoming and competent. There are many nice touches like bowls of candy at reception and pitchers of cold water in the lobby. They are clearly trying hard to do a good job. I would rate it 5 star except for two things which are becoming pet peeves of mine: exorbitant wifi charges and exorbitant minibar prices. A 500 ml bottle of Fiji water will set you back $12.63 plus tax. This is about 14 times the RETAIL price in the US which is simply a rip-off. You should not have to pay so much or perhaps anything for a decent glass of water in your room. The same goes for wifi at about $24.00 a day which is close to my MONTHLY bill at home in the US. It should be part of the room cost. it is a utility like running water and electricity. Fortunately, Many hotels are starting to provide wifi and drinking water at no extra charge. Curiously, this policy is still far more common at the low end than in luxury hotels which seem to nickel and dime you far more. I hope that the Renaissance Paris Vendome sees the light and joins this trend. When it does, it will be a five star hotel in my book.
