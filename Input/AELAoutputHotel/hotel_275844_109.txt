{"text":"Great place to stay. We have just had the pleasure of a stay at Hotel Colomba in Florence, Italy. This hotel is family run, small and friendly. The service is marvellous, nothing is too much trouble for the Italian\/Australian who runs this establishment. The hotel is situated at 21 Via Cavour, second floor (there is an elevator). Via Cavour is a busy street, but inside your hotel room you hear no noise. It is conveniently located to museums and galleries such as Academia (Michelangelo√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ David), Uffizi, Palazzo Pitti, Bargello Museum (in one room, four Michelangelo sculptures, many sculptures by Cellini, and upstairs, Donatello, Ghiberti and many others). The Duomo is about five minutes walk in one direction, with Piazza San Marco about the same distance in the other direction. Ponte Vecchio is a ten minute walk from the hotel.Our hotel room was spacious, comfortable, clean, well appointed, with an individual air conditioning unit that you set to your own requirements. Beds were comfortable and the bathroom shower had a powerful flow of water, this we found to be quite unusual in Italy. There is free internet usage, with access to a computer in a common area. If you have your own laptop you can pick up WIFI in your room at no cost to you. This was an incredible advantage for us.There is an excellent buffet breakfast included in the cost of your room, juice, cereals, yoghurt, bread rolls, pastries, prosciutto, cheese, eggs, fresh fruit, jams etc. Great coffee, made to order. This hotel is outstanding value.
