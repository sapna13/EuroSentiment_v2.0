{"text":"Stay away We stayed at Natura Park from Dec 23rd till Jan 2nd. This was our first, and probably the last experience with all-inclusive as I've realized that I don't like this idea whatsoever - staff is not motivated to try harder, you get the same food, etc. But anyway,speaking about Natura Park, there were two good things out there: the nature - the park, birds that were fun, ocean, snorkeling, etc. and ... the doctor who treated me for food poisoning - he was helpful and nice. So let me tell you something about the food first! The buffet was a joke, full of strange meals that did neither taste nor smell good. The tomatoes were always green (no kidding, I took a picture which I'll post later), fruit selection was poor, coffee machines didn't work properly and frying pans were never cleaned between two orders. I played it safe and tried to eat only familiar food but it didn't save me. On the 4th day I got fever and on the 5th I developed severe stomach cramps that made me scream. My husband, terrified, brought a doctor to our room and the doctor gave me an injection and some pills including antibiotics that I had to take for 5 days afterwards. For a couple of days I was so medicated and weak that I didn't go anywhere. Our medical bill came to $500 (thanks God we bought the insurance!!!) Then I started to venture to the beach and the buffet again. Just imagine how it feels to eat at the same place that have just poisoned you! I decided to stick to plain pasta with ketchup, bread, eggs, bananas and bottled water. That was mostly my diet for the rest of our vacation. Speaking about the Christmas dinner, I have nothing to add to hmnjacques's review. That was the most miserable dinner I've ever had. New Year's Eve dinner was somewhat better though - meals looked better and were served faster.Their so called a la carte restaurants were horrible as well, the only one that I liked was the sea food place.The room where we stayed definitely needed serious renovation. The air conditioning was having its own life - sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't. We asked them to fix it three times and nothing changed. Sometimes they would not change our towels, even though I learnt how to say towel in Spanish - maid did not understand English - and kept asking specifically for towels. They always nod yes and then nothing happens. Also, people are very lazy and it's nearly impossible to get things done fastThe tours - I found them overpriced, the people there are very money hungry and they view guests as some cash cows or something - they would ask $5-$8 dollars for a picture with a parakeet, for example. 30 minutes of massage will cost you $55, 5 minutes ride on a boat to a coral riff - $17, three hours snorkeling excursion (Marinarium) - $70 per person, 2 hours horseback riding (which turned out to be 1 hour and 15 minutes) - $40.Anyway, we tried to get the best out of it, and the beach and the sea is still beautiful, but never ever, under any circumstances, will I go back to Natura Park or even Dominican Republic.
