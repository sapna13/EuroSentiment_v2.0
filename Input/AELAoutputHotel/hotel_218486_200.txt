{"text":"wonderful vacation!! Well Folks, after viewing so many negative reviews prior to my trip, i was nervous as all heck!! But my trip was better than anyone could have expected.  Check In: Fast, and on time ! we had to wait all of 6 mins. and we took advantage of that every second, while waiting at the cute lobby bar. Rooms:  This was the only negative, not because the rooms were ugly or anything, but because me and my best friend( who was my partner in crime the whole week) were taken to a room with no sheets, and no working light. That wasnt gonna fly with me! so we asked our guy (Elliot) who drove us to this room, to get us something else. Atleast a room with some sheets!! He made a phone call, and before we knew it, he was taking us to the Elite club!! thats V.I.P folks!  Food:  The Food was nice. Dont be afraid of gettin sick, if you take care of yourself and use good judgment, youl'l be fine. Eat your heart out, you'r gonna be on vacation!!! lots of meat for you meat eaters, and tons of veggies, and fruit for anyone on the eating light side. they even have a pizza bar open late for all the night owls. Bars\\Clubs\\ Entertainment: Now this is one of the best features of this resort. Tons of bars, if one closes down for the night, you just hop 10 feet to the next bar. the drinks were on the weak side, but we decided to do shots and other fun, strong drinks! its not a party resort by any means, but if you know how to have fun, you will be just fine. 3 pools, and they do close early. 7: o clock.  They had Shows and Fun everynight of the week! the animators are lots of fun during the day and at night. there is also a disco club for anyone who want to dance the night away! Police:  They are every where 24 hours of the day. i could not have felt any more safehere! They even protect the beach during the night, incase you want to take a late night walk on the beach. Beach:  Beautiful. Soft white sand, Tall palm trees. The Seaweed staff do a good job of cleaning everyday. The water is warm, and the weather is humid. not too hot, and of couse not chilly. Pack many T shirts and shorts. you wont need pants, and at night a nice linen shirt works wonders in the humid, windy night breeze Excursions:; We did the Santa Domingo trip. one fulll day of sightseeing. its worth every penny. You shop till you drop, Visit a old cave, explore the Christopher Columbus house, Take in the sights of an old cathedral, AND still have time to grab a bite to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe! 60$ We also did the horse back riding excursion for my 22 birthday! so nice and relaxing. 30 $  Staff:  They are all so kind, so helpfull, and enjoy being there. always throw a smile, and a how are you today, and they will go out of their way to assist you with anything. Guest:  Well i have to tell you the truth... alot of the guest were rude, dont like to smile and look like they are unhappy. I was having such a good time i naturally made friends with all of the fun folks. 60% European, 20% cuban\/latino, 17% italian\/ german\/ and American. 3% african american. And thats very accurate. lots of newly weds, tons of family vacationers, and a wide range of young and old single daters.  to sum things up, it was a week of relaxation, Laughter and fun, an all around good time had by all!
