{"text":"Be firm with the front desk staff I stayed at the Intercontinental Dallas for two nights in May for a large business conference. My room was reserved at the conference rate of $130 per night and I reserved about six weeks in advance. When I arrived just before 9pm, the front desk clerk rudely told me that despite the confirmation for a non-smoking room that I was holding in my hand, they only had smoking rooms remaining. I have severe allergies and asthma and stated that this was unacceptable. The employee let out an annoyed sigh and stomped off, returning about ten minutes later to proclaim that she would upgrade me to a non-smoking king bedroom suite for free. This was said as if she was doing me a HUGE favor... providing me with the nonsmoking room I had reserved was apparently going way above and beyond the call of duty.The room I was given was fine. Certainly not 5-star (and seemed even worse since I had stayed at a lovely Sofitel property just the week before), but it was clean. However there were a few concerns: the cleaning staff will not replace half-used or even mostly-used toiletries if you are the beneficiary of a complimentary upgrade and the turndown service will not occur for this same reason. In fact, you are treated as a second class citizen by all the hotel staff. Finally, if attending a conference I suggest dressing in layers as best you can in business attire. Some of the rooms were boiling hot while others were freezing. The food is mediocre at best and the waitstaff do not speak English. If you don't want your salad doused with goopy mystery dressing you must guard it as they will grab it and pour it on without even asking if you want it.
