{"text":"Not Perfect, but they try real hard Travelling to Honkers with my business partner, we were there for a conference and a little RR. The hotel limo picked us up as requested after a short wait on arrival at the airport. The limo was a late model Benz with a courteous driver who supplied us with nice classical music on route to the hotel. Well worth the money at $70 Australian compared with $50 for a red cab.Reception was fast and friendly. Taken to our room and our bags were already there. If you can afford it, take the Club package which includes a great breakfast in the morning, afternoon tea and cocktails and canapes from 1800 to 2030. Open bar and they serve Verve Cliquot as their house pour. They allow children in there also which is ok (Im a dad myself) but they should have a minimum age as some mornings the little angels were just too loud for me.Renovations happening on the 17th and 18th floor woke us next morning. Leaking pipe in our room so our carpet got soaked, toilets would not flush for 5 or 6 hours because of renovations. We had a bit of a word with our Club lounge representative who arranged for a suite upgrade at no charge the next day. We had to forego our Harbour view, but got a huge room with a city view.The staff were all really friendly without being over bearing.Tiffany's bar was a bit lame as the band and music selection was a bit corny for us. Too much Celine Dion! The pool is on the roof and it's a bit small but it serves the purpose and the gymnasium has up to date facilities with free weights also.The rest of our experience was excellent. The hotel is central and close to all facilities including train, ferry, duty free, restaurants and a cool bar called Sticky Fingers, with a really happening band.Just watch out for the Working Girls there.I would definately stay at the Grand Stanford again and commend them on their staff's service and commitment.
