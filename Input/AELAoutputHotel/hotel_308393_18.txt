{"text":"Excellent All-round We stayed for just one night at the Miramar in October 2007 on our way from the UK to Australia. We had a 3 year old with us and would definitley recommend this hotel for a short stay like ours.The staff were very courteous and the room we had (just a standard double) well appointed. Love the bathrobes and little slippers - a nice touch in a hotel which only cost us √ä√£¬¢60 for the night for the 3 of us, through our travel agent. The only thing is the baths are a bit small (as per most Asian hotels) however this really isn't a problem as the shower was very good. Very clean room and a rollaway bed provided for my daughter and our bed was a King size. This did make the room a little tight for space, but for one night it was fine.We ate both dinner and breakfast in the hotel restaurant. There is plenty of local food as well as a few Western dishes and a few Italian dishes like spaghetti bolognese, which was great for my daughter. They were very flexible and brought her a half portion and charged accordingly. We had local food which was prepared quickly, tasted good and was beautifully presented. Breakfast also offers plenty of choice, with a chef making omlettes up for you with your choice of filling as well as local dishes. The waiting staff were really helpful, attentive and spoke good English as well as paying my daughter lots of attention.We also had a few cocktails in the bar when we arrived, which is great when the heat gets too much, or you can sit outside. Be aware that during happy hour when you finish you drink they just bring you another one all the time, so you do end up drinking loads! Probably just as well in that humidity though!We highly recommend flying with Singapore airlines because the little yellow SIA bus stops right outside. It takes you all around the City and to Orchard Road, etc. The bus also sells water bottles for a really cheap price as well. You get on the bus for a discounted price if you show your airline boarding cards. We didn't find the hotel too far out at all, and provides a nice walk to Clarke Quay.Would definiltey recommend this hotel for a short break.
