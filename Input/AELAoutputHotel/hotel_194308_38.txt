{"text":"Fantastic boutique hotel in best area This was a wonderful hotel in every way. The staff was so acccommodating, and the hotel had 50% American tourists, not sure if that is a positive or a negative! The breakfast was amazing and served until 11:30 a.m. eggs, 5 breads, pastries, cheeses, French yogurts, fruits, cooked spinach, etc. This was a big plus for us in the a.m. There is a beautiful garden, that is covered in bad weather, where we had drinks before going out in the evening. The bar at Cafe Laurent was so lovely and comfortable, beautiful jazz music until midnight. A nice nightcap after our late nights in Paris. The manager, Flavien and bartender Arnod were wonderful and everyone speaks English good enough. The French appreciate it if you TRY to speak French, you are in France! The rooms were very comfortable, nice size bathroom for European standards, comfy bed, great treats in the room, flat screen tv (boring CNN, don't bother). dvd rentals if you are that boring and want to watch a movie in your room. The location is amazing. We walked everywhere. No need for a taxi. Our favorite restaurant is on the side street, which we could see from our room window on Rue Christine, called CHEZ FERNAND, serving traditional French cuisine, not pricey, and wonderful service. The French are very polite and everyone offers to help you in the cafes, stores, and hotels. We are New Yorkers, and a bit fussy, this place was a lot of bang for the buck. We loved it and can't wait to go back. What a beautiful city in every way, we highly recommend this lovely hotel, especially for American tourists who are not looking for an American high rise chain hotel. Fabulous place! Thank you!
