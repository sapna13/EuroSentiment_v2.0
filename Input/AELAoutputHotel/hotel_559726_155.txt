{"text":"Great hotel in Honolulu for the price!! I stayed at the Aqua Palms in January of this year. This is hotel is in a perfect location. It is right across the street from the Hilton Hotel (which has everything, shops, restaurants...) The beach is within walking distance as well! The room was not bad at all. I had a king size bed and a pull out couch. There was a coffee machine, a fridge and microwave. There was a hair dryer and little shampoo, conditioner and lotions. The bathroom was small and could barely close the door if you are in there, but it was clean ( which was very important to me) The bed and the linens were soft, but the pillows seemed like they were over stuffed. I prefer to have flatter pillow when I sleep. They provide 2 robes as well. There is an Ironing board and iron in the room. internet connection was complimentary which was great!! There is washers and dryers also available in the hotel. Complimentary breakfast was given every morning in the pool area ( but it only consist of bananas, oranges, muffins, coffee and juice ). Parking on the other hand was expensive...18 dollars a day! ALso the elevators took forever! There were 3 elevators and only 2 worked while I was there.Other than the parking and the elevators, I would recommend this hotel if you want to visit Honolulu.  I will probably not go back to Oahu because it just didn't feel like island life to me. It was sooo busy, I felt like i was back home in a city and traffic is no joke in Honolulu. aarrgg...i hated the traffic in there!Also go to the seafood buffett that is only 1 block down (when walk out of the hotel make a left). It is within walking distance and the food is FANTASTIC!! You have to eat there at least once. It's pricey but so worth it.
