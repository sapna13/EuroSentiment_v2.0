{"text":"Excellent Service I've just return from a week stay at the Excellence Punta Cana. I would rate the resort itself as in above average, as the rooms and food were between 3 1\/2 to 4 stars. The thing that makes this resort a 5 star in my opinion is the service. I cannot say enough about the service. The genuine care and kindness that the hostess at the main  excellence club showed was impeccable (Kary, Fiordaliza Leticia, Jackeline and Franklin). If you stay at this resort you will have a great stay, as I stated the service in great. I could go on and on about the people above and other within the entertainment group (Ines, Rey and Mariel), and other throughout the resorts; but the ones above made this vacation one of best. I will continue to visit the resort is the property continues to employee such people as noted above. I would also like to say a special thanks to Santos from the excellence club lounge. So, if you are looking for a great place to stay where not only the place itself is above average, but the people that they employee puts the resort in a class by itself√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√±ick the excellence. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe already started looking into dates for my next visit. Also as a note...the food (is not to say that the food was bad), it just that the room service a few other menu items could stand some improvements...and the rooms I would guess normal wear and tear...and the bedding can be improved\/upgraded.
