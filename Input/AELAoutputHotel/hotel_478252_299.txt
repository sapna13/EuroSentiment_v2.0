{"text":"Beautiful but disappointing overall Just spent a week there and I am coming back thinking that one week was definitely enough. Let's start with was is great with the Bahia Principe. This is a big resort with nearly 2000 rooms in total and spread over a very large area (which for some is not a positive) with beautiful gardens, architecture, bars (particular the one in the Ambar section), pools and beach and probably 20 restaurants in total (I did not actually count them but for sure there is a lot of restaurants). It is worth noting that the resort is actually multiple resorts. Book at the Ambar if you are going there as a couple as it is for adults only and it offers slightly more upscale buffet.Now with the less than positive: the food is really not outstanding. While there is grat diversity with the restaurants, in reality there is little since most of the food taste the same. Actually, the a-la-carte restaurants are just not good for most. Secondly, the service in the restaurants and at the hotel in general is pretty bad. Finally, there is little do to outside of the resort (which is true for all of th resorts in Punta Cana and not something related to this resort). Finally, the rooms are very humid. I suspect this is due to the limited exchange of air in the rooms but the rooms (actually, the bed) smell rotten as a result. This is rather unpleasant. If you go there during the warmer months were air-conditioning is used more heavily, this problem is less likely to be as bad as it was for us. Also, try select an upper-floor room which is inherently be dryer.Therefore, if you like good food in your vacation, avoid this hotel.If you like to relax, spent time at the bars or you are with kids or do not care about food or service, this is a good option.As for us, we will definitely not go back.
