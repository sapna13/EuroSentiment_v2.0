{"text":"Fabulous stay We stayed at the degli Orafi during our honeymoon in November and had a wonderful stay. The hotel was placed in a great position to see Florence with the Ponte Vecchio less than 100m away and the Uffizi next door. From the hotels roof terrace bar you can see the Duomo and Ponte Vecchio and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a really romantic place to have a quiet drink before going out for the evening.Upon arrival we were greeted with congratulations by the concierge and upgraded to a two tier room with sofas, very large bathroom, upstairs bedroom etc and a bottle of champagne. A fantastic welcome! We had travelled from Rome to Florence and the city did not disappoint. The food and wine in Tuscany was so different and seemed to be up a notch. They really do appreciate dining and make a massive effort. The hotel booked us into a restaurant on our first night and the food was amazing even though we were sneered at for ordering white wine.The city is beautiful and you can easily spend the days in and out of the coffee bars sampling the pastries and hot chocolate before popping into one of the sights or doing some shopping. Everything is close and its worth taking a 30 min walk across the river and up the hill to get fantastic views.On our third day we went on a Chianti Classico wine tour that we had booked prior to departing on the net with Tuscan-wine-tours and had an amazing day with Rebecca the guide, We were the only ones on our group tour as we were out of season so had her all to ourselves and after a stop at a village about 50km out of Florence we were taken to a vineyard to sample their produce and learn about wine making and tasting. For lunch we were taken to a small family owned farm and had a fabulous 3 course homecooked meal in the kitchen next to a fire with 2 bottles of wine. It was one of the best days we have spent together and Rebecca was an amazing guide. We would recommend it to anyone.
