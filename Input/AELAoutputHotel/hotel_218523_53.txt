{"text":"Great Resort poor hotel Nice resort but hotel old and not so good had a good time and staff friendly and do their best for you but there is defenetly a problem.Better to stay at other hotels in the group if you speak english as most of this hotel entertainement etc done in Spanish and a little poor.Hard to fathom what the helll is going on in the shows.They tend to cater for their own peopleand forget if you spaek english and little Spanish gets a bit boring.Had a good time mind but evenings not a lot of choice as you are stuck for choice.Hotel i would say poor food poor very little choice but if you book the other special nights Italian steak resturants etc its ok but places limited.Bit like being stuck in a Spanish hotel with no choice of meals same every day and night.Meatballs Pork and Pitza god it gets boring.Location fantastic bars good but again indoors trips graet (GLAD TO GET OUT) Go speedboating monster truck really good see the locals loved it but to be honest enjoyed the holiday but would not stay here again a week would be good two weeks same old thing.Going to try Miami next time as you need to be able to get out and about as complex very restricted but if you want to spand two weeks in the same compond its ok just not for us.Think this is a fair reflection on a very old tired hotel would be just as good in Spain in fact thought a few times we were there.
