{"text":"Fantastic start to our honeymoon Hmm√à√\u2020\u2022?I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been reading some of the reviews posted about the Intecontinental on this site and I must admit I find some of them a little strange. I know its √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëifferent strokes for different folks√à√\u2020\u2022?n√à√\u2020\u2022?all, but come on! One star? Worst hotel in Bali? Judging by some of the more decrepit ones I saw in Kuta some people are being a little picky.Personally, I had a great time at the Intercontinental Jimbaran Bay. We were made to feel like honored guests from the first moment of our arrival (dig the whole ringing the gong thing), registration was quick and our welcome cocktail was very tasty. And of course, the best news, they had upgraded my wife and I from a standard room in the deluxe Singaraja Wing to a suite! Definitely a plus for our honeymoon.The suite was certainly one of the most pleasant rooms I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in in any hotel. Large, comfortable and airy, and equipped with two TVs √à√\u2020\u2022?a large on in the living room area and a smaller one in the bedroom. The furniture and decoration were all fine, and the bathroom was certainly up to scratch (very important to my wife). Coming from Japan, where even rooms in top-name five star hotels can be tiny, we felt like royalty. The rest of the hotel was up to the same standard. Impressive, but still comfortable lobby, beautifully maintained grounds and gardens, lots of water features and seven swimming pools. Okay, some of the pools are really nothing more than shallow √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°un√à√\u2020\u2022?kids pools, but they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e imaginatively designed and all feel very different from each other. The main one that you see pictured in all the brochures has a swim-up bar and a great view of the beach and Indian Ocean.Oh, did I mention the beach? This was the reason I booked this hotel, and it was most definitely the high point of our stay here. The stretch of beach outside the Intercontinental was just perfect for us. Clean, flat, golden sands√à√\u2020\u2022?and great for swimming. At high tide you get some pretty good waves (but nothing too scary) and you yes, you can even go swimming at low tide. An evening swim with the sun setting over the bay is a magical experience, let me assure you. If you want to grab a bale overlooking the bay we discovered that they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ usually all get √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªeserved√à√\u2020\u2022?until about nine thirty-ish, so don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel under pressure to get up too early (although this was at the start of the off-season). Some other reviewers have complained about the cost of the food at the Intercontinental, but then when has food at any five star hotel been cheap? Yes it was more expensive than eating out, but cheaper than some of the other hotels (Four Seasons, etc). The meals we ate during our stay were all up to a high standard, and special mention must be made of the great breakfasts my wife enjoyed everyday at the Bella Singaraja Restaurant.The staff were all very friendly, and, if anything too attentive! One thing that I really liked was how when you return to the hotel by taxi the staff at the front entrance usually quiz the driver about where you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe come from and how much the charge is in order to make sure they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not ripping you off. Tip: always make the drivers switch the meter on √à√\u2020\u2022?their √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºpecial√à√\u2020\u2022?charter prices are always more expensive, even if you factor in waiting times at restaurants, temples etc.  We stayed for five days before moving up to Ubud, which was just about long enough. Jimbaran is a great place for just lazing around by the pool\/beach and relaxing, which was definitely something my wife and I both needed! It was value for money too as we booked it at the bargain price of $164 a night after some searching around over the internet.
