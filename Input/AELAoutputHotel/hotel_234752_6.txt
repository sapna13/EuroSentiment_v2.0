{"text":"The most atrocious experience I had Cons: - Reading great things about this hotel, I booked it and I was terribly dissappointed at how it turned out to be. - Deluxe and premier rooms have no view at all. They will either have a window in front of you or a concrete wall.- The tables, desk and phone were dusty, and not cleaned in advance.- The bathroom floor got all wet and called customer service to come in as quickly as possible, told them myself. Receptionist called me 2 hours later to tell me that they did not knock on my door because I had the private sign. Take into account that a first customer service came in the room to see the problem and suggested to call someone else to solve it. Of course he did knock in the door regardless of the sign.- The TV had terrible reception and noise every 5 seconds. - There is no complimentary drinks or food in the minibar. Everything has to be paid at checkout, even a cookie is 5 dollars. - To request some bathroom appliances they charge you more than 6 dollars per request. - Parking is 38 dollars, not including taxes, per night. And they don't tell you where the car is parked or let you go see the car. Parking fees are not specified when booking accomodations in this hotel. - The location of the hotel is not at all good or convenient. I read more than 50 reviews relating to the location of the hotel being so good, and found out that it wasn't at all. Everything is far away. - The hotel charges for its business center. - Your booking doesn't include complimentary breakfast, taking into account that it charges no less than 200 dollars a night. - The design is terrible, there are long tall curtains everywhere that cover what it's supposed to be a nice wall design, or maybe a picture.- The breakfast menu will not cost less than 20 dollars for one person and that doesn't include what is usually requested.- The less expensive dinner menu will be the same for twice what a regular dinner will cost you at a regular restaurant like Chilys or Bertuccis. - They charge 10 dollars for a map. A map which is free about 10 blocks from the hotel in a city hall area. - The only thing a got from this place is how they want to squeeze more dollars. The taxed 80 cents for a coca cola I drank one night. Also, the first thing they ask is when will your dinner reservations be, of course, the cheapest dinner plate will run you over 40 dollars per person!.- I upgraded my room and at 7 or 8 am heard a lot of noise on the 12th floor. - There is only 1 bathrobe for use. The rest, even socks, are IN the room, but for sale only.Terrible hotel, I've stayed over 100 hotels in different countries and the US, this has been the worse. But why the worse? basically because you pay as a luxury hotel and expect the best. Hotwire ranks this place as a 4.5 star hotel. I certainly will give it a 3 like Ramada or Holiday Inn. My upfront suggestion to a couple, young people and everybody that has a sense of reality, do not spend time or money in the Nine Zero Hotel in Boston. Give your money to charity and you will feel much better. That's what I did after I came home.
