{"text":"Exceeded my high expectations! My husband and I visited Hong Kong for a baby moon the first weekend of June and our stay at the Kowloon Shangri-La was wonderful.As soon as we arrived and barely gotten out of our car ,2 hotel employees greeted us and welcomed us to the hotel. It was as if they knew we were coming. It was a very nice touch that made us feel specialWe upgraded to a harbor view room which was not cheap. It works out to about $100 U.S. dollars extra a night. We were glad we did upgrade though. The view was wonderful to come home to and wake up to each day. The room was very modern and clean. The bed was very comfortable. The food at the buffet restuarant was very good. The concierge desk was extremely helpful. They got to know my husband and I well and were very patient with all of our questions. The only issue we had with the hotel was during check out. We paid for our rooms through a package and they tried to charge us again for them. We aren't quite sure if this was an accident or not. Just be sure to look over your bill closely. Hong Kong Tips:Tours- We took a city tour the first day and it was helpful. The guide gave helpful information about getting around. Safety tips, food tips, etc. The tour itself wasn't all that great though. If we could have had a sit down with just the tour guide that would have been ideal. So don't bother with the tours. They limit you in regards to time. You might get somewhere and be bored and are stuck until the tour moves on or somewhere great and have to leave to soon. Restaurants:Aqua is an absolute must! It's on the 59th floor and the view is amazing. It's very trendy and the decor is really cool. The food is excellent. It's a mixute of italian and seafood. The prices were pleasantly lower than expected. Museum of Art: Spend your time doing something else. The museum was very nice but the art is quite boring. I come from a family of artists and enjoy going to museums but the Hong Kong one was not great. Shopping:If you live in the Philippines like we do, the night market and other souvenier or knock off markets are no different than those in Greenhills. Except the prices are higher. If you require full fledge designer fashion or accessories, Hong Kong is the place to go. I lost count of how many Luis Vuitton stores I saw.
