{"text":"Great time, great place! I cannot believe some of the comments made about this place, but maybe it made my stay that much more wonderful because we had decided to see for ourselves before passing judgement.Room: We were in Building 26, near the beach and pool and the lunch buffet. The room was a wee bit musty but I didn't even notice it in a couple of days, and did not affect my breathing. Woodpeckers and humming birds entertained us during our afternoon patio beers. Julio was our 'maid' most days and was absolutely fantastic and friendly. We tipped him $5 a day plus a gift bag full of goodies, plus a few dollars more here and there when he dropped off more than the allotted liquor and beer. Gracias!Food: The food was amazing, the buffets had so much variety that there had to be something there that you would enjoy. Yes, they had goat and a few things that don't show up at your local KFC, but get over it and try something new. I have an addiction to the Salsa Rosa, which I poured over my eggs in the morning. The Mexican a la carte was the worst, but I know some people enjoyed it. The Oriental was the best, try the shittake mushroom soup. The beach buffet was a pleasant surprise, so good in fact we never made it to the Home Run with the pizzas. But that was our taste.The Beach: Oh the beach! So, so beautiful. Goes for kilometres and kilometres. We had the premium package which gives you a private area on the beach. Even with this we had to get down to the beach and save our chairs at 7 am. No big deal, you can nap later.Beach bar: Great bartenders! And they seem to speak about a dozen languages each. Give them a fiver and they will look after you all week. We were so full of food and sun and booze that we didn't get out much at night.The time share people tried to talk to you but I just smiled and said no, gracias and just kept walking. I, like others here, didn't find the visitors overly friendly and didnt' meet as many people as usual but the staff was always friendly and helpful.Watch for prices when buying your trinkets, we went from $500 to $25 for just a few items. They love women, but may just think we are a little stupid.I would definately go back to this hotel without hesitation, and so would a lot of the other people with whom we spoke.
