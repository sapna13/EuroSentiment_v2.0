{"text":"Non-Weekends are 100% better We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights prior to our cruise (Sunday departure).The hotel was everything we expected it to be: unique, charming, old world, etc. with all the amenities you would expect: robes, turn-down service, fabulous concierge, etc.We asked for (and got) a room on a high floor (5th i think?) with a view of the bay. It is WELL worth the extra money. Looking out over the rooftops and the water is amazing. And because the climate is so prone to short rainstorms, it's quite a site to watch the clouds roll in and the lightning start!Breakfast in the garden patio every morning was beautiful, with perfect service and delcious food (it's costly, but there's no where else to get breakfast in San Juan practically).The tapas hour every night on the promenade was our highlight. Delicious cheeses and wines and a nice seat outdoors - it was heaven.We used the concierge to book a trip to El Yunque for us and to call taxis a few times - it was a great service. Everything about this hotel was romantic and classy and wonderful....except - when the other cruisers checked in.On Friday (and worse on Saturday) - a total barrage of Cruisers took over the hotel. The fact that it was crowded was unpleasant, but more than that (and i'm about to sound snobby) was that so many of the cruisers seemed out of place at El Convento - they were loud, they were dressed inappropriately, they had throngs of screaming children, etc.When you're shelling out this much money to stay at a luxury hotel, you don't expect it to turn into a holiday inn overnight.For example: El convento has an honor bar - where they leave out bottles of booze, mixers, soda, snacks, etc with a little sign that says this is an honor bar, if you make something for yourself, please fill out a receipt and leave it in this box - your room will be charged - on Wednesday and Thursday night the honor bar was honored - on Friday and Saturday my husband and I watched as handfulls of new guests (cruisers) stole from the bar - many of them laughing about it while they were doing it. some of them going so far as to grab armfulls of bottled soda and water and carry it back to their room!That was the only downside of El Convento, some of the losers it brought in they day before the cruise.
