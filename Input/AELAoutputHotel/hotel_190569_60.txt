{"text":"Elegance, Luxury and Fun at the Westin Palace Madrid! My husband and I stayed at this hotel in May of 2007 and we just loved it. We were using our Starwood points to stay and I was concerened about noise as it is in the Center of Madrid. When they put us on the first floor, I was really concerned, but when we saw the room - WOW! We were upgraded to a suite (room #123, as I recall) and it was done in blue and gold and white and it was incredible! The HUGE fluffy bed was like heaven and the bathrooms (yes, TWO of them!) were gorgeous. My husband and I had to holler to each other this suite was so huge. They also had a great sound system which I enjoyed the classical music. Too bad we didn't have any of our own CD's. I felt like the Queen of England staying here, with a gorgeous view of the Neptune fountain right out our window, and it really wasn't very noisy at all. We did have a slight problem in that they had a cold snap right before we arrived, so they air conditioning got turned off in our room. However, the staff was great and got the maintencance people to fix that, no problem. With our American AC going at full power, we were really in heaven then! HA! The GIANT buffet breakfast is not cheap (I think it's E33 per person) bu twell worth the price and you don't have to eat again until dinner, the food is so plentiful and lovely. The cupola dining room is super elegant and we had drinks in the lovely bar a few times. The bar waiters were fun, playing little games with us and even though we got the trivia questions wrong, they gave us the prizes, anyway! So this is a wonderful facility that is elegant and luxurious, but also fun to stay at and we would stay here again when we return to Marvelous Madrid! Oh, and don't miss Rincon de Esteban Restaurant, a few blocks away - the food is wonderful and the waiters are the best. Also, there is a little Cerveceria just behind the Westin that offers delicious tapas for very little money. I think it's calles the Fat Man or something that. Try these and enjoy!
