{"text":"A hidden gem in the Bay Area We were originally booked into your typical generic high rise hotel for our stay in SF over Memorial Day when I read an aritcle about quirky boutique hotels in the Bay Area. After reading about the Joie de Vivre chain of hotels, I instantly canceled our previous reservations and booked one at the White Swan Inn after deciding it was in the neighborhood (Nob Hill) that we wanted to stay in.I'm not sure anything could have been better regarding our stay. From being contacted twice before our stay to see if we had any special requirements all the way to allowing us to store our luggage at no charge for an entire day (Check out was a noon, but we were on the Red Eye).Everything about the hotel was top notch. The room was huge with an even bigger bathroom. There was a working gas fireplace in the room (Which was needed because apparently Memorial Day falls in the middle of Winter in SF), a refrigerator stocked with soda and water at no charge as well free refills if desired.Every afternoon, there was wine and cheese provided in the downstairs lobby, and a very nice breakfast buffet was included in the rate. For an additional $5.00 per person, you could have breakfast delivered to your room.The weekend package that we purchased included the parking which, at some SF hotels can be as high as $50\/day, and it allowed in and out priviledges.The service provided by the staff was better than some 5 star hotels that I've stayed in. Whether it was providing directions or calling a restaurant to let them know we'd be 10 minutes late, they were happy to do it and always with a smile on their face.I not only would stay here again, but if the service level is the same at all of the JdV properties, I would stay at any of them.
