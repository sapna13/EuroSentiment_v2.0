{"text":"Great Hotel, Reviews are right on Still here on March 28th. All the reviews I read on this website have been spot on. The rooms here are decorated nicely and seem to be newly renovated. I would definitely give the rooms a 10. I am sitting here with my laptop writing, with the balcony door open and I can hear the ocean waves hitting the shore. I am here with my wife and 6 teenage kids. We have been sleeping with the balcony door open and the beds are so comfortable! We are on the third floor in the tower overlooking the beach. This is a PERFECT room and location. We have 314 and 315. There is a shorter adjacent building called the cabanas, I don't know much about it, but I can tell you that this room and location is awesome. If you are coming here to relax on the beach it is perfect, if you are a pool person I might think twice. The pool is ok, but not one of the better ones. My family has no interest in hanging by the pool here. This is not a trendy or modern hotel either. It is a cross between a business hotel and a family hotel. The casino is right in the lobby and there is a nice bar there as well. The staff here is great. Everyone here is helpful and nice. Ashford avenue (the street the hotel is on) is a great street to walk up and down. There are great restaurants up and down. Last night we ate at a place 2 blocks down on the left side. I can't remember the name of it but it had a green awning and we ate under it. It was phenomenal! A little pricey, but expected. The service is slow around here, but I expected that. This isn't NYCity. All in all, I would definitely recomend this hotel and area; we are having a blast.
