{"text":"Expensive, large, self-contained and busy! Things to like - This is a beautiful property. It's right in the heart of hollywood: Chinese theatre, walk of stars, theatres, clubs, etc. It's connected to the Highlands, basically an outdoor mall with many shops and restaurants. You can actually go to Grauman's to catch a movie, because the hotel exits into the courtyard of the complex on several levels. This is a Marriott property, so the beds are great, the rooms spacious (including the bathroom), the service is good and it's clean top to bottom. There are a couple of restaurant\/bars in the hotel itself, and the scene is pretty good. Being a large hotel, there are constantly taxis available and the valets are pretty quick retrieving the cars. Rooms facing east have a view of the Hollywood Hills\/Sign. It's also about 5-10min from Universal CityThings not so crazy about - Though this is a higher end Marriott property, in my opinion it is way overpriced. You're basically paying for a safe above-average place, in a prime location. I received a group discount of $100, and the price was $189. So basically the rack rate is $290. I compare this to the Hilton I stayed at in the middle of TimesSquare, which was $250. If the room included a fridge, microwave and free internet, I might be less inclined to think such, but there was only an honor bar and internet was $.30@minute - 3 minute minimum. Valet is $29@night. There are 6 elevators which seem to be in use constantly, so I found a little annoying that there was no stair option. I was only on the fourth floor, but all of the stairways were emergency exit only. I didn't see very many children or families - though I was in panels most of the day - I think it's an ideal property for couples. Overall, if you can afford it, and want to be in the thick of hollywood, I recommend this hotel. But there are less expensive alternatives nearby. One tip though, if you're leaving the hotel and heading west, get a map to get familiar with the streets, and AVOID Hollywood Blvd for a few blocks (unless that's your destination, in which case you should just walk from the hotel).
