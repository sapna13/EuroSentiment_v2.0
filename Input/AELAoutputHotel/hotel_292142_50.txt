{"text":"We couldn't have been made more welcome! So, I'm taking my mother-in-law to NYC for a girlie shopping weekend, and it's her first trip to America at the age of 74 - and the first thought I have is where on earth should we stay? Certainly not near Times Square (too noisy), and not Downtown (not enough shops), nor on the Upper East \/ West side (again, not enough shops!) - so we went for the gorgeous area of Murray Hill where the Affinia Dumont is based - and both the location and the hotel turn out to be PERFECT - a quiet location, but just 15 minutes walk from Macy's!Just to put some perspective on the almost unanimously positive reviews for this hotel - it's fantastic, but not because its a luxury hotel (it's not, it's a solid 4 star, well set up for business or leisure travellers with large rooms including huge desks, a kitchenette, and a lovely views for the higher floors ) - the reason for the reviews are because the Affinia Dumont staff (on the front desk, concierge, spa, door etc) really take customer service seriously. They are definitely the most genuinely helpful hotel staff I have ever come across (and I travel a lot), and they seem to really enjoy their jobs which shows because they make the effort to welcome you to their hotel and city with such enthusiasm.I can honestly say that although NYC was fabulous as always, the Affinia Dumont made this trip a holiday of a lifetime for my mother-in-law. Thank you to everyone we met, and I'll definitely be back. ","annotations":[]}
