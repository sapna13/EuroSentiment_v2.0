{"text":"Tiny rooms but a great hotel We stayed for two night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ at 150 euro√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ per night.This is an excellent hotel on balance. The location is perfect, a short walk from the shopping streets, central station, Dam square, etc. The staff on the whole was very friendly and extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions.Normally we would never spend any time in the foyer of a hotel, the foyer was very inviting and cozy with comfortable seating areas, a little library and nice little bar with free coffee, teas, water and selection of afternoon cakes.There are two main problems with this Hotel, √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?mall rooms (first room I was shown was canal facing, nice room but the size of a rabbit hutch (she said generously), asked to be moved, the next room was a little bigger. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know if this was the only other room available or the guy on reception was being a sod but the second room over looked a builders yard, had a fighting couple next door and was smoking room. I had requested a quite, none smoking room, should have moved again but at that stage didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have the energy. Bathroom√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ small, hotel should thing about refurbish them. √à√\u2020\u2022√ì√Æ?he room was poorly sound proofed, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know if it was just the location of our room or all rooms have the same problems.Just a word of warning to those of you who like a little smoke; this hotel enforces a strict no cannabis smoking policy, as someone on our floor found out (arguing couple )to the tune of 150 Euros which makes it a very expensive splif! Check out the little Greek restaurant next door, excellent food, reasonably priced! Also a little caf√ã√\u2022√ñ called Broodje Bert a few doors down from hotel.I would recommend this hotel just be ready for very small rooms ","annotations":[{"endOffset":501,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":497},{"endOffset":529,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":523},{"endOffset":535,"mention":"teas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":531},{"endOffset":688,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":684}]}
