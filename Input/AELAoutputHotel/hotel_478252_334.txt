{"text":"Top Notch Resort, food, shows, servive Beautiful resort. We checked in at the Golden Club area. There was (bartender) an open bar with snacks. We made sure to get the room safe and also to find out what all is included with the Golden Club Rooms. We had villa 22 (22112) a corner room with a beautiful view. Bananas growing right out our door, palm trees, flowers, etc. Two double beds in the room, nice sized bathroom with seperate area for the toilet. Plenty of closet space with shelves and a desk with 4 drawers that our girls used. Fresh fruit on the table in room and t-shirts for each of us from the resort. Another table with chairs on the lanai. Our maid stocked our fridge with our requested beverages, we had fresh pool towels every evening and turn down service. She decorated our room with balloons several times, towel art with fresh flowers, slippers, special toiletry items for our girls, candy, etc. Very attentive. They also have rules (in their passport book) about not hanging clothes\/towels on the lanai, being quiet at night, etc. which was really nice. Everyone there had mannerly bahavior - no drunks or loud guests. You get what you pay for. The food was wonderful. Not too spicy or sweet. So much on the buffets and beautifully displayed, ice sculptures, carved (artistic)melons, all kinds of entrees, fruits, desserts, etc. The ala carte restaurants were all fantastic. From the atmosphere, service, menu, plate display, and entertainment. We also ordered room service after the nightly shows (45-60 minute wait) and the food was good and fun as well. Bars - Lobby bars,pool bars, and beach bar all had great service and very accomodating to both adults and kids. We always tipped to start off. Even after the lobby bar closed our group was able to get waters from them. They always were in a good mood. Made us feel very welcome. We tried all the pools and no complaints at all. The music was never too loud, pools were clean, never had trouble securing lounge chairs (not always where we wanted but there wasn't a bad location). The pool had more activity with volleyball, games, dance lessons, aerobics, etc. Grounds and beach were kept clean. Ocean water is crystal clear and sand is soft, never got hot to walk on. Nice beach - no rocks or shells in the water, or little fish. Grounds - Everything was clean and manicured. Beautiful resort with lush landscape. The workers kept up on everything, hedges were perfectly trimmed, untouched areas by the bridge were a nice touch. The birds liked to hang out there so when you pass by in the tram (or walk) you could hear them chirping. Peepers (frogs) at night. Activities - The nightly shows were professionally done with dancers and actors. Best we have ever seen without paying a big ticket price. They really worked hard and it shows. Sunday night show is more of an audience participation. Before the shows (1 hour or so) they get the crowd involved and pull people from the audience to learn the Bahia theme song\/dance and do an elimination game. Very nice open air theatre. There is also the Pueblo Principe Town that is open at 0900 for shopping and stays open until 4 a.m. with live music, a disco, karaoke bar, casino, etc. We thought this was a beautiful resort and everything was top notch. The service was excellent from arrival to depature. The Golden Club Rooms had some nice perks that we really appreciated (private pools, private restaurants for breakfast\/lunch, 4 ala carte dinners, pool towels, 24 hour room service,etc.) It will be hard to top the Bahia so if we go to a different destination, we will look for the Bahia properties.
