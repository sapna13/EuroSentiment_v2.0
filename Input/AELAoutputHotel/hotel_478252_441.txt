{"text":"Kids will love it here Second time in two years to Punta CanaJust returned from Gran Bahia and was very happy with our stay but we have stayed at the Paradisus in Punta Cana and am basing my comparison on th at resort.We have an 8 and 5 year oldNow, we were extremely happy with the Bahia but it is not a 5 star resort.We stayed in the diamond club which offered private check in, private pool, beach towels to the room etc. Nice perk, but you can go with out. the private pool is very very quiet, no activities, dull actually. The benefit was private restaurant for b\/f and lunch, quite nice. The rooms are average, neat clean , well kept. you have to pay for the room safe which i found odd as you are paying a good buck and they penny pinch you for $40. Room safe was included at the paradisus.B\/f and lunch buffet in the main restaurant, simply awsome, HUGE selection, dont bother with the snack bar by the pool.Al'carte resaturants, extremely disappointing, portions were very small and only one choice from each catagory. wine by the glass only, unless you wanted to purchase a bottle. Dont get me wrong, the food was excellent, but this is supposed to be all inclusive. French, mexican were the best for us. Paradisus you could order 12 of the same entree and they were happy to accomadate, and wine by the bottle to your table. Gran Bahia, one entree, one appetizer. Of the nine al'cartes at the paradisus, you had to reserve only 3, all other six plus the buffet were walk in. You could eat at 6 different al'cartes in one night. Gran Bahia we were only allowed 4 al'cartes. Thumbs way up to paradisus. Service at this resort was the best, kind and friendly people, better service at th Bahia, by far. The beach bar was great, no waiters on the beach like the Paradisus, no big deal. No room service, only two cans of beer in the mini fridge per day , unless you wanted to pay for extra beer. that was annoying. Paradisus was alcohol to the room, beer, bottles of wine, whatever, all included. We always ordered cheese and wine before dinner at the paradisus (to our room) which was awsome. It was nice to get dressed up and chill with a glass of wine on the balcony at the paradisus but were disappointed that we werent offered the same at the bahiaThe pool was good, shallow entry for babies and very young kids, attached 18 inch deep pool for kids to frolic in, very nice. Lots of action by the pool, can get a little tedious by the end of the week, but the pool bar was at the extreme other end of the pool. if you look at pics of the pool, it is in three sections, the section with the swim up bar is at the east end of the pool which is closed off from the main and west end of the pool, ???? no big deal for us, but may be for you. The pool at the paradisus was huge and tropical, huge palm trees and lush. paradisus pool was better for us.Didnt use the kids club at all, Would you leave your children in a strange country with strange people? I think notBeaches were both awsome, we walked down by the Riu Palace which was next door, seemed like dullsville. Bahia had music dancing etc it was awsomeShuttle service was unbelieveable, a tram every two minutesall in all it was a great vacation, but I have stayed with sol melia (paradisus) and they are truely a 5 star chain. Now if you have gone 3-4 star and then come here to the bahia, it seems like wow 5 star, its really not, its a 4, maybe a 4 +but it does lack in important areas to deem it a true 5 star. For the money I will spend the extra to stay with Sol Melia as they make the vacation truely unbelievable.I am not trying to come accross as a high roller cause I am not, but I want and need value for my money and have tried to be as objective as possibleWould I come again, yes (for around $3000-3500 for my family of four), would my expectations be as high, no wayAgain it is a great place, but it is not all the hypeIF YOU HAVE KIDS, GO HERE, THEY WILL LOVE ITHope this helped and go enjoy Mucho gusto ","annotations":[{"endOffset":429,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":425},{"endOffset":429,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":425},{"endOffset":2879,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2875},{"endOffset":2879,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2875},{"endOffset":2879,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2875},{"endOffset":2879,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2875}]}
