{"text":"terrific place, great location We have just returned to Australia after a 4 night stay at the Splendid, and Splendid it was too....echoing all of the favourable comments on this site, I would add that I was more than pleasantly suprised by the size and style of the room, and can confirm again that Farouk is extremely good at his job- by the way, he used to be a fast bowler in Pakistan, and was considering going to Australia for coaching by Lillee and Thommo- he chose Paris and the hospitality industry- good new for all of us I'd say....Anyway, back to the hotel. We stayed in a superior room, room 403- with the exceptional view of the Arc from the balcony- probably fairer to call it a balcony rather than a terrace by the way, wouldn't really be able to hold a cocktail party out there! The room was MUCH bigger than I had expected, should even impress Americans. It had an entrance hall, bathroom off it, and a door to the bedroom that could be shut, so there is an extra level of privacy from the bathroom to the bedroom if you get my drift. Good size wardrobe, good flat screen TV, but dodgy air conditioning- we couldn't get it to move from freezing or off, but to be honest we are low maintenace guests, we reported it once and then didn't worry about it again. Fussy people would probably be whingeing round about now I expect.Tiny lift up- as per usual in Paris- charming lobby, bar area, and a little ( unairconditioned) phone box size room with an internet connected PC ( free to use) for all those people who aren't bringing laptops on holidays with them, but still need to check emails etc. As per this sites advise, we didn't eat at the hotel- Farouk in fact pointed out a great breakfast cafe down the road a bit , where he goes- much better than the place over the road.It really is ridiculously handy for transport- RER station right outside the door, Cab rank 10 metres away, metro stop 200 metres, and the 14 euro Air France bus to CDG airport just over the road- brilliantly located. We strolled under the Arc to the Champs Elysee for people watching, and visited quite a few of the local bars\/ bistros where the Euro's were on TV every night.Anyway, I would stay there again like a shot- that's how good it is- well priced for what you get, and fully worth its high rating on this site- au revoir Hotel Splendid Etoile!
