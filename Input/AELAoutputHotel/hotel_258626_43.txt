{"text":"Love this place! This is our favorite hotel in Dallas. We were here for a short get-away. This is a very quiet hotel! When we arrived, the place was overrun with teenagers, either a school group or a sports team. We checked in, fearing a sleepless night. But there were no teenagers on our floor that we could hear. Our room, a King non-smoking, faced the atrium, which was (to our surprise) also quiet. The bed was perhaps the most comfortable hotel bed! The rooms are fairly roomy, with a separate bedroom. Four people would be cramped, but it was sufficient for two people. the living room area features a sleeper sofa (either queen or full,) a comfy upholstered chair, a desk with internet access, an entertainment center, and coffee pot. The room was definitely NON-smoking, and NOT saturated with air freshners to hide the smoky smell. The hot water was hot, and plenty of it (I know that is how it is SUPPOSED to be, but isn't always so in all hotels. I've stayed in 5-stars that were out of hot water by 7am!) There was a coffee pot in the living room, and USA Today outside the door each morning. The location is a plus, as well. Easy to find, just off the Dallas Tollway, a couple of right turns and you're there. It is right across from the Galleria (Macy's garage side,) and adjacent to the Container Store, ZGallerie, and numerous other stores. It is very close to Valley View Mall, to the east, and The Great Outdoors to the west. Parking was the only issue, and only once. The parking lot fills up very quickly. We were booked here by Hotwire the first time. We loved it so much we started booking direct with the hotel. We've been back several times and haven't had a bad experience yet.
