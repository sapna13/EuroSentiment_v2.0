{"text":"Good Budget Resort My husband and I traveled to the Riu Bambu from June 25 through July 4th, 2007. We had a great time and came back much more relaxed and much more tan than when we left. Our goal for this vacation was to pay about $2000 total for a 10-day trip to Punta Cana. So, with that budget, we were not looking at the 5-star resorts. We stayed at the Riu Palace Mexico two years ago, andthat was spectacular. For this trip we were on a tighter budget but still wanted 10 days to relax on a beautiful tropical beach.The Riu Bambu delivered that very well. We paid about $2200 total for non-stop air from Baltimore and 10 days all-inclusive at the Riu Bambu. Budget-wise, this resort was fantastic. The beach was stunningas expected, and we had a great time, all around.As with most 4-star resorts, some stuff was fabulous, and some stuff was not so fabulous. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l try to give an honest account. But, please keep in mind that overall, we had a great time and got exactly what we expected given our budget. Beach: Gorgeous. Plenty of sun and plenty of shade. Plenty of loungers at all times of day. The beach was quite clean, but there isa small amount of seaweed in the water all the time. Not a problem, just something to note. We took out a pedal boat for an hour one afternoon (it was free) and this was really fun. Food: Good. We both always found things to eat without any problem. Mexican night was our favorite. We both got mildly sick toward the end of our ten days, but nothing too awful, and from all the people we talked to, this is pretty much par for the course when you travel to the Dominican Republic. Dining Room: Not so good. My biggest issue with this resort was the heat in the dining hall. The dining room is not air conditioned, which is not a huge deal at dinner, but gets to be really uncomfortable at lunch. We figured out that it was cooler to eat at the outdoor tables during lunch, which helped a lot. But, the lack of a\/c definitely made things uncomfortable at lunch. I do want to say that the resort did make a real effort to keep the food at safe temperatures √à√\u2020\u2022?the hot food was always hot and the cold food was always cold. Drinks: Again, not so good. They had 4 types of frozen drinks in machines at all of the bars. When these machines were working and thedrinks came out frozen, they were excellent. However, most times these machines were not working and the frozen drinks didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ come out frozen at all. This would have been only mildly annoying if it had happened once or twice, but this happened more often than not. That said, the Banana Mama√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ are fabulous when they are actually frozen √à√\u2020\u2022?my favorite drink by far. Room: Good. It was basic and small, but it was clean and served its purpose just fine. We were on the first floor in building #3, which is a good location √à√\u2020\u2022?close enough to the beach and the restaurants, but not right next to all the noise. We had no problem at all with the room.All in all, we got to relax on a beautiful Caribbean beach for 10 days at a nice resort for just over $2000 total. Not a bad deal! For what we were looking for, the Riu Bambu was great. If I were going back with a bigger budget, I would choose a different resort, but if you are on a budget, this place is great.
