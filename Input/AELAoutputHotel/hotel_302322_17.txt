{"text":"city break Went to the Harbour Plaza Hong Kong as part of a honeymoon world trip.We booked the hotel through our local travel councellor and was surprised when we got there, as we were so near the star ferry one of the main attraction's.We stayed in Kowloon and had a good time, people were really friendly in the hotel and out of the hotel very helpfull.Went on the star ferry which cost about seventy pence per adult, really cheap, went over to Hong Kong island very busy and hetic.Did enjoy going up to the mid escalotors, but was surprised to see it was full of the nannies and maids on there day off they go there as they have no other place to stay, as they can not afford to board any where.very safe city, enjoyed a day trip to the lantau island where the big buddha is , this was amazing experience.Above all had a good trip, not the best place i have visited and would not rush to get back to the city, thought that it was quiet expensive near where we were staying.As we were on our honeymoon did not get treated special or anything the staff did not go out of there way for tourist's of the resort but would look after there own with more attention.Very clean hotel and the bed was very comfortable and always made, the room service was excellent and hot, the mini bar was very over priced , all room's have a safe which i laptop could fit in to.Used the business centre for the internet was very fast but could get it cheaper in the street.
