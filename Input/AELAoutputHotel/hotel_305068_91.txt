{"text":"Awesome Hotel My wife  I (mid 40's) recently stayed at this harbor-front property, where we had a junior suite (room 516) that compared favorably to any of the finest hotel rooms we've stayed in. Our room looked directly out on the harbor; at night we left the curtains open in order to enjoy the incredible vista. The bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was quite large, w\/a separate tub and shower (the tub's jets were not very powerful). Large closet with safe. Complicated TV\/Stereo set-up (we had to call for help!) but great Bose sound system. The hotel is in a great location, just a short walk to Nathan Road, the main shopping drag. The Peninsua hotel is very close by. Need to traverse subway, the subterranean tunnels that connect the hotel to Nathan Road and it was a bit confusing at first. The hotel lobby is gorgeous, with a magnificent view of the harbor. Comfortable but pricey lobby bar. The spa was nothing extraordinary -- not a Canyon Ranch -- but perfectly acceptable and not overpriced ($115 for 50 minute Swedish massage). The service throughout the hotel was excellent. It was extraordinarily hot and humid in mid-August (and this comes from a Ft Lauderdale, FL resident!) but the taxis in HK are incredibly cheap (US$2 to pretty much anywhere) so take advantage of them. We visited the Ladies Market on a late Sunday afternoon and the Night Market on a Saturday night and enjoyed the bartering with the locals over the vast array of cheap merchandise. Unlike Turkish bazaars, where the vendors hassle you if you ignore them or don't buy from them, these sellers were friendly and polite. By all means, negotiate! We also visited the Jade Market and picked up a few decent pieces.We ate at Yan Toh Heen, the hotel's Chinese restaurant, which was good, not great. Generally, we found the food in HK to be on the bland side (Cantonese is not our favorite), but we had a tasty, spicy Szechuan meal at Yun Yan on Nathan Road. We also ate well at Cafe Deco, atop Victoria Peak. A must-do side trip was a visit to Lantau Island. You take the subway to the island and then a municipal bus (modern, air-conditioned -- don't bother with the taxis) to the site of the Giant Buddah. We also enjoyed a ferry trip to Macao and gambled at the Wynn. Very few slots, no craps or three card poker, the few games they play are blackjack and, overwhelmingly, baccarat. We stopped in to look at the Peninsula and Langham, two nearby properties, and while they were both very nice, the Intercontinental had a far nicer lobby ... and that view!
