{"text":"Small rooms in a good location You are not really paying for the room here, its all about the location, location, location as you have Nathan Road, Canton Road and the MTR \/ Star Ferry \/ Victoria Harbor literally right at the doorstep. You can really shop till you drop around here! Coming back to the hotel all that shopping won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fit in the room, as the Standard Rooms are tiny with almost no room to walk around the bed. The bed is very soft and comfortable compared to many Hong Kong hotels. The bathroom is also tiny, but generally speaking the room was clean and ok. This hotel offers no views, as its overshadowed by the buildings around it, so don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be conned into upgrading to a corner harbor view room when checking in √à√\u2020\u2022?as you can only see a tiny slice of the harbor if you squeeze into the corner! Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be in a hurry when checking in\/out √à√\u2020\u2022?i.e. don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be rush to catch a flight, as you have to queue. The hotel lobby always seemed to have a queue and reminded me of a railway station as there were always big groups coming\/going cluttering up the lobby. The cool thing about the hotel is that it has a tunnel linking it to the MTR (Tsim Sha Tsui) and using the same tunnel network one can shop and explore this part of Kowloon without ever walking on the street √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a great way to avoid the chaos an heat √à√\u2020\u2022?and return to the hotel. As usual internet is available, but not free.
