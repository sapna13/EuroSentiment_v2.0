{"text":"Nice Staff at Hilton Frankfurt Just returned from a 4 week stay at the Hilton Frankfurt where I had to stay while on project for my company. So, if you speak of having experienced the goods, I did! By the 3rd day, all of the staff knew my name and used it throughout. Going to Germany I didn't know what to expect but all of the people working in the hotel were really nice and made my stay all that more comfortable. Having worked long days at the office, coming back to the hotel, my temporary home, was quite important. The buffet breakfast is one of the largest I've seen on my travels, I did loose count on the different kinds of bread they have, fresh fruit, cold cuts, cheese, hot dishes, 5 kinds of fruit juices, fresh and bottled. You can either have a normal coffee or order a special coffee, go for the latte machiatto, included in the price! The Asian Bar makes for a nice change with sushi and sashimi, try the mixed platter, it's heaven. As for restaurants in the area I can recommend the Neue Volkswirt. I also did a boattrip on the Main for 2 hrs, great to relax on the deck of the boat with a beer and a snack, you even get some cultural background from a recording that plays back while you go past the sites, the english version is quite funny. Thanks again to Hilton Frankfurt for my home away from home!
