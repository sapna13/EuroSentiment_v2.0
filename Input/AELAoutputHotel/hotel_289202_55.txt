{"text":"Wonderful Hotel We stayed at this hotel for two nights to celebrate my birthday, and couldn't have asked for better.We had booked one of the red rooms, but on arrival were informed that one of the suites was available in an adjacent building down a short Calle. We were offered it at a reduced rate of an additional √à√\u2020√ü?0 a night instead of the usual √à√\u2020√ü?0 with breakfast included. Once we had seen the picture, we were hooked and when we saw it, we knew we had made the right choice. It was lovely, and looked very recently done. There was a king size fourposter bed,draped in white muslin. Dressing table, and wardrobe all beautifully decorated. The walls are covered in cream striped fabric, and there are very beautiful wall lights and table lamps. The windows were dressed with acres more white muslin and luxuriously draped curtains. The room was equipped with a security box in the wardrobe and a very efficient mini bar, not to mention the wall mounted flat screen TV.The bathroom was spotlessly clean, and equipped with a superb shower cubicle. Everything from spare toothbrushes, razors , shower caps, shoe polishing sponges and a very handy sewing kit. Huge, white fluffy bath sheets too.The airconditioning unit was very efficient. The double glazing kept out all noise, and the shutters were excellent too. It was hard to believe that you were only a couple of hundred yards away from the Grand Canal, you heard nothing, not even the church bells!The entry hall was all marble, as were the two flights of stairs you had to climb to get to our suite. Entry was via a buzzer system operated from the reception area, then a security card key to your suite. We were never kept waiting to get in form more than a minute.The hotel has tables and chairs right on the Grand Canal, and a shady area to the side under two large sun shades. We sat there for a couple of hours every afternoon with a drink or two just watching Venice pass by. Entertainment was provided by the Gondoliers based at the Gondola station right outside the notel, their banter is wonderful to watch. Breakfast was very good, cheese and cold meats, boiled eggs yoghurts, cereals, juice and a wide array of pastries and fresh fruit. We got down later one morning, nearer 10 than 7, and there was still plenty to choose from. Fresh coffee is made for you from an impressive machine at reception. A choice of teas was also available.The breakfast room was very well presented, and you can also breakfast outside or in the bar area. We did all three during our stay.The reception staff and all the waiting\/bar staff were extremely helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble.Reception was full of flowers, and an enduring memory of the hotel will be the scent of lilies, gorgeous!We will definately be returning, and recommending it to anyone we know is intending to visit Venice. Almost forgot, it is even easier to find it when you arrive at Piazza Roma than the website says, and takes less than 10 minutes to walk even with a case. They were also more than happy to store our luggage before and after check out, which was brilliantEverything is right there on the doorstep. You cannot go wrong.We were asked when we left if we could think of anyway the stay could have been better, we honestyly couldn't hink of anything at all. On reflection, a chest of drawers might be a useful addition to Room 515, but in the scale of things, how minor is that?Pretty much faultless, we loved it.
