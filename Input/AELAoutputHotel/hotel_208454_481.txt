{"text":"One of the best if not THE best hotel in New York city I visit New York City three times each year. This was my second stay at this Sofitel and I do not intend to seek different lodging on any trip to NYC. The hotel is in a convenient location for the business functions that I attend, a few blocks from Times Square and Grand Central, tons of great restaurants within a few blocks as well as good shopping - so location wise, for me, it is superb.The front desk is extremely well staffed with from four to six desk agents throughout the day and evening. They are each extremely pleasant, well informed, meticulously attired, and peform the check in and check out process with precision. The lobby area has several seating areas conducive to simply relax, meet with friends, have an impromptu business chat or check e-mail on one of four computers in a private area off of the lobby. The lobby is always staffed by a uniformed employee keeping an eye on things and there to handle simple directions.The rooms are average to mid-size, especially for a major city. The rooms that I, and colleagues, have had are exceptionally well maintained, have all amenities that you could possibly need and have nice small touches such as fresh flowers in the bathroom and a bed that is luxurious. Room service is prompt, very good quality and as pricey as you would expect. The cafe\/bar is a great place to relax with a cocktail and is very well staffed and reasonably priced.It is rare to find a hotel where everything is as you wish, but this is one of those rare finds - quality lodging, efficient service and good location. At almost $600\/night it is pricey - perhaps the only thing that I could fault.
