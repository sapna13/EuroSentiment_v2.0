{"text":"keep looking for another resort This was our second and last time at this resort. 4 yrs ago it was great but not now. We have gone to punta 4 time and there are much better resorts for americans to go to. This one only caters to europeans for the most part.Room was nice but they have major major plumbing problems and may take a day for them to come to you.But dont worry they have a drain right next to the toliet.Speacialty rest were good but the buffet was absolutely terrible except for breakfast.The pool was the best part and Alfredo the bartender was great guy but he was a minority as far as being friendly to Americans.They tag you with a braclet so they know where and what tour group you are with.If you need to get on internet the guy posts he will open at 9 but exspect 11We booked thru apple and only saw our rep 2 times in a weekThis resort was great 4 yrs ago but has gone down the toliet,oh wait the toliets dont flush well. Even the big ones in the lobby were backed up all the time. Oh yea if you like entertainment forget it here. The DJ at the pool was great. He had 5 CD's of which 3 were all rap but he only liked 4 songs . One day he played the same song for 3 hrs straight True story.Well folks do yourself a favor and keep looking and spend a little more money for a much better trip Go somewhere else as far as resort planning ","annotations":[]}
