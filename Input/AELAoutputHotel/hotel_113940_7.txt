{"text":"Excellent Value - Great Location - Friendly Staff Recently I attended a conference in San Francisco at the Mosone Center. I was looking for a hotel within walking distance. Because I booked late, my choices were limited and was I lucky! Otherwise I would not have found this great little hotel Petite Auberge, that's just off Union Square. When it came up in the listing on Expedia, I wasn't sure, but I read some reviews and it looked good. I'm at 75+ room night per year traveler so I've stayed in my fair share of concrete boxes. This Inn looked interesting, from the description and photos it had character.The Petite Augerge is more of a Bed  Breakfast than a hotel. The rooms are nicely appointed with antique furniture and small touches remicinent of a BB. I was fortunate to get a room with a working gas fireplace (very cozy)! There were books and knickknacks on the mantel (not screwed down), robes in the armoire, a comforter and big puffy pillows on the bed. The staff was exceptional. Very friendly, helpful and really gave off the feeling that they were happy to be there helping you.The hotel serves breakfast each morning, quiche, sausages, fresh fruit, hot and cold cereal, an assortment of breads and pastries. The food was delicious, and the dining room cozy. In the afternoons, they have a wine and cheese reception where guests can get together and meet. I was surprised at how well attended they were! I was able to meet fellow travelers from around the globe, and everyone was having as enjoyable a stay as I did. Because it's a BB style, you'll probably find that most of the guests tend to be mature and more professional (EG: quiet, polite and considerate)From a location standpoint, you couldn't ask for anything better. It's a few blocks from Union Square \/ Nobb Hill and a 1\/2 blocks from the Powell Street Cable Car. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from within walking distance and the friendly knowledgeable staff will help you choose and give good directions to get you there. It is within walking distance of the Moscone Center if you are attending a conference, and a quick cab ride to Fishermans Wharf (I went twice and it was less than $8.00 each way) or you can take the Cable Cars.The Goods: Extremely clean, fantastic and I mean Fantastic Water Pressure in the shower, great decor, superb staff, great food, very central location, excellent value.The Bads: Well, nothing really. If you dis-like BB's, need extreme quite to sleep, don't like the occasional floor squeak or a little street noise or demand a fancy restaurant and bar in the lobby, then you might want to look elsewhere. Everyone else, this is a GREAT FIND.
