{"text":"hong kong perfection I stayed with my wife at the Shangri La Kowloon for seven nights at the end of March 2008. We booked our trip with Trailfinders who also took care of the flights (We flew with BA World Traveller Plus--very good--we enjoyed the extra room in the seats--well worth considering for long haul) We arrived at the hotel at 6.45pm and were met as we got out of the taxi by a member of the reception staff, taken straight to our room where a member of room service bought us some chinese tea. It was a good start which only got better. All of the staff were extreamly attentive and always gave superb service including the concierge (very knowledgeable) and the waiters. I know that the hotel is 5 stars but in all my years of travel I have never been made to feel more welcome at a hotel. The location is great for getting around Hong Kong--just a few minutes in a Taxi (very cheap) and you could be at any of the markets\/shopping areas or you could walk or take the bus. Its only 10 minutes walk to the Star Ferry which takes you over to Hong Kong Island where you can visit the Peak plus some very swanky shopping streets. We had some suits made at Charms Tailors, just across the road from the hotel, great value and quality. The real Hong Kong though is always just off the beaten track and its good to take a day just getting lost (its very safe in HK).Just to sum up The Shangri La is an exceptional hotel, please pay for the upgraded room (deluxe harbour view room) and just enjoy.
