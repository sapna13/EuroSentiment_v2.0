{"text":"Beautiful Surrounding... but Our tour agency (balitraveling) booked us on this hotel, though our original choice was The Maya. Since this place is much cheaper and the photos looked good and remarks generally positive, we decided to give it a try.I share similar remarks with most of the other reviews posted - the surrounding is just so beautiful and peaceful and the main pool is really as beautiful as what you see at the website.Our pool villa is spacious and boast of great privacy. The private pool overlooks the opposite hills, and the pool size is much larger than the Komaneka's or even the Royal Pita Maha. However, I felt that the whole place is not quite up to the mark - the hot shower doesn't work well, water pressure was low, the bathtub and bed linen not very clean, the DVD player didn't work and the qualities of the toiletries provided are not so good. The staff are very friendly but service is a little slow. Oh yes, the shuttle service is too infrequent, so we ended up paying for our own transport from Ubud most of the time (but it is not that expensive - Rp 30,000 per way). For the price that we paid, I think we had a pretty good deal (I think we paid USD100+ per nite). But I like pampering service (i.e. bath oil, high quality towels etc). So, I will probably go for The Maya next time around eventhough it will cost a lot more.
