{"text":"Very bad service We stayed for two weeks at Legian Beach, and chose the hotel from the great location and the pictures on the website. We were 2 couples sharing a deluxe garden bungalow. What should be our perfect holiday in a nice upscale hotel started totally wrong when we arrived after 30 hours of travel and our rooms were not ready! We arrived at 3 pm and had to wait until 7. We booked months in advance, and we were picked up at the airport at 2 pm by the hotel, so there is no excuse. The free lunch and use of a very dirty shower room did by no means compensate for waiting, very tired after traveling. By free lunch means: You can not order the expensive dishes and no free drinks. Outrageous!Our rooms were nice, but not the same rooms as in the pics on the website, much smaller in reality. The location of the hotel is great, and if it had not been for the very poor service, this would be a great hotel. Staff were generally not nice, and we were repeatedly told at breakfast that we were very late and please hurry up, even if it was before 10 (breakfast lasted till 10). In the restaurants, eating lunch could take up to 2 hours, because the staff were so slow! Help in reception was bad, and not friendly at all, sometimes even rude. In addition to this, everything is very expencive in the hotel. It cost a lot just to use the tennis-court (you would think using the hotel tennis court would be free), internet or laundry service. We tried to change hotel but as it was full everywhere we stayed and tried not to let it ruin our much-anticipated holiday. I will certainly go back to Bali, but never to Legian Beach Hotel.
