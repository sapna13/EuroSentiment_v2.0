{"text":"Loved Waikiki and liked the Marriott I stayed at the hotel for a week in December. It is a great location and a nice 4 star hotel. Nothing opulent, but the rooms are good sized, clean, and have comfortable beds. In addition to a couple of ABC stores there are a few shops and restaurants on the lobby level.Obviously you are in Waikiki so there is a lot to see and do. The beach directly in front of the hotel is protected by a barrier wall and is very calm. It seemed to be a lot less crowded than the portion to your right towards the Royal Hawaiian.If you exit the hotel facing the beach and take a left, that section of the beach along the park seemed to have a pretty rough bottom (although there are signs posted warning people of this) that cut my feet just standing in the water.There were a few places to eat that seemed to stand out. Duke's at the Outrigger was great for breakfast (we also did dinner there one night, which was good, but nothing special). They have a solid buffet that looks out over the water with wonderful fruit and items like coconut, pineapple, and mango bread pudding. I think it cost around $15. For Thai we went to Keo's for dinner one night and it was excellent.For cheaper food options, we went to Ono Hawaiian Foods at 726 Kapahulu Ave. It is a little outside Waikiki, but not too far. Authentic Hawaiian food for very little money (well under $10 for more food than you could eat). Also, you may want to hit one of the stalls at the International Market for something other than a hotel restaurant. Before you leave, go to Leonard's Bakery for malasadas. I had never had one before, but the fried Portuguese donut-like things were fantastic.
