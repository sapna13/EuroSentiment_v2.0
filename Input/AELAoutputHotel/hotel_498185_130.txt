{"text":"Can't really fault it... Just back after our first visit to Madrid. Again, as others have, we chose the hotel based upon 'Tripadvisor' reviews. The hotel fully met our expectations. Firstly, its location is directly on Gran Via, which, as its name implies, is one of the main roads in Madrid. It is a busy road, but this noise never caused a problem for us. We were it has to be said though, on the 5th floor, and towards the rear of the hotel. The hotel is within a short 5 minute walk to 2 metro stations, and many restaurants \/bars \/ shops are close at hand. We stayed in one of their 'Plus' rooms - which were basically a little larger, and had a small terrace which could be accessed via the large french doors from the room. The room itself was spacious, with a sofa, large bed, and a desk. Nice wooden parquet flooring.Bathroom was more than adequate, and came with lots toiletries- even spare razors,toothbrushes etc, if needed.Roms have individually controlled air con too. Overall, the hotel was clean, well presented. There is a small spa area in the basement of the hotel.Staff very helpful and friendly - we asked about getting train tickets for a day trip to Toledo (well worth it -but book a day ahead if poss, as you have to queue for tickets, and the trains to Toledo get full ) and they gave us a guide to the town, plus the train times too! Although we only ate breakfast at the hotel, the restaurant section was good, as was the food. Standard contintental breakfast of meats, cheese, breads and fruit etc.The bar area was great- stylish, and obviously not just used by tourists, which is always a good sign, although prices a little on the steep side, but that's the norm for hotel bars I guess.Overall, without wishing to rave on - I cannot really fault the hotel at all. We would definately return to Madrid, and I would be more than happy to stay at the De Las Letras again.
