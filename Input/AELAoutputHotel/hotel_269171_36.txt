{"text":"Worst accomodations ever experienced The Amsterdam House promises to rent lovely apartments by the looks of its website. I booked this online directly with the hotel. I should have suspected something when they said they would give me the exact location when I arrived. When we went to the hotel they directed us to an office a few doors down. The office was run down and filthy and they required that I pay the entire fee up front---- red flag that I ignored.The apartment was next door, up a few flights of stairs. It looked as if it was being used an an office and files and paper work had been shoved in a bookcase. The carpet was torn, dirty. The refrigerator did not work, there was no stove, one of the beds was a mattress thrown over a short piece of particle board, there was nowhere to hang clothes, hadn't been painted in years. But here is the kicker--- the toilet was leaking and actually falling through the floor!!Had this been cheap, it would have been one thing--- but it was 250 Euro a night-- $325.00!!!!I had booked the apartment for 3 nights!! I complained the next day and said there was no way that I was going to stay there another night. They offered a house boat for the next night ( and wanted to charge me more!) This was at least cleaner and a lot of fun --- but again the appliances in the kitchen did not work. We also had to get them to turn on the hot water.The 3rd night, I was told that the houseboat was not available and would have to move again........The apartment on the 3rd night is pictured on the website. --BEWARE!! If you want an authentic Amsterdam apartment this may be it, but you will have to share it with rodents and rodent droppings all over the kitchen counters.Go out for coffee--- the coffee pot doesn't work.At no time did the management address our concerns or offer any type of refund.This outfit obviously gets away with this all the time and just rakes in the money----- stay away.
