{"text":"Very so so, not worth the price The hotel was OK. Nice room, great bathroom (except the loose paneling in the roof, which made a terrible racket every time the door was opened.)The Good:The room, the bathroom, the breakfastThe not so good:Not very central, but buses stopped just outside the door, and taxis came zipping when you extended an arm. No metro, though, and only two bus lines, with approx 20-30 minutes to get to plaza catalunyaVery! expensive breakfast . Breakfast were included because of early booking but the breakfast-staff still tried to get us to sign off for it. When we asked why, they maintained it was not included. Sorted out quickly when we spoke to staff in the reception, but still a bit of an annoyance. The sorting out were probably helped by the fact that we had very good documentation that it were to be included..Staff attitude and response to legitimate complaints.The bad: Broken A\/C (set in winter position apparently), which were not fixed the whole stay (5 nights). Instead, it was set on approx 28 degrees, making the room hot!. With no A\/C, the window had to be open, and the traffic noise then became an issue.Safe locked when we arrived, and it took way longer to get someone to unlock it than it should have (2 hours and three reminders and finally going down to the reception to get the staff myself)Swimming pool placed so you had to pass through the lobby to and from, no privacy to speak of, and a laughably equipped gym. I never used it even though I would have with a bit more privacy. Never saw anyone else use it either.The ugly: No apologies from the staff for the A\/C, no effort to fix it. All in all: Not worth the (quite high) price.For peace and quiet you are better off getting a place in the Rambla, this would also be vastly more central.
