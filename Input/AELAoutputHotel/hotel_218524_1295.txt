{"text":"Loved Excellence, Hated to leave Stayed at Excellence Feb. 6-10th. Booked an early flight and flew Delta direct from jfk. Arranged for ground transportion as part of a package deal. Met up with driver, waited about 10 mins. for the other couples and off we went. The ride to the hotel took about an hour. We stopped at two hotels along the way to drop off passengers. The ride back to the airport was shorter as we made no stops along the way. Both trips were made at midday with no traffic. There are many potholes along the way so be patient. I didn't mind the ride at all. I enjoyed the scenery along the way and chatted with the other couples . Save the $400 for your next trip. Upon arrival we were greeted with a warm welcome home and a cool towel followed by a glass of champange. We declined the offer to upgrade and were glad we did. Our garden view room was charming. After unpacking we put on our suits, got poolside and had our first of many cocktails. The pools are stunning. The rafts are lovely. The beach is beautiful. It is wide and long. You can walk for miles in either direction. The water is a beautiful turquoise blue. There are plenty of lounge chairs everywhere. The ocean is very strong. Enjoy the waves! The food was very good. Our favorites were Chez Isabelle and Agave. Plenty to choose from at breakfast. Be adventurous, try new things. The shows were entertaining. Don't miss the Michael Jackson show. The people that work at the hotel are dedicated to making your stay the best that it can be. Each day the hotel grows on you more and more. It is very relaxing. Best for a relaxing couples getaway. Five nights is perfect. If you want a great all inclusive in the carribean go to Excellence. You won't be disappointed. ","annotations":[]}
