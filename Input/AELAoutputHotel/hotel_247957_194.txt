{"text":"Miss it already We traveled with a group of 15 Parrotheads. If you know Parrotheads, we can have fun about anywhere. Add beautiful beaches, beach bars and beach cabanas, now we're really talking!Some of the group had the deluxe rooms and some had the Royal Club Rooms. Those in the deluxe had no issues whatsoever. Those in the Royal Club however made up for it. Actually the only issues are the people in the Royal Club Office. Check in was horrendous and never were the people in that particular area nice! Everywhere else, all employees were extremely friendly. Three of us were bumped from Royal Club rooms to deluxe rooms. The deluxe rooms were great. We were supposed to have the same amentities as the Royal Club, however, the Royal Club staff was not responsive in taking care of our requests. Overall, not sure the extra amentities were worth the price difference.The beaches were magnificent! In other reviews they suggest getting to the beach early to save chairs. Our advice is go to the beach bar, watch the seats you want and after 30 minutes, move the towels and enjoy. Many days we noticed people who saved seats never showed up!The food was ok. Plenty of options on the buffetts, but who really goes to Punta Cana for italian food or steak? Bar tenders were great, especially Rosio at the Royal Club Bar. You have to ask for premium liquor, they hide the bottles so you have to ask.We did 2 excursions. The Catalina Island Tour and the Jeep Tour. Preferred the Jeep Tour by far. Both are all day, but the Jeep tour is more organized. You go to sugar cane fields, a plantation, a horse farm, a school, through the mountains and to the beach. Well worth it. The Catalina tour was unorganized and not nearly as much fun. Just ask questions on how long the tours are, how long to get to where you want to go and how you're getting there. The roads are horrible and full of potholes, so you want to be comfortable.What we liked: the beaches and the barsWhat we disliked: Royal Club employees ","annotations":[{"endOffset":261,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":257},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":334},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":334},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":334},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":334},{"endOffset":420,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":416},{"endOffset":604,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":600},{"endOffset":719,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":715},{"endOffset":719,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":715},{"endOffset":719,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":715},{"endOffset":744,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":740},{"endOffset":744,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":740},{"endOffset":744,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":740},{"endOffset":744,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":740},{"endOffset":744,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":740},{"endOffset":1316,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1312},{"endOffset":1349,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":1342}]}
