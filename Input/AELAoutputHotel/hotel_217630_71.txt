{"text":"Good Low Gloss Hotel in High Rent New York Hotel 414 is definitely a low gloss hotel, not for those who require a smooth shiny surface in their hotels. I found it pleasant, ideally situated and comfortable enough, once I climbed the 3 flights of stairs to my room (getting exercise on your vacation is a good thing). And apparently $150 per night is a steal in New York. I'm guessing that the building was one of the residential brownstones on the block that got converted to hotel\/bed and breakfast status (the sign outside the place said bed and breakfast).I particularly appreciate hotels that are in quieter, more residential areas near the center of town. Hotel 414 fit this perfectly, being sited on a quiet residential street a couple of blocks west of the Theatre District and a few more minutes' walk to Times Square. 9th Avenue, the commercial street around the corner, has lots of moderately priced restaurants and bakeries, and a bus line (the nearest subway station is on 8th).The bed was comfortable, the room had enough lighting but was dark enough at night, there was that huge TV (there was also the armoire for the previous TV, which nobody had yet bothered to remove!) The air conditioning worked and wasn't excessively noisy. The room was kept clean and I was too busy huffing and puffling on the (narrow) stairway to notice its condition. As someone who likes baths, the bathtub was awfully shallow. The breakfast looked pretty lame to me--stale pastries in a city full of wonderful bakeries, so I skipped it. The lobby was minimal but it did have a free internet connected computer, a helpful amenity for those of us who don't travel with laptops.
