{"text":"A wonderful hotel, a perfect vacation.. I booked a partial ocean view for 8 nights at the outrigger. We were told on arrival we were being upgraded for free to an ocean front room.. the man who checked us in kept saying not to tell anyone he would get fired for upgrading is for free.. he made a big deal out of it, however we were not upgraded. That was my only complaint about the outrigger.. we were fine with the room we booked untill we thought we had an upgrade only to find out we were lied to. That being said... Room:we were on the cheesecake factory side of the building directly beside the fan, where everyone said is the worst place to be, however we had no problems. The part of our view that was ocean was wonderful, and the part that was city was nice too. The fan was not very loud and when the door was closed you couldnt hear it at all from inside the room. You could hear a flush from the bathroom next dr in the middle of the night but nothing you would hear if you werent already awake. The Bed's were comfortable, room was cleaned well every day. It was not a huge room, but a very good size for the two of us. Loved the in room fridge, we were always bringing home leftovers and eating some the next day.Food:We ate at all 3 restraunts and both aggreed Dukes is best for a snack and a drink atmosphere was nice but food was just ok. Hula grill was the best breakfast we ate the entire vacation. The pancakes with coconut syrup was amazing. And Chucks steak house was very expensive but totally worth it, small portions but the food was good. Pool\/beach:We never had any problems getting a good spot on the beach day or night. And everytime we went to the pool we always found 2 seats side by side. When the pool man was there, there were always towls, ice water and friendly staff. Other:We went to the hot tub one night to have a drink, wow a big mistake, you can not drink anything in the hot tub, so we got out of the tub and I forgot my id in the room, so i sent my fiancee to get drinks, they wouldnt serve him because he was only in swim trunks, So he went to the room to get his shirt and ID and still couldnt get us drinks because we both needed to be present to get 2 drinks. Finally we gave up, went to the room, got both ID, both completly dressed and down to get a seat at a table to get drinks.. finally we got served. A lot of work. But after we knew we always went prepared. No problem at all with a wait for the elevators, always room, sometime empty, but dont forget your card! You cant go up to your room without a room card. Over all:I loved this hotel, as did my boyfriend who ended up proposing to me in front of dukes on the beach one night. This location will always be special to us, we will always return to outrigger if we go back to waikiki.
