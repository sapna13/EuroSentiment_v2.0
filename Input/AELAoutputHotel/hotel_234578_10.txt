{"text":"A Wonderful Find In Barcelona My wife, 13 year old son, and I stayed here for two nights following a cruise. I read about the hotel on the web on multiple sites, including Trip Advisor. We wanted to be reasonably close to Las Ramblas and the Old City, and we wanted a reasonable price for the hotel, particularly given the poor exchange rate for the U.S. dollar. We were delighted with the result.The hotel is directly across from the Estacio Franco, so one can whisk from the airport to the hotel in an air conditioned train, cross the street, and enter the hotel. It is a short walk to the Picasso Museum, and the hotel backs up to the Ciutat Vella (Barri Gotic). We were also walking distance to the sea, and only a 30 minute walk from Sagrada Familia (a walk we would recommend)The room was reasonably spacious by European standards, with a fold out couch\/bed for our son and two twins together as a double for my wife and me. The bath was actually large and spacious, and well equipped with every amenity from hair dryer to bidet to high pressure shower. Breakfast was included and to our surprise and enjoyment included eggs and bacon as well as wonderful croissants, fresh squeezed orange juice, cheese, and the traditional elements of a continental breakfast. Wireless Internet was also provided without additional charge.We enjoyed large bath towels, good air conditioning, a a free safe in the room for valuables.There is a lounge on the 1st or 2nd floor (lobby is 0) with comfortable chairs, etc. The staff was quite fluent in English and extraordinarily gracious and helpful. The hotel was perfect for our needs in every way--comfortable, reasonably priced, conveniently located, and aesthetically pleasing, as well as clean. We would readily return the next time we are in Barcelona. We had 4 or 5 star amenities at a 2 star price.
