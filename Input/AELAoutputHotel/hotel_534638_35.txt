{"text":"Beautiful Hotel, Polluted Beach We recently stayed at the Sofitel in Seminyak Bali. This was our second year to Bali and decided this yr to try staying in Ubud and Seminyak as well as Tanjung Benoa and everything I read about the Sofitel Hotels sounded fantastic.We found the hotel overall was very nice and we also received an upgraded room which was very well appointed, clean and looked to be newly refurbished...very nice room.We found the staff were friendly and helpful and the food was excellent. We ate at the Husk Restaurant where the dinner was excellent and a little pricey compared to some of the restaurants down the street but deffinately worth it.The pool was nice although we felt it was small and alittle awkwardly laid out but always clean, good lounge chairs and towels and terrific service. The biggest problem we had with the hotel was that the beach was a HUGE disappointment...very dirty, garbage, plastic bags, you name it strewn all over the beach and the waves and current are so strong you cannot swim in the area. We took photos of the beach as even we could not beleive how dirty it was! This was a huge turnoff. Also it is a public beach so on Sunday hundreds of people are out on the beach playing soccer so it can be really busy.The construction next door does go on all day and just about all night and when you are at the pool you can see and hear what is going on and you will notice it a bit the first couple of days and then it becomes a bit of background noise and we did forget about it. We found the biggest problem with the construction was that they worked just about all night so when it was quiet late at night and you were in your room you could see the lights and hear a little bit of noise.On the plus side, very friendly staff, very helpful and an excellent breakfast selection...you name it they had it available ","annotations":[{"endOffset":425,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":421}]}
