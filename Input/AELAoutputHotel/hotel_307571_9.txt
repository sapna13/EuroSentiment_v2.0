{"text":"Fantastic holiday at a super resort Fantastic holiday at a super resort. We loved our villa, which had good wifi for my husband and was very roomy even with the cot in it. The bathroom was very luxurious and we felt like we were in our own little house rather than just a room.The staff and service were superb. Best holiday we have had with our daughter (age 2). Excellent kids club and little paddling pool, very close to where the sun loungers on the beach so could easily keep an eye on little one. For those without children there are other loungers far away from the kids club, so you don't feel you are swarmed by children! The staff were lovely and had a genuine love of children. We spent most of our holiday playing with our daughter at the club as it was so accessible and close to the beach.The food was lovely, particularly breakfast, and the children's menu was varied and healthy.Extra touches, such as putting a child barrier around our plunge pool were very much appreciated.We had a lovely babysitter in the evenings and she even phoned us to let us know our daughter was asleep without us asking which was very thoughtful and meant we could enjoy the evening knowing she was happily tucked up in bed.Although the hotel is very child friendly we were recommended it by couples without kids and it would suit both types of holiday very well.I had 2 spa treatments and my husband had one. They were excellent. My pregnancy massage was the best I have ever had and the therapist was properly trained and knew exactly what she was doing.We found the trip very relaxing and enjoyed the lack of vendors on the beach, which I have found particularly irritating on previous holidays.10 out of 10 to all at the Four Seasons Jimbaran Bay. We hope we can come back soon and enjoy your hospitality again!
