{"text":"Like staying with your cool Italian relatives If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a small, chic, family-run hotel in the heart of Florence, you probably won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do much better than Hotel Davanzati. The charming family owners greet you with recognition as you come and go, making you feel comfortable and at home.GETTING THERE: We took a 22 euro, fixed-rate cab ride from the airport. On Sunday evening, at least, it was incredibly quick and easy. If arriving by train, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° hire a cab to take you to the hotel. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not real far, but the roads aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ideal for dragging bags.LOCATION: Perfect. You can walk to almost anywhere, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ off the beaten path just enough to provide some quiet. The exterior stairs up actually provide a greater sense of refuge and peace from the street.  ABOUT THOSE STAIRS: Lots of talk about the stairs on Trip Advisor, but honestly, they aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that bad. Get staff to carry up your bags if you need help. Otherwise, the reality of visiting Florence is tons of stairs and cobblestone streets. Think of the stairs as a screening, just like old second-story dentists figured their patients were healthy enough for dental work if they survived the stairs.  ROOMS: Not huge, but clean and functional. Simple, minimalist urban d√ã√\u2022√ñcor. Internet√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a big plus. We had a little noise from our neighbor√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room a couple nights, but my earplugs solve that. HAPPY HOUR: With lights dimmed and techno jazz playing, we felt much cooler than we really are.PRICE: We had a 182 euro rate but got a 10% discount by paying cash. Tomasso can quote you your exact discount total before check-out so you can accrue enough cash. (You need to pay 100% cash to get the discount√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√®ot a combination of cash and credit cards√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√áut well worth the trouble.) We liked using the ATM inside the post office across the street.FAMILY OWNERS: I think the family element√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the magic to this place. Have Fabrizio pour you some wine at happy hour. Visit with his chic wife, Patricia, and ask how this 50-something grandmother gets to work each day. (A Vespa!) Sister-in-law Sofia made us great caf√ã√\u2022√ñ√à√\u2020\u2022?lattes at breakfast and convinced us to visit the Pitti Palace. Tomasso, the charming son, resembles a 1950√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ movie idol√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√ßike where young American girls fall in love with the devastatingly handsome young Italian man. (He will blush when he reads this, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ true.)CONCLUSION: Hotel Davanzati√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a great little gem for travelers who want something other than a cookie-cutter experience. Like maybe warmth, charm and ideal location. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2265,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":2259}]}
