{"text":"Non Habla Espagnol After spending a week at Bahia Principe, we are glad to return to Toronto. We travelled as a family and found both pros and cons to this resort.Beach: There is seaweed and sand. The water is not clear. However, the sand is nice and white. We were not able to find shade most of the time. The beach is also very small. All water activities are over-priced.Pools: The pools were always packed with people and unfortunately, the water was very very hot( the jacuzzis and the pools use the same water).Food: Decent. You won't go hungry but don't expect gourmet meals. The french, mexican and japanese a la carte restaurants were better than the buffets.Entertainment: Terrible. The largest problem we had with this resort was that most employees there did not know how to speak english or even french. We found that if you did not speak spanish, you did not get as much attention, hence, bad service. The nightly shows were all in spanish so we did not understand much but the dancing shows deserved an A for effort but not for presentation. We spent a whole week saying non habla espagnolThere is also a casino where you can kill an hour or so.Rooms: The rooms were clean enough with the occasional creepy crawlers. There were little ants on the dressers and ants crawling on the walls.Due to the massive size of this resort, there is a train\/taxi service that drives you to one end of the resort to the other. Tipping is optinal but is always appreciated. The alcoholic beverages were exremely weak.Having been to Cuba three times before, Dominican pales in comparison. Although it was not a bad vacation, we will not be going back mainly because of the language barrier.In conclusion, North American tourists: STAY AWAY! This resort is mainly for Europeans!
