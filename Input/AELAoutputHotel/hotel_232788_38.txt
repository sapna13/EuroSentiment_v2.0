{"text":"Average The rooms were not great, but were okay for a week's stay. The beds were not too uncomfortable. Considering how much time you actually spend in the hotel room during vacation, it was tolerable. We had the triple room, since we were travelling with a six year old. it was very spacious for the 3 of us. The staff were extremely nice and very helpful. They were able to get my husband tickets for a match, which he was extremely ecstatic about, being the futbol fanatic that he is. Breakfast was decent. It consisted of eggs, fruit, cold cereal, sweet breads, toast, hard rolls, meats, yougurts, juice and coffee. One draw back, was there were no irons or ironing boards. We had to go buy a small travel one. The great thing about this hotel, is the location. It is literally in the middle of everything! Las Ramblas is just right down the street. El Corte Inglese is around the corner. Pastry shops and cafes right in front and to teh side of teh hotel. It especially makes a big diffrence when shopping all day or tired of sightseeing, that you can comeback to rest or drop off your bags. We definitely learned our lesson last year in Rome, after staying in a suburban hotel away from the city . I would rather put up with the hustle  bustle of a major city, then hike back to your hotel w\/ a tired  cranky 6yr. old after a long day of sightseeing.
