{"text":"Paradise!! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Sirenis Tropical in Punta Cana for our summer vacation and it was unbelievably gorgeous! The grounds are very well maintained, gardeners are always out keeping the grounds in immaculate shape and are more than happy to climb a tree for you for a coconut. Pool was gorgeous, very very big and was at just that perfect temperature. If you want to get a chair around the pool that is in the shade you must go early though, they fill up quickly. Buffets were great...food tasted very good. The beach was beautiful, however the most central area to swim in the ocean had a bit of seaweed floating around but if you walk about 2 minutes down it clears up. The staff at this resort are probably the most friendly people you'll ever meet!! We made very good friends with Phillipe and Fedor (bartenders) at La Pergola bar...they made our stay about 20 times more fun as they were sooo hilarious and kind. The drinks were amazing, especially one called a Marco Polo and the bartenders are definitely not cheap on the amount of liqor....you're glass will be about 3\/4 liqor and a splash of juice or pop unless you tell them otherwise. We did get a helpful piece of advice about the drinks from our travel guide....any drink that has creme de coco i believe it was called such as the Coco Loco drink are best to stay away from as the creme de coco is considered a laxative there!! The only thing I would have to say that I didnt like about this resort was that the front desk never seemed to have any small american bills which was quite a problem as most of our bills were 20s and we wanted some smaller bills to tip the bartenders and other friendly staff so make sure to change your money earlier. Besides that though this was an amazing resort, we would go back in a second so dont listen to any of the bad reveiws. ","annotations":[]}
