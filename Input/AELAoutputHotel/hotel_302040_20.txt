{"text":"Amazing Hotel - World Class We stayed at the Peninsula Hong Kong on two occassions in June 2008. Previoiusly I was a Hong Kong Ritz Carlton loyalist but this property has been shut down for redevelopment giving me an opportunity to experience the wonderful Peninsula Hong Kong.Airport arrival service and Rolls Royce transfers arranged by the Peninsula are highly recommended. They whisked us through the Hong Kong airport on a golf buggy, handled all baggage for us and loaded us into a Rolls for the 30 minute trip to the Peninsula.Upon arrival we were immediately whisked up to a full harbour view suite on the 22nd floor. Simply amazing view of Central Hong Kong. The skyline view was breathtaking from the vantage point of the suite. Room registration was taken care of in room. A butler immediately began unpacking our suitcases for us whilst another staff member served welcome tea.The Room:We booked a full harbour view suite and it was palatial with a large dining area, comfortable living room, entryway and a massive master bedroom and opulent marble ensuite bathroom with deep soaking tub. Views from all rooms of the amazing Hong Kong skyline.The decor is traditional Hong Kong British Colonial meets modern China.....comfortable and traditional. Very well thought out design touches making the suite a superb home.Gym  SpaThe gym is adequately sized with new equipment and a personal trainer on duty. Unfortunately we did not have time to enjoy a spa treatment but the spa looked over the top luxurious and indulgent....perhaps next time.Food  Beverage:Afternoon tea at the Peninsula is a tourist attraction brining in hordes of non hotel guests making the lobby a bit of a mob scene during the day. However do not despair; simply mention you are a hotel guest and you'll be at the top of the line. Afternoon tea is superb and offers great people watching in one of the world's most attractive and happeninig hotel lobbies.Room service was superb. Deliciously prepared food served quickly and very professionally.Unfortunately we did not have time to experience any of the Peninsula's other dining options but I am certain they would be excellent.Service:Across the board service was immediate and very professional. A 12 AM call for a prescription refill resulted in an on premises nurse visiting my suite within 10 minutes with the prescription in hand. Amazing.Concierge is world class, well connected and an invaluable resource at this hotel. Overall the Peninsula is a special hotel suitable for all of us whom are passionate about superlative hotel experiences. Highly recommended!
