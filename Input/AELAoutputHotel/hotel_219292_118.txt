{"text":"Fooled by Reviews I had been staying at the Hilton Village Resort for 8 nights prior to switching hotels for a change of view. The reviews posted on tripadvisor looked promising and they had 1 room left at a pay for 2 get 1 free night rate. All indications gave the impression that this newly renovated hotel was going to be a decent 4-star hotel similar to the Hilton. So I booked 3 nights. Here is a side by side comparison of a true 4 star hotel (Hilton), even though I thought it was only a 3.5 when I was there, versus the Wyland.At arrival:Hilton - Greeter escorted me to check-in desk. Full time doorman. Bellman brought bags to room.Wyland - Not a sole around as taxi driver helps drag bag up front steps. Lobby empty. 1 person at check-in desk. No bellman.Room:Hilton - Quiet - Spacious King - average sized Lanai - Sofa Bed - Arm chair - Coffee Table - Desk - Dresser\/TV Stand - 32 LCD TV - Coffee Stand - Bathroom is actually 3 separate rooms plus a large closet.Wyland - Tiny double twin (promised a King but none available) - tiny bath\/shower - tiny Lanai - wall A\/C - tiny desk - tiny dresser\/TV stand - 27LCD TV. As I walked in and placed my bags against the wall I had no room to manuever. The A\/C came on and it was loud. I forced open the sliding door to the lanai to get busy city street noise. This was no 4-star. I immediately went back to the lobby and asked if they had better rooms. One King overlooking the pool remained for $40 more. I declined. Right then I asked if I could cancel the reservations. They said if hotels.com would agree to it, then they would refund my prepayment. (It was too late in the day to move again so I knew I was stuck for the night.) I went back to my room, logged on (good luck finding an outlet) and selected Outrigger Waikiki (another 4-star) on hotels.com. (The Sheraton was booked) Best move I made. Well worth the extra dollars. One additional item - As I entered the room I let the door close - or so I thought. Within 5 minutes Security was knocking at my door. Apparently, the extra coat of paint to hide the old decor was too thick to allow the door to close properly. You had to push the door to get it to close all the way. The security person also started me to think that this wasn't the best part of the Waikiki area. But back to the comparisons:Beds:Hilton - comfortable - plushwyland - hardboards - enough said!Bathroom:Hilton - This 3 room plus closet bathroom was larger than the entire Wyland room.Wyland - Tiny - Tiny - Tiny. I am no big person 5'8 185#. To use the sink and counter which was as wide as this keyboard, was a joke. I had to rest my left leg against the toilet, the corner of the counter was directly in my crotch, and my elbow hit the wall on the right as I brushed my teeth. As I leaned over to rinse, the contemporary faucet handle had a nice pointy rod aimed right for my eyes. Also, absolutely no room to place anything on the counter. Seriously folks - this was a room for little people! Half the towels as the Hilton as well.Closet:Hilton - Spacious with built in lighting with a safe at eye level.Wyland - I had to shimmy sideways next to the bed to access the closet. The safe was on the floor and I could only get on 1 knee to use it.I could go on and on but I won't. Leave it to say that there exist way better places to stay then the Wyland unless you are Tiny Tim. OK - one more comment - the artist Wyland should stick to pictures of sea life and stay out of the hotel designing business. The decor is cheap contemporary and not warm at all. This place is intended for those less traveled and who are involved in the world of Art. The clientele I observed there support this statement.Bottom Line: If you have kids - go to the Hilton Village Resort. If you want to be closer to the action on the Waikiki strip then go to the Outrigger Waikiki. Either way, both are a much more pleasant and comfortable stay and both are right on the beach. At best this is a 2 1\/2 star hotel.
