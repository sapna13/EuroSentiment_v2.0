{"text":"Super 8 Hotel with (Cheap) Lipstick Just an awful experience - Many complaints from a guy that hardly complains at all.1. Breakfast ended early without warning. I wish I could review the breakfast items, but good luck finding any. When asked at the front desk, the guy didn't even apologize or offer any alternatives. Advice - get there at 7 AM and stock up for the entire week.2. OK, hotel was painted in trendy colors. Painting is easy, but if you don't truly upgrade appliances, sinks, and other parts of a pre-existing hotel, it's like putting lipstick on a pig. Even the painting was fairly sloppy in places. Carpet all over the building in the common areas was problematic.3. Fitness center was a joke. It is a converted hotel room, except they also took the TV out of it.4. Warning to those in the summer - rooms open to an outdoors courtyard area. This is not one of those newer hotels that have an indoor atrium. The heat hits you like a brick.5. Rooms were spacious, but bathrooms were small and there were numerous problems all around. Rooms looked like they were newly painted, but everything else inside the room reminded me of 1970s (meaning that everything appeared as if it was built in 1970s). Bathtub slowly released water (after about an hour it was empty).6. Most of the minibar items had expired dates. This isn't usually a problem for me since I hardly use it, but the special was that I would receive a $20 minibar credit. It wasn't stocked with enough unexpired items to even get to that point. I'm very curious how all of the positive reviews got here given the numerous problems that were so plainly evident. Even the service staff didn't appear all that concerned when we informed them of the problems. ","annotations":[]}
