{"text":"Fantastic hotel but wished I had a different room This hotel is amazing. Everything about it was wonderful and pretty much how I imagined it would be. We stayed for 3 nights in Feb. I could go on and on about how fabulous the room was and how helpful the staff were and how great all the extras were as other reviewers have done, but I can't really add to what's already been said. Stay here, you will not regret it. It will become your favorite hotel.That being said, I had two very minor disappointments. One being the room given to us (room 101). We had booked a deluxe canal view room months in advance. Upon arrival we were given probably the smallest room in the hotel. The bathroom didn't have a bath, only a shower (a fantastic shower it should be said). But even with a small room minus a bath, it was still fine, we still had a great time. I could've asked to be moved but decided it really wasn't worth the bother. The next time I go, I will ask to see different rooms\/configurations and will probably not choose a canal view room (we were hardly there). The second disappointment was the fee charged for wireless connection in the room (10 euros for 60 minutes). Since everything about this hotel is all-inclusive, I didn't understand why wireless wasn't included. There were 2 computers with free internet in the lobby, but for someone like me, working on the go from my laptop, lobby computers were not an option. Banks should either offer free wireless, or find a different internet access provider to offer better rates for their guests.The time we spent in the lobby by the fireplace after a full day of sightseeing was something we will always remember. Thank you Banks, we will be back. ","annotations":[]}
