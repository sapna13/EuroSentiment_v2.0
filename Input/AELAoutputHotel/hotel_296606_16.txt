{"text":"luxer ain`t luxurious The taxi really couldn`t have dropped us off much nearer. The RLD is mostly pedestrianised apart from bikes and service vehicles. The hotel itself is in the midst of the RLD where we had booked to be. Soooo we checked in and the credit card was swiped and everything seemed good and we held out our eager, tired hands for our keycard, only to be told that there was a problem with our room and we were to be given alternative accomodation elsewhere. only 5 minutes away. Eventually someone came 30minutes later and led us on a 20 minute trail to a dodgy looking bedsit which I`m not sure even had windows, only to be then told if we wanted breakfast we would need to go back to the hotel! To cut a long story short, we stomped backed to the Luxer where the receptionist grudgingly gave us the key to another room in the hotel but said it was for people yet to book in. We weren`t pleased but were tired so acccepted, but apparently she gave us an incorrect key for an occupied room. Eventually we recieved the correct keycard for an empty room. The room was very basic and could do with a few lessons from budget hotels who know what they are doing. This is not three star as most people would know it. Try 1 or 2 star at 4 or 5 star prices. Forget a view, but we did have fun re-naming the tv channels. Next day whilst indulging in a siesta, the intended occupants (we assume) entered our room. Thankfully, they had the sense to about turn and leave! All through or stay we were making trips up and down to reception to have our key re-activated. Very annoying.Important Stuff. The rooms were clean enough. The cleaner was an English man and the toilets were spotless and the towels changed daily. The air con was rubbish. I wasn`t particularly impressed by the buffet breakfast. Although the fruit, when there was fruit, was welcome. Amsterdam is VERY VERY VERYexpensive, especially for drink and very very seedy. We were constantly being asked by various individuals if we were looking for Charlie. In the RLD, there are mainly 4 kinds of shop - coffee, pub, restaurant and sex stuff. 3 days were enough. I`d like to go back to Amsterdam one day and do the museums. But I won`t be booking this hotel again. Especially when there are familiar chain hotels nearby such as the Ibis which is right next to the train station. Book really early.P.S. my other half has just proofed this article and said I was very generous. Words mentioned were piece of **** and don`t do it!Not about my article, about the hotel, I believe!
