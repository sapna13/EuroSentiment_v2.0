{"text":"Still the best hotel service in Singapore I've been a frequent guest at Royal Plaza on Scotts for well over two years. When the hotel closed for renovation in the fall of 2006, I very much anticipated the 2007 re-opening. The hotel rooms had become tired and run down and a full renovation was long overdue.Two weeks ago, the Royal Plaza re-opened for business, but to date, only floors 12 (Premier), 13, 14  15 (Club) are available to guests. All other floors are still in the process of renovation and are scheduled to re-open in March 2007.Anxious to check out the new digs, I booked a club room for two nights. I was given a room on the 12th floor (Premier), and was told the room was the same as those on the club floors above. I also had access to the club floor facilities.When I checked in I expressed concern about possible construction noise and was told the work would stop at 8 pm. This was not to be - on both nights drilling and hammering continued well past 10 pm. I contacted the front desk and the noise ceased shortly thereafter.The room was nice, but felt small. The bathrooms are bigger than before and contain separate tub and shower stall with rain shower. Understandably, the extra space needed for the bathroom was taken from the rest of the room.There were HUGE bath sheets (almost too big) and plenty of nice amentities in the bathroom. The room was nicely decorated and the bed was comfortable with a crisp cotton duvet. It felt completely geared to business travelers - there was a corner unit work station with an attached mini bar, and a single wing back chair. Gone are the small round tables and chairs, the vanity and small TVS. Now there are large 32 flat screen TV's mounted on the wall with a few shelves beneath the TV for storage.There's a safe and coffee making area in the closet. What I liked most - improved air conditioning system, comfortable bed, big TV with decent choice of stations to choose from and best of all, the same incredibly gracious employees I've come to know over the past two years. The service at the Royal Plaza is the best I have ever enountered anywhere. The employees are genuinely helpful and friendly. And get this, the entire hotel is now completely smoke free! What I didn't care for - room felt small and seemed designed for one person, there was no clock, and the corner work station overwhelmed the room, there was a lip on the door threshold leading into the bathroom which was easy to trip over.Breakfast, high tea and cocktail hour on the club floor are similar to before the renovation. Food choices have changed a bit, but it all seems a bit fussy - fancy nibbles displayed on tiny odd shaped china, small pieces of pastry tipped into delicate stemware, etc.Will I go back ? Absolutely, but I'll most likely wait until the rest of the hotel is open and book a non club floor room. The location of the hotel and the consistently good service are enough to bring me back.
