{"text":"Impressive but cold and noisy The staff in all areas was very polite and always helpful. The breakfast buffet was impressive. We stayed in the Harbor room on the 8th floor √à√\u2020\u2022?the room was extraordinary.The hotel is very well decorated, but it felt very cold because the main colors are black and red. The only issue was the noise. From the inside it is the Morton√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ bar, which gets very busy in the evenings and you can hear the noise in the bathroom and the room entrance. From the outside, there was a building work going on opposite of the hotel, which started early in the morning till 8pm. It was very disturbing and it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stop during the weekend at all. Please note that I was there in Oct. 2006, so I am not sure if this is still going on √à√\u2020\u2022?check with your tour operator or directly with the hotel. Also near Esplanade is a place which holds some live music concerts, which are also very disturbing. On Friday night it went on until 1 am. The swimming pool and the area around are very nice with a great view at day and night. But again it was very noisy because of the building work on the harbor side. I can accept the typical city noise, but this was a bit too much. The windows in the hotel room cannot be opened and yet I could hear all that noise inside.The fitness room was quite small for hotel with such a capacity. ","annotations":[]}
