{"text":"Great Time, Fun and Relaxing My wife and I traveled to Excellence Punta Cana from 8\/15 - 8\/22. We had a wonderful time. I will attempt to break this trip report down in several sections:Transport to\/from airport: Excellence is about one hour from the airport. The shuttle has a\/c and the drivers try to get you there as soon as possible. Yes, the roads are bumpy. My advice - enjoy the countryside and see how the other half lives.The resort: It is very nicely done. The lobby is top of the line and immaculate. We had a junior suite with a garden view. The room was plenty big and the a\/c worked. A minor compliant was the shower - on the small side and the mini-refrig. didn't keep the beverages to cold. We had a king sized bed, jacuzzi, tv, and mini-refrigerator that was stocked with beer, pop and juice. Upon arrival there was a complimentary bottle of rum. All in all the room was appropriate for our needs.The Beach: the beach is beautiful!!!!! Nice soft sand and plenty of shady areas. This is the best beach we have been on. We have stayed in Cancun, Ocho Rios, Mayan Riveria, Virginia Beach and Mytrle Beach and other resorts in Punta Cana.The water is warm and in some spots blue. As stated in previous reviews the waves are stronger than one might think. With that said the waves didn't bother me. I enjoyed them as I wave busted. Honestly though the waves aren't that big of a deal. No different than the waves at Virgnina or Mrytle Beaches.On most days the waiter staff took drink orders or brought the drink of the day right to you on the beach. Additionally, wait staff would bring food on to the beach in case you didn't want to leave the beach and go to the restaurant. Don't be upset if the wait staff doesn't come to you. You eat and drink plenty so use this as an opportunity to walk to the nearest bar and get a drink and burn up some calories.Restaurants: There are seven restaurants to choose from - Spice, Spanish, French, Mexican, Italian, the Grill and the Lobster House. Our favorite was the Lobster House. We went there twice and had grilled lobster. What a good meal!!!! Plenty of good food at the Mexican restaurant. Next came the Grill, Italian and Spice restaurants. We didn't care for the Spanish restaurant and the French restaurant didn't have anything to our tastes. I did hear plenty of good things though about the French restaurant. For breakfast and lunch you can go to the buffet which is located at the Italian restaurant - Toscana. The food was good. They serve tradidition breakfast and lunch foods along with left overs from the previous night. All in all the food was very good. No complaints and we didn't get sick.Entertainment staff: They all work very hard to get people involved if they so desire. Francisico and Franklin stood out but they all did a wonderful job. We had the pleasure of staying at Excellence when rain storms from Hurricane Dean went through. The entertainment staff got out board games in the lobby for people to play and participate in. The nightly entertainment was good. As stated in previous posts the Michael Jackson show was good. They had a 70's and 80's show, a magic show, a Dominican show, etc. You are on vacation so sit back and enjoy!!!Jose, Kenny and Greison are wonderful bartenders. They do a great job of making drinks and making you feel like you are important. We did leave tips for the maids, bartenders, waiters. Thye greatly appreicated it!!! They work 11 consecutive days and then have three days off.There are stores off the property (off to the left)with decent prices. You can walk on the beach. About 1\/4 of a mile to the left of the resort you will find a slice of heaven. Perfect water and caribbean perfection.Go and have a good time. You will enjoy the vacation if you relax. The pools are nice but we are beach people. The people are friendly.
