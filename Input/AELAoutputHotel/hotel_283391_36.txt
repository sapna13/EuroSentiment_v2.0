{"text":"Thank God for beautiful beaches! My husband and I have traveled to the Domincan Republic 5 times in the last year and a half. We have always stayed at the Riu resorts because they are wonderful. We decided to try something new, so we stayed at the Palladium Palace. Well, it is NO palace! It is an average hotel in appearance with other hotels connected, but nowhere did I see anything that resembled a palace. The grounds are large enough that they offer a train to move around the complex, but each connected hotel looks exactly the same as the other.DURING OUR STAY WE WERE WITHOUT CABLE ON AND OFF THE ENTIRE STAY, WITHOUT WATER FOR A DAY, WITHOUT ELECTRIC FOR A DAY, AND WITHOUT AIR CONDITIONING FOR THE LAST 2 DAYS OF OUR STAY, AND WE WERE ONLY THERE FOR 5 NIGHTS!!!! The response we received was, we'll have it fixed in a half an hour each time we asked. Finally at bedtime, we went to the front desk to complain again. They gave us another room to sleep in for the night... and another room... and another room because the rooms they sent us to were without air as well. One room was a loft with the air unit postitioned under the floor were the bed was, so in addition to the air conditioner not working, we had to lay in a shaking bed while the useless air conditioner fans turned. I know these things can happen anywhere, but how it is handled make all the difference. Of course, no one seemed to care that we were unhappy. We are not picky or demanding at all. All we are interested in is the beach, sun, ocean, and a few room luxuries like water, electric, cable, and air. Is that too much to ask? If you want to stay at a great resort, go to the Riu Palace. It actually is a PALACE! We have never had a problem there, in fact this is the first time I have ever written a negative review.
