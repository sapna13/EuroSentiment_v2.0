{"text":"ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE Live in New York and have lived in Dallas so i was encouraged by some of the other reviews posted, comparing this dump to some amazing properties like the Mansion in Dallas.I was supposed to stay here for 10 days but I finally gave up on the horrible location, lousy service and cheap pretend furniture, and left after 4 days. At the begginning of the week, the area is a ghost town. Other than a couple of pubs, there is nothing here. As bad as that is, come Thursday I regretted my complaints. On Thursday this club location turns into a loud-kids only -hang out. Mobs of kids, shootings etc. Bring A bullet proof vest and ear plugs. I finally gave up and left on Friday.The rooms are spacious but furnished from a cheap bargain store. Scratches and chips everywhere. Linen, while nice at some previous point, were bear and some even had stains. Room service??? Now there was a joke. It basically did not exist, and the one time it did arrive within an hour of ordering, the fries were soggy, and the salad was wilted.When I tried to complain, I just got a run around and some condesending results, suggesting that Bloor St is more my location. So I took their advice and moved to one of the Hotels in that area and had an absolutely amazing time. Toronto is GREAT but the SOHO MET is a DUMP. I am inb my 40's, so maybe I have been around too long to know when to move on, and I did OUT of the SOHO. And so should anyoneone else that is unfortunate enough to have booked here.
