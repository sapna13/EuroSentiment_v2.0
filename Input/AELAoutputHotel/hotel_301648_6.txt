{"text":"Tranquility We stayed here for 5 nights in Sept08 - the last leg of our honeymoon. At first I was a bit disconcerted at no TV in the room and at how remote it felt, but it really worked out to be a fabulous stay. The stay were really courteous and helpful. The room was great, it's not huge, but the outdoor shower is a real novelty and contrary to previous reviews is not overlooked (would take acrobatic effort!) The turn down service includes candle on balcony and mosquito coil being lit. The cosmetics included are lovely. There are quite a lot of steps in the property so it's not for those of limited movement. The pool looks fab and they have extra comfy sunbeds laid out on the grass when the deckchairs are full so don't be too concerned about that. You also get complimentary drink and snacks by the pool in the afternoon. There's free internet access and a big satellite tv in the library. We were extremely well treated with upgrades and free meals\/treatments etc. The spa is also lovely and would recommend the balinese massage as it put me to sleep! Fabulous!The prices they charge for drivers and taxis are more expensive than you'll find from Ubud so I'd recommend going down there and negotiate with a local driver to look after you for the duration of your stay. We got one guy to take us around all the sights for a full day for 500,000RP. Ubud has some great restaurants which are to be recommended - specifically Lotus Cafe, Indus and Jazz Cafe were nice. The restaurant in Alila is lovely and would recommend eating there at least one night. ","annotations":[]}
