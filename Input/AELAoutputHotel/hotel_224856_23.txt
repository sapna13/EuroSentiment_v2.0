{"text":"Great Place and Location We selected this hotel as part of a package for an extended weekend in Seattle. To start with, the location is great, right on Lake Union near several restaurants, downtown, the Space Needle, etc. We had a car but you could probably do without if needed. The light rail and busses run right by the hotel and take you all over the city with frequent and easy access. If you do have a car, the hotel charges $19 to park in their secured garage or you can find metered street parking for less than half (which we did with no problems). The hotel has recently been remodeled and the rooms are some of the best I have seen for this brand. Very roomy, nice d√ã√\u2022√ñcor, nicely equipped modern kitchens, great comfortable bed, plenty of drawer and closet space, large flat screen tvs in both the bedroom and living areas. It is easy to spread out and even have a little privacy if you have more than a couple of you. For the working types, there is a nice work area with free high speed internet and comfortable desk and chair. The staff was very helpful and knowledgeable about the area. The hotel does appear to cater to families (and allows the family pet too which you see many of so that may or may not be OK with you). The hotel is busy and sometimes elevators and such are slow due to this but while the hotel was quite full, we never heard our neighbors (the lobby was a buzz but the rooms were quiet). We had a room that faced the back (not the lake) but this was fine and quiet. The lake side actually is along a fairly busy street so it has a little more noise but you get the views of the marinas, seaplanes, etc. I ran one morning along the lake which was great and I felt safe (and saw other runners out). Of course exercise caution since it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a mix of nice residential, commercial, industrial and some transient all in the area but overall you should be fine to walk to local places, etc. They gym has decent equipment (but not a lot of it). A couple treadmills, a couple elliptical√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, one bike and some weights (barbells and a universal weight machine). The gym area is small and gets crowded and a little stuffy (indoor right by the pool) but if you go off √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√®√¶ours you should have no problem. They have an indoor pool and spa which is great for the kids and have adult only swimming hours also (later in the evening).The breakfast is extensive but busy. There are also some great restaurants within walking distance offering all kinds of cuisine and many with outdoor patios onto the lake. Nothing beats having a drink or bite on the lake front on a sunny day in Seattle. I would definitely stay here again, loved the location, the room and the staff.
