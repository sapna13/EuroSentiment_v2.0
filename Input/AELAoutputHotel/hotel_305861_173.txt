{"text":"I did't want to leave!!!! My son  I stayed here Aug 06, and I must say we had an excellent time in HK. It started when we arrived at the hotel at 7am coming from Beijing. We had to go to the 29th floor to check in because we had an executive clubroom. So I was just expecting to drop off my bags  come back in the afternoon to check in. This wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the case they informed me that I could check in now which was a surprise (never happen to me before). After she told me that I then let them know that my credit cards were cancelled\/on hold for fraud  that one of them won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be active until the next day. I had told the stupid credit card company  my bank that I was going to Asia but the put both my cards on hold after they saw charges in Beijing. Anyways, the check-in clerk spoke w\/ the on duty Manager  they said that it would be no problem I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l just have to leave a nights deposit then finish the check in the next day. Well all I had was $600HK cash  the room was $1200Hk. After talking to each other a bit in Chinese the girl said I could just leave a $500 deposit (leaving some cash for me to eat). Then they noticed that my Res was for a double bed but they informed me that the best viewing room was avail but it only has a king bed w\/ separate living room plus 1 √à√¥√ú bahrooms. Once we saw it my son was sold he loved, the room had a sofa, chair, desk w\/ chair, a bench, bar, entertainment center. Then in the bedroom another Enter. Center. The bathroom was just beautiful; it had a sep shower  huge tub. Extra long vanity sink. The entire suite had a panoramic view of The Harbor and Victoria Park. FYI, Victoria Park is enormous it has like 20 Tennis Courts, 8 Basketball courts, Soccer field, 2 swimming pools and various other fields if you have kids this is a perfect hotel to stay at. Plus around the corner you have McDonalds, 7 Eleven, and a Game Room. Back to the hotel, the next day we finished check-in and we got everything fixed w\/ the bank I felt better. I forgot to mention that also during check-in they gave me 2 free drink tickets to the hotel bar. Plus because I had a clubroom we got free breakfast. We cold either go to the rest on the 2nd fl or we could use the Club Lounge on the 29th fl. Also in the evenings they served free drinks  light snacks in the Club lounge (kids could also come). We preferred using the CL during breakfast because it was less crowded and served some of the things from the full rest on the lower level. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not a big Breakfast person so I opted for the quietness of the CL. Make sure to try the spring rolls if they serve them they were excellent even my 13yr son loved them and he√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a picky eater. The entire staff is very friendly  helpful; they remember your name  what you drink in the evenings. One staff person had just return from vacation  she knew my name  what I drink before I could tell her. One of my co-workers pointed out to me that I was prob the only African-AM at the hotel so it would be hard to miss me, but that little bit of detail still made me fell good.We wound up staying 6 days and would def go back again.
