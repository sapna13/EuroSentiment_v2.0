{"text":"Hotel Ares is the one! We booked this after much trawling of Trip Advisor and booking through Laterooms and got a great deal. As a Brit, I have travelled and stayed in lots of hotels worldwide and this is not my first trip to Paris. As a couple, we found the hotel to be ideally placed near the Eiffel Tower at a very reasonable rate. The room (yes, if you're not European) is small, but if you are out all day, then no problems if you just want somewhere to sleep in style. From previous reports, we saw that other travellers felt that the service was not great. We must disagree. The owner himself was on hand to make sure that we were happy and we were glad to be left alone to get on with our trip without the intrusion of staff or street noise, as we were on the 6th floor. Take advantage of the 5 Euro a day mini bar refill (soft drinks). If you are a couple and you don't want to put up with families and kids, this is the place to go for peace and quiet and boutique style holidaying at it's best. As for the breakfast in the hotel, having paid 10 Euros for coffee in the Louvre, then 15 Euros each for breakfast is good, as there was sufficient choice from the all you can eat buffet. This is Paris, cheap does not really happen here. We would go back and recommend the hotel, the staff are really helpful (if not a little shy) and well meaning and we were made to feel very welcome.
