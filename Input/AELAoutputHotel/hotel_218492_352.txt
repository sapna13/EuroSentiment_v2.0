{"text":"A Nice Surprise! It was our first visit to the DR and Globalia, so we were nerveous too... but the place and the country, the climate, most of the people, the nature surprised us in a good way. The Hotel was neat, employees helpful. The entertainment was o'right. We saw the Michael Jackson show, of which the acrobats part was so entertaining. The food was good too... We went one night to The Beach Club I thing it was called, and we had to get up and leave, because the staff around us was busy, seemed frustrated and the selection was for someone who had no other choice of place. We got chased first by the hostess, then by the manager and begged to go back to the table. That felt so uncomfortable, so we promissed to eat there next night, of course we never did. Instead we went to Da Mario - GREAT FOOD, that's all I can say. Definitely try Windows, the buffet there is honestly outstanding, compared to any other All inclusive place we've been to so far - we were so stuffed we couldn't walk..:)One last thing - The vendors on the beach and the ones in the hotel were just so anoying. Don't buy anything, unless you are prepared to dig deep in your pocket, get into a fight, or literally cursed out. Example: My husband needed new sandals for the beach, and went to see if they will have any in their little sheds on the beach. The guy was asking $40, for something you get at the Dollar Store for a buck. But when I showed up, the show was over. I talked him down to $15, then finally completely changed our mind, because he asked for cigarettes and beer on top, didn't buy them, and the vendor made a rough comment about my nationality that was hard to swallow - almost ruined my vacation mood there. A trip someone offered for $110\/pp, we got for $70.Overall, we had a great time and lots, lots of beer...
