{"text":"Not Bad For The Price and Location We booked this hotel early Feb for our March 31, 4 night stay and we got the room at $76\/night + tax.Check in with the crabby old lady was fast, she just asked for my name, id and credit card (don't know what for...room was prepaid-but was returned eventually w\/o swiping). No one to help with your luggage also but that's just fine with me. We got the room in less than 15 minutes. Was given room 301 which faces Bush St., which can get quite noisy because of traffic on the street and at all hours. Room size is ok, so was bathroom w\/c has bathtub\/shower combo, hot water and some toiletries and also 4 sets of bath towels. The hallway also has some weird\/funny smell as mentioned before.Location is great, just a few steps to the cable car, 2 blocks down to Union Square, 2 blocks to Chinatown and across Alamo\/National car rental (w\/c I would use going to LA). I suggest you get the Muni Passport or Citypass (w\/c includes Muni Passport) so you'd have no problems with public transport. Although it's only 2 blocks to Union Square, coming from Union Square is a steep and very tiring climb up...we're not used to SF up and down streets. Breakfast was as stated, pastries and free coffee, that's it. You can try going to Chinatown for congee or down to Union Square for some American breakfast. Internet on hotel's 2 computer is free as is wifi in the lobby. We didn't have any problems with computer usage in the mornings we were there. Regarding the crabby old lady, she reminds me of my grandmother so I didn't have any problems with her. Some people just aren't people persons but they're the ones that take care of the business. She was there mostly mornings until afternoons. She's Thai\/Chinese, so if you can, speak to her in her language - that's the way to get on her good side.
