{"text":"Ocean Sand delivers! I'm just back from the Ocean Sand Resort in Punta Cana.What a great trip! The purpose of my travel was a destination wedding so we were 40 people in total. Everyone I talked to felt that for the price of the trip we could not possibly have had a better experience.Punta Cana's beach is amazing. I ran for over half an hour in both directions without running out of sand. You can walk for hours! The sand is fine and soft, the ocean doesn't have rough surf and is shallow for a ways out...good for kids!The beach vendors don't approach you when you're lying on the beach...Mexico's polar opposite!The resort itself is medium sized. No need to take the golf carts that roam like taxis to assist the elderly or heat addled. There are 5 restaurants included in the all inclusive and 2 more that can be booked for additional costs. There's also a sports bar and a disco as well as a casino (gambling is also not all inclusive:)The 2 buffets are incredible and feature menu changes everday so they don't get old or tired.A seperate word about the Dominican people....so so friendly and helpful and nice and just incredible service. I saw no evidence of anyone working on caribbean time. I didn't get off the resort much but there's a bit of shopping around. The golf is expensive but nice.The resort is a solid 4 star experience. We walked around resorts with private concierge service, constant bar\/food service on the beach, private villas and pools etc. If that's your bag, skip Ocean Sand. If, however, you want 4 star service, cleanliness, location, convenience all for what's more like a 2 star price, check out Ocean Sand!ps I booked it through my travel agent Helen Austin [----]. She beat the lowest price I could find by 300 bucks and I had done some major looking!!
