{"text":"Just Perfect! Stayed at the hotel David for 4 nights last week. The hotel is situated about 20 min walk to the Ponte Vecchio. If walking doesn't suit, there are 3 buses that stop outside the hotel. They offer a full continental breakfast, which is lovely and fresh espresso's or cappuccino's, which are to die for! Between 6.30pm and 8pm they offer a full range of nibbles ( bowls of pasta, bread and pate ), red\/white wine and soft drinks. To be honest they call it nibbles but you could really have a two course dinner for free! This is to encourage guests to coverse with each other, and it really is delightful. We met some lovely people and had learnt some really interesting things! The room we had had a balcony looking over the garden, which I requested, and was very pleased. It is a bit noisy at night time, but that didn't bother us. We were that tired at night time from walking about all day, we could of slept through an earthquake! If this worries you, request a room at the back, but don't think they have balconies. The rooms and bathrooms are spotless and the shower is ferocious! Just what you need after a long day. The staff give a very personal service and even know what room number your in, so you don't have to keep asking when you get the key! Free internet access and 10 min calls worldwide a day. All in all this is a very special hotel. It is rated at a 3 star but to be honest is better thatn some 4 and 5 stars I have stayed in. Can't wait to go back. If your thinking about going to Florence, don't look anywhere else. Book hotel David NOW!
