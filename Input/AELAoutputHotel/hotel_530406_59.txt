{"text":"loved it until the dog attack We were travelling with our three sons all under the age of five and I would say this is a fabulous resort for children. Most of the people there had kids and we had an amazing time until the last night. The food was great, the rooms were large and clean, the beach was a little dirty but is the fault of the guests...Our last night we went down to the beach, around 4pm, to take some photos of the boys on my lap in the sand. We were on the resort property.While sitting on the sand a dog, one of the many that guest were feeding and we had avoided knowing they were wild dogs, jumped over my husbands shoulder ( he was on his stomach taking photos of us) and jumped on my five year old bitting him on the mouth as he started to scream. My three year old jumped up and started to run away - the dog turned to him and bit him on the bum and them pinned him and started licking his face. I was trying to get up and protect my 6 month old as my husband kicked at the dog to get it away. My children were terrified - we all were.My son had to go and get a needle right away. We were leaving the next day and upon arrival in Toronto took the kids to the Doctor. Both my five and three year old are now getting needles for rabies - we don't know if the dog had it but it is 100 percent fatal, 100 percent! So a total of 15 needles later - we still have to get more- I would advise people to be careful. Rabies is contracted not just with bites and blood but with saliva - hence the son who was licked on the face had to also get treament. The hotel's responce was to put up signs on the beach the next day and they gave my son a piece of gum and a bowling ticket. They told us the dogs were filthy and disgusting but there was not much they could do about them.We had such a wonderful trip up until the time, really no complaints but I think I need to tell people about our experience so they can be careful and protect their children. The dogs seem friendly and I think the dog wanted to play but who knows what diseases it might have and it did bite them. A wild dog can turn quicky and we don't know how they are treated by their owners.We love the Dominican and will definately go back. I don't know about this resort because of the dogs but the area is beautiful and the people are wonderful!
