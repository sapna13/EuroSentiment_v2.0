{"text":"Coqui Inn AKA Bedbug Inn Although I have stayed at this hotel in the past, my last visit was truly horrible!!! To begin with they did not have a record of our reservation. To make things worse I actually found a used condom wrapper in my bed sheets. We found the condom on our second night due to the fact that on the first night we were so exhausted we fell asleep on top of the bed without turning the covers down. In spite of this, I tried to gracious keeping in mind the nice experience we had at this hotel in 2005. However, If this wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bad enough, I soon started to suffer from massive bug bites which at first I assumed to be mosquitoes. Much to my disgust and dismay I soon learned that it was not mosquitoes that were feeding on my body but BEDBUGS!!! After a long discussion with the management, they finally agreed to change our room. They didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even have the decency to comp us for the three nights we spent sleeping with the bedbugs and condom wrapper. Unfortunately, I did not make an issue of this or demand to be comped for the room in spite of the fact that friends that I called in the states suggested that I should demand to be comped and that I should report the to the Puerto Rican Tourism Board ( which I was also gracious enough not to do). I must say that I left more than my heart in old San Juan as a courtesy of the bedbugs I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure I also left a couple of pounds of my flesh. That and over sixty bucks that I had to spend on bug spray anti itch creams etc.In conclusion, I had to personally fumigate the room in which my nephew and I were staying. After which, I did not want the hotel to clean my room but unfortunately there wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a do not disturb sign that we could use to indicate that we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want them cleaning the room and possibly exposing us to further contamination of bedbugs. I came away from this trip totally disgusted with the quality of service at this hotel. Unfortunately, I also came away disillusioned about visiting my homeland in the near future as well. I most say that I have always preferred to spend my vacations and money in my own homeland however, after this visit; I must seriously consider spending my money and vacation in other locations.The Coqui Inn AKA The Bedbug Inn ","annotations":[]}
