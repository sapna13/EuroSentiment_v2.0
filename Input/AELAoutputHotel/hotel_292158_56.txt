{"text":"A very nice, relaxing holiday!!! Over all our holiday was very nice, our group consisted of me, my husband and my daughter who is 13. The airport on arrival in punta cana was ok, a very pretty airport, the only thing i would say is, trying to find your coach to take you to your hotel was a bit confusing, there werent any reps to ask, just find your travel agent desk and they will tell you were to go! The journey was fine, about half an hour to the hotel, check in was fairly swift, however we did have a very grumy bell boy! Our room when we got there had a very funny smell and over one of the pools, also it was to small for 3 of us. we decided to upgrade to a suite which was lovely well worth the money, about √ä√£¬¢280 for 2 weeks.The grounds were beautiful and maintained every day by the gardeners, the pools were beautiful, i dont understand previous reviews where you couldnt get a bed by the pool? My poor husband got up at 6 the first day and had his pick!! There were not any problems by any pools in getting a bed with shade for the day! The beach however was different, plenty of beds, but if you want shade then i suggest you get up early!!!!Plenty to do if you wanted to do any of it! Spa was lovely ,the beach was beautiful!! kept very clean, seaweed cleaned away every morning. We went the last two weeks of july and it seemed very quite,during the week, the locals come for the weekend and it did get busy but other than that it was very quiet!!Food, on the whole it was fab! I would recommend the italian and mexican, fantastic!!!. The buffet restraunts were very good loads to choose from. My daughter always eats the same thing when we go anywhere in the world and she never ever gets poorly, she generally eats the usual teenage rubbish, pizza, chips, cakes, etc. She never touches the salad, fruit, ice etc, perhaps that is why she is never poorly. All was fine for the first four days, we ate in the buffet, we then decided to eat in the seafood and steak restraunt on the beach, god what a mistake, we both had sea bass. When it came out i only ate a couple of mouth fulls, my husband ate a bit more within a few hours we had a very upset tummy!!! My husband had his for a day or so, i was poorly for 3 days. Speaking to others on the resort, not that many though as not many english, alot had been poorly, one poor girl stayed in her room for seven days!! I think it was the fish but im not sure it may be the salad\/ice etc. In future im going t eat what my daughter eats!!. It didnt ruin the holiday though, just be sensible!Staff. Mostly they were lovely, language barrier was difficult, but hey thats my problem, i dont speak spanish!! Some were very rude, especially in the shops on the resort!A little tip, despite waht the travel agents told me, DO NOT TAKE Domincan Peso's they ALL prefer US dollars, If you take travellers cheques, the hotel will only exchange for peso, and you will get ripped off! Go to the banks who wil exchange for Us dollars. Trips. We went to saouna island, well what can i say paradise!!! Dont book with rep, much cheaper with joseph who is by the pool all day!Would i go again, Probably yes with more of us, there was very few english people there all locals\/italians\/germans etc, sometimes its nice to chat to other people on holiday!! i would go back with more of my family, that would be great. Dont be ut off by negative reviews, people are to fussy. The place was great, if you cant speak spanish, tuff, the majority of staff were lovely, the rest of them, hey its like any other place in the world, we all have our bad days!!!
