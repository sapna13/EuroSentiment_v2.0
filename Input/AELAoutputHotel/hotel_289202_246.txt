{"text":"Loved the Antiche Figure We were 5 ladies travelling throughout Italy and Venice was our first stop, arriving from Rome via train. I had contacted the hotel and told them we might be late in the evening as we were arriving from the US and taking the train from Rome to Venice. Well, we arrived around 10:30 pm and as soon as we walked in...the hotel is directly across the canal from the train station...we were greeted as long lost relatives. Tony, at the front desk was so welcoming and our rooms...we had a double and a triple...were all set and ready for us weary travellers. The rooms were perfect, not too small and nicely appoited. The bathrooms were an excellent size and the beds were comfortable.The rates included breakfast which was in the back room on the main floor, small but accomodating with the usual fare. There are also small tables and chairs outside to have a drink and watch the world go bye and a small bar in the lobby for a good cocktail at the end of the day. I asked the hotel in advance to get us reservations for the Secret Tour at the Dodge's Palace and we had reservations for the next day at 10:30.The also recommended a nice restaurant the next evening for dinner in the neighborhood, which was excellent.They have free internet in the lobby which is a nice touch, so we could all let our families know we arrived safely. They did mention to me that they are in the process of adding more rooms, but these would be mini-apt, ideal for families. The location of the hotel is perfect if you are using the train station, very easy to get to with luggage. I have stayed in Venice several times, and at hotels within this area and I like this hotel by far the best. The other hotels treat you like paying guests, this hotel treats you like family. While it is a walk from St. Mark's , you can easily hop on a vaporetto, directly across the bridge, and in no time you are there, or you can walk..a wonderful way to see the real Venice and all the interesting shops, etc. along the way.I will definately come back to the Antiche Figure.
