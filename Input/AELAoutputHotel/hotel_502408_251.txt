{"text":"Lots of Room - Loved it! We stayed at the Affinia 50 on April 13 - 15, 2007. We booked the Amercian Girl Package. Originally we reserved a Studio, but were pleasantly surprised when they upgraded us at no extra charge to a Jr. Suite. I have stayed in NYC a lot for business and usually stay at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square, but this time we had two children along and couldn't have been happier with the room and hotel. We had a living area w\/pull-out, two large, comfortable beds, a full kitchen (bring utensils if you plan to use) and bathroom. There was plenty of storage and the pillow menu was great. The pillow that plugs into an IPOD was a big hit with my 10 year old.The Club Floor was spacious and bright and the free coffee was good. The location was super. The diner up on 50th and 3rd, Morning Star Cafe had good breakfast at reasonable prices.Only Negatives - the safe in our room didn't work, but we did not call about it. The bathrobe was missing upon check-in, but the front desk brought a new unopened one to us when we called.The temperature control wasn't the best. Tried to run just the fan for outside noise reduction, but it poured out heat no matter how it was set. We were on the 8th floor facing 50th - so we had some street noise. It wasn't excessive though - we live in the mountains with NO noise - so we notice any noise.All and all - loved the place - and will go back !BTW - if you are a baseball fan - try the Yankee Stadium Tour (when there isn't a game) for a reasonable, memorable tour.If you plan to go to Liberty Park - plan ahead - they give out a limited number of passes online and the day of - to get inside the Statue of Liberty. We missed out on this, but walked around the outside and got fabulous pictures.If you have kids -try Ruby Foos (Pan-Asian) on 49th and Broadway - good food, loud, and roomy - has a kid's menu too.
