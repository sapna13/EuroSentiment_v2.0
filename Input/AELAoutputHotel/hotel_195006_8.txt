{"text":"Simply the best! We were booked into the Lungarno for a 9 night stay as part of a private - 4 couple - tour. Given the location and the great views we saw on the web site we did not expect much from this hotel. When our driver from Rome had difficulty finding it, we were sure it would be a so-so hotel as many are in tourist areas. We could have not been more pleased with what we then found. This hotel is simply marvelous and is a hidden jewel in Tuscany. In the future we will stop in Florence just to stay in this hotel. Despite the fact that we travel for about three months of the year to many countries, this is the first hotel we have written a review for. They are simply great.The room was good sized and had great storage with everything well thought out. The attention to detail was obvious. The river right outside the window and the view of the Ponte Vecchio was great also.Food service was great both in the room and in the restaurant (which is a jewel). Breakfast was very cozy and almost like eating in a private home.The lounge\/bar and its especially helpful staff was an unexpected draw and became the last stop of the day and was often where we had a light dinner as well. It was both welcoming and yet provided a sense of privacy to each group - something that is not usually the case. There are not many hotels one can stay in for 9 days and still wish they were staying longer. This is one.We will go back. ","annotations":[]}
