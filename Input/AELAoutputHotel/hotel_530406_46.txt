{"text":"Beyond disappointing! I went to Ocean Blue as a bride√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ maid in a wedding. This was the 1st and very last time I will visit this resort. The trolleys that are supposed to take you around the resort do not run frequently and stop prior to the bars and clubs closing. The food was terrible, dry and tasteless. We even tried one of the restaurants that you had to pay extra for and it was the same as another restaurant which was all inclusive. I asked for towels to be sent to my room. They never came! The entertainment was boring and limited. The disco played the same music every night. I don't even know why they hired a DJ to play Britney Spears, YMCA and Reggae tone over and over. The next day I went on the banana boat and the driver was so obnoxious I thought he was trying to hurt us..We flipped 10 times and 3 of us got hurt. We told him to go slow because of the children but he just laughed at us. The worst part was the fact that we had to work around the wedding planner√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ schedule. We originally were set to have the rehearsal at 9 am Sat morning. Come Friday night she calls the bride to say that she is tired from the wedding the night before and isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ coming till 2pm. Since when do we resolve around her schedule. The only thing I can say that DR is beautiful and the beaches are exquisite. If you are looking for good food, great entertainment and service..Do NOT stay here!!!! ","annotations":[]}
