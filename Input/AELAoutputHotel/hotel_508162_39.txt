{"text":"A Dream Never been to this Hotel before, although I have been to the North and South of the Island in the past. I was a little bit doubtful after the bad reviews I have recently read, but my worries were for nothing.Yes, the road to the Hotel is bad - bumpy and the journey does seem to take forever - but youre not at work - so enjoy - it's all part of the holiday!!The Hotel makes up for the road's shortcomings - we were greeted with cool towels and a cocktail. Reception Staff were efficient and friendly.The room was wonderful - we had a room with a view of both the pool and the sea. It was clean and well maintained. Maid service was good - and the turn down service even better. The mini bar was well stocked daily.The pool is wondeful - big and clean. There are quiet parts to the pool and there are plenty of sun loungers.The drinks were of a good quality and well presented whichever bar we used.Concierge staff were very helpful and knowledgeable and there was always someone at the desk from early morning until late at night.The entertainment staff were brilliant and worked hard to keep everyone happy. Well done Usher and 50 Cent - you were extra special!!The food was good - a wide variety of choice, though it should be expected that the a la carte take longer to get a table, but the food is worth the wait.Can't wait to go back - and it will be soon!!!!
