{"text":"The pillows are heavenly! I've heard amazing things about this hotel, and it's a frequent Travelers' Choice Winner, so my expectations were extremely high. It did not disappoint. While it's in the middle of a somewhat chaotic part of town, once I entered the lobby, the heat and noise faded away. The staff was courteous, but not overbearing, and the French greetings are quite charming. My room was on a low floor (the 3rd), however I didn't hear any noise from the street. The room was spacious, the bathroom quite big. The bed was incredible - I'm picky when it comes to pillows, and they were scrumptious, as was the duvet, which did not have that nasty, dirty bedspread feel found at many hotels. Other plusses - lots of room in the closet, separate shower and tub, plenty of room in the bathroom. I traveled alone, but there would have been more than enough room for 2 in both the room and bathroom. I also liked that there were TV speakers in the bathroom - great for when you're getting ready to go out. Only a few cons - didn't love the toiletries, I've stayed at lesser hotels with higher quality products; there were no drawers to store non-hanging items; and finally, I had to replace my room key 3 times because my cell phone kept demagnetizing it. If you stay here - keep your cell phone and room key far apart! The location is great - if you're planning to spend a lot of time in midtown, or want the convenience of traveling to the upper east or west sides of town. Would definitely stay here again, and would recommend it highly. ","annotations":[]}
