{"text":"A real find! This hotel is a real pearl. It's inexpensive, it's chic, the service is great and the location is not bad either. The reception is situated on the 25th floor of one of the towers in the Shiodome complex. You get both excellent views of the Tokyo cityscape going up in the lift and from your room window. It's also easily within walking distance of all the stores in Ginza. We had not one complaint about the service. Everyone on reception was both helpful and efficient. We had read murmurings prior to our trip about the small size of the rooms, but found the set-up similar to many rooms in Europe. The decor is stylish and the bathrooms well-equipped. You have heated toilet seats and the part of the mirror above the sink does not steam up while you're having a shower. So, you don't have to shave or brush your teeth through the mist! For us, the real highlight were the breakfasts, which are absolutely delicious. We live in Paris and the pastries were as good as any we have tasted here. If I had any grudges about the Park Hotel, then they would be slight. The first one would be the difficulty in actually finding it. We arrived at the Shimbashi train station and I had printed out a plan from the Park's website. However, it wasn't 100% clear that we had to go into the underground complex when we got out of the station. There are also steps in the same place going up to an overpass and we were slightly confused. The second thing, which may bother some people is that the tower in which the hotel is situated is right next to a major train line. You can hear the rumbling of trains below all the way through the night. It didn't bother us, but it could be a pain if you're a light sleeper. Otherwise, definitely try out the En restaurant on the 42th floor of the neighbouring Shiodome City Center tower. The views are amazing and the food fantastic.
