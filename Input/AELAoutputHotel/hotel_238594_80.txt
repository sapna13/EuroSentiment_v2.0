{"text":"Absolutely loved the Montecarlo We stayed in the Montecarlo for 4 nights in early January this year and were very impressed. We booked one of the deluxe rooms and really believe it was well worth the extra money. First of all the room and the en-suite were huge. The bathroom was easily the biggest we've had and having the jacuzzi bath and seperate walk-in showers after a long day spent sightseeing was a godsend. The bed itself was one of the most comfortable beds I've stayed in. Entertainemnt wise we had a full minibar, mini hifi system and multichannel tv. What was really cool is that the hifi was wired into the bathroom so you could relax in the bath sipping some chilled cava while listing to your favourite tunes. Total bliss. We didnt sample breakfast as we booked room only, however there are plenty of nice places nearby which do lovely reasonably priced meals.All the staff we met during our stay were incredibly helpful. The gave us tips on what to see and do and they were only too happy to book restaurants and taxis. The hotels location is very central, literally 5 mins walk from La Catalunya railway station. However travelling from the airport its not advisable to take the metro, its best to take the bus to Placa Catalunya and walk 5 mins to the hotel. I would definitely recommend the Montecarlo to anyone going to Barcelona and will stay there again next time I go to Barcelona.
