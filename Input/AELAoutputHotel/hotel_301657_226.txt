{"text":"Best Hotel Value in Tokyo BY A MILE! The two hotel mistakes a Tokyo tourist can make is (1) spend a not-so-small fortune and (2) stay in a hotel that isn't convenient to the invaluable and super-easy-to-use Tokyo subway\/train system.A good Tokyo hotel can easily cost $300, $400, or more a night. I was really worried that at roughly $155 a night, the Park Hotel would be a dump. Boy, was I wrong. It is a sleek, modern, new, immaculately clean, trendy, and gorgeous hotel. Anything under $200 a night is a bargain in Tokyo and I can't imagine that there is a better bang for the buck anywhere in the entire city of Tokyo. The hotel is very close to one of the main subway lines and an easy 8-10 minute walk to Shimbashi station, which makes it a snap to get to all the other popular areas: Roppongi, Shinjuku, Meiji, Akihibara, Tokyo Station, and Shibuya. I can't emphasize enough how critical it is to choose a hotel that is close to a subway\/train hub. This hotel is also within easy, easy walking distance to the Ginza and the Tsukiji fish market. Both of those are absolute must visits. By the way, the only reason to get to the Tsukiji fish market before 6:00 is if you want to see the actual auction process. I found the post-auction process the most interesting. Things like carving up the monster tunas, strolling the colorful seafood stalls, and watching the elaborate engine of sushi commerce in action. My advice is to sleep in a little and arrive around 7:00 AM instead. The only negative is the size of the room. They are indeed small. It was no problem for me because I was traveling by myself, but I the size would be a serious problem for anything more than 2 people. Don't bring a family here. The hotel restaurants are good but expensive. Take advantage of the Family Mart store in the basement. Family Mart is the 7-11 of Japan and has drinks, snacks, and cheap-but-delicious bento boxes to eat. Unless you're rich and have money to burn, this is the VERY, VERY, VERY best deal in all of Tokyo.
