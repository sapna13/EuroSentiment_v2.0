{"text":"Fantastic Stay at Beach Tower We travelled the US during March\/April for 1 month . Family of 4 with 2 teenagers.This was our last stop, after a long trip , on our way home.I wanted something large to give us space from each other, in central location, on the beach with great views.I researched hear on TA and came up with the beach tower.We where not dissapointedThe tower is in an excellent location right accross from the rock pool and in the heart of all the shops and restuarants.Our apartment was on the 24th floor, 2404, it was a renovated 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment and I was extremely pleased with all the facilities. We had washer\/dryer in the apartment , and the maids left me detergent every day. This was usefull as I completed all my holiday washing!We had a full size kitchen (which we didnt utilise to potential) but was handy for breakfast and snacks.Two enormous bathrooms, huge king bed in main bed, twins in the other room, plus a huge living\/dining and the biggest balcony with amazing viewsThe tower does not have a restuarant but that was no problems, rewstuarants everywhere.The staff where helpful and courteous, and Greg the bellhop was truly amazing with his helpWe got a better rate by buying the hawaii entertainment book and calling the hotel, to which they honoured my booking at a reduced rateI will definatley return to hawaii and stay hear at this fanastic apartment tower.Book your stay hear, you will not be disappointed ","annotations":[{"endOffset":429,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":425},{"endOffset":429,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":425}]}
