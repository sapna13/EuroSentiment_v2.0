{"text":"Good Overall but not 5 Star This hotel is in a great location....walking distance to shopping, restaurants and attractions. So if you are looking for a perfect location you cannot go wrong. The room was clean, the bathroom large with lots of counter space, towels and ammenities. I was in the North Tower on an upper floor with a spectacular view of the Space Needle and Puget Sound! The Service Express was great, anything I called about was taken care of in a prompt courteous manner. In fact, room service would be at my door 10 minutes after I called and bell man almost immediately. The Concierge was helpful and knowledgeable about the area. The food is fairly limited and is also very expensive. All hotel food is expensive but I thought this was more so than other hotels and I travel extensively. Just oatmeal and tea in the morning for one cost almost $25 once service charge etc is factored in. A better option would be to go to the 5th Ave Cafe which is located in the downstairs lobby. The same breakfast would cost less than $10. The cafe has everything, not just a la carte, you can get waffles, pancakes, hot sandwhiches and soup for lunch.I did use the gym and liked it a great deal. The only hotel I have stayed in with a better one was an Orlando hotel which had a unique facility to rival most gyms. They have several treadmills and elyptical machines, stair climbers with their invidual TVs and headphones which is nice. They had a few upper and lower body machines and free weights. They also had a smaller room with a couple machines and equipment such as a stability ball. I was at a conference so we gathered in the bar in the lobby several times, the services there is great the waitress Melody was very friendly. A relaxing atmosphere and wireless access throughout.The bad: Internet Access BEWARE of this. Ok, the hotel does NOT have wireless access in your room. If your PC detects a wireless network it is not the hotel's network. It is a separate network which will charge $10 a day to your credit card and not your room bill. To connect to the Westin's network you need to plug in the network cable. You will see the Westin logo etc and that the charge is billed to your room. They do not tell you this. The conference I attended covered room charges, so I ended up paying out of pocket for a day's worth of internet access which was not credited to me. They were like oh well it is not our network and we have no control over this Also the network was saturated and for 2 days I could not get access to the Westin's network and if I did it was extremely slow.One other thing: I had a connecting room and a door divided my room with the room next door. I did not know the men next door. The door was not sound proofed and I could hear every conversation they had and I am sure they could hear me as well. These people were in and out all hours of the day and night. Also I was across from a stairwell which is used by service people. So all night I would hear this door slamming shut. I hardly got any sleep despite the nice comfy beds with all this racket. Then on my last night about 1am, the group of men staying in the room next door tried to bust open the door between our rooms and get into my room! I was shaken up by this and as my room was at the end of the hall had no way out. And I am a woman traveling alone. I called the Desk and they sent security up right away. The Mgr also phoned me back and changed my room to a different floor in a non-connecting room. This room was quiet. Ironically my last night was the only night I had 5 hours of uninterrupted sleep without doors slamming. So overall it was a fairly good stay but as I did not feel safe due to the incident above I was happy to be checking out.
