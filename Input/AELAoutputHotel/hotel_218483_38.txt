{"text":"The food made us sick The only thing that would ever stop me from going back to the resort is the food borne illness that permeates this resort and the whole country. I had no problem with the variety or the taste or presentation of the food, but if I am getting sick than we have a very big problem.   First of all for any Nay Sayers, it was NOT the alcohol. I did not drink much of it as I was doing all I could do to stay hydrated to counter the effects of illness.  This was not a stomach bug or virus and neither am I prone to this sort of thing as I ate Cafeteria food for 4 years in university and have lived on military food for months at a time. I never got these types of problems when others did. I have traveled for weeks at a time in the British Isles drinking my face off every night and have never had anything that even resembles this.  I am also not the only one. My wife was affected, as well as everyone at the resort who came over on the same plane. One such individual has very extensive experience in the food service industry. I really hope he will post a review as he noticed many problems with how food is handled.  I met a German guy who stayed in his room for 4 days after he got sick. My wife saw a little down syndrome girl vomiting at the pool. When at the variety show I looked around to see 90% of people drinking water, and not alcohol. Could this be a sign of food borne illness induced dehydration? I wonder what the problem is. Is that the food they buy is bad? Do they not cook it enough? Do they cross contaminate? Is there inadequate refrigeration? Is it poor hygiene and hand washing? Are they cooking with infected tap water? Are they reusing food from a previous meal? Does the hot stay hot and the cold stay cold? Is it all of them at the same time? I realize this is a budget resort. The food isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the best quality in the world and the liquor is of the worst quality and full of sugar. However, this comes with the territory of booking a 3 star resort. However, food poisoning is not something that any person should have to endure. Most of the problems seem to be related to meat. I would not feed a pet dog much of what is being served at that resort. Who wants to go to a resort and just eat rice and bread? Every time that you sink your fork into the food there, it feels like your stomach is playing Russian roulette. I would like the Carabela resort to post a rebuttal and explain what they are going to do to alleviate this problem.  Other than the food, I was happy with the resort in general. My only other complaint was that some of the public bathrooms at the resort were always filthy and should be better maintained. The bed was hard, but supportive. The beach was fine. The staff was great, and the smaller sized resort had an intimate feel. There was enough to do that we were seldom bored. I would this a good resort for young people and families. If I were retirement age I probably would not want to stay here. At the end of the day, if you like paying for alcohol you are too sick to drink and relish going to the bathroom a dozen times a day (with toilet paper reminiscent of 300 grit sandpaper) or eating Imodium AD and having pains in your stomach because your body is now being forced to harbor this toxic food, than the Dominican Republic and this resort is for you!  I am passing on this complaint to the Dominican department of tourism and if anyone feels that food borne illness is something that is going to prevent you from coming to the Dominican Republic, in all fairness you should let them know so they can do something about it. The country has special tourist police, but apparently not special tourist health inspectors. In the age of Mad Cow and Avian flu, food borne health issues are a much bigger threat to tourists than street crime.
