{"text":"Not worth the money My husband and I stayed at The Rho Hotel from 7th - 11th September 2008. We were allocated room 2008 on the 2nd floor.(there is a lift) The ROOM was a nice size. It overlooked a residence, therefore you had to keep your curtains closed at night. The room was very dark, lack of lamps. On the skirting board below the bed, there was a spill stain, it had obviously been there for ages, not the cleanest hotel, but on first sight it looks ok until you really look. The BATHROOM reminded me of a fish market slab, there was very BAD MOULD around the shower and tiles, the shower was either v.hot or v.cold. They only provided shower\/shampoo gel and some soap, would have expected more for the price. We had to chase the maid every day to leave us two bath towels,bath mat, toilet rolls and tooth mugs. For some reason she forgot to leave them, she was a 'shilling short.' BREAKFAST, this was a mixture of dried up cheese, rubber\/cold scrambled eggs and over cooked bacon. When they refreshed the eggs, they threw them in from a distance, it was clear they could not care less. There was tinned fruit in syrup and runny yogurt. The bread was nice and fresh. The breakfast staff had a bad attitude problem, never a smile, they do not clear plates until you leave the table. The dishcloths they use to wipe the tables were a FILTHY GREY. It was very NOISY at NIGHTwith druggies shouting and scooters roaring, not a good nights sleep in 4 nights. The blanket was ripped and the beadspread was stained, the mattress had not been cleaned in ages, the dust on the TV had been there for months. THE FRIDGE had mould in it and was not very efficient. Upon check out, there was no 'thank you\/goodbye' THE LOCATION WAS GREAT,NEXT TO DAM SQUARE AND TRAMS. The reception staff were pleasant enough. We would not stay there again, it is not worth the money, it is more a 2 star hotel. THE PILLOWS were very LUMPY, you can request some thicker ones, even so they are horrid. Not worth the money, we felt cheated. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL UNLESS ALL YOU WANT IS GOOD LOCATION. It is so basic. For the price I would have expected better service. Perhaps the Dutch are not known for their service!If you want a great place to eat, just turn the corner and eat in the Chinese,(the first one you come to, CANNOT REMEMBER THE NAME) it is great value. This is an honest review. I do not have any pohotos as we have been to Amsterdam before and there is a limit to how many pics you want to keep. Wish I had taken some of the mould in the bathroom though.
