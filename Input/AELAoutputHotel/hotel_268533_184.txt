{"text":"Other than check-in, was nice We did arrive at the Argonaut at 2:30pm, instead of the 3pm check-in time. I felt like I was being reprimanded for arriving 30 minutes early. The front desk clerk remided me of the check in time and I was told to take a seat in the lobby and they would let me know when my room was ready. As we were sitting there, I noticed other guests arriving and immediately being handed their room keys and going to their rooms. No one ever came to let us know our room was ready until I walked up to the counter just after 3pm and stood behind others checking in and asked why others were getting keys and we were still waiting. They simply forgot about us. The room we booked was a standard room, decorated nicely, and overlooked a courtyard with restaurants and shops (I guess it is called the cannery). There are brick walls and huge wooden beams in the room and the hallways left over from the cannery the hotel was made from. It was unique and looked nice. There were several selections of wine served in the lobby in the afternoon. We were given a great recommendation for dinner from the concierge. It is called Albona Ristorante Istriano; Albona for short. What a wonderful dinner experience. It is located on Francisco St. It is a small, intimate place, and is warm and cozy. Because of its size, make reservations. The owner Bruno will come over to your table and welcome you with open arms, talk to you about his restaurant, and the evening's specialties. Later he will stop by to see how you liked your dinner. Don't miss it! ","annotations":[]}
