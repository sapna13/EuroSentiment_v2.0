{"text":"For Beach Lovers Only My husband and I stayed at the Gran Bahia from Dec. 23 -28, 2006. First time to Punta Cana and first AI experience. We're 36 and 39, from New England and have been to the Carribean before (Bahamas, Jamaica, Grand Cayman).The Good:The Beach -- soft white sand, warm water, perfect rolling waves.Cleanliness of resort -- common areas cleaned constantlyStaff -- happy, eager to please, especially Laura in Sales (trip planning) and housekeeping (fun towel designs).Weather -- warm, low 80's, sunny, breezy everyday.Convenience --- short ride from airport; everything you need right at resort; no need to carry money with AI.Clientele -- families, adults, polite and friendly.Free Upgrade to Diamond Club -- better room location, closer to beach.Beautiful Pools.Late check-out option ($10 per hour).Aerobics on the beach.The Disappointing --Airport -- forced photos (for a fee); $20 per person entrance tax after customs; being followed by musicians looking for tips; being mobbed by men who want to help with luggage for tips.Check-in -- Went to Bavaro side of resort, Shuttled to Punta Cana side, given a room on the Bavaro side (go figure). Told you take care of me, I take care of you before given a room assignment. Room keys did not work; had to get new keys.The Room -- very basic. Never did get our shower drain fixed. No ocean view. Maid entered without knocking. One 4 inch cockroach -- killed by brave maid.Diamond Club -- never received the perks I found out about later -- beach towels, t-shirts, bottle of rum, or fruit basket.Food -- plentiful, but mediocre and boring. Very difficult getting reservations to ala carte restaurants. Having to be careful with food selections -- husband got turista on second to last day. Casino -- tiny, tiny, tiny and unexcitingThe Bottom Line --Overall, go if you love the Beach amd are looking for pure relaxation in a family friendly environment -- you will not be disappointed. Don't go expecting luxury or great food. Don't expect the Ritz, or even the Westin or Marriott. This is a 5 star resort in a poor country; the staff takes pride in the resort and tries very hard to please. The common areas are very pretty and well-kept. Go with the flow; try to speak Spanish as it makes things much easier; and just relax.
