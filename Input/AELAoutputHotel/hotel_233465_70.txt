{"text":"Conveniently located to everything! My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Louvre Sainte Anne for six nights. Our room and bathroom were nice sized and quiet, even though the room faced the street. The room was spotless and the bed was comfortable. There was also a dressing table and mirror in the room. The biggest asset of this hotel is a nine-year employee at the front desk: Moen (pronounced Moon). She is cheerful, knowledgeable and helpful. We don't read French and misunderstood the sign on the back of the door. Our room was 145 euros\/night. The rest of the sign said breakfast was 12 euros (we got that right!) and what we thought was coffee, which we thought was gratis, actually was the in-room safe! You have to run your credit card through the slot for identification, but there's no charge. We discovered that the coffee was 3 euros, but that was cheaper than anywhere else, which was 4-5 euros\/cup. We thought we were being so clever to go to a restaurant to have breakfast because we thought 24 euros for breakfast was too expensive. We ended up paying over 40 euros because the coffee was so expensive and we each had two cups! As Moen would tell you, if you want to go to the Louvre, turn left out the front door, walk four blocks and you're standing in front of it. Bakery with wonderful fresh goods and a great, big cup of coffee? Left out the front door and walk one block, same side of the street. Grocery store: Out the front door, turn right and immediately turn right again to go down the side street, walk one block and there's a market kitty-corner across the street. The metro is three blocks away. You will discover that there are dozens of Japanese restaurants in that part of town. We also discovered a newly opened Persian restaurant, just 1 1\/2 blocks from the hotel. Out the door, turn right. Same side of the street. They do not have hotel shuttle service to and from the airport, so be sure to book transportation the day before you're ready to leave the hotel. We're glad we did. We wanted to leave at 10:30 am. Moen called 5 or 6 services for us and there were none available at that time. She found a ride for us at 9:00 am which we immediately booked.
