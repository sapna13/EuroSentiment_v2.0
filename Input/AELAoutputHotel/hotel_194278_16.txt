{"text":"November 2007 Artus Review My girlfriend and I stayed at the Artus and since we used this site for information, I wanted to share our experiences there. All of the staff were friendly, professional, and approachable. No signs of the aforementioned surly Patricia. Sanjay, the manager, was wonderful. The evening staff were also helpful. We booked our room via Expedia for $245\/night. I feel we got a good value for the price. After all, this IS Paris. Yes, the room (132) was small, but it was clean, the bed was comfortable, the pillows perfect. The only complaints that I had, which I shared with a receptive Sanjay, was that the rug was showing signs of wear, and the paint on the wall in the toilet area was chipping. The modern decor of the lobby and breakfast area was perfect. Breakfast downstairs was good if you didn't want to face Paris too early. And at 15 euros each, it was comparable to what a decent breakfast would cost. The location is great, the St. Germain des Pres area is full of activity, and anything you could want is steps away. It was a little noisy on Friday and Saturday nights, very, very late, but it's a small price to pay for the location. The small gripe we do have was the heating system would make a annoying noise each time it would turn on\/off. Not good when you're just about to drift off to sleep. So I guess I would recommend this hotel. Would we go back? We like to try new things, so probably not. But, as I mentioned, it IS an excellent value in a very expensive city. So, what are you waiting for??? ","annotations":[]}
