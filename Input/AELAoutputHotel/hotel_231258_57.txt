{"text":"Loved this place! We chose this hotel because it had free street parking for our rental car [booked to take day trips to the hill towns of Tuscany]. We read that there was easy access to Florence city center by the bus right near the hotel. The bus turned out to be so easy that we cancelled the car and later celebrated the fact that we were in a quiet residential neighborhood. Which brings me to the Hotel Ungherese - it's like staying at your beloved grandmother's house! Very residential, quaint, homey, super clean and absolutely charming, down to Peggy, the little white cat sleeping on the stairs. Sabina and Leonardo's personal attention helped us go from a little reserved the first day to feeling like family on the 5th day when we left. Every morning, we enjoyed a full breakfast downstairs, accompanied by Leonardo's delicious coffee - everything from Americano to cafe latte, and he would gladly make you more than one! My niece and her boyfriend got engaged on this trip, and Sabina provided chianti, flowers and a cute little stuffed animal - all gratis! Sabina also recommended a local restaurant that we went back to two nights in a row. We were a 5 member family group and she joined right in. I would definitely stay there again. I knew that Hotel Ungherese would be a smaller and more community place, and was not disappointed. We stayed in three smaller hotels on our trip [in Rome and Venice] and the Hotel Ungherese was by far the most agreeable. It's clear that Sabina and Leonardo love what they do, and they really respond to people who understand that.
