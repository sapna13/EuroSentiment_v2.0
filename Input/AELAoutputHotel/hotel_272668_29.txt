{"text":"Perfectly fine. I ended up staying here for one night when my flight out of LAX was bumped a day.To me, it is in a fantastic location, near Silver Lake, Echo Park, and Los Feliz, all areas worth checking out. It's also spitting distance from the 101 and a block over from a 7\/11 if you are so inclined. I think if you find this neighbourhood fearsome you are a bit precious -- I parked outside and the car was fine, and at no point in my travels did I feel unsafe. I'm pretty sure most experienced travellers would feel fine. Everything was very clean. I was given a corner king room which felt tucked away and private. The TV had a lot of channels. The free wireless internet was appreciated -- that always seals the deal for me. (My room was too far from the access point to get a signal, but I was given an ethernet cable by the front desk, which is fine.)In the morning there was juice, all kinds of baked goods (frozen  thawed, but that's alright), waffle batter, fruit, etc. It was much more than what I expect from a continental breakfast.My only issue with the hotel was the rate -- I had a coupon from a local guidebook, but the rate was actually $10 more. The clerk said that they had raised the rate after the book was printed. In my view, the advertised rate should be honoured, as that was what brought me to the hotel. But really, it's a clean, relatively cheap place near some good neighbourhoods and the freeway. I would recommend to a friend.
