{"text":"Terrific inn, newly renovated and charming! We stayed at this hotel for one night as we returned to San Juan from a cruise and it was excellent. Our room and bathroom were large and the common areas beautifully decorated. Floors throughout are tile and there are many art pieces on the walls and in specially designed niches. On the main floor is a garden and patio area which is simply breathtaking, with orchids and other tropical plants. Once away from the front desk, you would hardly know you were still in the middle of a large city. There is also a small pool which has been built into a secluded area; a small elevator; and in the back of the main floor, a piano, a breakfast bar, and a microwave. Our room had a refrigerator and internet access.Personally, I would probably not choose this inn if I was traveling with children, mainly because the atmosphere seems better suited to couples or solo travelers. Some areas would also be difficult to navigate with a stroller or extra luggage. The Old Town is a short drive or taxi ride away, and there are a number of good restaurants within walking distance. There is a US post office and a drugstore with grocery items about a block away. The staff was exceptionally accommodating and followed up with us immediately on an item we had left behind. We would definitely recommend this inn to anyone looking for an oasis in the middle of San Juan...it was the perfect end to our vacation.S. Rey-Barreau ","annotations":[]}
