{"text":"Nice place bad service Staff: Beware of a few of the discourteous front desk staff. One of them had plenty of snooty and patronizing verbiage to dole out sans any eagerness to help. I was appalled by the belittling tone she used to address the Japanese tourists. She tried that with me. I put her back in he place within the first 5 mins. But she put us in a stinking hole. I guess she √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂?on√à√\u2020\u2022?and Hyatt must be proud of her. Anyway the front desk guy next day made up for her offensive demeanor. Room: Bait and switch. First 3 nights in a muggy room with the view of other buildings. The guy at the front desk helped us switch to a renovated room in the other tower. Can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ complain, that room was excellent with a partial view of the ocean. Loud music from downstairs, did not bother us that much though. Expedia staff: There was a lifeless guy √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬ßanaging√à√\u2020\u2022?the desk, who was more interested in carrying on the phone conversation than doing business. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe that he was commission was a part of his incentive package. We went to get some advice on destinations and airfares to the Big Island and Maui\/Kawaii, and came back with phone numbers etc. The next day luckily a senior guy was there who was very helpful and we sorted out everything. Overall service: Good. Breakfast: Good. Continental  Japanese. No variation, day in and day out. Facilities: NiceOverall experience: Fantastic. Repeat visit to HRWRS: Not in this lifetime. There are cheaper and better placesRepeat visit to Hawaii: Yes. Strongly, advice Kawaii or Maui instead of Waikiki.
