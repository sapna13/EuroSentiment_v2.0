{"text":"perfect location You couldn't beat this hotel for location, literally 10 seconds walk to the Markisches Museum underground line (U2 red)...and that's if you were dawdling! We stayed in an double apartment room which was huge! We were expecting a little kitchenette in the corner of the room, but what we got was literally a suite with a large sitting room and kitchen complete with microwave and dish washer. We didn't bother with the hotel breakfast - we stocked up with milk, cheeses and meats at the supermarket down the road and then ordered from reception freshly baked rolls and croissants to be delivered to our door. Who could ask for more!Admittedly the maid only cleans the room and changes the towels every other day, but we never put our towels out to be refreshed every day even when we have the option.The staff were extremely friendly, spoke brilliant English, and it was spotlessly clean! We ate in the restaurant two nights and had complimentary drinks and extra starter both times, and the food was gorgeous! A previous review had said that the hotel was a little out of the way for nightlife...this is true, but when you've been out sightseeing all day we certainly didn't have the energy. The lovely restored area of Nikolaiviertel with lots of great traditional bars and restaurants is only a 10 minute walk away, and if you haven't got the energy to walk that far and fancy something other than pork knuckle, the Indian across the road is superb too! I recommend the Punjabi\/Maharaja Thalis...both fantastic value for money!
