{"text":"Great Stay! We stayed at HC directly after a 3 night stay in Rome. HC is very centrally located. We were traveling in a group of 6 and reserved 3 rooms. All rooms were nicely sized and clean. We had a room facing the street and the other two rooms had views facing the back of hotel with lovely views of the Duomo! I read about noise, but the windows were very well insulated and we heard NO noise from the street. Of course, at the end of a long site-seeing day, we were very exhausted, and not sure anything would have awoken us! The hotel staff were neither overly helpful or overly rude. They conducted their basic duties and that was the end. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfy. I liked that they had extra pillows and blankets already in the room (the only hotel out of 3 that we stayed while in Italy that provided this without asking). The breakfast was also the best we had while traveling!! Eggs, bacon, pastries, etc. VERY good. My only complaint, albeit small, was they charged 5 Euro for 30 minutes of internet use. Give me a break...Can't this be included with your stay? We had to touch base back home regularly due to a sick pet and I was irritated I had to pay for just a short email check. It's a tiny service that makes a HUGE difference!Overall, I would recommend this hotel. THe location can't be beat. The rooms are nice and the price was good for Florence.
