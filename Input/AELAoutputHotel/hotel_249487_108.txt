{"text":"Beautiful beach, relaxing stay but not close to Old San Juan We wanted a beach vacation and that is what we got at the Water Club! From the minute we arrrived, the staff was helpful and attentive. Our room was not quite ready so William, who is awesome, suggested Mi Casita, a small local place right down the street from the hotel. It was lunch time and we sampled MoFongo, which is mashed fried plaintains with garlic and topped with pork. It was delicious. Our short flight from New York was in the past as we enjoyed lunch at this little authentic restaurant. We were immediately taken with the ocean view and the gorgeous beach, which is literally steps from the hotel. Every morning, we would walk out of the hotel and be greeted by the wonderful staff and then the beach staff would set up an umbrella and chairs for us. The ocean itself was wonderful to swim in - clear, warm water, no seaweed and the ocean floor was not rocky at all. We spent alot of time in the water and walking on the beach because it was so beautiful. We had lunch at 2 separate beachfront cafes and I would recommend both. If you walk down the beach toward the el san juan hotel you will see the bar that serves lunch and you can sit at a table on the beach and look out over the ocean. We watched the sun set from there one nite with a pina colada! I would suggest the beachfront lunch places as opposed to lunch in the hotel which is expensive, although the waitress service on the beach is excellent. We ordered drinks only. The other lunch spot is set back from the beach on the small road that leads into the hotel. Its a bar and little cafe that serves salads, sandwiches, drinks, burgers. We had lunch there and each time the service was great and again you feel a great breeze since you are steps from the ocean. Breakfast in the hotel was ok. Pricey and nothing special. I really wanted some fresh fruit and it was just a mediocre fruit plate for $11. The same area where Mi Casita is, there is a bagel shop where you can have breakfast and coffee as well. Yeah, the blue lights and techno music are a little much but I never felt overwhelmed by it. The safe in our room was broken, and within 20 minutes someone had come to replace it. We reserved a partial ocen view as an upgrade and we could not have been happier. It was a great view and the bed is facing the windows which makes it lovely in the morning. You can tell they upgraded the rooms but only with trendier amenities. There was no fridge, but there was an iPod clock radio. The rooms are minimal, but the bed was comfortable. It was like they went to Ikea and decorated the rooms. At 4pm our room wasnt cleaned one day (it appeared they had just fogotten the 9th floor completely) and that was annoying. The cleanliness of the rooms is questionable but I am pickier than most. We were on the 9th floor and never really heard any of the late nite club music and dancing that others did. It rained one evening when we were going out and I thought the hotel should supply umbreallas but they didnt. You can walk to Walgreens but the area around the hotel isnt great. You really just want to be near the ocean because the ocean breeze and view are wonderful. When we stepped away one afternoon, we wanted to go right back to the beach!Restaurants we enjoyed: Raices in OSJ, Mi Casita, and Platos which is down Isla Verde Ave past the el san juan hotel. And Pikayo is inside the Museum. It was superb. We each had a chef's tasting menu and I cannot say enough about it. Our experience there was delicious, romantic and memorable. Beware of the trip into OSJ. While it is a very quaint area with many many bars and restaurants, its an $18 cab ride one way. Cabs are not cheap so try to avoid them. Overall, we enjoyed our stay very much. It was relaxing and just what we needed.
