{"text":"Highly Recommended It's hard to find a perfect hotel (except maybe the Peninsula in Bangkok), but this one does it's best. We stayed for 11 days which is a fair test. Check in was around midnight and the service was excellent. The entire hotel is non-smoking, which for us was a bonus. The room was a little small but most adequate, with a flat panel TV on the wall, a good work station, bar fridge, coffee and tea kettle and a very comfortable king sized bed.Try to get the odd numbered rooms as they have much better exposure to pool and view. (such as it is in Singapore.) We noticed a small amount of water on the marble floor when we first entered the bathroom. Next morning we called and they sent someone up to repair the leak. This hotel had just finished a major remodel, so you can expect the odd problem. In the end they moved us to the room next door, which had the same bathroom without the leak. I rank a lot of hotels by the shower and the rain shower head in these bathrooms was one of the best I've ever used.The rate included an excellent breakfast buffet, which catered to all the different ethnic meal choices very well. In addition they restocked the bar in our room every day and supplied high speed internet access (that worked) both at no additional charge.One little tip...they are demolishing a building located between the Hyatt and Marriot, which are across the street from the Royal Plaza. Although the noise was considerable 12 hours a day, it was not apparent in our hotel, but must have been terrible in the those two hotels.
