{"text":"Raffles never disappoints Have stayed at the Raffles on several occasions on route from Australia to Europe and have always loved it. The overriding point about the hotel is that it is very beautiful with great service.Rooms: Very spacious and lovely with a small siting and dining area that is semi closed off from the rest of the room. Most rooms open onto an outdoor corridor that has a table and 2 chairs outside of each room, lovely to sit and sip tea or read a book. Air conditioning very efficient (much like all of singapore!)Bathroom: Large marble bathroom with double basin separate shower and bath tub, well appointed.Room Service: excellent. Have even found my shoes polished and stuffed with tissue paper on my return.Breakfast Room: Good variety but not the best coffee. When they are nto really busy, all the staff in the hotel will address you by name by the second day!Room Service: Not the regular room service, you press a service button and seconds later somebody appears to come come to your room and take your order. As the hotel has a number of restaurants, they can easily track down whatever it is you are after off the normal room service menu.Swimming Pool: one of the reasons i return so often to the Raffles is the swimming pool. It is very beautiful with dark green tiles and a waters edge. Unless there is a heavy down pour, the water is very warm and inviting.Service: exceptional. After checking out, I forgot my wallet in the room and remebered hours later. The swimming pool staff contacted room service and even the management became involved until it was found a couple of minutes later. The manager came up to the pool to return it to me, even though we told them we would collect it from front reception, and not one cent was missing. By the time we left, even the porter knew what happened and told us how releived they were that we found it before we left. Obviously things don't usually go wrong at the Raffles!I will continue to find excuses to stay at the Raffles!
