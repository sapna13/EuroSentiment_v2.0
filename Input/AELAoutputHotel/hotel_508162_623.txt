{"text":"Good Hotel We stayed at Sunscape the Beach Nov 15th for 2 weeks, we booked this hotel in January and was looking forward to it for nearly a year!When we arived we were given a drink while we waited to be served at check in, this was quick and easy and were given directions to our room.Our room was lovely, in the 5th block, over looking the pool and with a king size bed and a bath which we requested as my boyfriend has bad back we cant have a shower! The porter bought our bags up but we had to wait an hour for these,Although we had loved this room we had to change rooms on the 19th November because this room was inter connecting and a couple from America next door were having a massive argument next door and it really scared us, the front desk were not helpful about this and kept just saying to come back if it happened again but about the 4th time when we said it was getting worse, the changed us and we were given the 3rd block ground floor so we can walk out onto the swimming pool. The only thing was there were no light bulbs, the tap had fallen off the sink, balcony door was locked and the shower wouldn't work! We get this fixed but the safe kept not locking we got this looked at 5 times but in the end we just had to put up with this!The swimming pool was really nice very big, once we changed rooms we just got two sunbeds and put them outside our room so this was very handy.The restaurant was nice we only tried the world cafe, chinese and sea side grill. The chinese we didn't like, the sea side grill was nice but most days we went to buffet as this was just easier, most days the food was lovely.The entertainment was good but they don't really cater for people going away for two weeks as it was all repeated on a weekly basis, we went to the disco twice but it wasn't anything special, See Dave from Jamaica he is really funny we only made it three times as we were so jet lag we were in bed by 11 most nights!!The only thing that let it down was the service in the resturant we would ask for drink and hardly ever get them this was asking about 6 times and in the morning would give my boyfriend and then we would ask for milk and they never bought it!!Do the monster truck safari, this was really good, we also did the saona adventure was was good but i was sea sick!!!Over all we really enjoyed the hotel it was really warm but also rained most days just the service of the staff could have been better and made sure the room we changed to was up to scratch before they told us to move!Also if you go to the upper lobby at night were bite spray as i kept getting bitten an then went there towards the end of holiday we went up there and got very badly bitten, 54 times one leg, 50 other leg and one of breast - got infected, the next day was so shocked to see these and then they started looking like blisters.We really enjoyed it here and would go back. x ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1459,"mention":"chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1452},{"endOffset":2197,"mention":"monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Monster_Energy"],"startOffset":2190}]}
