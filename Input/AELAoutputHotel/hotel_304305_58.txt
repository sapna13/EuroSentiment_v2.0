{"text":"For the price, a solid choice With the dollar at an all time low against the yen, I think all hotel reviews in Japan need to be taken in the context of price. I paid $160 per room per night on Expedia which I thought was a fair price. I had 2 rooms, as I was traveling with teenagers. We were in the older Main tower which is circa 1970. I had very low expectations and was pleasant;ly surprised. While the drapes are gold velvet (?)and the furnishings are from the set of the Brady Bunch, everything is very clean and the rooms spacious. The beds are reasonably comfortable and the linens were acceptable. One of the rooms smelled of cigarette smoke but the other was fresh. The bathrooms were large and upgraded. My only real knock on the place is the A\/C was antiquated. It was cool every day we were in Tokyo but I could always count on our room being warm and stuffy when we returned. Also, don't bother applying for their membership card unless you plan on paying rack rates. If you book through Expedia or any other service, the membership is useless. The morning buffet is wonderful with a high price tag to go along with it ($30+). We spluged one morning, the other mornings we ate at the pancake place across the street (under the Sizzler). And BTW, the Sizzler has an awesome salad bar if you are sick of sushi. Don't laugh, I counted 7 kinds of tomatoes. It's amazing. My summary, for the price I paid on Expedia, Keio Plaza was a fair value. I don't think the Main Tower is worth much more than what I paid.
