{"text":"Great Family Weekend We visited the hotel for just a time-out weekend in January with our 2 girls ages 9 and 11. At first we were worried that we should have stayed closer to the beach, but after one afternoon on the strip at South Beach, the Four Seasons was welcome oasis. South Beach was a bit too much of a freak show for the children (even though we are New Yorkers). The pool deck overlooking the bay and nearby condos is perfect for a day or 2 of relaxing and the staff and drinks are welcoming (the Brazillian drinks especially tasty). The children were able to amuse themselves the entire time, swimming and exploring the 2 acre deck. We adults enjoyed excellent massages in the spa and the children had pedicures and haircuts. All very swanky. The haircuts were less expensive than my local salon in NYC. My only gripes are that the Acqua restaurant is a bit sterile, and we would have like to hang out at the poolside Bahia bar in the evening after the kids were in bed. Unfortunately, a corporate event had closed the bar to guests. (A bit annoying given what we were paying for those 2 nights!) If that is standard procedure on weekends--ask before booking if there are any closures of that sort. Note also that the rooms are deluxe, the views lovely, but in most rooms, no balcony or fresh air. It is a glass and steel tower after all. There is a touch of that corporate downtown expense account feel. In other words--this is not luxury adventure travel a la the Caves in Jamaica, but it is convenient and just fine for a short get-away. Big Props to Steve Goth in the security department who mailed me back my daughter's winter coat left in the room. And finally, note that no matter how organized and efficient the Four Seasons is, the Miami airport is an absolute zoo on a Sunday afternoon, so don't be lulled into cutting the hotel to airport time too short in order to have one last swim in the gorgeous pool.
