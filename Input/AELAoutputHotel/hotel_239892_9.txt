{"text":"A very Nice Place for a Week's Stay... Do to a future Job Transfer, my family and I combined a House Hunting trip and Vacation into one and stayed at the SeaTac Homewood suites for a week from Mar 14-21.Although the hotel appears very plain from outside, we found upon entering, a large, well appointed and very comfortable Lobby\/Great Room with two fireplaces. (This area also doubles as the breakfast and cocktail area) The two bedroom-two bath suite was very roomy and comfortable for 6 adults and one small dog. With a fully equip kitchen, this made for an ideal central point to explore the Seattle Area.Our suite overlooked the Green River and the river walkway was perfect for walking the dog in the morning. Although trains could be heard they were not bothersome and added a light country feel to the atmosphere.MT route 150 (METRO BUS) which stops less than a 1\/8 of mile from the hotel is a direct (no transfers) to downtown Seattle with stops 2 or 3 blocks from both Pike's Public Market and the Space Needle. It saved on gas and traffic headaches.The staff was extremely helpful and courteous and the business room with two Internet ready PC's was very convenient along with the 24hr self serve laundry, which we all used. As for the reports of numerous vehicle break-ins, the hotel has a few office buildings and a large park in the immediate area which would account for these. We parked all the way in the back of the property and did not have any problems.My wife and I will be returning in late July or early August and most likely be staying here for a week or two until our new home is ready.
