{"text":"Location is everything Just got back from Beijing - I had read many reviews about the Red Wall Hotel and was not sure what I would find. Beds were hard and carpets were dirty, but I had hot water and clean sheets. Had cool air and electric. Not bad for a Chinese Hotel at less than $30 US a night. Restaurant was okay, but many good restaurants in area. Right next door is a neat little hotpot restaurant where you can get a good meal for under $4 US. For another dollar you can have a Chinese Yanjing Beer - it's good. If you turn left out of the hotel - walk a block and turn left again, you will find a neat little market street. There are several restaurants, some with English menu. If you walk all the way to the end of that street you will find the Alley Cafe. They have American food (coke, burger and fries for $4US )free internet, and can help with setting up trips to the Great Wall and other places. As you are walking down this street about half way down to the left is an alley way that has a Chinese food store. It,s a good place to pick up snacks. This is where the locals shop. The best thing about this hotel is the location. You can walk to the Forbidden City, Tian'an Men Square, Jing Shan Park, Bei Hai Park, Wangfujing Street - all less than 25 Minutes. I even waked to the Lama Temple which took 45 Minutes, but there were several cool hutongs on the way. Somewhere between the hotel and the Lama Temple I found a neat little place - The Pass By Bar - good Mutton and Cheese Pizza. WORST THING about this hotel is that taxi drivers do not know where it is, but I just had them drop me off at Jing Shan Park and walked the 5 mintues to the hotel. Overall, I was pleased with this place. If you want to travel in style, then don't stay here - However, if you like a little adventure and a good Chinese experience then this place is it. Oh yeah - take a good street map with you - you will not find a good one in Beijing - you will need it.
