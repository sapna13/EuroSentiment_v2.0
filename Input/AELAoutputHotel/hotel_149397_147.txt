{"text":"Resort 4 outa 5 but left with itchy Bumps Overall, Loved the resort Was impressed with grounds, lobby, rooms, buffet and attentive staff. It was worth the $30 upgrade for a suite as we spent a few evenings enjoying the balcony view. The front desk staff was happy to switch us from lower suite to an upper - privacy reason mostly.We came on a small, later shuttle but noticed bigger buses sometimes got great VIP greetings with coconut drinks and occasionally even dancers in the traditional red and blue dresses.The room was large and clean although missing face clothes until we caught the maid and requested them on the 2nd day. She had room cleaned before supper and no complaints there. Room had a little water leakage under air conditioner which was beside the bed. I was sick on bus for 1\/2 of one morning on 2 hr hot bus ride to Saona Island to snorkel (still not sure why) I was OK once we got off bus and on the boat. The next day my Sweety got the trots for full day so that could been from rinsing our teeth with their tap water or possible food?- I'd brought prescription antibiotic that seemed to help him recover. It was little hotter on the Caribbean side at Soana Island vs Punta Cana. I didn't see much else I'd go off the resort for as they had an awesome beach at the resort and also Saona Island and we can't beat their weather in our Canadian winters. We went in mid Jan and no sweater was needed either day or night. Always slight breeze so not stifling hot either. The staff aren't looking for tips and remember you when you do leave one. Didn't feel obligated and they were attentive and happy at both pools and no long waits there or front desk.Saw maids picking their own flowers from grounds for rooms? and grounds keepers happy to share opening a coconut for a drink. I took in an awesome massage at the Spa and even did a workout in their exercise room. Dr.s quarters were next door.Didn't see a lot of bugs\/insects - the odd mosquito - half the size of the Alberta ones! If that's what bit me they have twice the bite and itch though. Dr said it could have been bed bugs - but my sweety showed no signs of them so gotta wonder - I didn't see anything on sheets either when checked although I did see a few mattresses being replaced. Shopping was close - outside main gate and nice diversion if you don't mind the hassles of come see my shopcompetition specials today etc They don't budge too far off prices and will remember you next day if you bought. Sweety enjoyed the small bar with giant $4 Presidenta? beer in Bavaro Plaza across the street from resort. The paintings can be rolled up if you can spare the extra couple Kgs in luggage - ( we didn't have much - 20 kg each) with Sky Service. Was also relieved we sat in emergency exit as long 7 1\/2 hr flight for us. - Still itched for couple days after being home and hope I'm not left with the scars.
