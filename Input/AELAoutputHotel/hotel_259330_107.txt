{"text":"Wonderful vacation!!! I will start by saying: don't listen to the bad reviews!!!!!I read all the reviews before we left in our vacation (May 1-8) and to be honest I was a little stressed out with all the bad reviews i read. But.....I did not see any of the bad things that people wrote here. So I guess they would have to look for 5,6 stars hotels from now on...in Europe not in Dominican and they will probably sill not be happy.Anyways.....1. We booked our vacation with sunquest and we were in the sunquest select section.2. FLIGHT - absolutely wonderful (both ways)....3. we were picked up from the airport in a really nice bus and the trip was around 30 min. to the resort4. ROOMS - we were in the sunquest select section and the rooms are great: new, clean, no bugs or spiders, no leackings, we had hot water every day (we were in building s7 and 8), we had new sheets every day and clean towels.6. THE RESORT there are 3 parts of the resorta. the main resort - right on the beach, with pools, restaurants but the rooms are olderb. the select section - the rooms are great, and it has its own pools,jacuzzi, bufet, bar, tenis court, kids club, minigolf and others, The staff here is great and I liked the food here better than in the main resort (more variety) also it was not that crowded as in the main resort.c. the club section - has the building from 1-6 which also has its own pool. I cannot say more about this section as we did not go there at all.7. FOOD - there was plenty of food, really good, something for everybody and the fruits were great.8. BEACH - we had to walk aprox.5 min from the select section to the beach but we really enjoyed it....it was a nice, short walk but if yu didn't feel like walking you could take the troley that would go every 10 min. The beach is AMAZING - the best I saw so farI hope this will help people relax when they go there.....f you have any problem at all, the staff was ready to fix it right away. We were 4 families and none of us had anything to complain.EXCELENT TRIP and i would return here any time.
