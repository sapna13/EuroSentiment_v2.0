{"text":" Passage to Singapore  from The Natprachas - THAILAND Start your passage from Changi Airport.You can reach this Hotel by Taxi, Limousine, Paid Travel Agent arrangement and MRT. Airport Shuttle can not send you there because they claimed that it is out of bound, they are only take you to City Centre's Hotel. (Eventhough they advertised that they send you anywhere except Sentosa area and Changi Villages ). If you use MRT, take the HarbourFront Line, then, take 143 Bus to the Hotel (Bus stop is nearby the Hotel). The Hotel itself situated between St. Theresa Church  Canadian International School. Meaning, this hotel is in the Residential Area rather than Tourist Disctrict or Business environment ( do not expect to find anything around the Hotel that money can buy-Food ,Drink, Souvenir, etc ) Those who expect some action, light  sound, please do not bother to stay here (but I like) Considering the price you have paid for, this Hotel is good enough (for Singapore Standard and not Thailand-For this price in Thailand, you can easily get a 4 star Hotel) I can say this Hotel is 2+ star but the place is clean, area is safe, staff  Management were friendly, helpful...Room (superior) was not big but enough to move about., Bathroom is surely very small with only shower and no bathtub ( I do not mind ), limitted amenities provided, small towel (not so white colour anymore but fresh  clean) Other was OK EXCEPT : pillows are like a Flat-tire, I had to fold to sleep on it, REfrigerator seem like noone ever touch it for 200 years ( forget about a nice cool drink with ice cube - but they provides Free are; Coffee \/Tea Sachets with Kettle and two bottles of Drinking Water) ,NO BLANKET provided and outdated TV reception with mostly local programme, no Radio........ Breakfast included in the room price. For us Asian, its OK, delicious, they have Omelette, Sausages(local), Fried Noodle ( it surely only fried noodle with soy Sauce and no Veggi or meats at all ) and Baked Bean with Bread, butter, Jam, Coffee(local), Tea ( Lipton ), Milk(smell strange) and ice cold drinking water, all are Buffet Style ( I saw a couple of Westerner turn down the breakfast, just had Coffee  left ). for sight-seeing trip, this hotel, for us, is very convenient. We took bus 143 to VivoCity for Monorail to Sentasa ( only less than 10 minutes ) and went by the same bus number 143 to China Town  Newton\/Orchard. If you prefer MRT, the nearest one are HarbourFront MRT and Outtram MRT. In general I can rate this as a 4**, Value for Money, Safe  Clean, Friendly and Convenient..All these were good enough for us to decide to stay here when we plan to go to Singapore again next time ","annotations":[{"endOffset":578,"mention":"Canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":570},{"endOffset":1365,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1360},{"endOffset":1365,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1360},{"endOffset":1559,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1555},{"endOffset":1621,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1615},{"endOffset":1997,"mention":"Bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1992},{"endOffset":2005,"mention":"butter","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Butter_chicken","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Butterscotch"],"startOffset":1999},{"endOffset":2010,"mention":"Jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":2007},{"endOffset":2030,"mention":"Tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":2027},{"endOffset":2183,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2177}]}
