{"text":"Nice, buuuuuuuut After reading all of the great reviews we booked this hotel for our pre-cruise stay in Seattle. We had advised the hotel that we would not be arriving until very late (actually the next morning) . After flying a redeye all the way from Tampa FL and arriving at the hotel at 3 AM we were told by the night auditor that he had cancelled our reservation but could put us in a room, whatever at this point but he put us in a room with 2 double beds, not the king we had guaranteed. After going down to the desk again and pursuing it we were finally shown to a very nice suite which was an upgrade over our original room. He couldn't figure out how to correct the rate but assured me it would be taken care of by the manager in the morning. Sure enough the next morning I spoke with the day manager and was assured it would be taken care of. After enjoying the breakfast provided and a day of sightseeing in Seattle, we returned to find the room had not been cleaned. Once again, I contacted the front desk and after an apologie the room was cleaned, sort of, they made the bed and changed the towels but did not vacuum or even give us fresh coffee for the coffee maker. The next morning at checkout our bill was indeed corrected to the proper rate. I asked the desk clerk to call us a cab to take us to the port and instead they called a limosine service they use. The price was only $25 so I didn't complain but it wasn't what I asked for. Overall, we found the hotel average at best. The Avida products and furnishings provided a nice touch and the free shuttle downtown was convenient but the problems we had though somewhat resolved don't allow me give a better review. NO traveler at 3AM who has guaranteed a room should EVER have to worry that there room isn't available after it has been paid for. There is NO excuse for that. The proper way to have handled it after holding us up would have been to comp the room for that night , especially after it wasn't even cleaned the next day. All in all sort of amateurish way to run a hotel.
