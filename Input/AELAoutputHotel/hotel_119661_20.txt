{"text":"A Great Value! With newly renovated rooms, free parking, free wireless internet, free in-room coffee and other great amenities, one can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ask for a better bargain with the prices they had to offer. We stayed here recently for a get-away and wanted to really experience San Francisco, which the Broadway Manor Inn made a lot easier with their receptionist advising us where and what to see and also booking us tours for cable cars as well. With a newly renovated hotel, the rooms also had new furniture and provided amenities such as a microwave and a refrigerator. Parking usually in San Francisco is an issue, but with Broadway Manor providing free parking, that also right in the middle of the city did wonders for our stay. We were able to easily park our car either in their front lobby or their underground garage and had nothing to worry about. If you are like me and want city views while staying in the city, well then the Broadway Manor Inn had to offer just that. Being on the corner of Van Ness and Broadway, I was able to overlook Van Ness Ave and just enjoy the city feel in general. We stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and never did have a single problem with their services nor did I mind the fact that just 1 block away was Polk Street and it offered a wide range of selection of foods from Indian to Japanese to Mexican to Western as well. I would definitely recommend this place to my family and friends and to all. The next time we decide to take another get-a-way to San Francisco, we know exactly where we are staying!
