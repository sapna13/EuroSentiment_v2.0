{"text":"Beautiful Location, Room  My husband and I celebrated our anniversary here the first week of October. We have been to Hawaii many times and I always wanted to try the Kahala. We were a bit put off by some of the reviews but decided to give it a try. We used Amex points for most of the nights but paid over $500 a night for the additional night. Positives - The location is quiet and the beach is very nice, It was very slow due to the time of year and the economy so no problems with lounges around the pool or beach. All of the staff was very pleasant and helpful. We ate breakfast almost every morning at the Plumeria, the buffet was really good although expensive but no more than any high end Hawaii resort. We also had dinner there a couple of nights and enjoyed the meals. The room we had was a mountain view with a lanai and the view was beautiful even though it wasn't an ocean view. Note that not all of the rooms have a lanai. The room was large by Hawaii standards and had a nice flat screen. The bathrooms had a huge amount of room and storage space. Two closets and extra drawers. We had dinner a couple of nights in Waikiki and one night in Hawaii Kai and couple in the Kahala area. It is really easy to get to Waikiki, a pretty drive through gorgeous residential area and the front side of Diamond Head.Negatives - The pool area needs a facelift. The pool is small and not in great shape. It didn't look like they washed down the pool deck area every night like most resorts do so it always seemed kind of sandy and not really clean. The coping around the pool was kind of crumbly. The lounge chairs looked pretty old and it looked like they had been repainted and the paint was wearing off and dirty. Not what I would expect at a 5 star hotel. I know lots of people come for the dolphin program but to me it seems cruel to have them confined to a fairly small area. It is billed as a learning program but I am sure it is pretty lucrative. My husband and I both felt the Kahala would be improved by getting rid of the dolphin area and revamping the pool area with a nice big pool like other resorts have. New furniture with tables and chairs besides just chaise lounges would be nice. It would really make them unique to Oahu as none of the Waikiki hotels other than the Hilton have nice pools. I don't know if I will go back again unless I hear the place has fixed up the pool area etc. I wasn't too upset since I was using points and not $. If I was paying over $500 a nite I would have been bummed. We have stayed at the Marriott and the Moana and at a couple of hundred dollars less a night I would go back there. If you are looking for a luxury hotel away from Waikiki I would recommend the Wailea area in Maui as the 5 star places there are actually 5 star with nicer pools. Wailea also gives a better choice of restaurants and shops in close proximity.
