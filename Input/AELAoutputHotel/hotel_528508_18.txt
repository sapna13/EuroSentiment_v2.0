{"text":"Bad hotel stay away. The Artemis Hotel in Amsterdam.It was my first and last stay in this hotel.The welocome was ok no problems there.After check in we got our card for the room.When I arrived on the second flor opened the door of (my) room to find out that the room was already occupied.Imagine your self having a romantik moment with your wife or girlfriend and then a completly stranger comes in the room...how 4* is that?Ok ,I went down told the reception about that matter and eventualy got an other room.Checked, and yes there was no other people in. I arrived with my car from Germany and was told that the hotel has a private parking for the costumers.A privated paying parking that was.Rates 2.40euro per hour...Ok Amsterdam has a parking problem ,I accept that,but Artemis Hotel is not in the centre of the city.A lot of spare space all around the hotel is free, but no you have to pay.So...here comes the hit...When I got back from town the first day I saw 4-5 cars parked outside the hotel.A Mercedes , a Range Rover sport , Porsche and an other car.I decided to park there also.First day ok ,second day at 22:00 I wanted to leave the hotel and saw that my car had a nice parking ticket of 50 euro.The area of the hotel is far away from the center where you really should be carefull where to park...and there are no police controls of course.Wild guess...the hotel called for the police to give tickets because they was loosing money from their huge underground parking lot which should be free for a 4* hotel...at least. The room cleaning service...Bad BAD bad.The room cleaning was only to change towels and make the beds.That is all.I had a smoking room...my ashtray was never cleaned ,some small garbage was never removed and the best of all together is some of my MONEY WAS STOLEN.Oh yes I have evidence for that.I left some change money like 5-6 euros on the desk in my room and took a picture of them with time and date also left a 50 euro bill and left the room.When I come back the 50 euro bill there the garbage was there the ashtray full like always but the coins where gone.Just great for a 4* hotel don't you think.I went to the reception told them to change my departure for the next morning.I hope you all have a nice time in the famous Artemis Hotel.
