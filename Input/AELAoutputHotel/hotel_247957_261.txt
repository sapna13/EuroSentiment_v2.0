{"text":"Loved the Mangos I went in June of 06' for seven nights eight days. The food was absolutely horrible.I felt as if they tried too hard to get American style food, and it just wasnt working . I came to a diff country and i wanted to eat Dominican Food, not wanna be chinese. My diet consisted of liquor, banana's and mangos the whole time i was their. The beach was beautiful, the staff were very friendly. Our room was always cleaned, with fresh towles daily. The pool was a little dirty, but what can you expect, people are getting in and out all the time. I found it very quiet, not a young crowd. The age range for our group of women were (21-34), their were more couples and family's than anything, The disco, had horrible music. They replayed songs over and over! We went off the resort in to the town, we got a ton of clothes and gifts for DIRT cheap! Try to go on the expeditions. They are fun. Plus you really get to see how poor that country really is, and to think WOW I should really appreciate what i have living in the USA. Over all i would rate my trip at 6, and i wouldn't go back to this resort. The liquor could have been better, food should have been Dominican, and to use a payphone around their to call home was a pain in the a*, especially when they ate up your phone card minutes very fast! Have Fun! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":849,"mention":"DIRT","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Dirt_cake"],"startOffset":845}]}
