{"text":"Wonderful Hotel in a Good City Stayed in Sofitel New York from 6 - 11 April 07 was greeted by very friendly staff and very professional staff. Upon arrival I was able to change Travellers Cheques without charges up to $200 but as I wanted more they said that on the 1st exchange only they would do this for $400 (had I known how little we would spend I would not have put the lady at reception out.) We were there for an easter break, both me and my partner really found the hotel to be the best location wise, cleanliness, friendliness and so on I cannot praise Sofitel enough for keeping French Front of House staff to retain that consistently high level of service.If you have booked to stay at the Sofitel New York you will not go away disappointed. New York may not be what you are expecting but the hotel will be!Found New York to be so so. It is not a city we could fall in love with such as Paris but it is okay and enjoyed the stay. Well worth a visit but not much in the way of romantic essence especially not at The Empire State Building as I thought there would be here if no where!The Empire State Building is okay, it is a construction site inside and not only do you queue to get up but you queue to get down too and Top of The Rock at Rockerfeller Centre is far better, much closer to the essence of New York I was expecting and more professionally managed.As other reviewers have said if you are due to stay at the Sofitel anywhere in the world it is well worth getting yourself a Sofitel Privilege Card in advance - takes about 3 weeks to arrive but if you apply online there are no fees and you can ring France obtain your card number and expiry as I did and quote upon arrival or booking in order to gain you can get your free drinks on arrival and 4pm check out without hassle. You need to ring France to get your details if they don't arrive in time number on their website.Didn't spend much as food was relatively inexpensive best meal and most expensive meal we had was at Grand Central Station in the restaurant opposite Jordon Steak House, can't remember the name something like Caprianio. Also The Red Flame Diner a few doors down from the Sofitel is excellent for a cheap and cheerful meal but a bit of a nightmare at breakfast time very busy but that just goes to show how good it is not just tourists either.All in all a very nice experience both of New York and Sofitel. But everyone's tastes are always different but the hotel most certainly will be favoured by the majority but the jury is still out on New York.
