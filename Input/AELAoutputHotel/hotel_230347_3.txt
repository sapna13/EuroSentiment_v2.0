{"text":"Avoid this hotel Yesterday I was in Frankfurt on business and was booked into the Intercity Hotel across from the train station. I only hope that the company saved money, because comfort was certainly not an issue.It is true that one hears no train noise. However, the noise inside the hotel is considerable. Doors banging, closets in the adjacent room opening, elephantine footsteps on the next floor, etc.I was given a room on the ground floor, where in case of fire the door to the bar\/lobby is not allowed to be shut (I tried); ergo I was treated gratis to a concert of loud-mouthed drinkers until 1 a.m. To balance that out, the maids started rattling glassware, carts, etc., at 6:30 a.m. One of them tried to enter my room before 9 a.m. But the real kicker was the TV unexpectedly waking me at 6 a.m. I turned it off, fuming at a system which allowed the instructions of a previous guest to disturb my sleep. Unsuccessfully wooed Morpheus until 7:30 a.m. when the TV blared again. This time I called the receptionist, who, flustered, assured me someone would come to check. Thirty minutes later, having given up hope of succour and still gamely trying to rest, I received a call from the front desk saying I had neglected to press the OK button for a call left the previous evening, therefore the TV would continue to remind me. (At midnight when I entered my room, the omniscent TV had told me that a call had come. In vain I sought information from the TV and from the front desk. I was assured no call had come. Not true.)Even the manager attempted (admittedly, in not quite in so many words) to persuade me that these disturbances of sleep were my fault for having failed to press the OK button (also not true). Should I add that the remote control for the television was far from self-explanatory?Another colleague was awakened at 3 a.m.! But at least only once.I had to request that the soap containers be filled. No shower caps, shampoo, etc. Drains sluggish. Pillow was thin, although upon request an extra was provided. The A\/C did work. The only other positive aspect was the not-quite-automatic offer of a free CombiTicket for public transportation. I received one at check-in, but other colleagues had to ask for it.One expects no better from the former proprietors of this hotel chain, but it is now owned and operated by the Steigenberger group. From THEM even transient guests should expect more.
