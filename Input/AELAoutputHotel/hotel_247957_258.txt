{"text":"Had a great vacation here! I just got back from a week at the Occidental Grand Punta Cana Resort. I was preparing myself for problems as I read negative reviews, but I had a great stay! Arrived at the hotel at around 7pm, checkin was fast and easy.We had a very nice room, in building 12. I read about alot of complaints about the rooms, and I can only speak for the ones I saw (my own room as well as my parents room which was also in building 12). Large kingsize bed was very comfortable, clean room, small sitting area, tv with lots of english channels, large covered balcony with chairs, clean bathroom - sometimes the water took a while to warm up or the water pressure was a bit low but no worries - its a vacation! Never had any blackouts or problems like that.There is alot of negative comments about the front desk\/customer service. While we did once have to call 3 times for towel and had a few minor requests go unfullfilled, none of these things ruined my vacation, and I firmly believe if you go with a laid back attitude and WANT to have a good vacation, these small inconveniences will not phase you. I wouldn't even have mentioned them except to counter other reviews on here and I will have long forgotten about this when remembering what a great time I had here.The ground of this hotel are beautiful, clean, the walkways and tiles floors get VERY slippery when wet - I read that in the reviews and its so true, just be careful, I did slip once and twisted my ankle. The lobby has lots of comfortable seating areas to sit at and have a drink or relax in the evening. The pool are great, lots of chairs never had a problem. Serve staff at the bars are always friendly and quick - some speak minimal english but there is always someone who can help.The food at this hotel was great, TONS of selection.We ate at the breakfast buffet everyday, there is everything you can think of, the omlets that they make in front of you are awesome! For lunch we usually ate at the Home Run bar by the pool, they had fries, nachoes, burgers, etc. Also at at the beach club buffet for lunch once and it had lots of selection.The buffet dinner also has tons of choices, lots of variety of western and local choices, the pasta station where they make it in front of you is so good! Also they have lots of deserts and ice cream.The pizza place and taco place also have very good food!For a la carte I ate at the Italian resteraunt and the Grill. The Italian had lots of choices for various pasta dishes, with salads and deserts as well. The grill is a brazilian steakhouse where they serve sausage, chicken, beef and pork, as well as salad and desert bar. Both were really good.My party of 4 never had any problem with the food at any of the places.There is also the nightly entertainment which generally wasn't my thing, but the shows change every night and they put on a good show. Hope this review helps for those travelling to punta cana, if you go looking for a good vacation and have a good attitude, you will enjoy your stay at this resort.
