{"text":"Before you book READ THIS Ok then before i go on im gonna break this down for you all and then you can make your own decision so firstly boys and girls if your sitting comfortably.....Ill begin.1. AccomodationAccomodation was absolutely top notch, ive been to the Dominican before and this was the bet ive ever seen, the main area was a split level room with the dining room on the bottom level, it had sattelite TV with a lot of english speaking channels and a fridge that was stocked every day with beer, water and pop. there was loads of cupboard space in this area and also a settee. in the top level there was a double queen size bed with lamps on either side and a fan above the bed. The area leading into the Bathroom was full of mirroed wardrobes which also included a safe (no fee) in this area there was a large sink area with all round wall to wall mirrors...good for checking if youd tanned ya [----]. the rooms were cleaned to a high standard every day and the air con was freezing, lovely after a hot day in the sun.2. FoodThe main resteraunt was bloody brilliant with lots and lots of choice, for anyone who didnt want to try something a little different there was an American station with your typical American food Burgers, Pizza etc. The resteraunts which were all inclusive were also good but were difficult to book (3 days advance was the norm) not once did anyone i know get a bad tummy off the food. there is lots of different little resteraunts on the beach were you get food at anytime throughout the day and at midnight they do snacks in the main resteraunt.3. EntertainmentOh dear this is were it all started to go wrong, quite simply they do not cater for ANYONE who speaks English...If you can speak spanish then thats fine, can you speak itallion then thats ok too, maybe you speak german french or russian well thatll do nicely! not once did i hear the night time entertainment speak English and this [----] me off no end, i had a 13 boy with me and to keep a teenager entertained when there was no other English speaking kids was difficult. At the bar the staff would make a point of serving the spanish first and when they did serve you it took ages to order anything because of the language barrier.4. Things to do. The beach was gorgeous and the water was crystal clear, the sand was golden and was constantly being cleaned, we didnt spend much time round the pool as it was full of jonny foreighners stareing and gawping, we found one English family out of about 600 people so to that end we were definately in the minority. The full time we were there the everyone that was not english speaking was rude arrogant and would not apologise for anything even if they knocked into my kid.....to which i give an explicit lesson in english to one guy. The trips that we paid for were top class...The 4 wheel drive buggys are a must, and the trip on the boat to watch the sunset with dinner was ace....DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BOOK TO GO SEA FISHING....spoke to loads of english on route out and they done the same and didnt catch a thing...it is just used as an excuse for the fishermen to go trawling with nets and make some wxtra cash.Looking back it was nice to get away for a couple of week in the sun but given the choice again i would definately NOT go back to the east of the island and instead go back up north to puerto plata again were there is lots of englsh speaking friendly people. I spoke to quite a few Canadians who had the same problems as myself and got told a story of one couple that were that disgusted in the way they were treat by the foreighners they moved hotels at there own cost.If you dont mind getting treat like a mug off the staff and anyone who doesnt speak the queens english then this is the place for you.......enjoy! 5.
