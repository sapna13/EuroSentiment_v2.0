{"text":"NOT a business hotel - service sucks Stayed here for a week on business back in May. Would NEVER go back. Recently changed management to HILTON and employees are cleary very unhappy. They completed a big renovation and it shows in the design of the very modern rooms that look identical to the modern 21st century HILTON rooms have seen in other cities (including NYC). Flat screen TVs, cable hookups, and nice bathrooms. Only drawback, doesn't feel very Hawaii if you are looking for that.More importantly, customer service at this hotel was HORRIBLE! Employees are clearly disgruntled and disempowered. Countless (and simple) requests to front desk, room service, and business center went ignored and were screwed up (with a very surly attitude, even when our concerns were raised to management). We called in advance to make sure their business center (they claim to be a business-centered hotel) could accommodate our need for a few hundred photocopies...they made us feel like criminals and second class citizens, and their equipment did not work properly. They refused to give us paper until we threatened them with a formal complaint. The 24-hour restaurant delivers pretty decent food, but again service is dramatically absent, and it takes 35 minutes to get your food, even when they are practically empty. Room service is even worse - one night we had to put in our order three times for it to finally be delivered to our room.Again, stay away from this hotel, especially if you are on business. The rooms are nice, and the location is cool for Kuhio Ave, a few blocks back from waikiki boardwalk. But the service is a major dealbreaker.
