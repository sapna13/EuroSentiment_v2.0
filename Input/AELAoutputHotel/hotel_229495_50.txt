{"text":"Great for a family break in amsterdam I booked this hotel after reading the reviews on this site and just wanted to share my experiences for all those parents looking for a family friendly hotel in Amsterdam. Having visited Amsterdam in my heady student days I knew it was the kind of city more suited to adult weekend breaks than action packed escapes for kids. Amsterdam is however a great place for a long weekend with young kids if you stay at a hotel like this.Situated on the edge of the museum district and a stones throw from the Vondel Park, this a well located hotel. The tram stops are just opposite the front of the hotel taking you to Centraal Station in less than 10 mins. Museums are in walking distance, as is the famous Liedesplein which is full of bars, restos and 'coffee shops'. Bigger attractions such as Madame Tussauds and the big department stores are a straight tram ride away, again less than 10 mins and very walkable if the weather is fine. The great thing about the hotel is that its in a well lit; safe area well a way from the red light district, something you just don't want your young kids to see. If you are after a charming hotel capturing the spirit of Amsterdam this is not for you. It's an ugly imposing seventies building servicing business travellers and airline crews. The terrible facade however is compenstated by the wonderful views of canal and city. The rooms are very comfortable with fantastic beds, plush decor and smart bathrooms. The daily room service is impeccable and there are nice touches such as turn down service at night (with choccies!) and a daily newspaper. There is also a well stocked bar at reasonable prices. We had a family room which was a bit small for us but okay. There are many connecting rooms so you might be better to go for two small rooms if they aren't too pricey.There are two restaurants. The Bar and Grill serves sanwiches and pizzas to name but few and it's OK. The food is cafe standard and service fine. It's fine with kids as you don't feel under pressure if they start to perform! Price wise its fine too. The Quoy restaurant is more upmarket so we saved this til our last night but it's not riduculous price wise so we could have eaten there more. The kids menu is the same as the bar so not much choice but they will cater to your needs (i.e. no sauce here, cheese on the side not on top etc!! kids!!). Go in early as fills with busniess clients later and you kind of feel that you don't want your kids being noisy while someone is having a business dinner. It is not however a stuffy restaurant and kids are most definately welcomed and catered for. Word of warning: they will serve you kids meals with your main course unless you ask them not to! We waited over an hour for ours. Service is very slow but the food is lovely when it finally gets to your table!Take breakfast if its included as its great. Again its in the Quoy restaurant with a great view of the city rushing by. They will cook you anything and the staff are lovely. They will warm milk and don't care if kids spill things!!Try to get a family package as it includes breakfast (which is too expensive per head otherwise)and kids meals and one of the deluxe refurbished rooms. If you fancy a trip out of Amsterdam go to Majurodam in the Hague. It's Holland in miniature and your kids will love it.All in all, a great hotel if you've got kids as its comfortable, well situated and on the whole, kid friendly.
