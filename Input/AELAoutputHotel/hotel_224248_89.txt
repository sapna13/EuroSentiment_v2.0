{"text":"Good pre-cruise choice We booked this hotel for 2 nights prior to a cruise. For me ,it was a choice between this and the Holiday Inn Port of Miami. I chose this propert for several reasons.1) for a 2 night stay and no rental car, I liked the option of a suite with a kitchenette area complete with dishes ,stove ,microwave, dishwasher, fridge and a small dinette table. I dont plan to cook but it leaves the option open and to have a large fridge to hold water bottles, beer and some fruit was great. The bedroom had 2 beds (?full or queen) and the living area had a fold out couch. Both areas had a TV.2) We were arriving somewhat late and the proximity to the airport and the free shuttle worked for us.3)It was rated higher on trip advisor and had fewer lukewarm or negative comments. I also thought it would be less crowded. We paid more but we didnt mind.General impressions: 1)used the courtesy phone at the airport and were told where to meet the shuttle and were given a description of the shuttle. Its a busy area and there is a constant stream of shuttles form the various hotels. There didnt seem to be any specific pick-up area but rather find a place at the curb and wave at the shuttle that has your hotel name.2)Arrived to a clean spacious suite,check- in was no problem, (havent ever eperienced otherwise :) staff was courteous and helpful. Pool area was attractive ,clean and had plenty of space -tables ,chairs etc.3)Wal-greens,CVS (same type of store) and a grocery store are all across the street and provided easy access for snacks, water, liquor, personal care items etc. There is even a deli in the grocery store for chicken, sandwhiches, and salads.4) Didnt seem to be a lot of dining choices -burger King and someplace called Pollo Tropico? ,kind of a fast food chicken and seafood southern style,seemed to be popular. There was a small mall and bank across the street(ATM machine). We didnt explore too much and didnt have a rental car as we didnt want the hassle.5)Breakfast was basically a continental with 2 warm choices on the side, french toast sticks or eggs for example. A free newspaper and a cup of coffee are enough to make me happy. If you are looking for a prepared omelette go elsewhere.6)Shuttle to the Port was $10\/person,we arranged through the front desk . The shuttle was on time and we had no problems. They offer to pick you up as well but we had other plans.
