{"text":"Had great time!!! To summarize: Great hotel and in great location! Me and my wife stayed there for 3 nights.I will try not to repeat what others have written just important points:1) The suggestion to travel by bus to the hotel was excellent. Eurobus travels from the airport (just outside) to Plaza de Catalunya and back every 8-12 minutes (3.5EUR pp). The hotel is situated 3-4 minutes walk from there.2) Breakfast is excellent. Try if possible to include it in the hotel price (as otherwise it does not come cheap 15EUR pp). Most of the online sites do not include breakfast in their offers. We booked from a travel agent and recieved a better price from all the online ones (expedia, hotels.com etc.) + breakfast.3) Many people complained about the small rooms. Some however said that the rooms were fine. When we booked our room we specifically asked for the room numbers (literally!!) of the poeple who wrote good things on their rooms size. The hotel of course cannot ensure specific rooms (and it didn't) but at least in our case we got what we wanted. The room (not surprisingly) was large and confertable with a little balkony (Room 512). Looks through the reviews and add other series. Worth trying...2 little bad points:1) If you are suffering from noise to large extent, the room we satyed at (and I guess all rooms) have a little (very little) background buzz of the street below (which is a main road with heavy traffic).2) My wife complained that there are no English speaking TV channels on the TV (beside CNN). Bare in mind of this is important to you.... ","annotations":[]}
