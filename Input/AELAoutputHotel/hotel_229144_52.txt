{"text":"Only the One problem!! My wife and I and another couple stayed for five nights from 20th - 25th November 2006. It was our friends birthday on the 21st and decided on this hotel for it's location and other 'good' reports on this site. Only a five minute walk to the Hard Rock Cafe and plenty of bars and eating places. Although we had requested superior, adjoining rooms, we found at check-in that they were on different floors! However the two guys on reception soon sorted this small problem out and we had room 101 and 102. Despite hinting of a special occasion our friend didn't have any wine in the room as mentioned in some reports!! ...........However, at breakfast the first morning, (on his birthday), the young waitress who's name escapes me opened the Cava and we all had bucks fizz, it went down so well they brought out another bottle so were sloshed by 10.30am!! Superior rooms are a must, they were clean but the lighting was hopeless and a little too dark. We all found the breakfast to be first class with a large variety on offer. All of the staff were ok except for one....I guess all hotels have their 'bad-apple' and MEDDY was this hotel's bad one. We decided as it was raining to have food in the bar, we were the only guests in the bar area and it was around 9.30pm. There was no eye contact, he was rude....almost throwing the drinks at us, one of the orders was a pizza and when it came it turned out to only be cheese  tomato instead of what was ordered. When quizzed as to why he didn't inform us of a change he quite clearly couldn't care less!! No apology or anything. This spoiled what had been, a really good day! The rest of the staff were fantastic as was the whole five days. We mentioned the problem at check-out and the receptionist reduced our bar bill for that night by half and couldn't apologise enough. All in all well worth the money and we would stay again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":274,"mention":"Rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":270},{"endOffset":1393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1388},{"endOffset":1393,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":1388}]}
