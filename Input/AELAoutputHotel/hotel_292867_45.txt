{"text":"Loved the Room, Hated the Service We vacationed at Caribe Cub Princess from April 12th - 19th. Well I'll start off by saying that when we arrived the host asked us to leave our luggage in the front. We really didn't trust leaving them there, but we did. We checked in and since we booked the V.I.P. package they sent us to the concierge. They gave us everything we needed for our stay. We went back to our luggage and the trolly was there to take us to our room, but we were still a little confused on what or where we were going. We arrived at our room (2111) without our room key, the front had forgot to give us our key. The room cleaning lady had to open our room door while we waited for our keys. We were amazed at the view. We had a great view of the beach. Room service brought the key quickly. Well that night I was waiting to see a fight of Cotto vs. Gomez and 2 weeks prior to our vacation I personally called to make sure that they had HBO and they told me they did. To make the story short I missed a very important fight. That night they also showed us how important customer service was to them. They told us that they would send a technician over to our room and he never arrived. The room cleaning was good. The A\/C was cold, worked very well. The other dissappointing thing was that from the time we got there they told us that they had Corona beer, but that they still hadn't distribute them to the bars. We asked all week long and never saw a Corona beer. The Higuero Buffet food is not very appetizing, but I guess it will do since there is nothing else for breakfast and lunch. Let me correct myself, for lunch there is snacks at El Pescador, which isn't very good either. Not all the food was bad though, all the restaurants were great but the best was El Pescador. Make sure you make your reservations for the restaurants for each evening so you can try them all. With the V.I.P. package it includes 1hour per person on the internet, 20 minutes massage per person, and one motorized watersport per person, plus a bottle of rum and 3 cigars. My wife and I definately thought that the massages were worth it. Just remember that when they say international drinks they mean Heineken and Genuine Miller. For the last thing don't go to the disco thinking you can drink whatever because that was one of the only places that we found Corona beer but they wanted 7 dollars a beer. VERY RIDICULOUS Other than that the beaches were very clean . The gardening was very well kept. The shows were ok. Hope this iformation was helpful.
