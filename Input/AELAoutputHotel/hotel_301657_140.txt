{"text":"Consistently Pleases The Park Hotel Tokyo is in the Shiodome area, on the higher floors of an office building and it's very close to other hotels like the functional Villa Fontaine (no room service), the Royal Park and the very upscale Conrad Hotel. Having stayed at the other aforementioned places, for my money, I would choose the Park over the rest (not that I can really afford to stay at the Conrad haha) as it offers the best value for its rates. I have stayed here a few times and on my second visit, they upgraded me to a better room with a fantastic view of Tokyo Tower, not much in the daytime but really gorgeous at night. Now, every time I stay there, they have always given me the upgrade, without my having to ask for it.The rooms are very comfortable and the decor is understated and chic. Bathroom amenities are from a Thai company that makes natural and organic products. If you want to take them home (and they do smell lovely), bigger bottles are for sale at the hotel store, tucked in a small corner off the elevators on the lobby.Don't take the breakfast - at over Y2,000 it's very plain and you can get better pastries and bread at Vie de France and the other coffee shops in the Shiodome train station area.The other great thing about the Park Hotel is that it's connected to the Shiodome and Shimbashi stations via an underground passageway -- terrific to get out of the rain or the cold. It's also connected to the Yurikamome station for shopping forays into Odaiba. And the buildings around the hotel have so many restaurants and coffee shops to choose from. Not to mention convenience stores for last minute emergency supplies.You can also book online and they have a special rate for bookings 30 days in advance that was even cheaper than the corporate rate that I used to get.There are no unpleasant suprises at The Park Hotel Tokyo, just consistently good facilities, service and great value!
