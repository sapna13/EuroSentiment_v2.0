{"text":"Terrible Service! Uncaring and Callous Our family spent three nights at the Hotel Rivoli at the end of out three weeks in Europe. Our journey was intentionally flexible so we would usually book hotels a few days in advance online and live by the Trip Advisor Reviews. Thanks to the great reviews we found some hotels along the way that were real gems! Unfortunately, this was no gem, it could have been very good but contrary to other reviews the service was awful and uncaring. It all started a few seconds after we arrived, the desk manager informed us that we had booked a double room not a triple. I suggested we review the document from Expedia in his hand, at the top read Triple Room. His answer was yes but you selected a double bed. I explained to him that there were only two choices on the online form, twin or double, but no matter I selected and paid the premium for a tripple. He responded that even though I paid for a tripple because I had selected a double-bed I get a double room. This ridiculous exchange went on for fifteen minutes when he finally acknowledged that he was not sure he had a triple and wanted to keep one open for a guest who may stay another day. I finally prevailed. I was hoping that this was an isolated incident and the other staff would be more service oriented. My hopes quickly faded as I interacted with Team Rivoli, I asked for a restaurant recommendation, the reply was an arm pointing to the east stating that there are many good restaurants that direction. I did find that the bartender was kind and helpful, I hope someone reads this review from the hotel and promotes him to manager. Bottom-line, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ trust that you will get what you paid for or that they will honor your online reservation. I see others reviewing this site have been turned away, not a pleasant experience after a day of travel and five blocks from the train station. The location is convenient, the rooms are ok, however the pillows are unimaginably hard and thick, and the bathroom was a contortionist√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ dream - 9 feet long by 3 feet wide. The price was reasonable presuming they give you what you paid for, but there are much better hotel options, regrettably not available for me, if you are traveling in the off season √à√\u2020\u2022?not in August. In summary, this is the most disappointing hotel service experience of my many nights in hotel rooms, a true case study in bad hotel management. If they can get their act together, hire some professionals and show some integrity and caring, they may well find themselves in the top ten of the Trip advisor list.
