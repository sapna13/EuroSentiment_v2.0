{"text":"The Good, the Bad and the Hidden We booked the Sheraton because it was one of the choices for our niece's destination wedding. Good: rooms very clean, good bedding, good service. Bad: lobby was very shabby, perhaps due to the many casino guests who were not staying at the hotel - lobby furniture stained and decidedly long in the tooth. A stark contrast between the rooms and lobby! Hidden: when we received our bill we had added costs for porterage even though it was so busy we had to carry our own luggage up to the room and hotel services even though we didn't use any! There are no refrigerators in the rooms and no business center. When I inquired about these and many other additional fees, I was informed that because we were part of a group, they were added automatically. I found out that the group was the guests who had come for the wedding and received the special rate. If we had NOT registered as wedding guests and simply come at the regular rate or secured an even better rate on a service like Priceline or Hotline, we would have stayed for less money. Meal prices do not make much sense. Breakfast is decidedly more costly than lunch and many dinner items - and there is nowhere that opens before 9 a.m. close by where breakfast may be obtained even though there are other options for lunch and dinner. I would not stay here again without inquiring about ALL fees and getting the rate of what that did or did not include in writing. ","annotations":[]}
