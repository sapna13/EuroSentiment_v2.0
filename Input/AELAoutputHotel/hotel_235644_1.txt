{"text":"REVIEW OF THE CASTLE CLUB AND DISNEYLAND HOTEL After reading quite a few comments both good  bad on tripadvisor about the dineyland hotel i thought i would pen our fabulous experience of not only the hotel but also that of the exclusive castle club , after paying a quite substantial amount for a 3 nidht 4 day break (ouch)!!! , i was a bit concerned especially as i like sunny \/ beach holidays , but i went with the flow and after a bit of persuasion from the wife and our 6 year old i thought sod it , well i'm glad i did from the staff to the resort ,i cannot fault it , i have stayed in quite a few 5 star resorts but for location and elegance it is just fab , food in the inventions restaurant is brillant and the constant characters flowing through the hotel  restaurants for photo ops and signing is endless , when you upgrade to castle club you get your own private castle club lounge which is exclusive to castle club members only it comes with free soft drinks tea coffee , sandwiches and cakes during the day and private buffet breakfast away from the masses in the morning , one of the best bits though is the direct lift staight to the park turnstyles , if during your trip inside the park and the kiddies are getting tired you can pop back to your room at anytime have a break and a cup of tea and then crack on later it is that simple !! no transfer buses just call the lift which is activated by a credit card size keycard and within seconds you are up by your room or your private lounge if like me you could'nt justify the extra amount of √ä√£¬¢500 , i would say save up and go cc its worth every single penny , the look on my little girls face was priceless when mickie  minnie not only came into the restaurant on the first night but even started cutting up her food and fed her she was so excited , i did mention flow of characters the only one she did'nt meet in the castle club lounge was donald duck and by my reckoning that is quite a few characters and all in the peace and tranquility of your own hotel lounge no pushing and shoving she got to spend quality time with each character , i have absolutly no hesitation in recommending this hotel or resort it is first class all the way however it comes at a price but worth every single penny , ","annotations":[{"endOffset":25,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":21},{"endOffset":25,"mention":"CLUB","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":21},{"endOffset":248,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":244},{"endOffset":248,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":244},{"endOffset":248,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":244},{"endOffset":926,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":922},{"endOffset":974,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":971},{"endOffset":981,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":975},{"endOffset":994,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":984},{"endOffset":1004,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":999},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1307,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1304},{"endOffset":1900,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1896},{"endOffset":1900,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1896}]}
