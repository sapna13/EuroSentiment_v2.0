{"text":"Perfect for Paris! I was very excited about staying in this hotel, for starters, it was one of the only ones in our price range without cheap old furniture, two it was being renovated, three the eiffel tower being sooo close!We arrived around 10pm, checkin was quick and easy, however lift is quite small as expected! So one person at a time when up with their luggage. We were in a room known as La Sorbonne. It was a very nice triple room, with a seperate toilet, and two windows. The beds are incredibly comfortable! Considering you will be walking around all day they are the best to just relax in. I've read many reviews about the breakfast not being good. well my family LOVED the breakfast. For 12 Euro, you got croissants, bread, canned fruit, scramble eggs, bacon, pastries etc. 12 Euro sounds like a lot, but on wkends the bakery next door is not open and it's about 2 blocks till you get to a cafe for breakfast and you're looking to pay 8Euro for tea\/coffee, croissant and bread. Where as at the hotel you get a semi cooked breakfast and you can have as much as you like. Maids in the breakfast room dont speak much english but they are very friendly and helpful. As far as food in the area goes, there were VERY few restaurants. Especially family style ones. Sure they had a few restaurants but with interesting menu choices, i know this is france, but you could have some trouble finding food. We found a very nice lebanese restaurant that served mixed grills which were so good and although their menu is not in english the friendly elderly man is more then willing to translate. Unfortunately i can't remember the name of the place but its next to a restaurant called Pizza Tina's. Anothe place we ate at, it was ok. Location wise, its a residential, quiet street, close to the L'open Invalides stop about 3-5min walk. The Eiffel tower is around a 15-20min walk. Front desk staff were very helpful, specially Lucie who organised us euro disney passes, l'open passes, metro advice etc, however always ask to book a taxi in advance, never listen if they say you dont need to book one an hour ahead. As we had a show at 7 and were waiting and waiting for a taxi, as we were told we wouldnt have to wait and there was no need to ring ahead. Insist on ringing ahead!!
