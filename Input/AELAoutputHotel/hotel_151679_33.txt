{"text":"Don't stay here in San Juan - I have another recommendation My wife and I were on our honeymoon for our Puerto Rico trip. We felt we paid too much for what we received. First of all, it seems like Wind Chimes Inn charges about 25% tax when everyone else on the island charges about 9%. We paid over $150 per night with taxes included when we only booked the room for $120 per night - do the math, that is a ton of taxes. We didn't know better though, because it was the first hotel we stayed in. The room was nicely decorated but pretty small - also, we were given a room right beside the lobby and the front door, even though we told the lady at check-in that we were on honeymoon and wanted some peace and quiet. This definitely caused some problems, what with the spring breakers slamming doors and yelling in the lobby til about 3:30 am every night and the hotel not doing anything to calm the freaks down. Nothing is complimentary and you WILL get nickel and dimed more than anywhere else. Also, the hot water seemed to be non-existent half of the time - take a quick shower if you stay here. It is close to the beach and shops and restaurants which is nice. Also - no parking unless you want to pay $10 per day, and it is pretty difficult to find a spot near the Inn. All in all, the Inn is clean and nicely decorated, but we felt it is overpriced and doesn't offer very good service or value. As a recommendation, we stayed at another hotel in San Juan called the Oceana Hostal Playero on the latter part of our trip and enjoyed a much quieter, nicer, and much less expensive stay. Hope this helps! ","annotations":[]}
