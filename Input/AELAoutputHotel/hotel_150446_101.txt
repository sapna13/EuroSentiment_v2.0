{"text":"The Worst Customer Service! We stayed at the Intercontinental for a bachelorette party for the weekend of March 14th. We picked this hotel because of the great reviews. I know everyone√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ experiences are different, so I thought I should share mine. The Intercontinental was overall an okay looking hotel, nothing special. The service on the other hand was terrible. From the moment we got there to check in at the front desk we were given attitude, especially by Barbara (who we always some how had to deal) She seemed bothered by everything and looked at us as if we were asking her for stuff that didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to do with her job!One of the worst things about the hotel, are the elevators. You could hear everyone who were staying at the hotel complain constantly about how long they took! 15-20 minutes to just go up to your room is unacceptable.. and when they finally did arrive, they would be so packed with guests that you had to squeeze in.. People in the elevator always tried to make room because there was an understanding that no one wanted to wait another 20 minutes for the next elevator! Something to note.. Check out is at 12pm.. and although they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ tell you this till after.. they will deactivate your keys at 12pm sharp.. even if you have requested a late check out. So something to be aware of.The Pool area was definitely the highlight of this hotel. There were always chairs available and the pool wait staff was great, thanks especially to Javier  Wilmer!When I go away, even if its for a long weekend.. its because I want to relax and feel calm. Anytime we had to deal with the hotel employees, they were rude, abrupt and unhelpful or just took forever to do anything. I believe they need to be retrained in Customer Service.So.. in my opinion, the Intercontinental Hotel chain tends to mean you are getting a good quality hotel with great service.. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be fooled by the name√à√\u2020\u2022?The San Juan Intercontinental is not like any of the other Intercontinental√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ I have ever stayed at. For the price.. I recommend going somewhere else. ","annotations":[]}
