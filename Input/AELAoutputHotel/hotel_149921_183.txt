{"text":"Old and Tired Hotel My wife and I stayed at this hotel May 18-23, 2007. We are Hilton Diamond Club members so we were supposed to get the best room they had available. Well, that didn't happen. Our room was on the 16th floor, just above the major construction site of the new Hilton casino. We did have a view of the ocean\/bay but we had to go out on the patio to see it.  The rooms were ok and the beds were comfortable. The maid service was good - nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either.  The prices of food and drinks at the hotel are outrageous! We went across the street to a convenience store and bought our drinks and snacks. We ate breakfast in the hotel (it was free) but all other meals were taken in Old San Juan. Puerto Rican food is just terrific. You can only experience the REAL Pureto Rican culture and food if you eat in an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant. The Caribe Hilton restaurants have a lot to offer for those of you who want to throw your money away. However, I highly recommend you venture out to other restaurants for your meals. Finally, I'll say that the grounds\/landscape of the Hilton hotel arealso old and tired. The pools are nice but had STUFF floating in the main pool every night (we have no idea what it was but we have suspicions!) and the beach on the ocean is protected by a sea wall. We couldn't take the constantly screaming kids at the beach or the pool area so our trips to the beach and pool were few and far between - what a waste.  All in all, we did enjoy the city of Old San Juan and a big plus is that the beds in the Caribe Hilton were comfortable. Thats about it.....I don't like to be negative.
