{"text":"Shockingly filthy, Fecal stains-most prostitutes won't go there....except.. I stayed there for a single night of horror. First off, the man with filthy greasy hair a the registration desk -armored with break proof lexan, insisted on running my credit card before I could see the room saying that he was fully booked. A liar. Most of the hotel was empty. But not the two rooms on either side of me. One room next to us smelled like ether from a freebasing Afganistan prostitute (clearly a juvenile no more than 12-3 years old)and her 50 year old scar faced lover\/pimp who came down stairs at the 2am only to eat a stale donut and vomit in the breakfast trash bin in front of other guests. Another regular was a chain smoking bald guy who never changed his adult diapers- fecal smears were left on seats he sat on-Jeans soaked through- he was our other neighbor. I tried in vane to book another hotel but it was after midnight and no one was answering phones. Distressed more than we could stand it, we abandoned this hotel at 3am and took a cab to the airport 13 hours before our flight. While Leaving the hotel a few ladies of the night laughed at us for staying there-and told us even worse experiences- they obviously knew better than to go there. We slept much better on the floor in the airport- but by the time we had arrived at the airport my wife was already showing bites from fleas or bedbugs.The hotel toilets there are ancient with no water flow. The hotel manager unclogs them with his bare hands... I could not believe it...and this guy would be putting out the breakfast..hepatitus would be included with the wifi I suppose. QuentinTarintino could not have depicted worse squalor. The hotel manager was completely indifferent to what was going on.
