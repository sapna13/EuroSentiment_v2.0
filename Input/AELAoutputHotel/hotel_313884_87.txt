{"text":"Didn't Exceed Expectations My husband and I went to the Dominican Republic as part of a larger vacation (we stayed in Florida for a few days prior and a day after our Dominican trip). We chose the Dominican because it was reasonably priced and was easy to travel to from the Florida area. We chose the Princess Punta Cana resort because it was an Adult Only All-Inclusive resort and had favorable reviews on the site.Accommodations: We stayed in a top floor suite and the room was beautiful. The high ceilings and large daybed were nice surprises. Housekeeping was not exceptional; everything seem to be done in stages and began early in the morning so after the first day we did not get new towels and were left without washcloths for the remainder of our stay (the towel person came knocking before we got of bed in the morning so we always had to turn her away). The in-room mini-bar was limited - two bottles of pop, two beers and two bottles of water all restocked daily and one bottle of local whiskey.Amenities: Pool was very nice, kept at a comfortable temperature and the swim up bar is always great. However, there were a limited number of chairs, daybeds, and tiki huts which all filled up by early morning. There was a rule about not saving spaces but who wants to get into a fight with someone over a chair when you are confined to the resort space with them for the next few days? The beachside huts and daybeds, when available, were fantastic. Huts were especially nice when it rained all day √à√\u2020\u2022?allowed us to be outside but kept us dry. And surprisingly all of the nightlife activities were next door at the family resort so this resort was very quiet after dinner.Service: I have to admit that the service was below my expectations. I have previously stayed at all-inclusive resorts (Sandals begin the most recent) and resort staff is generally exceptional. One thing I was not happy with was tipping for everything was expected and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem appreciated. Also, while US $ was the standard in the resort, the resort staff was very limited in their English language skills. I have generally had a feeling of pampering when I stay at all-inclusive resorts and here I felt like I was intruding most of the time.Food  Beverage: Definitely edible, I certainly didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ starve during my stay. The fondue restaurant was fun and it was nice to have options outside of buffets. I was disappointed in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µremium√à√\u2020\u2022?shelf liquor. As a VIP guest we were suppose to have access to the premium liquors however it was difficult to find any. I think they keep any name-brand liquors hidden in cabinets at the bars and you have to ask specifically for them when ordering drinks.Overall, the trip was very nice; the island was gorgeous, the resort was satisfactory and beaches were great.
