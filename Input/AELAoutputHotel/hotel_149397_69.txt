{"text":"Thank you to everyone here for a great stay We just returned from the Bavaro Princess June 17 - 24 2008 and i must say what a great week. I wont drag out this review too much, you can contact me for anything specific you want to know. my advice is to go enjoy your time get to know the staff and animation team their sole job is to help you relax and have fun. participate when they ask you will have fun. Check in was quick and easy.The room was awesome no problemsThe beach was amazing largest of all surrounding resorts .Buffet had plenty of variety for everyone.Bella pasta Italian very goodEl Gaucho Steak not Outback but goodTanuki Japanes Steakhouse was great a definite redo when we go back.A side note about the reservation restaurants..men must wear pants and that includes teenagers, don't be a pain and think you are going to change that rule deal with it, it does not hurt you.Staff was outstanding and i mean everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful. HOLA to all.The Animation Team deserves a special recognition for all their hard work from 9 am to midnight everyday with just one job..to entertain you. they do a great job, get to know these guys their great.Go enjoy yourself and leave all attitudes at home they won't work here and all you miserable people do is annoy everybody else. If you don't have patience stay home this time next year that way i am guaranteed a reservation spot with no problem..A Domincan minute is anything but a minute, so where are you in a hurry to go didn't you get away for a change of pace?I saw people who could adapt and have a great time and I saw people who were miserable with life in general. they will write bad reviews just because the sun came up or the wind blew today. Open your mind to the island lifestyle your on vacation enjoy. People asked us all week how we got waited on so fast over others. this is how I figured it, we saved a bunch of money by going here so with what i would have tipped at restaurants and places on vacation in the states i just gave to the people i thought did a great job there. contact for more info and to all we saw there remember BUBBA SPORT MUGS RULE!!!!
