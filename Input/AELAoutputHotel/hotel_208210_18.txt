{"text":"Vertigo central Stayed at the hotel during November for an event. Staff service was not good. Only the reception staff spoke English well, other staff had considerable trouble understanding basic communication. We had an over priced lunch in the main foyer, costing upwards of 20 EUR for a very small sandwich and had to wait 30 mins to pay as there was no staff to be seen, only after going to reception was someone sent so we could pay. Service generally was slow but they did try hard.Rooms were comfortable but I did have a bed that squeaked every time I took a breath. Bathrooms were nicely fitted out though.The free spa is excellent, with steam rooms, aromatherapy steam sessions, sauna's, hydrotherapy pools etc. This is all free if you are staying at the hotel however, if you do not bring your slippers from the room you have to pay 2 EUR for flip flops and if you want to use the indoor pool its 5 EUR to purchase a swimming cap. Note of caution the spa area is separated male\/female so be aware once you enter with your partner you will not see them again except in the indoor pool area. I met a lady who was with her husband and they had not realized so she was sitting all alone in the hot tub looking a bit lost. Not the romantic spa weekend away that they had planned.They also have a good fitness area, massage and treatments, salon and a range of classes such as dance and yoga for an extra fee.If you suffer from vertigo (afraid of heights) then ask for a lower level room. There are 4 lifts 2 of which are glass and run the full height of the hotel. Rooms open out onto walkways that look down into the main foyer.The Garden restaurant was very nice, not too expensive and the food was great. A good setting for a romantic dinner.They have some original Gaudi chairs in the foyer and the building looks impressive. It's by no means in the center of Barcelona so you will either need a taxi to get in or walk to the nearest tram or metro.
