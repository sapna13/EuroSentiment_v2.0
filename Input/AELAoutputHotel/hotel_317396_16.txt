{"text":"Fabulous Hotel! My stay with my sister at Evergreen was really pleasant, with helpful and polite staff. The hotel, although small was clean and in a superb location, a short walk from Mong Kok, close to department stores and near the MTR. A 7-11 is next door so that was convenient.Although our room was small, it was enough space since it was only two of us. The free internet access and kettle that was provided were useful too. The only downside was the laundry service, which was only open from 4pm-10pm - the times when we were out so we had to come home early a few times to get our laundry done! The bathroom had a nice selection of toiletries and also plenty of towels available.Before arriving, I had read reviews on how the key was too big but it was a standard size and besides you can leave it at the front desk and collect it when you return.The buffet breakfast was ok I guess, but we only went once during our two week stay since we prefered to go out for breakfast instead since food in Hong Kong is not too expensive.Overall, I had a lovely stay in Hong Kong, tired from all the walking I was glad to return to this comfortable hotel after the long day of shopping with friendly staff to greet us. I am normally quite fussy when it comes to cleanliness, and this hotel satisfied my needs. It was a great location and made my stay in Hong Kong so much more enjoyable.
