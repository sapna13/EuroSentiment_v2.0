{"text":"Great furnishings, good size, very comfortable... I just completed a 2 night stay at the Hotel ZaZa in Dallas. I was coming back from Cancun (stayed at the Fiesta American Grand Coral Beach which was great). I was staying 2 nights before flying back home to Buenos Aires.I know Dallas very well as I formally lived in Dallas before moving to South America. Before flying to Cancun, I stayed at the Nylo in Plano which was nice. I posted a review of that stay as well.First of all, the location is really great and it's very close to downtown. Nothing really to do downtown but this area is in a very central location and close to both 75 Highway and also the Tollway so it's easy to get around.The lobby is very nice. I tried booking directly on their website but the reservation section wasn't working so I booked off of Expedia.com. I booked a suite and the rate with tax was about $250 per night.We checked in late afternoon and they had everything ready. It literally took just 3 minutes to swipe my credit card and they gave my keys to the room. I got in and both my fiance and I were really impressed with the rooms. I'm in the real estate and hospitality business so I do a LOT of furnishing of rental properties. I could see they spent some money on the finish out and furniture. The room itself was very spacious with high ceilings. It had a VERY comfortable king size bed and it had a HD LCD 42' inch TV which was very nice. it had a work desk with both wi-fi and cord complimentary Internet but service was very spotty for the 2 nights\/3 days that we were there. It worked but the connection kept cutting off. I was impressed as the desk chair was VERY nice and comfortable. The bathroom was nice as well with marble countertops. Good size.The first night we were on the 2nd floor and the room was VERY noisy with the wind. It was very windy and we couldn't sleep as there was a loud whislting of the wind against the window. We thought maybe it was just this room. In the morning we asked to move to another room because of the noise. They were sold out but they said that at noon they would have another room. I told them we would pack our bags and they could move them. We went out and about doing lots of shopping and met up with a friend and they did indeed change our room and moved our bags. They moved us to the 3rd floor. That night there was still some noise with the wind and the windows but not as bad. I'm not sure if it was just this side of the building but there was lots of wind noise whistling into the room. Really that was the only complaint I had about the room. Keep in mind they do NOT have a parking lot to park your rental car. Dallas is one of those cities with very few taxis so you probably will rent a car. Note that they don't have a lot and only valet. The valet guys were very good. Of course you should tip them each time they bring your car. The hotel also charges you $18 per night for the valet car parking so note this.At the check-out everything was ok but we noted that they had an incorrect $78 for breakfast in the restaurant. We never went to the restaurant and in fact, had room service that same day. We pointed it out and they quickly took it off our bill. I'd suggest you review your bill in detail.Really, I was impressed with the hotel. Great staff and everyone was friendly. The location was very good and central and the size of the room was very nice. Nice LCD TV, nice desk with very upscale and comfortable chair, nice bathrooms and nice furniture. I'd highly recommend the hotel.
