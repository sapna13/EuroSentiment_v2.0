{"text":"Location, Location, Location My wife loves SF, so when her 50th birthday rolled around, that's where she wanted to go. I got a very good deal on Hotwire for two nights. The rooms are standard fare, very clean, large bathroom, firm, queen beds. A closet safe, TV, table and chairs, coffee maker, thick towels, internet access, hair dryer and all the stuff that we have come to expect in most of the better hotels enhances our stay.We're off and running. Two easy blocks, slightly downhill to the Fisherman's Wharf. Strolling, observing, stopping for snacks. I even got pulled into a street performance. They needed a slightly overweight, big guy, to pick up the girl and stand on the performers chest as he laid in broken glass. My daughter was slightly embarrassed by the whole thing but my wife was cracking up. We ate well, spent a little more than normal in the tourist trap, but for the most part it was very good... My wife is partial to fish and crab.. and the wharf is a good place to find itThe next day, after the continental breakfast, (which we all loved and felt was quite complete and generous) we decided to take the bus to the Union Square for shopping. $1.50 a head, with free transfer. We rode thru the Chinese area on the way. Many older ladies got on with their shopping bags and gossiped at breakneck speed. As we passed, I noticed the stores selling food were jammed. I felt transported to a crowded Asia. I quietly commented to my Asian wife that she will look right at home on this bus in a few years chatting with all the old ladies.. That comment was overheard by the lady sitting across from us who laughed out loud upon hearing it. We chatted with her and had some laughs. We had fun shopping in the stores. Macy's has 7 floors on each side of the street, 7 for men, 7 for women. That was pretty cool.. I bought my wife a nice gift.A reasonable $10 fare to take us taxi back to the hotel.. We rested, then strolled some more, all jacketed and ready for the cold San Francisco nights. We slept well that night and came home safely.The hotel served it's purpose more than adequately. The location, the full continental breakfast, and the cleanliness of the room stand out in my mind. The beds were sturdy and comfortable.. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only negative is those damn parking fees in SF, $35 a night plus tax. We could have saved about 7-10 dollars a night by parking off site and walking but it wasn't really worth it to me. But the Hotwire mostly deal offset it..I know now that Holiday Inn Express can deliver comfort and convenience to the traveler and tourist. Without equivocation, I can tell you it's as good or better than the 4 star hotels we've visited.
