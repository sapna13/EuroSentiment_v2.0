{"text":"Good Hotel for Business Downtown, stays at Swedish Hospital I stay at the Silver Cloud Hotel on Broadway 10 times per year or so. It is a good hotel for downtown business in Seattle, as it is fairly close, and not ridiculously overpriced like so many of the downtown hotels are. In addition the rooms are nice, especially for what you pay.The lobby is spacious, and has a nice fireplace that you can sit next to while waiting for friends\/cabs\/coworkers etc. The attached Cayenne Restaurant has competent fare for reasonable prices. The wait staff is rather impersonal though. The free breakfast that is available in the restaurant is self serve and includes cereals, waffles, yogurt, fruits etc. There is not a cook to order breakfast, but the selection is more than adequate for most tastes, and is better than the free breakfasts at most hotels that I stay at. Of course, being in the downtown\/captiol hill area, there are innumerable great restaurants to choose from close to the hotel.The fitness room is nice, although a bit small. That's okay, however, because I have never encountered anyone else in the fitness center. The pool and hot tub are great. They are both indoors in the basement area, although you do have to walk through the parking garage (albeit a short distance) to access both the pool and fitness area.The rooms themselves are spacious, with the exception of a few per floor which are much smaller for some reason. The rooms have all been recently updated with new bedding and flat screen TV's which are very large and nice. There is complimentary wi-fi throughout the hotel. All rooms come with a microwave and refrigerator, although you would have to bring your own food as their pantry type store is very limited in it's content. The parking is located below the hotel for a fee. It is a bit tight, and I have heard several stories of people having problems parking larger vehicles there. All in all, based on what you get for the price, I would say that this hotel is a best kept secret for the area, which should be considered when looking for downtown lodging.
