{"text":"Decent facilities. Atrocious service. The facilities at this hotel are run-of-the-mill, the beach is decent. But, uneventful stays rarely inspire travelers to write reviews...As a frequent traveler, most trips leave memories about the trip - not the hotel. This hotel however, stood out far far above any other I've encountered in recent years.My first night dining with them, the meal was acceptable... we put the bill on our room, and left. About half way across the hotel, the waitress and restaurant manager (not hotel manager) came chasing over, claiming we've put down an invalid room number. When we showed our hotel card key of the same room, they forced us to go to the front desk. Wonderful... a mini detainment session for no crime done. After they chatted with the front desk for 10 minutes, they realized that the front desk did not check us in yet for the day. They looked over, and said Ok, you guys are free to go.Thanks... that's a lovely apology for chasing us yelling from half way across the premise and detaining us.Two nights later, we came back to the hotel very tired from a strenuous day of activities, so we decided on eating at the hotel restaurant again. (I know... why?) The second time, we were one of the first people to arrive for dinner, but waited forever to get our food, getting our food well after numerous people arriving after us. While a long wait in itself isn't terrible... here's another example of the delectable brand of service this hotel offers:The filet mignon was ordered Medium. It came out not medium, not medium well, not even well done. The center was starting to turn *white* from the dryness of overcooking. I'm not an epicture, but the meat had the texture of a well aged 2x4 with the flavoring of a bag of fresh road salt. Maybe an acceptable first try for beef jerky...but that's not what I ordered.Another entree, a pizza, was put on our table for roughly 10 seconds before it was taken to another table, and given to them. Quite a few minutes later, the wait staff realized their mistake... and they had the audacity to pick up the pizza from the other diners and bring it back to our table. Serious? Are there really no health regulations in Florida about re-serving served food? (I guess it was untouched...but would you want to eat something that's sat at another diner's table for several minutes?)To be fair, one of the other diners in our party took this directly to the hotel manager, who came to address several of our grievances. The hotel manager acted very professionally and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. While the other diners in my party seem mostly placated by this, I personally feel a hotel with good management but poor staff is still an awful hotel.Good hotels in this region are easy to find... I regret straying from my usual brand (SPG) to try something new. Don't make the same mistake.
