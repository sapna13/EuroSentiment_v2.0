{"text":"No Air Conditioning at the Clarendon! At that's not all! We stayed at the Clarendon for one night over President's Day weekend. We had planned to stay two nights, but the air conditioning was not working and the room was unbearably hot and miserable, so we left after one night. We received a small discount, but honestly it was not enough to compensate for a truly sleepless night. But there's more. We travel a fair amount, and this hotel is substandard in every way. Please read: When we checked in, we overheard a staff member talking on the phone about how she wasn't sure she could continue working at the Clarendon as she was on probation and it had to be ok'ed-we're assuming by her probation officer. Didn't make us feel real comfortable about handing over our credit card. Our room was very warm and smelled musty when we entered, so we immediately turned on the AC. We left for a couple of hours for dinner, but when we returned it was still very warm. We called the desk, and they said they did not have AC, only a chiller (which was broken, we found out in the morning) and suggested we open the windows and turn on the small fan on our bedside table. We opened the window for awhile, but it was noisy due to traffic and aircraft in the area. We stayed the night, but we were hot and sticky and uncomfortable the whole time. In the morning we went to the front desk and explained that we needed to leave because we were unable to sleep due to the lack of AC. They then admitted the cooler had broken and because it was a holiday weekend, it would be hard and expensive to get someone to fix it. Other things you should know about the Clarendon. It is in an area of Phoenix that should be OK if you stay in a group, but not a place to be alone. The hotel rooms are concrete block with a bad stucco finish and a poor paint job. The bathroom was literally no bigger than 5 by 5 feet, the tub area has had a poor quality refinishing job, and the sink is not in the bathroom. The carpet is really carpet squares, the closet is covered with a curtain rod that was loose and falling off the wall. The curtains are stretched canvas paintings that slide over the windows, however the one in the bedroom was not big enough to cover the entire window so the bedroom had an eery light from the parking lot all night. I accidentally touched the inside of the window when I opened it and my fingers turned black from dirt-they were that dirty on the inside! There is an honors bar area filled with Pringles, MM's and a $25 condom kit. The hotel is marked as nonsmoking, but we noticed cigarette butts on the stairwells. The breakfast consisted of two dirty looking coffee pots with coffee filled with grounds, bagels with nothing but jelly to spread on them, two types of muffins, and a few dried out looking danish. The staff was friendly, but unable to give the simplest of directions, like how to get to the nearby highway. This is truly among the worst places I have ever encountered in my travels. I would recommend it (with hesitation) to the homeless, 20 somethings who truly enjoyed dorm living, and perhaps those who need to make a 12 hour international phone call to a loved one (calls are included in your room). And even then remember that there may not be AC.
