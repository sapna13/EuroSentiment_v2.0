{"text":"Loved the Florence Globus We stayed at the Globus Hotel in Florence for 10 days in September,2008 and found it to be a fabulous choice. first of all , it is well situated, close to the Santa Maria Novella train station and the Sita bus station.It is also within walking distance to the San Lorenzo indoor and outdoor markets,and other major attractions in Florence(such as the Duomo,Uffizi Gallery, Academia,Ponte Vecchio). we intially booked an economy room but asked for an upgrade,mainly because we were staying for 10 days. The owners obliged us and put us into a superior room, which included free laptop\/internet and free minibar. The view from our bedroom window looked out to the Medici Church in the San Loenzo Piazza. The room was always very clean and well appointed in a modern style of furnishings.The Owners (Serena and Michele)and ALL STAFF were friendly and very helpful.We asked a lot of questions about tours,scooters, computers and all questions were answered with enthusiasm.THe breakfasts were always well balanced and included juice,tea,(good quality choices), special coffees from a very nice fellow, dry cereals,fresh and dried fruit, ham, cheese, tomatoes, white and wholewheat bread, white and wholewheat buns and croissants and yogurt.The breakfast room and lobby both have CNN in English,(the rooms also have SKY cable)The lobby is on the 2nd. floor,there is an elevator to the other floors.Our stay will be forever in our memories and will recommend the Globus to our friends. WE rate this hotel 5 out of 5.
