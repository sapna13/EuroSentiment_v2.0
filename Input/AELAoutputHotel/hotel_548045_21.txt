{"text":"great hotel, few flaws the four seasons is everything the other reviewers say and more. a great hotel in a great location with impeccable amenities and lovely facilities. the rooms are beyond reproach in terms of space and taste although if you are used to international luxury this is what many people nowadays expect.in terms of styling it is brilliantly done with a magnificent lobby and the enticing blue bar that has a nice jazz band on thu, fri and sat.two things bothered me:- when asking for a late checkout, i was told they could only do it until one pm when i am used to much lesser hotels offering me at least 2, 3 and even 4 pm without charge. i think they lied when they said they were very busy to do so since they did indicate that i could have a late checkout if i paid the extra charges that i didn't even care to find out how much.- the concierge did not make a good enough effort to arrange for my bags to be picked up and taken to the entrance of the express train checkin counters that are almost next door where i could do some shopping and meet their porter there. this service was provided last time to us by the lesser quality and older JW marriott hong kond and when i said so they said we dont do that. what happened to being resourceful?i think that the hotel is not to be missed and service is always with a smile and brilliantly a hallmark of the four seasons but the two issues above showed me that they sometimes are not willing to go the extra length to truly make you happy.relevant disclosure: we were paying at least 40,000 hong kong dollars per night with five harbor view rooms for almost a week and i just needed the late checkout for two of those rooms.
