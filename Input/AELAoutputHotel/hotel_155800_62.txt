{"text":"Reccomend this Hotel! A group of about 20 of us (ages 20-something to 30-something, couples  singles) just came back from a 5 day 4 night stay (Thurs.-Sun.) at the El San Juan. All really had a great time. We were worried after reading all the reviews...bed bugs, no chairs, unfriendly staff, noise, lousy rooms, lousy showers, blah, blah, blah,... Well, there aren't any bed bugs. There are mosquitos and sand gnats on the island (isn't that a surprise), bring some OFF, you'll be fine. Of coarse there are chairs, there are TWO pools  a Beach (plus hammocks). I really doubt any hotel you go to will have a chair per guest at the hotel, that is an unrealistic request! And again, 20 of us went and somehow each of us had a chair everyday! The staff was as friendly as any other place we have travelled to. I guess it would depend on how friendly you are with them. They gave suggestions on nightlife, restaurants, things to see, things to do, were polite  respectful. My suggestion is don't be demanding and rude and RELAX... your on vacation. I do want to compliment specifically Yvonne Ramos  Miguel at the front desk. They were above  beyond when it came to hospitality and helping our group out. Next time, if you have any issues, I suggest you look for these two employees. Thank-you both! We stayed in the garden-lanai rooms ( had an opportunity to upgrade, decided not to) . The rooms were more than spacious, had our own balcony, walk-in closet, sitting area(for make-up girls) double sinks, king bed  sitting area...oh yes, 2 in our group got hot tubs on their balcony. One room did have a problem with a safe, but we called security ,they came, it was fixed! As far as the noise goes...people go here for a vacation, to enjoy themselves, to relax, to let loose, to laugh out loud and not worry about the real world for awhile. When your going out ,you do want a crowd, whether it's in the lobby, in the casino, in the club, at the pool,or at the restaurants. This actually means the place is worth going to  makes the atmosphere more fun  the time more enjoyable. It was never so crowed you could not get into somewhere or had such a long wait you would want to leave. HINT: No crowd...best bet...not good! If you want no crowd, no wait, someone waiting on you hand  foot, no noise...I suggest you rent a house  a pritvate chef somewhere off the beaten path. I guess to sum it up, I would reccomend this hotel  would myself go back in a heartbeat. A vacation is really what you make of it and the El San Juan is a great backdrop...Nice rooms, beautifuls pools (forgot to mention pool chairs AMAZING!) ( I would though, suggest either a live band or a dj at the pools, the generic recorded music was more annoying than enjoyable) friendly  efficient staff, a very fun atmosphere in lobby, casino, and we all had a really great time at Club Brava. All in all good hotel\/good vacation! P.S. Food is expensive, but your eating in the hotel, it's like that everywhere! It's not an all-inclusive! For breakfast  great cubans try Edith's next door. Lupi's is good for lunch  dinner. There is also Mi Casitas  Metropol, all walking distance. Or hop in a cab to Old San Juan, there you have more than enough options for dining  things to do day or night! Have fun!
