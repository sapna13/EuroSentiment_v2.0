{"text":"Bahia Principe is beautiful But we had some problems!!! My family and I stayed at the Bahia Princupe for one week , July 20th thru 27th. I would like to share my thoughts with other tripadvisor readers as I learned so much from reading other reviews.First of all let me begin by saying it was my first all- inclusive packsge holiday since my honeymoon 22 years ago...having said that I found that the all inclusive thing is a good deal if you are a BIG drinker and love buffets, otherwise I';m not so sure if it's for me.When we arrived at the hotel I was quietly rehearsing my sentence about wanting to be upgraded to the Gold or Diamond in my very basic spanish but when we got to the front desk we found out we had already been upgraded without even having to ask or pay for it !!! We don't know how this happened but we weren't about to ask ! We were put into the Club Premiere, a private area with it's own private pool and restaurant and private lounge...the private lounge here was the very best thing we loved about this place...it was a large, open area with marble floors and rattan furniture and miniature palms, just stunning ! In the morning they had a pastry and coffee bar where you helped yourself to croissants, etc. and Cafe con leche( basically instant cofee and hot milk) ...okay if youre a Second cup or starbucks kind'a guy you will not like this but I loved this kind of coffee or should I say I grew to live it because that's all there was ! In the afternoon it was the same thing with different pastries and also many fine Twinings teas to choose from. There was a bar there as well and internet access. No magazines or newspapers to read...this would be a welcome addition.For me and some of our family we found the food to be a a major disappointment. The buffets were full of variety but I was squeamish to try things I had nevers seen before, i.e. veg. I had never heard of and deef-fried pineapple etc. , at breakfast the north american type foods i.e. bacon and pancakes, french toast did not taste or look like Canadian equivalents...and yes, I know we were not in Canada but they just tasted so different it made me feel uneasy. The doughnuts were made fresh each a.m. and they were delicious as well as all their breads and pastries. Needless to say I ate alot of those things during the week. The a la carte restaurants were fine, the best for us was the french, tender filet mignon and M'aitre D named Josolo was wonderful.Japanese was fun but we found it to be very average food.My kids loved the pasta you could get at all the buffets, they said the french fries and burgers were good too. The beach was absolutely beautiful....always a breeze and never a problem finding 3 or 5 chairs together. I enjoyed seeing women of all shapes and sizes who felt free to wear whatever type of suit they wanted to whether it be a bikini or maillot or topless...I was impressed with their self-confidence as they were not feeling trapped by the media frenzy guidelines that women are so often felt compelled to follow...in other words if you don't have a perfect body...you'll love showing off what you do have !!!To finish off I'll say that his resort is more like a four star( north amer. system) and if you want one week of beach and pools and non-stop drinking then this is the place for you . I enjoyed it and I'm very glad I went but one week was enough for me. Go and try it out you have to judge for yourself ! Staff are very nice !!!
