{"text":"Very good hotel Stayed here recently for one night, weekend break in London to see Billy Elliot - great location as the Victoria Palace theatre is practically next door.The hotel has a very clubby atmosphere, all the staff were very polite and you really felt as though nothing was too much trouble (the room service button on the telephone in your room is called 'whatever, whenever').Loved the special touches, like complimentary supper and a help-yourself-but-put-it-in-the-honesty-book, and the turn-down service was spectacular, as hotels go - candle lit in the bathroom, tv remote and tv guide open on correct night, slippers and robes laid out, soft music switch on. Very nice indeed!If I had to be picky, I could say that the rooms are a little small, and some of the room service items listed as available for 24 hours were not - but I am being picky, and didn't think to even mention it on checkout.If you go for the pre-theatre dinner at the Old Masters restaurant (attached to the hotel) be aware that it's a carvery only affair, and we did feel a little over dressed. I'd have preferred a more intimate, restaurant meal, but in the end again I had no complaint - the roast rib of beef was superb! I would consider staying at this hotel again. It is a fraction out of the way, being up the wrong side of Buckingham Palace, which meant a few walks down the Mall to a more lively environment, but all in all it's a very good hotel, very smart. Staff make you feel special, and not so expensive either. Recommended!
