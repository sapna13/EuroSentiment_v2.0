{"text":"Wonderful !!!!! I decided to verify the quality of the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥ostal Barrera√à√\u2020\u2022? It seemed strange to me that a 2 stars Hostal was the N.1 in the Madrid Best Hotels Trip Advisor list. I did not have at all budget problem, as I was on a business trip, and I am used to sleep 90 \/ 100 days in 4 and 5 stars L hotels around the world and I do so since decades, so I have an idea about Hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ quality.First impression√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂he entrance is quite dark, you have two ramps before reaching the lift, 9 steps in total√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√Øk√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√®t was not so impressive√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∂han√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>The reception staff was perfect, I would like some reception staff belonging to the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºeading Hotels of The World√à√\u2020\u2022?to come here and learn something about how to receive a guest! I felt pampled since the first second till when I checked out.The reception was bright, the yellow colour is the dominant colour in the small lobby and in my room, a single room. A sort of a small nest where you have all what you need. Plasma TV on the wall, safety box!!!, multi jet shower!!! Stereo system in the room!!! Al was modern, functional, nothing was broken or out of order. I was looking for a stain on the lining an hair under the bed, some smell in the bathroom, just a small drop of shampoo on the shower plate. Nothing. Only CSI Miami probably are able to find an evidence of the previous guest. You can eat directly on the bathroom floor. It is one of the cleanest Hotel I have ever seen. Well what I can say. I paid 50 Euro \/ Night. It is an amazing Hotel not Hostal. Sometimes you find horrible 4 stars hotels like in Dubai or Paris, and this is a 2 stars!!! Negative points? Ok√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√ºou do not have a mini bar in the room but cold beverages are available 24h at the reception, this speech is valid also for the hair dryer. A screw of the lid of the wc was not perfectly fixed so when you open the lid it slightly moves. Maybe you need one socket more in the room. Somebody told about noise from the street or other rooms. I have had a perfect sleep. Of course the Madrid Movida goes on all night long! Just use some wax for the ears and it will be all ok. In any case all the windows are double insulated and they are new. This will be definitely my choice in Madrid. It is a perfect Hotel, it was a perfect staying. And you are in the heart of the city and 2 minutes walking from a metro station. The Hostal Barrera is the Hotel N.1 in Madrid. No doubt. And I have compared it with the 5stars Hotel I was used to go since one month ago, during my staying in Madrid. I saved about 250 Euro per night!!!!!!!! during my staying in Hostal Barrera not bad at all I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° say! ","annotations":[]}
