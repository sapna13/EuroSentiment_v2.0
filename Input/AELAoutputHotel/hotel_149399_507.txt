{"text":"Great Week at the Melia Just got back from a the Melia. We stayed Feb3 - Feb. 10 and it was a fantastic time. This was the second time that my wife and I have gone here and it was even better the second time. Please do not worry about the bad reviews. I do not think anything would make them happy. But, do remember you are in a foreign country so the food and customs maybe a little different. I enjoy that.Pool Area.- Best part of the trip. Bring a raft if you like to float in the water and get a tan. It will keep you cooler. The sun is very strong and it does get hot out of the water. Pool is large and you do not have to fight for chairs, unless you get to the pool around 2pm. Bring a insulated mug. The bartenders will fill it up no problem. It was nice getting the 32oz. Beer and not having to go back the bar for another small cup that they give out. Tip the bartenders a few bucks when you first arrive, it will payoff with fast service the rest of the week.Beach Area - Water was great and no real problem with seaweed. They clean it every day. Good water sports for all. Nice breeze all the time to keep you cool.Food- One of the best All-inclusive in the carribbean. The food is aliitle spicy so I will admit it was a good idea to bring the Gas-X. We never got sick just aliitle gas. The American grill was excellent. A surprising good steak and the chicken was very good. Room - Large for just the 2 of us. Maid did a good job of cleaning. Leave her a few dollars at the beginning of the trip and it will play off.Service - Check-in and check-out was Fast. They were great.Oerall - Was a great week!!! This is a great place to go and relex!!! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1089,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1085}]}
