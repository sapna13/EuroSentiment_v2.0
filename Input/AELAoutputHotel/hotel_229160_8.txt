{"text":"The Hotel Schiller grew on me! My husband and I were booked in here for 5 nights recently by his company for his business trip - me just along to visit Amsterdam for the first time. It was a convenient choice for us both.The easiest way to arrive from the airport is to take the train (tickets on sale in the airport luggage hall) and walk onto the platform five minutes away. We were in Central Station in 15 mins. Walk just outside and get on a no 4 or 9 tram (it's the terminus, so no worries about which direction to go!). Ask for the Rembrandtplein (square), about 5 mins away, and the hotel is immediately opposite. So, much cheaper - and quicker - than a taxi or the hotel shuttle bus, for which there were huge queues.The hotel is supposed to be an Amsterdam 'landmark' - over 100 years old. I was initially disappointed; the entrance and lobby are small and dark and looked a little worn. The lift is antiquated.But the staff couldnt have been more helpful. Having read Tripadvisor reviews I had asked for a quiet room at the rear,and this was the best piece of advice I got!! The noise at the front of the hotel must be awful at night and especially at weekends with all the bars and cafes in the square and the clanking trams! Butwe were upgraded to a more spacious business room at the rear which was comfortable and very quiet. The beds were extremely comfortable, bathroom small but perfectly adequate with masses of hot water; nice flatscreen TVBreakfasts in the Cafe Schiller were good - a range of hot and cold dishes, plenty of fruit, choice of lovely breads etc. You could even have sparking champagne if you wanted! And the cafe area was what actually 'grew on me'; it was quite nice to be in an older building with some character and charm instead of the usual modern hotel areas you find everywhere.The best thing was the convenience of being able to walk to every major sight in minutes. Turn left out of the hotel and left again and within two minutes you were on the quietest canals with their wonderful architecture. Two minutes in the other direction and you were in the heart of the city.We ate in some good restaurants - but the best by far was again two minutes away - down the road to the left of the hotel which leads to the canal. On the corner over the first bridge is a tiny Italian place - only about 8 tables - called Ponte Arcelo (or something like that!) run by two Italians. Fantastic food - whatever was fresh that day - you had to pay cash, but it was so cheap and absolutely delicious - a real find.So, overall a good stay - but remember to get that room at the back of the hotel if you plan any sleep at all!
