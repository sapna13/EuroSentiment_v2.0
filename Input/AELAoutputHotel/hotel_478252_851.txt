{"text":"Great 4 a vacation not a wedding! Lets start out with saying the resort itself is beautiful, the servers are attentive and the food is excellent. However the wedding coordinator was not very time oriented. At first I wrote it off as a langauge barrier however; my good friend and father in law (who traveled with us) speak very good fluent spanish and there were still way too many mix ups for me. So.... before we got to the resort I had attempted to get in touch with the wedding coordinator several times (five to be exact ) by phone and email, I did not receive a response until four days before we left. Then when she finally sent me the options on where i could have my reception and the menus, I printed them for my fiance to look at. The next day I receive an email stating that since I did not respond (in that time... one day) she would have to book it where she had availabe. When we got there our room was directly next to my father's..oh soo romantic. So we switched our room. However all of our gifts' from the hotel went to the wrong room day after day! The literature I was sent stated the would press the bride and grooms attire, did not happen! There was no rehersal just a quick do this do that... with a little map. They gave me a choice of songs to walk down the asile, they played the wrong song! So once we got there it was a little choatic. We arrived at the reception where our dinner was supposed to be a the hostess kept informing us that we wer not on the list...the cake served at the reception was only vanilla, when I ordered half vanilla and half chocolate. Okay fine so I drank a few more cocktails and then I was over it. Until I go to pick up my pictures and they were not ready and when we returned the said they lost them. We eventually got the pictures but the dvd we ordered was not finished.. big surprise! So we were leaving at 6 am the following morning the said it would be done at 9 pm that evening. By 11 pm we finally received our $220 dvd that has to be reformatted on a different disc to play in a standard dvd player (it will play on a computer if you own a cd rom). And the icing on the cake... it says JOHN AND MARY! which of course is NOT our names. So I suggest you go on vacation there after you have the wedding somewhere else.
