{"text":"A Gem of Florence We booked a reservation at the Hotel Globus through its web-site based of the good reviews that we read on tripadvisor. Though, we are fully aware that european hotels are less in quality compared with the ones in Asia or US. This is true, therefore we are not expecting much on it.During the time to confirm our reservation, we have been offered with various rate for double standard or double executive room. Thank you to Michelle who is one of the owner of this hotel. He gave us a good deal of Euro 90 for double executive room (incl. buffet breakfast and taxes). We stayed there for 3 nights late December 2003.To us the hotel is most likely a 2 stars with a 4 stars bathroom facility. Our room is spacious with internet access, cozy modern-minimalis design and clean. The one which decreased the value of this hotel is that the lobby is up a flight of stairs. Guests must climb with luggage. when we arrived we were greeted by the front staff who helped us to bring our luggages up to the lobby.We left our luggages at the front desk since the room reserved for us was still occupied. When we came back in the afternoon, our luggages had been brought in the room at 2nd floor. The bar and breakfast place looked like a snack vendor and the only staff is very practical. Breakfast was fine european standard with fresh fruit, however we could ask for a cup of capucinno or even a glass of hot chocolate.This hotel is recommended for budget travelers who do not mind to carry on your own luggages to the room and during check out. We do not mind it either. The location is best, near the train station (5 minutes walk) and many budget eating houses nearby. Mercato St. Lorenzo is just steps from the hotel. The window of our room is facing the back of Medici Chapel, a warm scene in the morning of winter season.We will absolutely stay there again if we get back to Florence one day.xxx ","annotations":[]}
