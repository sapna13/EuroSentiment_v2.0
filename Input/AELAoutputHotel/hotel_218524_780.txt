{"text":"Not close to what we expected! Wow, where do I start. I went for a week with my boyfriend to celebrate my 30th birthday. Drive from the airport to the hotel took approximately 50 minutes and was not a smooth ride. They drive very fast too! If you get motion sickness this will not be for you. Staff at hotel were friendly, Room was nice except it always felt damp even with the air condition on, and food was just ok. French restaurant was by far the best. Did not like the Italian and received the wrong order. Room Service was alright, they forgot something from our order 2 out of 4 times we ordered. The grounds were well kept and the pools were very nice. The beach does not have White sand and the ocean is very rough. You will not be able to kayake at this resort or snorkle. They told us they would have to take us to another resort if we wanted to kayake. You can use a boogie board for up to an hour and then it will cost you $10 each additional hour. They do not have surfboards to rent. It took a long time for staff to serve you drinks on the beach even when you tip. The drinks are really weak but do taste good. Mosquitos are really bad and they will bite you even if you put repellant on. Not very pleaseant! We went on the Jeep Excursion which was a entire day excursion. We were very upset because we told the host whom you book your excursions with at the hotel, that we wanted the Jeep to ourselves  no other passengers. He told us that we would have to pay an additional person in order for us to have the jeep to ourselves. He spoke English very well and understood us. Well, once we had taken a 60 min drive to where the excursion started they told us we would have to share the Jeep with another couple. The Host lied to us to make more money. After reviewing our receipt of payment more closely we relized that the host only charged us for 2 people instead of 3. So, at that point we had no choice and we had to share the jeep with another couple that did not speak English that well. My boyfriend only was able to drive the Jeep for about 45min the entire trip. The only positive thing that we got out of this excursion was that we really were able to see the culture of this country and the beautiful trees,plants,  mountains. You will visit a sugar cane field, tobacco museum, school, ranch, home of a domincan family,  beach. At the ranch they will provide you with lunch, which I was unable to eat. (dry meat, rice\/beans, fruit  bread) Flies were landing all over the food. Not much of a lunch so you should pack a lunch if you decide to do this excursion. After lunch you can choose to take a 30 min horse back ride or just wait where you eat lunch. We decided to wait since we did the horseback ride at our resort the day before. The wait was a good 1 hour 45 min because they did not have enough horses to take everyone at the same time. The beach was nothing special. Vendors selling items on the beach and water was not very clear. Needless to say we were glad we got to see the culture, although it did not need to be an entire day excursion. We were going to book another excusion, but after finding out that all the excursions are an hour drive from the hotel on terrible roads we decided not to. The host talked us out of the swimming with the dolphins excursion because he told us that one of the dolphins had bitten one of the guests. Who really knows if that was true after all he lied to us about getting a Jeep to ourselves. He was not very friendly after we told him we were upset about not having our own Jeep and at that point he stated he must have misunderstood us. To sum it all up, We will not be back to this resort nor Punta Cana. It was not at all what we expected.
