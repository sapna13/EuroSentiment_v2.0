{"text":"Nice hotel in great location The Fajardo Inn is a great place. I would definitely recommend it and would go there again.The pool is terrific. Apparently the pool hours used to be short but they are now 8am to 8pm. There is free WiFi near the hotel lobby, which is especially welcome because of telephone connection charges in the rooms and the cost of using the business center√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ computers. Bring your own laptop and enjoy all the Internet you want. The rooms don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have clocks√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√Øo bring a travel alarm clock.People complain that the hotel is hard to find. One reason is that the location on the directions map of the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ own website is wrong. This is the web address of a map that shows the correct location of the hotel: http:\/\/www.travelmaps.com\/fajardo.html When you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e driving to the hotel on Carr 195\/Calle Principal, look on the left for a government-style road sign that simply says √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢otel√à√\u2020\u2022?with an arrow to the left. Turn left after that sign and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l see the Fajardo Inn at the top of the hill. But there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ no sign that directs you to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Æajardo Inn√à√\u2020\u2022?anywhere, and no sign I could see that identifies the street as Parcelas Beltran.Incidentally, if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e driving to the hotel from the airport in San Juan, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend that from Carr 26 you take Carr 66 (instead of Carr 3 the whole way) until Carr 66 dead-ends. Then you turn right on Carr 3 and follow the rest of the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ directions. Carr 66 is a toll road which costs $1.50, but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ worth it.About restaurants√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√±he hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ restaurants are good, but assuming you want to try some others, let me recommend: The best seafood we found was at La Parrilla, which is Kiosk #2 in the long line of restaurants and bars in front of Luquillo Beach. All seafood restaurants, this one included, cost about what you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° pay in the continental U.S., so they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not cheap at all. Rosa√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ seafood is quite good and is much closer to the hotel (take the last right turn before the ferry port and go to the end of the street). Anchors Inn, which is on the way to the El Conquistador, costs slightly more and just wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ as good. Pasion por el Fogon, near Anchors Inn, is very expensive. There is an excellent Cuban restaurant called Metropol located in the shopping center with the movie theater at the intersection where you turn from Carr 3 to Carr 194 on the way to the hotel. This is a copy of the highly-regarded Metropol located in Isla Verde.Finally, the Golden Bagel restaurant, which is on Carr 195\/Calle Principal just a few blocks before the hotel, is a great place. It has both traditional Puerto Rican and more continental U.S.-style breakfast and lunch entrees. The espresso is excellent, it has a range of bakery items, and believe it or not, the bagels are quite good. Free WiFi as well. We went back several times.
