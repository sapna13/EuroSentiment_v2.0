{"text":"Superb, but expensive, experience The Clift is a five-star experience in every respect. As a frequent patron before the remodel, it is a shock to see the French decor give way to the new minimalist look. The rooms are pretty white with the two walls covered with mirrors to make the smallish room seem much larger. Fine quality bedding makes for a luxurious nights sleep. In keeping with an eco-friendly environment, it is a little dim in the entry way and no light in the closet.The staff was friendly and helpful, at the front desk, concierge and the front door staff. The rain interrupted the smooth flow of traffic, and we had 20 minute waits both to drop off our car and to retreive it. Everyone was working hard and helpful, but the infrequent rains in San Frnacisco seemed to overwhelm them.The main dining room was fabulous. The unusual blend of Asian and Cuban cuisine was delicious and presented boldly with lots and lots of food. Our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful -- especially about not ordering too much as the portions were huge. The scallops were perfect; our calamari salad was delicious, and we split a main course of steak that was so tender it could be cut with a fork. There was a mix-up on our dinner reservation, but they promptly took responsibility and we were seated within 5 minutes on a busy Saturday night. Everyone was quite pleasant and helpful.Overall, it was an outstanding experience. Close to Union Square and shopping. I missed the old French decor, but in with the new was not much of a disappointment.
