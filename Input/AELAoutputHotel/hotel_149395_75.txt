{"text":"B+ Value for the money, we would visti again We would return to Paradisus as the good outweighs the bad and, as returning guests, the knowledge gained from a prior visit would make for a more enjoyable return stay.The Beach -- Soft white sand, very wide, gentle surf, absolutely world class. Plenty of chairs as well as abundant shelter from the sun available. [A+]Water Sports -- Sailing, kayaking, scuba. One free scuba dive per day, resort supplies all equipment. Divemasters were great. [B+]Food -- Breakfast and lunch buffets were always very good. Lots of fresh fruit and many, varied choices of food. Dinner selections varied from inedible (no exaggeration) to very good in the same restaurant on the same night. This is where experience comes in; at Albufera order the tenderloin not the sirloin. Fuego was the standout with excellent food and outstanding service. Bottled water and other drinks always readily available. [Breakfast = A, Lunch = B, Dinner = ya never know could be an A could be an F]Staff -- generally helpful, but not overly so. Overall a B- to C+. In the restaurants if the manager was friendly\/guest-oriented so was the staff. If the manager was surly (and some were), well...Rooms -- not bad but not great. Everything worked, quiet, comfortable beds, but showing some wear and tear. Not likely you will spend much time there, however. [B-]Fitness Center -- small, but top of the line LifeFitness equipment. [B+]Transportation -- resort is large and shuttles were readily available to get you around. [B+]Casino -- small and pretty laid back. [B]Security -- use the safe in your room or, better yet, the safe deposit boxes in the lobby. The resort may have a theft problem as cash appears to have gone missing on several ocassions from several of the rooms occupied by our group. [D-]Punta Cana Airport -- Updated, nice and efficient. One of the easier ins\/outs we've had in the caribbean. [A]Overall value for the money is a B+. Consistent and better dinner would make a huge difference as would updated rooms. The resort does not knock your sox off like The Ritz -- Cancun, for example, but the cost is also in a different stratosphere. Paradisus is very comparable to Moon Palace -- Cancun or Swept Away -- Negril, Jamaica.So, again, we'd go back for the killer beach and now that we know what restaurants and foods to avoid. Next time would probably try staying on The Reserve side of the resort to see if it's worth the extra $$$s.
