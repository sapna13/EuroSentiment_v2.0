{"text":"1950 was a good year for the hotel.... We stayed at the HIlton Caribe over Christmas\/Hanukkah 2008. Almost every person that we spoke to prior to our trip had told us that they had stayed at the hotel 20-30 years ago and loved it. We were eager to experience a great time.No doubt the hotel was first rate in the 1950's and 1960's--but nostalgia can only go so far. In many ways, the hotel reminded us of the glory days of the Catskill resorts in New York (The Concord and Grossingers).For a resort, the service was inconsistent at best and surly at worst. The food was very expensive (but not unlike other overpriced resorts.) The special lounge for VIP\/HIlton Honors guests featured an evening cocktail hour (cash bar) and free snacks consisting of just cookies. They could have given more, don't you think?The inflatable iceberg in the water broke on day two of our trip and did not re-appear. The lox ran out each morning on the breakfast buffet. The free daily newspaper was a photocopy of the online NY Times and even that ran out. (couldn't they just make more copies?). Inflatable rafts and water toys were available for rent at $20 for a day--not even close to reasonable.One concierge insisted that our GPS from New York would not work in Puerto Rico (it did). The movie shown nightly broke one evening and popcorn was only served at the early movie. It was a nice touch that was missing at the later show (9:00 PM)To be fair, the hotel is not all bad. The hotel is well located to the center of town and the housekeeping staff were very nice. To regain first clas status, the hote needs some updating and staff training. While some of the staff understand guest relations, most did not, and when a hotel is tired and worn the staff can make it better by being customer focused.
