{"text":"Ill be back to the Lenox! Myself and my good lady had the pleasure of spending New Years Eve ( or First Night as the Bostonians call it ) at the wonderfully located Lenox Hotel. The Hotel is located in the slick back bay area of Boston - 2 minutes from Newbury street ( where all the designer shops are ) and a ten minute walk from Boston Common. The splendid service starts at the front door when the helpful and always cheery doormen greet you and direct you to reception. Check in was swift and professional and in literally 7 mins we were comfortably housed in our tenth floor room. Our room was small but we really did leave the booking late and were simply happy that they could accomadate us at all. Saying that the room was great - Very much along the lines of a standard Four Seasons room - it was warm ( essential in Boston during their present winter ), had a well stocked bathroom ( with nice Aveda products ), the bed was very large - all in all it is defintely one of the better rooms I have stayed in. One minor odd issue was that there was a 2 inch gap under the door leading out to the hall - we simply put a bed throw at the foot of the door and this sorted the problem. I suppose its just an odd querk in such an old building. BTW - the building itself is very old but the hotel marrys this with some clever modern and cool additions ( lovely cozy cocktail bar and seperate restaurant for example ). We had breakfast in the Azure restaurant on new years days and again recieved first class and warm service. Nothing was a problem. The waiters seemed to be young but were not lacking in all the skills to make the client feel welcome. For the record - I had the continental breakfast - priced at $13 - I had lots to eat and it was all very fresh and filling. But if the weather allowed I would venture out for breakfast to the many diners\/ restaurants within short walking distance. 15 mins walk away is the paramount cafe in Beacon Hill. The best blueberry pancakes I have ever had!I would recommend this Hotel to anyone looking for comfort ( and in fairness luxury ) at quite reasonable rates. Our rate of $225 for new years eve was more than acceptable to me.As the governator says ill be back!!
