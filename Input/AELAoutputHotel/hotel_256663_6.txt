{"text":"Supreme value for money We stayed here in November and booked five nights for a mere √ä√£¬¢50 per room per night. We were quite lucky in that we got a corner room which is slightly bigger than the rest on the 13th floor. The room was perfectly clean and had most ameninties you would expect and some you may not including a microwave! The staff are friendly and attentive and check in and out is straightforward. The bar or restaraunt was not open whilst we stayed, but if you are unable to find a favourable place to eat or drink in Sydney - something is wrong.Realistically it is a 30 minute walk to Circulay Quay, but this is Sydney - there is plenty going on to keep you occupied. Not sure why you need to catch or a bus or the light rail as Museum Station is just a few minutes walk away. A return loop on the City line (which will get you to Circulay Quay and back costs less than $4. The journey takes no more than 5 minutes and the stations and trains are clean and safe. Chinatown and Oxford Street are both within walking distance if you do'nt fancy the walk to the Rocks or Circular Quay and Darling Harbour will probably take you 15 minutes.In summary, you will not find a better value room in Sydney (believe me I tried) than at this Hotel. The snobs among you will want to stay in The Marriot or some other establishment you can name drop, but this is likely to increase your room rate to √ä√£¬¢150 per night. ","annotations":[]}
