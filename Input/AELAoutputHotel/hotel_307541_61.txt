{"text":"Rooms let it down, but lovely overall We had a lovely two weeks in Bali and stayed at the Hyatt. We wanted a relaxing escape for two weeks and that's what we got. When I arrived after over 20 hours travelling I was a bit disappointed. They left us hanging around a bit to be shown to our rooms. And the room was dated - terracotta tiles which reminded me of a spanish apartment and dated furniture. The bathroom was particularly outdated. BUT we ended up having a great time in the Bali Hyatt.The pools are lovely and the sunbeds, towels etc are very nice. The staff were good and unlike some Asian hotels I've stayed in didn't seem to expect tips all the time. There is a service charge on everything anyway.The food was great and while more expensive than outside the hotel, it was pretty good value. They make their own bread in the hotel and it was great. Really enjoyed the lunches there but opted to go elsewhere in the evenings.The gardens are great. Staff were very attentive to our room. The sheets were crisp and clean, the bed was huge and comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. There was a great selection of TV channels too.We did have a cockroach problem in the bathroom (they were small cockroaches thankfully) and the hotel dealt quickly with this.In my view the rooms are 3 star, the complex is 4 star, the food and service close to 5 star. So overall it gets away with its four star rating.It's best point is its location. Lots of bars and restaurants around. and we didn't want to be stuck in a hotel for two weeks. If you're looking for a very luxurious hotel, this mightn't be for you, but its a good standard and very pleasant place to stay in ","annotations":[{"endOffset":828,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":823}]}
