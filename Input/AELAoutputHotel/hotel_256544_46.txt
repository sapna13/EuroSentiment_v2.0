{"text":"The Worst Four Seasons Gloabaly After staying at many of the properties in this chain I was incrediblly dissapointed at my experience here. Like one of the May reviews I found the hotel understaffed, not well informed of their own city and at best tired. I had booked a car to pick me up on arrival, it did not show up despite several e mails with the concierge, who seemed completely unable to book a car service. At check in they lost my luggage and despite an early check in my room was not ready until 2 pm. When I was sent to the assigned room, it was the wrong room and belonged to someone else with my same last name and was a smoking room. After going back to the front desk and wasting even more time, I was finally assigned the proper room..now 3:00 pm. The concierge who screwed up the car service made reservations at a hip, australian restaurant with great wine list per my request. Unfortunately, it was an Asian restaurant full of screaming children, bad food and loud music, excactly what I had not requested. The room I was given was on the executive floor with a club. However, they failed tto tell me that just because i was on that floor did not mean I could use the club. I showed for breakfast and was literally run out as I did not belong.I spend about 40 room nights at 4 Seasons annaually and have never seen such a poorly managed hotel. Do not stay here if you are a Four Seasons veteran or you will be dissapointed.
