{"text":"5-star service and architecture, 3-star room The Biltmore is stunning in its architecture and grounds and a fantastic place to plop down in Phoenix during the spring. If you're a fan of mid-century modern, you'll love exploring. Be sure to peek into the conference room spaces, some with soaring gold peaked ceilings - truly unique in design. I encountered true 5-star service from all staff during my stay, including a charming houseman who greeted me in English and then, when I asked for directions to the spa, provided me precise information - in Spanish! Because of his friendly body language and gestures, I was able to infer where to go and when I confirmed it with him (Oh, across the pool...I see!) he smiled and said Yes sir! This kind of interaction is sooooo much better than the typical eyes-down, mumbling no englais response one might receive at other properties.As others have noted, the Biltmore is a bit pretentious when it comes to pricing. Even in the gift shop, a 12-oz. can of soda fetches $2.50 - God knows what it is from the minibar. The Biltmore's biggest opportunity for improvement is in the room itself. Once inside it's as if you're suddenly transported to a typical Marriott in a city center location. Large armoires hold a smallish 20-inch tube TV; if they'd banish the armoire and install a proper 42 flat screen, they'd gain substantial psychological space in the rooms. The rooms aren't tiny, but they're below 21st century standards for space. Bathrooms are somewhat cramped, but at least the tub\/shower combo is a roomy six-plus-footer so even men can lie fully in the water if they choose. Rainshower heads help when taking a shower. Only a single sink but a wide vanity and an extra full-length shelf above help store toiletries over a multi-night stay. Closets are ample and lighted by opening the door automatically. Beds are new Serta mattresses in the same quality range as the Westin Heavenly Bed, and they include a substantial down topper (removable if too hot during the summer). However, the Biltmore ruins the effect by using cheap 60\/40 blend sheets instead of the all-cotton sheets virtually every 5-star property uses these days.Furniture in the rooms is somewhat dated, with a craftsman style but worn and de-laminating tops on many surfaces. Decor is very desert-style but lacks color - too much beige\/brown\/terra cotta, not any bold color to break up the palette, even in the artwork or accent pillows. Despite the build date of 1929 (or perhaps BECAUSE of it), the room was quiet - and I was in the main building above the lobby. If in the main building, third floor, odd numbers will provide a reasonable view.In-room dining also falls far below a 5-star standard. No roll-in cart here - it's delivered on an uninspired tray with the single indulgence being a fresh-cut whole flower and long stem adorning the side. I ordered a pizza; it came in a delivery cardboard box. 5-star properties that get this right deliver on a silver platter with cover. For its central location and local history, the Biltmore is a hotel you should stay in at least once. You'll have to decide after that if it's worth returning.
