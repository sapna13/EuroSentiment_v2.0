{"text":"Can't beat location and price It's taken me some time to write this review, so forgive me. My husband and I stayed here in October 2006.PROS:LOCATION and PRICE. Can't be beat. You walk out your door and you are in the Plaza Mayor. Taxis are always available right outside of the hotel if needed, but you are centrally located to most everything.CONS:Tiny, tiny room. Could barely fit me, my husband (who is rather tall) and our luggage. The shower stall was pretty claustrophobia-inducing... kind of tight in there when trying to wash my hair, etc. Also, the hallway was really, really dark which we found kind of bizarre at first. I think it's on a sensor but it would take a little time to go on. A bit scary when first exiting the elevator. Lastly, we almost did not get to see the flamenco show that we wanted and it was the last night of our trip. The receptionist assured us that they made us a reservation, but when we got to the venue, we were not on the list. Luckily, there was one slot available as long as we weren't going to eat dinner. We weren't so we got lucky, but that was a bit disappointing. Oh, and though I am a New Yorker, I would have to say that Madrid never sleeps! The party went on all night long and so it was rather loud. The voices seemed to reverberate through the square. Bring earplugs if you get bothered by that.Overall, I would recommend this hotel because of its great location\/price. Just don't plan on spending too much time in the room.
