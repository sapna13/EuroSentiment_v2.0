{"text":"Hotel Alamanni Best Of Expected After have made my reservation I've read all bad reviews in this site and I feelt scared to stay in this hotel, but my reservation was prepaid and even if i want to i could not make any changes so I went there, SURPRISE!!!!Now I wondering if all reviews have been in this hotel or they have just making mistake with some other hotel in town.First the hotel is located on the second floor but this is well advertise on web site, second if you follow instructions or if do best to call the hotel and ask what the best way to go there they will give you all best directions to go there, just OPEN YOUR EYES.Room was nicely decorated, very clean, and smelling good parfumed, bathroom was gorgeous to be only 3stars hotel, made with marble with everything you need especially a very good water pression and lots of hot water, sorry but this in not less important than many other things, because in many hotels also 4 stars the water pression is terrible and hot water is never enough to making a good shower.Also the rooms futured a fully refurbished minibar, pay per view with flat screen tv colour, NO BEG BUGS, I've been searching for but I couldn't find it, no noise in the night I could sleep like if you would be in the middle of the forest, they change towels every 2 days but your advice so you get for what you pay, not even some 4 stars hotel change linen and towels every day, I don't thing is the most important matter.Breakfast was ordinary nothing special, but certanley with little of everything, only negative point they don't have fresh fruits which I believe in the morning is healty eating fruits, however they serve cereals, yogurt, sweets, cold cuts, cheese and butter, juices and delicious coffee, well it was good but I would prefer espresso but they don't have espresso machine but only american coffee machine.The staff was very polite, and professional, also for this point I would say, is only 3 stars hotel on the second floor with only 18 rooms what will you expect to find the receptionist dressed like at the grand hotel??, staff are casual dressed but they do the job very well.I will certanly return to this hotel, is very convenience close to everything and in some periods of the year the room rates is very affordable to be in florence (very expensive city).
