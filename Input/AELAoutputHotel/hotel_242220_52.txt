{"text":"It was a good hotel. We stayed at this Hotel for six nights, I was a little apprehensive at first after I had read some of the reviews here. I can happily say that our stay was wonderful. We showed up and it is true that you will not be allowed to check in prior to three pm, so we checked our luggage in and headed out to town, there is a public transportation stop across the street that for .75 cents will take you to San Juan, so we took advantage of this and went to see the town. We came back around 6pm and we checked into our room, we were in a corner room on the 7th floor. Room was clean, it looked as if it was recently painted, sheets were clean and the bed was restfull enough to get a good night sleep. Hair dryer and Iron all worked well. This is a no frills hotel, the location is excellent and as long as you are realistic in your expectations you will enjoy your stay. We had no problems with the hot water as I read here someone did. This is not the hilton or the sheraton, for the price of 80 dllrs a night you get the basic comforts of a room to rest your head after a day out on the town. Oh and the poolside kitchen was great! 5 dollars for a plate filled with food. We plan to go again and next time take the kids, we will be booking our stay here again! ","annotations":[]}
