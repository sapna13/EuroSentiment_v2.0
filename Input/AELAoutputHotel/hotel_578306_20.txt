{"text":"Is it possible to be too boutique? I had a great stay a the El Gaucho. Before I get to what I consider to be down-sides, I'll give you the high notes. The bed was wonderful, probably best I've ever slept in, certainly better than any chain hotel, Kimpton properties and the Westin\/W included. The towels and bathrobe were very soft (although the towel didn't absorb water as well as I expected it would). The high definition television with loads of hi-def and premium channels was a nice perk. In general, you can tell the hotel put a lot of considerations into the furniture in the room. There is also free wireless. There was a great shower head in the shower. Lastly, the hotel has arranged for free use of the Seattle Athletic Club (although this is not very close to the hotel). The wine glasses and water glasses (with corkscrew) was a nice touch.On the downside: I'd consider the bathroom average. Nothing was wrong with it, but it came across as an afterthought compared to the rest of the room. The ironing board was miniature - I had to sit down to iron my shirt. For the price of a nights stay, I would expect a full-size ironing board. Lastly, while the staff was very professional and personable, they were apparently stretched thin. I called the front desk three times in ten minutes to set up a wakeup call and got the hotel voice mail every time. I ended up leaving a voice mail but never got the wakeup call I requested. There's also a long flight of stairs to the hotel lobby. I guess there's supposed to be a bellman to carry up luggage, but that didn't happen when I arrived.I guess the bottom ine is that while this is an excellent boutique property, it is small to the point of not being able to cater to the guests as much as a larger luxury\/ boutique hotel. With only 18 rooms, the staff will call you by name and establish a rapport with you, but they may not be able to pick up the phone when you call.
