{"text":"Fantastic time at Casa Camper My husband and I have just returned from our first trip to Barcelona where we celebrated our anniversary at the wonderful Casa Camper. Nothing was too much trouble for the friendly staff and we simply had to write a review of the hotel as it really made our trip special. From the moment we arrived we were made to feel tremendously welcome and relaxed. We stayed in a suite on the 5th floor which was very spacious and hip. The bed was large and very comfy and the lighting set the perfect ambience. The room encompassed a large living area with plasma screen TV etc and a very relaxing hammock and french doors from which you could step out and look down on the street below. The bathroom was also nicely sized with generous products to use and a fantastic power shower (and bath) - just what was needed after a day sightseeing in barcelona. We loved the unique design of the hotel from the lobby area through to the gorgeous roof terrace from which we enjoyed many a drink in the early evenings before going out for late dinner. The other remarkable thing about Casa Camper is the free food served 24 hours a day in the cafeteria. You can literally help yourself anytime to a selection of sandwiches, salads, cakes, pastries, yoghurts, crisps and a wide range of juices and soft drinks. All of this is included in yoru room rate and was a welcome addition to our stay.The location is also brilliant - on a small side street off Las Ramblas. The museum of contemporary art is at the end of the street and there are numerous lovely restaurants\/cafes\/bars nearby such as 'Es' meditaerranean restaurant and 'El Lobo' tapas restaurant - both very enjoyable and off the main tourist strip of Las Ramblas. We had a fantastic trip and cant reccommend this hotel highly enough!
