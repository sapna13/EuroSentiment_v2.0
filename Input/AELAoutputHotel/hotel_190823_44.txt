{"text":"Quality and Location! We have just returned from a 5 night stay in Barcelona at Hotel Colon and were originally drawn to consider this hotel from the reccommendation of an acquaintence who had stayed there. I followed this up by researching on Trip Advisor before booking and although most of the reviews rated it quite highly there were a few that made us a little apprehensive. Be sure not to confuse a review with the 2 Star 'Regencia' Colon Hotel which is located behind Hotel Colon itself!Comments about the excellent location of Hotel Colon are absolutely right! So perfect for exploring in every direction and in comparison to a lot of other hotels fronting noisy streets this position opposite the cathedral in a busy but relaxing square was ideal for a city location.Our room was superb - we were very fortunate to be upgraded to a large superior room in a corner position with two small balcony terraces and a jacuzzi in the bathroom. The room was clean and the air conditioning was efficient. Daily cleaning and topping up of complimentary supplies could not be faulted. Even our room service order for morning coffee arrived right on time.The hotel staff were very pleasant and professional and the porters were charming. They were more than happy to store our bags for a few hours on the day of departure and called a taxi when we were ready to go to the airport. A receipt was presented for us to use on collection of our luggage. All very efficient.One or two have commented about slow service at the outside cafe area. We expected this from reading the reviews and although we used this area 3-4 times, we did not find the wait intolerably long. A little consideration should be applied - when you are working in the heat a more measured pace is required. By contrast, if the waiting staff had been running back and forth in a scurry, the experience of relaxing in the shade at the edge of the square could well be spoiled. Even the padded cushions on the chairs added to the comfort. If there is any negative comment here, it is likely to be that some of the prices are a little expensive.Overall we would highly reccommend Hotel Colon and as a post script must say - we were a little reluctant paying so much for a hotel without a swimming pool, but in our case, the in-room jacuzzi was a better choice. After spending so many hours walking who knows how many miles each day, a few minutes in the jacuzzi was greatly appreciated and truly rejuvenating before going out for the evening, whereas a 'swim in the pool' may well have shortened the day!
