{"text":"Brillant find in Paris-loved it! This was our 4th trip to Paris and we had always stayed on the Left Bank on previous trips. We thought we would like a change of scene and also the hotel in which we previously stayed had very small double rooms and our girls are now an age at which its nice to give them there privacy and the family room days are now gone!We booked our trip through a web site and got a rate which included breakfast. When checking in at the desk I enquired if the rooms (2 superior) were overlooking the garden as we had requested. We knew there was no guarantee on this but as soon as we mentioned we would prefer it the very helpful receptionist had it sorted out for us. One had already been a garden view and she changed ours no problem!On arrival into our rooms the four of us were delighted with the cleaniness,size of rooms-especially ours, as it was the same size as the quadruple we had in our previous hotel. It was really a special touch to have tea and coffee making facilities as Paris hotels dont usually have this little touch.The supermarket-Campion chain was very handy just across the road with a huge selection.We were concerned about the area being quieter but it was great to come back to after racing around Paris all day. It was very easy to find as we used the Air France bus from CDG which dropped us off a 5 minute walk away. We used the Ternes metro stop 5-10 minute walk to get around Paris.All in all we can highly recommend this great hotel, they were just one day away from completion of the renovation work and we will no doubt return to stay here again in the future.
