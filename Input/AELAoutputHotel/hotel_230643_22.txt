{"text":"Lovely Hotel in a great location My girlfriend and I stayed in The Universal for three nights in the middle of August. On arriving to the hotel we noticed that the area that it is situated in looks a small bit dodgey but we soon got over that. The staff at check in were extremely friendly and helpful. No problems there.The rooms themselves were spacious enough and extremely clean with the added bonus of a comfortable bed! The only thing was that we stayed at the back end of the hotel which meant the view wasn't much to write home about, looking out at the back of the flats across the way!The hotel also has a small pool (more like an over sized bath),a solarium and a basic gym. We did'nt get the chance to use any of these amenities. On the first night it rained very heavily which forced us to stay at the hotel bar since we were dressed for the sun, this suited us because we were quite tired. The only thing we found about this was that the bar service was quite slow and infrequent.The girl kept walking away from the bar leaving people with empty glasses, this happened on a few occasions during the two hours that we stayed there. Then as soon as the clock struck 12pm the bar was closed straight away without announcing last call as if it were going to turn into a pumpkin or something!The hotels location was excellent, literally only a five minute walk from Las Ramblas. I would recommend doing the hop on hop off bus tour as we found it the best way to get around. I would also recommend going to Sitches, a small village with a beautiful beach situated just 40 minutes by train outside of Barcelona.Overall our stay in The Barcelona Universal Hotel was an extremely pleasent one!
