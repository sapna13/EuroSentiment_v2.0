{"text":"Would definitely stay again I booked this room through Lastminute, and was rather surprised to find the rate that was quoted.I didn't have a credit card with me, and foolishly didn't arrange to have a pre-auth sent through. No real problem - the Duty Manager could see I was unlikely to be much of a problem guest so a cash advance against room service was ok. More on that later.My room at it's bargain rate turned out to be on the top floor and was not one of the recently renovated ones. This was ok with me, the room had everything I needed and more despite being a little bit on the dated side. The bathroom looked to have been fairly recently upgraded.The bathroom contained a bit of a surprise to me, the wealth of toiletries which are supplied. Way above the usual and very very nice quality (the hotel sells them too, which I didn't take advantage of as I was travelling hand baggage only so couldn't have taken them home again). There was a little sponge, a comb, a hairbrush, a shaving kit and a toothbrushing kit as well as the usual shampoo, shower gel, soaps and body lotion. All in little wrappers! The comb was confiscated on the way back through Schipol (maybe they were scared I'd take it out of the wrapper and start demanding to comb the pilot's hair).One down side was some dust - possibly due to renovations however it did make me think that the rooms don't get used enough or are not being worked on enough by the staff. There was dust on the coffee sachets - this being said, the cleaning staff were very much in evidence so maybe just one of those things. I was given extra coffee sachets cheerfully on request by the maid.Everything otherwise was fine, though I did in the end use the minibar (I wouldn't have without having given a deposit). Possibly the most expensive thing going, 12√à√\u2020√ü?for a diet coke, small can of Pringles and a Snickers. 12√à√\u2020√ü?!Checking out, the balance was returned without any worries and the City Tax was simply deducted.Next time I might even not worry about upgrading to a better room. There were electronically remote controlled sunscreens outside the window, a little book of stories as light reading and even a packed of Smints!
