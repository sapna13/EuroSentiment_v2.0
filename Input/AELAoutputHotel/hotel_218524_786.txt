{"text":"Relaxing vacation We stayed at the Excellence resort in Punta Cana 11\/3 - 11\/10. It was very relaxing, except for the frustrations at the pool.Check-in: Smooth. Bags quickly taken to our room. Anniversary banner on our door (thanks!)Room: Building 14. Quiet\/clean\/leak started from the ceiling and was never fixed by Saturday afternoon. 2 calls to front desk. Maintenance came and went without a word. Never returned. No apology when we left.Food: Pretty good. Lots of choices. Went to every restaurant. Breakfast was very good and there will not be a need to go to lunch (unless it's raining :). Favorite: Breakfast Least favorite: Lobster house (bugs and chewy lobster)Grounds: Beautiful. Service: Excellent. We brought, and gave $150 in tips. It didn't make any difference in the service provided, but probably mattered to the receipent.Pool: Beautiful. Please be a courtese guest. DON'T take the floats in the morning. SHARE. It will work for everyone if you do. Too, please only take one chair per person. (We saw a couple with 4 chairs by the pool. . .shade versus sun. . .rather than just pulling the chairs into the sun, with 2 floats hidden under their towels. . . .that is a total of 10 towels on their 4 chairs. . .). Really. Is that necessary? It was so frustrating to the rest of us. Recommendation to the resort: print ON THE FLOATS, please leave the me in the water! I'm for all the guests.Country: Covered with litter! Bugs: Too many to count. I had 20 bites on one foot and that was with bug spray on. . . . they were absolutely terrible.
