{"text":"Great Hotel For The Price We booked an Apple vacation at the Caribe Club Princess during the week of October 22-29, 2007. We had great weather for six of the seven days, then the storm came in. It did rain a few nights, but that is to be expected for the area and time of year. It was our first time in Punta Cana and after reading some of the reviews, I was hoping I didn't make a mistake booking that hotel. Well, I didn't!! It was a great vacation. The staff was friendly and helpful, the room clean everyday. We ate at the buffet for two dinners and always found something good to eat. The restaurants were also very good, but you have to make reservations early. We had dinner at the restaurants on five nights and found the Chinese our favorite. I don't understand how some of the previous writers could complain about the food unless they are extremely picky. There was always something good to pick from whether you like fancy or the plainer fare. Some people will complain no matter what. The beach was the best beach ever, even nicer than Cancun, although the water in Cancun is a little prettier. The water was warm and clean. There are no shells, stones, etc. on the beach which made long walks enjoyable. We had no trouble finding chairs or huts to sit under during our stay. By all means, if you are looking for a great vacation without going into debt for it, go to this hotel and use a few dollars that you saved on tips for the staff. They deserve it. We would definately go back to the Caribe Club Princess and recommend it to others.Joanne and Ed from New Jersey ","annotations":[{"endOffset":72,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":68},{"endOffset":1515,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1511},{"endOffset":1515,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1511}]}
