{"text":"What I've come to expect in Amsterdam... Just back from 5 nights in the Dam staying at the Prins Hendrik. Having been to Amsterdam a few times before I wasn't expecting much from the hotel, which is just as well. When we arrived we were told our room wasn't actually in the hotel but in the apartments just across the way. I didn't really have a problem with this until I saw the stairs! An extremely narrow and steep spiral staircase which was as difficult to get up as it was back down again. I managed to cut my hand on the rail on first attempt. It is also wooden with no carpet and very noisey when people are going up and down.The room was dark and gloomy with very low ceilings, the decor was very dated and cheap looking. The double bed was actually two narrow single beds pushed together. One sheet and a very light blanket was all that covered each bed - you didn't even get to share a duvet. I was quite annoyed about this as we had arrived on valentine's day and it wasn't exactly romantic! The bathroom was adequate with a decent sized bath and ok shower. The rooms do get cleaned daily and although there were stains etc on the carpet and everything was tatty, it did seem clean.Breakfast was ok for us; a couple of options on cold meat and cheese, scrambled and boiled eggs, beans, cereal, breads and fruit. The staff are a bit hit and miss. We asked if we could leave our bags on the day we were departing the night before and told there was nowhere to put them but on the day a friendlier chap showed us a space under the stair where other people had also left their luggage.On the up side, the location is great, central for everything. The pea soup ordered from the bar was fab and the bar itself was friendly, busy and with a good atmosphere. Paying a √ä√£¬¢120 a night I would really look hard and fast for a better hotel for my money next time.
