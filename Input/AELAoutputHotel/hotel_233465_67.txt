{"text":"Excellent choice for hotel in Paris Brought my family of 4 here in mid-May for 4 nights. I only booked 1 room, and as I know now, one typical Parisian hotel room is not enough for 4 people. We took a second room, but it was only available for the first night. By morning, Moun had found us 2 adjoining rooms in an alternate hotel just down the street called the Hotel Opera Maintenon. This was classified as a 2 star, but the rooms were clean and comfortable and even a little more spacious than the Louvre Sainte Anne. The only reason it was a 2 and not 3 star is that: 1) You must climb one flight of stairs to get to the elevator, as it only travels between the 1st floor and higher (it does not go to the ground level); and 2) It does not have air conditioning. This is not a problem in Paris in May, so we did not mind that at all. We through the windows wide open and enjoyed the cool Spring air. On the plus side, 2 rooms at the Hotel Opera Maintenon were only slightly more costly than 1 room at the Louvre Sainte Anne.It's true what is being said of the service at the Louvre Sainte Anne. Moun and Edita helped to make our first trip to Paris a tremendous success.BTW, I could not find the Hotel Opera Maintenon listed in TripAdvisor or I would post my comments there as well...
