{"text":"Better than I expected, but possibly overpriced I was asked to work in Singapore for 3 months for work at very short notice, so booked the Rendezvous for my first week as it was convenient for both the office and nightlife. I chose my flight specifically as it arrived around 2.30pm so that I would not have any delays checking in. Within 5 mins of getting out of the taxi I had checked in on the executive floor, been given a brief overview of the facilities, and arrived at my room where the porter was waiting with my bag.The room had plenty of storage (I had clothes for a 3 month trip), an average sized, clean bathroom as well as a proper desk. There was also an armchair to sit at while snacking on the complimentary fruit basket.As a business traveller I was pleased to note that the desk had plenty of power sockets and all were multi region, so I could plug my US laptop in without having to use an adaptor. The internet access was charged at $0.85 a minute, or a maximum charge of $25 for 24 hours.Annoyingly the TV remote control could not be used to turn the TV on or off, and the picture broke up on certain channels, but that was only a minor issue.I didn't have occaision to use any of the hotel's other facilities, such as the pool or restaurants, so cannot advise on those.My only other previous experience of Singapore was a 2 night stopover nearly 2 years ago to the day. I stayed at 5* hotel just off Orchard Road for about two thirds of the cost of the Rendezvous, so it would seem that the hotel rates have gone up a lot in recent years.I would stay here again if I found a better rate than the approx 90GBP I paid.
