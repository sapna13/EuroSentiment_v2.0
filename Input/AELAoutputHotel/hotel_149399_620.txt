{"text":"Mixed Feelings... Arrived at Melia Caribe in mid July, we were a large group so checking-in was a challenge. We were originally placed in 3 different buildings but were eventually put together after about an hour of negotiations. People at the counter were somewhat friendly but we did have to ask for cold beers. Being a huge resort, commuting was done by either walking under the scorching heat or trains. Trains were usually on time but we found walking after dinners a must for carb.\/fat burning. At times, flagging down the Royal Service carts with a couple of dollars in hand will get you anywhere in a hurry. Rooms were nice and spacious; the cleaning ladies were friendly and courteous with extra towels and water. Leaving a $2-$3\/day tip goes a long long way. The pools were great with swim-up bars and friendly bartenders. Getting pool towels however was a huge challenge, they usually run out EVERYDAY at around 3-4pm and you are stuck with used towels for the day. During the day, checking every 30 mins to 2 hrs for clean towels was a norm. The beach was nice but not as good as the Caribbean Sea beaches as it is on the Atlantic Ocean side. The banana boat ride was excellent for $10\/person. Parasailing, underwater-personalized mini submarines and speed boating were available but none of us tried any. There were 8 A-La-Carte restaurants, each a different style of cuisine. Making reservations was also a challenge, but we found success by calling RIGHT AT 3:30pm on the same day rather than 7:00am with a hangover. With a large group, we managed to find a reliable and resourceful person at the front desk and had that person booking 4 of the 7 dinners for us. A good tip made that happen and it was well worth it. Overall, the people were not as friendly and helpful as we thought (except if you are ready to hand out tips regularly). Many all-inclusive regulars in our group suggested that Mexico and Cuba were better in that area. As for excursions, the full day Saona Island tour was the worst. 2 hours each way by tour bus and with boat rides to the island and back to port, we were left with less than 2.5 hours of actual beach time on the island. The BBQ lunch was however great. The half-day Marinarium snorkeling excursion was the best, very friendly people and the atmosphere was great. Swimming with Stingrays and a 6-ft. nurse shark was very exciting. We also did the sunset horseback-riding excursion, not as romantic as suggested since our horses were mostly apart and I did not see my wife until the end. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ worth the money if both of you are good riders and can actually control the horses to stay together. As for shopping, bargaining is an absolute must. We found that the strike price was usually about 1\/3 of the original asking price. As for calling home, a phone card will save you money but we did have some problems with the ones offered by Verizon. A couple of them became invalid even before the expiry date. I also managed to golf 2x at The Cocotal Golf Resort. It's free as suggested in our package but renting a cart was mandatory at $35 USD per round. Course condition was above average but it was a VERY flat course. Not much tree, water or bunker trouble. I definitely would not suggest paying $65 USD for renting clubs to play there. To conclude, a nice looking and clean resort. Be ready to tip regularly to overcome their shortfalls. Ask many questions about your excursions and bargain hard when you shop. Have fun and like the locals says, There's always no problems here and if there is one, it's for tomorrow .....
