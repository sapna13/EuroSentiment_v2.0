{"text":"An Amsterdam Gem When some think of Amsterdam their first thought might be their favorite restaurant, coffee bar, museum or district. When I think of Amsterdam my first thought is the Seven Bridges Hotel. Without question this special place made my trip. It is located in a quite street just outside of the heart and soul of the city. Everything is within walking distance and for those longer treks the tram (which is so easy to use) is one block away. There are more than enough fine dinning restaurants and other famous Amsterdam establishments just a stones throw away. The hotel itself offers many wonderful characteristics. First, the hosts Pierre and Gunter, will make sure your stay is comfortable and to your satisfaction. Each morning breakfast is delivered to your room at your desired time. The breakfast was always fresh, warm, and plentiful. You have your choice of rooms at the Seven Bridges. We had room four and eight. Both rooms were above our expectations in comfort, d√ã√\u2022√ñcor, and ambiance. I would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting an authentic and memorable place to stay. The stairs are steep but most people would find this aspect of the hotel to be unique. The stairs were not a problem for us and we had to haul two 50lb bags up the stairs for our business meeting. This was my second trip to Amsterdam and by far the best. I felt as though I could not ask for anything more out of a hotel and its hosts. The Seven Bridges is they only place I will ever stay in Amsterdam and I am already planning a return trip soon.
