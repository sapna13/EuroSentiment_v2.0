{"text":"This place is a joke,,, The price of the rooms and suite is perfect.. cheap price..quailty mmmm... not goodI booked a standard room but got upgraded to the presdential suite...The suite is huge but a joke... Big living room but no tv lol... dont understand that really...the sleeping area is so so... the fake wooden floor is a joke.. it was half broken and when you walked on it.. it made squeeking sounds.. the toilet was huge but strange..you had a toilet room but no washing basin for after using the toilet.. you had to go in the next room which there was a huge room with just one basin for washing hands and thats all.. very strange design..the suite was very dark.. not much lights.. the service was a joke, there was a dvd\/cd player.. quite confusing to use so called the tech guys and they send 2 normal tech guys and they had no idea how to use it so send the head guy in the tech department and had no idead how to use it... this took 30 minutes after that they ask the manager to come up and see if he knows how to use it.. in 5 minutes he came up spend about 15 minutes.. he still didnt know how to use it.. so he came up with a real good reason and i was pissed but kep my calm .. guess what he said.. He said mmm we dont know how to use this thing but it dosent matter because you got upgraded so you were suppose not to have this equipment so deal with it.. well good luck to people who actually book this suite and ask them to come up and help...guess the manager have to think of another reason to tell the guest..
