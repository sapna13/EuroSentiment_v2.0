{"text":"Loved the Relais Bosquet!!! My husband and I stayed at the Relais-Bosquet for 7 nights in January of this year. I was a little hesitant about booking a regular double room (as opposed to a superior double) because we'd never been to Europe before and had heard nothing but horror stories about the small rooms. I needn't have worried! The room, while cozy, was plenty large enough for the two of us and our two big suitcases (+ carry on backpack and shoulder bag). We didn't feel like we were stepping all over each other, or our luggage.The room had an armoire where we could hang some of our clothes, iron and ironing board, those wonderful electric darkness blinds, and a very functional bathroom with hairdryer and nice toiletries. Oh, and there was also a safe and mini-fridge. You could buy items from the mini-bar, but it also came in handy for us to store our own sodas\/water. Just walk a few steps to the right of the hotel's front door, to the grocery store there, and buy Coke or Evian for something like 2.50-3.00 Euros for a 6 pack of either.The front desk staff was always warm and helpful, and housekeeping was excellent. I do recommend that you tip the housekeeper each day - it's apparently the norm in Europe, and you'll get much better service if you do it each day instead of waiting until the end of your stay. I generally left 2-3 Euros a night, and in return, got extra toiletries and towels, a spotlessly clean room, AND I wasn't charged for the 2 drinks we actually did take from the mini-bar before realizing we could just walk to the grocery store.We really enjoyed using the free internet on the computer in the breakfast room. I was able to check in with friends and family, and also get info about some of the tourist sites we wanted to visit later in our trip.The carpet and furniture in the lobby and in the halls is slightly worn, but we didn't mind at all. For the price and location, this hotel is a GEM.As for location, you couldn't ask for better. We spent some time in the Latin Quarter at night, and it was bustling and noisy even late at night. We really loved coming home to our little section of Paris, where it was peaceful and not as crowded. At the same time, it was soooo easy to get from our location in the 7th to anywhere else in Paris. For one, Paris is incredibly walk-able. Second, the Ecole Militaire metro stop is an easy 3 minutes or so away. I was a bit intimidated to try using the metro on our first day, but it really was easy, and we ended up using it multiple times a day, zipping all over Paris with ease. Finally, the location can't be beat for restaurants. The 7th is full of lovely little bistros that are moderately priced (23-30 Euros per person for a delicious multi-course prix fixe meal). In short, the Relais Bosquet is fabulous, and I'm fairly certain that if you choose you stay there, you will love it as much as we did!
