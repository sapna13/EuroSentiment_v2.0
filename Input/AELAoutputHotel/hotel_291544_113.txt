{"text":"Wonderful service on the top floors We spent a weekend at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe in February 2006 - and we'd only wish we could have stayed for longer...My fianc√ã√\u2022√ñ used HHonors bonus points for the stay. We arrived from Gare du Nord with a taxi outside the hotel - and before I'd even stepped out of the car, our luggage was brought inside. We walked up to the reception, and when my fianc√ã√\u2022√ñ brought out the Diamond VIP card, as the reservation was on this card, we were simply given a key card and asked to use the elevator up to the 6th floor. On the 6th floor we were greeted by an extremely serviceminded personell, and taken into an office where they processed our reservation. Unfortunately, the room was not ready (it was about 2 pm) - but I think this is because the reservation was originally for a standard room, but they upgraded us because of the Diamond VIP (funny thing the computersystem hadn't registered that, but oh well). We were given the option of going for a walk, and they would call us when the room was ready, or we could simply hang out in the lounge - which we ended up doing. We watched sports on the giant flat screen, had snacks and drinks - all for free. The lounge is open all day, and all who stay on the 5th and 6th floor are told to think of it as their livingroom. Great livingroom with access to champagne, beer, cappuccino and fruit (and what not!) all day long!!The room was wonderful - the largest bed I have ever slept in. The bathroom wasn't brand new, but still very luxurious and spacious. An hour after we got our room a bell boy stopped by and rang our door bell (yes, an actual door bell... no knocking!) - and gave us a platter of sweets and a dessert wine. All in all, the service could not have been better.There's a spa at the hotel, that we were planning on using before our departure on Sunday - however, the only day during the week that the spa is closed happened to be on Sundays... That was a disappoinment, as I only learnt this Saturday night...and we had to make new plans for Sunday (and travel days are always so stressful anyway...).As for location it is not shmack in the middle of things, and there are few restaurants and bars immediately around the hotel. However, it is only a 10 minute walk to Champs-Elys√ã√\u2022√ñes, where you obviously can find whatever suits you.All in all, a great luxury hotel - however - I have no idea what it is like in the rest of the hotel, as you live a very secluded life on the 5th and 6th floor.
