{"text":"Way better then I would of ever thought I stayed at the Prince hotel Main Tower from April 3rd through april 10th. The room I stayed in was a updated room and it was amazing. Of course in Japan it was smaller then normal rooms but the way its set up makes it seem bigger. I would recommend getting a room on a higher floor because those are the more updated rooms. I also got the breakfest add on to the room each day. I tried almost all the choices that they had available. The one I would recommend most is the buffet in the main tower next to lobby forgot what its called. The hotel has so much you can do. I didnt get to do all of it but I did go bowling and after getting in for the night I did some kareoke. Bowling was fun I went during the evening when all the business people were there and they are fun to watch. Kareoke is HUGE in Japan and the hotel had its own. You pay for the time you want and get your own room that fits like 10 people. Me and a friend got a room for about two hours and you can stop a song if you get bored and pick a new one and they can also bring you drinks. The staff is so nice they also said hi when you walk by and if you need help with something and even though they try to understand you they go out of there way to find someone or walk you to where you need to go. Also like everyone else said very convinent to the JR station. ","annotations":[]}
