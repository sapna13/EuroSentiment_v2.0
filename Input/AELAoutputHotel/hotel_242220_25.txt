{"text":"Damn Decent For The Money After agonizing over where to stay while in Puerto Rico for a long weekend, we decided that it would be best to economize and appreciate the local culture at a non chain hotel. (Tip: This is a pretty lengthy review, so grab a drink.) The Diamond Palace Hotel  Casino was actually better than some of the reviews place it at, but I make that statement conditionally. First, know your threshold. If you're paying $89.00 a night for a hotel, how high are your expectations? Second, are you going to enjoy the island, or are you going to live in the hotel? Third, everyone has an opinion and is entitled to it, you do not necessarily have to agree. That said... The room was quite clean, the first thing I checked for was evidence of bed bugs. (I've become conditioned to checking for that first after all of my travels.) I searched for evidence of fleas and roaches as mentioned by others. Nothing.  Next, I moved onto the amenities. The TV was as standard as standard gets. It took us 2 days to get a remote for it though. Not a problem for me, however my travel companion, she needed to have one. (Again, what is your threshold?) The balcony was my sanctuary thought the duration of the trip. (How much time do you want to spend in a room with your ex girlfriend?) Once I got the sliding doors un-stuck, it was awesome. We had a decent albeit obstructed view of Condado beach. (Tip: if you're on the front side of the building and have low tolerance of noise, get a higher floor, as the hotel is on the main strip of town on the way to San Juan, there's also a jumping late night diner attached to the hotel on the first floor.) All of the standard hotel gimme's were there. Blow drier, iron, board etc... The bathroom was clean, however the water never really got cold. (Trust me, depending on the time of year you're down there, you'll be looking forward to a cold shower or at the least a drink. Same goes for the water fountains.) The air conditioning was amazing at night, however it's not powerful enough for the tropical humidity during the day.  The hotel itself has a bar on the first floor where a Continental Breakfast was served daily. We never ate it as I discovered my home away from home just a half block up the street, Starbucks. The casino is as standard as most Caribbean casino's get. With a handful of table games and nickel slots, it'll keep you busy for a mindless hour if that's your thing. Friday through Sunday nights they had live music @ the bar. Speaking of the bar, drinks are quite expensive. Think NYC club prices. Do yourself a favor and bring your own alcohol to the hotel and stick it in the room fridge. Unless you buy it from a major store and you're not a local you will pay A LOT. (Tip: they don't have Guinness anywhere on that island, I was warned ahead of time and smuggled in a case.) The convenience factor was quite significant. It is just a bit over 2 miles to San Juan from the hotel. Cabs to the center from there are about $12.00, cheaper if there's more people in the cab with you. The 21 bus will take you to town for .50. (Tip: Have quarters.) The Wallgreens across the street is open 24 hours, and it's easily one of the largest ones I've seen anywhere outside of NY. (Tip: They close the side entrance after 9:00pm) The beach is a short walk down the block, and it while it's not a glamorous hot spot, it's delightfully reclusive and you have the full run of the Atlantic. There are places to shop, and a few places to eat around the hotel. Check out the Buenas Ares Argentinian restaurant. If you're a wine snob, avoid the Portobello restaurant on the top floor of the hotel. Actually, avoid it all together. It's a decent Italian restaurant, but WAY over priced, and the wine, while the selection is deep, it's awful. Overall, 3 stars. 4 if you don't set your expectations to Marriot level. (Which is right up the street at double the price.) 2, if you're looking for a great hotel without spending any money. It is definitely my first choice to stay at again when I go back in March if I stay in the same area. The proximity to Starbucks alone is worth putting up with not having a remote.
