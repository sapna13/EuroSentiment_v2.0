{"text":"LOVE THE LOCATION SHERATON AMSTERDAM AIRPORT HOTEL is the only Hotel located inside the Airport in Amsterdam. It takes hardly 2 minutes from the Arrival lounge to reach the Hotel lobby. You dont need to go out of the airport so even if its raining or snowing , you can reach the hotel safely and without spending any taxi money.Hotel is very reasonably priced at around Euro 150-200 , which is nothing by Amsterdam standards. You can get cheaper budget hotels in the city but after spending approx Euro 100 for the return Taxi fare , it works out to be cheaper than those budget hotels. You can also find some cheaper hotels around Airport but even those are not of Five star standard like Sheraton and you need to take shuttle bus to reach those hotels. Bus is free but runs at every 30 minutes interval. Very inconvenient specially if its raining and sometimes buses not come on time.Service and ambiance of the hotel is excellent. All the staff members are very courteous. For dining , Hotel restaurants are expensive but you dont need to worry about that. As you can just come out of the Hotel to reach Airport complex which is full of Expensive to budget Restaurants and fast food like Burger King , Delifrance , etc. Also many bars , supermarket and shopping. To go to the city centre , you can take a train which runs at regular intervals of 10-15 minutes and costs approx 3-4 euros.On top of everything you can get starpoints on your SPG card for which you can become a free member if you are not already.These points can be redeemed for your future stays in any starwood hotel. If you are a Platinum member of Starwood , Hotel will upgrade you to a Club floor room with club lounge facilities which has Complimentary snacks and drinks from morning till evening and also premium alcholic drinks in the evening. They might even upgrade you if you are only a Gold member. Only thing is that you need to request them if they can and mostly they will. As in my case , i am only a gold member and mostly I have been upgraded. It will depend upon the availablity and a bit of your luck. So overall it was a wonderfull experience for me with club lounge facilities as I was able to relax in the lounge with complimentary Black Label and snacks. Complimentary Internet is also available in the lounge.You can reach Gold level in Starwood by staying 10 nights in a year at any Starwood hotels like Sheraton , Le Meridian , etc.You can have more information at WWW.STARWOODHOTELS.COMORWWW.SPG.COMI have stayed at this hotel about 5-6 times now and all the time my overall enjoyment of the stay exceeded previous stay.I travel alot for my business and stay overnight in Hotels around the world approx 70 nights every year and Sheraton Amsterdam Airport Hotel is one of my favourite hotels I have ever stayed in my life due to its perfect location and value for money.
