{"text":"Surpassed all expectations! I have to start by saying that the negative comments about this resort must have gone to a different resort than the Sirenis Tropical! Especially regarding unhelpful and rude staff, for me and my boyfriend the staff are one of the best assets for this complex, they can't be faulted. The only problems we experienced were fellow holiday makers being incredibly rude, inpatient and ignorant towards staff. Being polite and having a smile on your face goes a long way here, You are on holiday after all!From the moment we arrived until the moment we checked out we had an amazing experinece and can honestly say it was the best holiday we have ever been on.The grounds are extremely well kept by tremendously hard working staff. The rooms are a good size, clean and tidy. The food is out of this world (unless you only want pie and chips every night), couldn'tfault it, excellent choice and quality in the buffett and the bookable restaurants are fabulous too (especially the Chinese). All of the bars and Casino are well stocked and staffed. Entertainment is varied and enjoyable for all ages. Pools are clean, beach is gorgeous, you feel very safe in the resort with security staff present but by no means intrusive, you are free to walk up and down the beach as far as the eye can see. Would also recommend going snorkelling in the sea, amazing. All in all, we woulddefinately go back to the Sirenis Tropical Resort and would advise fellow travellers not to be put off by the negative reviews on this site (I'm glad we weren't!).
