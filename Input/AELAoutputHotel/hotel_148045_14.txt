{"text":"Save your money.... I read the reviews on Tripadvisor prior to coming on our trip. The reviews are really all over the board and I truly think it depends on your expectation level of a 5 star resort\/vacation. We were part of a large group of realtors and spouses on a business retreat. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate as there was rain almost the entire week, with a threat of Hurricane Omar (that luckily missed the island). When you have the extra time on your hand, you tend to notice some of the imperfections (and there are many).The hotel overall is in serious need of maintenance. How they can maintain their 5 star rating is curious and almost laughable. With the current condition of the resort, this should receive 3 stars. The windows leaked throughout the resort and in the rooms. The staff had yellow pool towels rolled up at the base of every window, everywhere. Rugs were soggy... The pools are in need of refurbishing. It looks like my child did the grout work around the pool. The grounds are nice, but lacked maintenance. There is chipped paint, marks of the walls throughout the hallways, and generally feels like half of the staff did not show up to complete the level of work needed to maintain this caliber of hotel. With the anticipated storm, all but 2 of the restaurants closed (they have 21 I think) for two days. The food is expensive, so bring your wallet. Drinks too, and not just alcoholic. An Arizona Ice Tea ($1.00 a can in the States) is $5.75, a coke is $3.75 and the Fuji bottled water in the room is $7.00. We enjoyed a fabulous dinner one night at Stingrays, but it set us back $144.The rooms are a nice size with an incredible view of the ocean and pools. Our room looked like it had been recently renovated (very modern, sleek), however, the bathroom looked original (to what year, I'm not sure!). The grout was dirty and stained, and again was sloppy. There was peeling paint on the celing of our bathroom. The water was luke warm at best on some days. We were lucky enough to finally receive a wash cloth on the last 2 days of our 6 day stay. I'm not sure housekeeping spent more than a minute or so in our room cleaning it.The entrance as you come into the resort has large tiles. Obviously, the constant rain made it difficult to keep this area dry. But the tiles are dangerously slick. Someone in our group fell and injured her finger. Why anyone would think it is a good idea to put slick tile in a main entry way that is susceptible to rain, I don't know. We did not play the slot machines or even enter the casino. They did close the casinos down in anticipation of the storm. The area looked nice.The staff was extremely pleasant and helpful. I did not see any presence of management throughout our stay. Overall, it seemed like the hotel was generally understaffed.I am hopeful that by sharing our experience will help you make a decision about this resort. Again, I will say, had the weather been beautiful the whole week, our group would not have noticed all of the little details, I'm sure. But this resort has been seriously neglected and hopefully the next group managing it (we learned it is in the process of being sold) will but some serious money and efforts into refurbishing the resort. The potential is certainly there, but given the prices they are currently charging, you expect 5 star quality (in the resort itself, rooms, service). Save your money and pick another resort......or come back when it's been renovated.
