{"text":"GREAT little hotel! We booked this hotel during our stay in Florence because it was in our price range. We weren't sure what to expect but the rest of the reviews seemed good so we took a chance. Boy are we glad we did! The hotel is on the 2nd and 3rd floor of a building but there is a small elevator. We had a lot of bags so it took a couple of trips of sending bags but it wasn't bad at all. Check-in was fast and smooth. The nice woman who checked us in showed us to our room, showed us where the amenities were, pulled out a map and showed us our location along with the locations of the popular sites and some recommended restaurants. We didn't need to be shown where the Duomo and belltower were as we had a perfect view of both of them from our window. Breakfast was a traditional European breakfast, pastries, cereal, fruit, coffee, but the service was the best. As soon as you walked into the room the owner was already making you a cappucino. The hotel is in a great location as it is close to just about everything. Things look far on the map but you quickly realize they are not. We walked to EVERYTHING except for the Piazza Michaelangelo. We had such a great time staying at this hotel and would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone who doesn't expect the Four Seasons. We will definitely stay when we return to Florence, whenever that may be.
