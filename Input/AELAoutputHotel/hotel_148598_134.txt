{"text":"Excellent Trip... Great Hotel and Staff We returned a couple of days ago from a week at The Wyndham Rio Mar. It was a great time. I'll split the review up a bit to try to hit all areas of the trip: Travel Arrangements: You should honestly rent a car for this trip. The hotel is a little far away from everything but the rainforest and a car rental is pretty cheap there. You will appreciate all the money you save on tours if you have a car. Directions from Airport to Hotel: From the airport, take Route 26 towards 66. 66 becomes a toll road is will cost you $1.50. It will bring you to Route 3. You make a right onto Route 3. Your marker is the Baelz Outlet Mall. The hotel is about 5- 10 minutes up Route 3. There are signs; you make a left and it's up the hill. Parking: If you self park at the hotel, it will cost you $15 a day. Each day you leave the hotel, you bring your ticket to the valet desk and the scan it so you can put it in the machine to get out of the deck. To save on parking, we went to the Timeshare presentation. They gave us $100 and a vacation voucher to Hawaii for 4 nights at a hotel in Maui. Worked out well, because it ended up paying for all of our parking and we only had to spend an hour listening to the presentation. Hotel Accommodations: We were booked for a resort view room. I called a week before we got there and asked for a free upgrade to oceanview, When we arrived, they weere not able to accommodate that request. After a couple of minutes of asking really nicely, they put us in a rainforest view room which I honestly think was best. The view was amazing! The room was very comfortable and well decorated. The best part, it was clean. Food: We did not eat at the hotel at all because we read other reviews that the prices were outrageous. There are a couple of resturants very close by. When you are coming out of the hotel and make a right to go up the hill a bit, there is a resturant called Ritche's. It is an outdoor traditional Puerto Rican resturant and it was excellent. It's pretty much family run. Ritchie comes to your table! There is a breathtaking view of the ocean and the food was good. We enjoyed it so much, we went back twice. Ritchie even remembered us. There is another resturant just passed Ritche's. It was ok. Cheap! I can't remember the name, but it's worth trying. The one resturant you SHOULD NOT go to is Antijito's which is on the same street as the hotel. As you are turning on the street from Rt. 3, it's the first resturant there. The food was awful. The service was pretty bad. That was the only thing I did not like about the food for the week. Things to do: The hotel is beachfront so we spent a day at the beach. The water was a bit choppy and the waves were cresting around 7- 8 feet. I actually got caught in one and ended up bottoming out and tearing up my knee. After that, I was done with the water there. Taking a walk on the beach was goregous. If you walk up the beach, there are small coves which are beautiful. You will even get views of beach and rainforest in the same picture. If you're in Puerto Rico, you should go to Old San Juan at least once. There is great shopping and really interesting little shops and streets to wander through. Great Jewelry stores also! There are lots of great little resturants down there too. It was a great time. We drove up to Farjado and took a Catamaran cruise to the caribbean side of Puerto Rico. There were great pictures and we were able to go snorkeling. The boat we went on was the Spread Eagle II and the crew was great. They serve lunch and bring you to two areas to snorkel off of. It's also a Rum cruise so that was fun too. You have to go to the Rainforest if you are staying literally across the street from it. Little hint; you do not have to pay to get into the rainforest. The Concierge at the hotel will give you a map, and you can drive and hike through it for free. There were amazing views of the beach and landscape. There are also a couple of goregouse waterfalls. Great trip; great hotel; great value. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone who asks.
