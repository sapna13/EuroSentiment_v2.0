{"text":"Cold showers, slow and unreliable internet - I won't stay here again The Normandie Hotel is aesthetically pleasing -- the lobby is beautiful, and the inner courtyard of the hotel is nice. But the service here is lacking, and the hotel is way overpriced.I stayed here Feb 19-23 on business, choosing this hotel because all the decent hotels in town were already charging more than $300\/night. Three out of the four days I was here, the shower was cold. I told the front desk, and they had no response. Also, the high speed internet was slow and unreliable. I tested the connection, and it was between 65kbps - 90 kbps and many times cut out entirely for hours at a time. In order to get work done, I had to walk next door to the Caribe Hilton and camp out in the lobby to use their free WiFi.Fortunately, staying Monday - Friday, I didn't have any troubles with noise from the N Lounge that I'd read about in previous reviews. I would echo other reviewers' comments about the breakfast buffet being disappointing and overpriced at $12. I'd also echo the warnings about the fact that your bill will increase by 20% or more in taxes and fees. My rate here was $250 \/ night, which then came to $300 with taxes; however, after I voiced my complaints about the cold showers, they discounted my rate 20% for those nights.Having traveled now to Puerto Rico at least 4-5 times, I've come to the conclusion that San Juan's tourism industry is an overpriced racket - it seems as though there's a cartel keeping prices way above market rates in the hotels and major restaurants. However, the real value in Puerto Rico is seen when you travel outside San Juan to the smaller towns, or to Vieques, and stay at the more humble lodgings called Paladares. √à√∂√úBuen viaje!
