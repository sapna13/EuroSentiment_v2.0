{"text":"Outstanding views, service, food and much more - great hotel!! We stayed for 5 nights over the Valentines period and were delighted with the hotel.Hong Kong is synonimous with a skyline along the lines of New York, for that reason we upgraded to a Contemporary Harbour View Room - which is more expensive but really makes the stay. The end wall is a floor to ceilling window overlooking the harbour and Hong Kong Island. By daytime the view is fantastic but by night the illuminated hills and buildings make for a spectacular view. Having ventured around HK I can say without any shadow of a doubt this hotel has the best location of any. The views are unrivaled and it is situated in bustling Kowloon with close proximity to the star ferry (1km) for quick access to HK Island (approx 5 mins).Every effort and more was made by the staff during our stay to attend to our needs and make us as comfortable as possible. The food at Yan Toh Heen in the Intercntinetal was without question the best Chinese food I have ever eaten. We did also venture out to Nicholinis in the Conrad Hotel one night and found the most amazing italian food in opulent surroundings. Both of these restaurants are must visits for any holiday maker. They are quite expensive at c√ä√£¬¢130 for a meal for two, Although you can eat cheaper.The SPA facility at IHK is fantastci and we booked a couples room for 1:30mins. This gave us private use of a jacuzzi,sauna and steam bath for 30 mins followed by an hour long chinese massage. Again, I couldnt recommend this high enough. At just √ä√£¬¢120 for the both of us this is a luxury but cheap compared to the UK equivalent.Having now returned form our first visit we would love to return and are looking at ways of incorporating a Hong Kong stay into further asian based holidays.
