{"text":"Great Beaches We just got back from Punta Cana Iberostar Dominicana. The hotel is situated in the middle of 3 Iberostar hotels. Bavaro looks very posh and the rooms are like small little houses. Punta Cana is a lot smaller. Dominicana isn't as posh but I think it is more easy going and the animations during the day and night is fantastic. The biggest downfall for me was the food. I expected tropical caribbean food. Instead what you got was all American based. Hot Dogs, Burgers, french fries. The salad buffets weren't that good and the water was also metal tasting. The drinks at the bar are also weak. They use a Brand called Normandy which is a copy of all the normal drinks everyone knows of. And it was 14% alcohol. I understand that as its all inclusive and everyone would get drunk. The funniest was too see the people Acting drunk. For my taste there were too many American People. And at dinner time we heard them complaining that there were too many europeans and sectioned off a part of the Dinner buffet the american side is what they called it. All inclusive is ok, but you just see people eating like pigs and stuffing thier faces with as much junk food as you can get. They will also walk around with huge Kegs they brought from home and would ask the bar keeper to fill it up with beer. Apart from all that the beaches are to dream about. Absolutely gorgeous!!!Animation was great!!Beaches gorgeous!!!Next time I go I will bring with me a plug in air freshner for the room, my own cushion, and not so much luggage!!
