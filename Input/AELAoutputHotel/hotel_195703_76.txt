{"text":"Location, Location, Location  There couldn't be a better location for enjoying Florence - a short stroll in one direction takes you to the Duomo and Baptistry, turn the other direction and you are at San Marco in minutes. Or turn at the corner and you will be at San Lorenzo. We have stayed at this delightful, small, family-run hotel several times over the years, and each time we love it more. The Lombardi family and their staff are warm and amazingly helpful. They help with bookings, transportation, give advice, and do whatever they can to make your stay a happy one. They truely love their guests.Other factors which bring us back to the Casci include the very complete breakfast - your egg will be cooked to your exact specifications, all you have to do is ask. There is an all you can eat policy, with lots of choices of proteins, fruits, breads and pastry, along with juices and coffee. This makes a huge difference when planning a long day of site-seeing. The hotel's air conditioning is controlled by each room - we Americans appreciate that. There is not only Wi-Fi available, but also a computer in the lobby for guests to use who do not care to bring their own laptops. It is also important to mention that the hotel is amazingly quiet - we never hear traffic or street noise from our rooms.My husband and I escort adult tour groups to Tuscany, and each time we stay at the Casci. All of the adults touring with us have been very happy there.The Casci is not a big or flashy hotel, but it is a hidden gem. The rooms are always immaculately clean, fair sized, safe, and user-friendly. We can't imagine why anyone would stay anywhere else!
