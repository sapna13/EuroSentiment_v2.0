{"text":"A great hotel: location, quality and value I was incredibly impressed with the Moevenpick in Berlin, though I must admit I was not expecting too much. I say that because my friend and I booked a room for 89 euro a night on Easter weekend; I was shocked that a major European city would be offering hotel rooms at such a low price for a holiday weekend. Anyway, we were instantly impressed. The hotel is located just off a subway station, Anhalter Bahnhof, and a 5 minute walk from Potsdamer Platz, which is a major transit hub and home to some big banks and embassies.The hotel itself is very modern--the beds were comfortable and the bathrooms very modern and up-to-date.NOTE: If you book your room on the hotel website directly, you can sign up for this great deal to get an upgrade. Instead of paying for a higher priced room, you can sign up for an as-available upgrade at the time you make a reservation. When you check in, if they have a room of a higher category available, and you've signed up for this program, you get the better room and just pay a few euros extra. My friend and I got bumped from a standard room to a junior suite and just paid 106 euro a night, versus 89 for the standard room. If we had booked the junior suite outright, we would have paid a whole lot more.The staff was incredibly helpful, professional...and spoke with impeccable English. They had nice touches like complimentary juices and water and fruit at all hours, and gave each guest a chocolate Easter bunny on Easter Sunday.The one complaint I had was the high cost of internet--it was 4.50 euro for a half hour if you wanted to access their wireless. But the positives far outweighed the negatives.I would very much recommend this hotel and would stay there again without hesitation whatsoever.
