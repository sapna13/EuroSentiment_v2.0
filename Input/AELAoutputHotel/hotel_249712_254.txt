{"text":"The Place to stay in New York Me and My Girlfriend stayed he in Febuary 2007 ( 13th - 21st ) Snow evrywhere, we had booked a deluxe room, on our arrival to this hotel taking in the all the site, this being my first NY visit. When we came to the check-in desk we were kindly greeted and given a free upgrade to a deluxe corner room. We told them we were also having a late Valentines day ( On the 17th due to the flight on the 13th didn't want to arrange anything incase the flight was delayed) he told me he'd lay something on compliments of the Westin. Dying and very tired well headed for our room, the elevator even had there own little tv - How COOL!. When we reached our room 3529 we couldn't believe the Standard, Quality, Space and above all view of the room. The room was Incredible and we had 5 massive windows, all with views of times sqaure and the hudson river. The heavenly bed lived up to it's name, after a 7 hours flight and a limo ride i felt like diving under the covers but as usual i explored the room. The TV was a lovely 32inch flat screen, massive work area with internet *at a charge* i then dove in the mini bar. The prices of the mini bar weren't to bad compared to some. The Heavenly bathroom was brilliant, it had the curved shower curtain, lovely tub, massive mirror, and so much space. but the thing that i loved the most about the bathroom and excuse the saying but  i've never sat on a comfy toilet were *with the door open* you can see the empire state building *see pic* (don't worry i'm not in it). As we hadden eaten for like 7 hours and were exhusted we tried out the room service which came from the restaurant in the hotel Shula's Steak House we placed an order (see pic) it was not to badly price again for a hotel. My first night in the heavenly bed sent me off to sleep for a good 12 hours and has to be the most comfortable bed in NY. The cleaning staff were great always seem to come when we weren't there but did an amazing job. The receptionist were very helpful and friendly. On the 17th (Our valentines day)we went our for the day and as i booked everything through allnewyorktours.com i couldn't tell my girlfriend what i had planned. I had booked a Helicopter ride around manhatten, if your a photographer like myself it is somthing you have to do. It was a 15minutes ride (which somehow i took 200+ pictures in) and you see every bit of new york, but i did feel a little sick as i'd never been in a helicopter before. When we arrived back to our room we had 12 red roses in a glass vase put on our desk for my girlfriend for valentines day (i did ask the hotel to provide them and that was at a cost but only $25 which i thought wasn't bad) on that day i suprised my girlfriend with a meal at tavern on the green (the only restaurant in central park) plus we had a carriage ride through central park dropping us off there which was $40, the meal it'self was $240 but as it was a 5star restaurant which did include 3 course and the first drink free. tavernonthegreen.com when we arrived back at the hotel around 10pm there was a knock at the door the Westin had laid on a bottle of champagne and chocolate covered strawberry, we thought this was a lovely touch to the evening. Overall the hotel cost us √ä√£¬¢2000 *with flights and all charges included* and i would have spent double that for the hotel standard amd service we got so for the 10 days at the Westin and we left with no complaints or faults and will certainly stay the next time we go to New York.
