{"text":"Realist Review Firstly, reviews that stated that this hotel was on par with Le Meridien Tanah Lot were out. We stayed at Le Med same time last year and wished we had done so again. Although we were only in the hotel for a total of 5 days (in transit to Sheraton, Lombok) so this was not convenient.  We were upgraded for our first 2 night stay to a Club Suite Room which was large yes, but the airconditioning was struggling to cool the room, big double bed was hard as rock and we were a fair walk from restaurants and swimming pool which was hard for my parents in their late 60;s. The Golf Buggies used by concieges came in handy for them when they could get one. The concieges, most restaurant and maintenance staff did not appear to understand any english at all and we had to resort to charades to request a Bucket of Ice, repair our TV and request a quote for car to Ubud. (Driver mind you was excellant). I dont expect anyone to speak english far from it but hotel staff should have a basic knowledge of English as I do of Indonesian.The Main Restaurant was not upto scratch either, ripped cushions on chairs, damaged furniture, cracked teapot and very slow service if any. On checking in for the 2nd time on our return journey back from Lombok we requested 2 rooms closer to Restaurant and Pool and were handed two room keys and told our room number and left to find the room by ourselves. We had no directions given and the baggage boy just walked off. Having not complained up until this point I finally lost it when the rooms we were given were slightly closer however overlooked the Petro Chemical Tanks of the Airport. Cannot believe we did not check into another hotel but we kept going and got moved back to our original upgraded Club Suites, bad airconditioning, leaky toilet and hard bed an all.Worst stay in Bali Yet!!!!
