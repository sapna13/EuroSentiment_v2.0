{"text":"Great hotel if you plan on staying in that area of Bali Was here for a 4-night stay in early January 2007. Arrived there quite early in the day (around 12 noon) and they put me up right away (temporarily) in a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√ºospitality suite√à√\u2020\u2022?since my room was only to be ready around 6 PM that day. Got my room a little bit after 6 as promised. I had to get a deluxe room since all of their √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Üuperior rooms√à√\u2020\u2022?(the cheapest rooms) were booked. I had booked my room a few days before through passionasia.com, which allowed me to get a discount of roughly USD 40 per day (the base rate on Sofitel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ website for a deluxe room is USD 155 and I paid USD 135 per day including breakfast, for which the hotel usually charges USD 20 per day on top of the room rate).The hotel is very well located: if you just walk 5 minutes on the main road away from the beach, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l find tons of places where you can eat or drink, as well as convenience stores and Internet cafes. I tried a few restaurants there, among others: the Indian place (called √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022\u201AÑ¢ateway to India√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?quite good!), the vegetarian restaurant (Zula√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ √à√\u2020\u2022?an interesting discovery) and Made√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Warung (a good 20-minute walk from the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?decent place to get a taste of some local specialties). A fact that may be of interest to some readers: there are a lot of gay bars that can be reached in about 10 minutes on foot (e.g. Q-Bar and MixWell), and the gay beach is located about 20 minutes north (on foot).My room (#345) was quite nice, a very decent size with a huge and very comfortable bed, fresh fruit on arrival and 2 small bottles of spring water in the bathroom. One of the features I especially appreciated about the room was the larger than usual in-room safe (they have the same one in their superior rooms), which allowed enough room to store all of my valuables as well as my laptop, which is bulky by today√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ standards.The hotel promises √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√±roadband Internet access√à√\u2020\u2022?should you need it, but it is rather expensive and was VERY unreliable during my stay. Sure, they could blame the Taiwan earthquake that had occurred just before New Year√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, but I did not have the same kind of problems in other properties in Bali before I arrived at the Sofitel Seminyak. You can buy a 3 or 4-hour block of time for in-room wired access or a full day√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ wireless access useable in the lobby only. They also have a business center with a couple of Internet stations near the lobby, but people who used it told me the speed was terrible. I did not buy any Internet time but someone who did told me he was able to connect only on the last day he was there (he had tried to connect in vain during the first 3 days of his stay).The rooms and villas are really spread out and the lobby is on the second floor, which makes finding your way around the resort a little tricky. The main pool is quite nice, with lots of shaded areas, but it did get quite busy there on a couple of days during my stay. The pool staff is very hardworking and attentive, so are the gardeners who work all day to keep the grounds impeccable. The beach can get dirty, but simply walk a little bit north and it quickly gets better. The water was a little rough but quite warm, so I stayed quite close to the shore (perhaps knee-deep) and had no problem. Try to swim only between the flags if you can help it √à√\u2020\u2022?makes for a safer experience. Between 11 AM and 2 PM, the sand (which is a darker brown) can get really hot, so you have to run to the water in order not to burn your feet.Can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ say much about the food at the resort, as I mostly ate outside the hotel (except for breakfast). Their breakfast is adequate but I found there was less selection here than at other similarly-priced hotels in Bali. You can order fresh juice along with your coffee or tea when you arrive √à√\u2020\u2022?a nice touch. If you get there when it is busier (the 9 to 10 AM breakfast rush), you may find their service to be slow and quite disorganized. Other than breakfast, I tried their spicy shrimp-spinach pizza one day for lunch and it was excellent!The staff is very gracious and attentive, the rooms are clean and comfortable and although you can do much better for the price in Bali, if you want to stay in that specific area of Kuta, I think you really can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go wrong with this place!
