{"text":"Interesting alternative in Hong Kong As a frequent guest of the Holiday Inn Golden Mile, I noticed that Rhombus opened another hotel, this time in TST, HKG. I have stayed at the LKF by Rhombus and found it a great experience. So this time, I choose the Panorama, over my usual choice of the HI as it is just a stonethrow and convenient to the office of our business partner in TST.We had asked for Platinum as that would give us access to the lounge for B'fast and cocktails as well as free wireless in the lounge. I ended up on the 36th floor and had a corner room with good views over the harbor. The hotel is new and clean. Had a busy feeling in the lobby and public areas with tourists and tour groups. If on business, I would recommend the Platinum option. You will have a separate elevator and you are away from the crowd. Breakfast is not lavish but acceptable, with good coffee. The views from the lounge are stunning. Staff is helpful and friendly. The only disappointment was the bathroom. It had no separate shower and the whole bathroom is very small. I was told next time to ask for a middle room as they have separate showers.The hotel lies next to the Hyatt Regency which is under construction and around the corner there are plenty of friendly bars and restaurants.A short walk from Nathan Road and other shopping streets, this is a great new alternative. I will be back again. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":885,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":879}]}
