{"text":"Deluxe accomodations in the heart of Amsterdam Besides the good price and great location my wife and I stayed here for the famed marshmallow bed. We were not disappointed...We stayed for two nights as the relaxing end to our tour through London and Paris. We came in on the train from Paris and the hotel is a short walk from Central Station. It is also a street or two over (and they're tiny streets) from the Damrak and tons of shopping, dining, and just about everything else in Amsterdam.When we checked in, workers were redoing the road outside. The front desk advised that our room would be in the front overlooking the street. I asked if they had anything else due to the construction, but they assured me that we would not be able to hear it through the double windows and that the room was very nice. They were quite polite and exactly right! (they even sent up a fruit basket later just to make sure we were comfortable)The room was practically a suite with high ceilings and large windows overlooking the street outside. The bed was king and was the promised comfort of marshmallow goodness. The shower had a tropical rain spout directly overhead that was like showering in a hot waterfall. The bathroom kit included very nice French soaps, lotions, and shampoos.Maybe we enjoyed it extra much after our smaller rooms in London and Paris, but we loved the Sofitel and would definitely stay there again--make it a tradition even because of that magical bed! :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":140,"mention":"marshmallow","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marshmallow","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marshmallow_creme"],"startOffset":129},{"endOffset":1077,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":1070},{"endOffset":1092,"mention":"marshmallow","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marshmallow","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marshmallow_creme"],"startOffset":1081},{"endOffset":1237,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1233}]}
