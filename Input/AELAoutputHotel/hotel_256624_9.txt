{"text":"Room with a view but a possible security issue We had a two-bedroom suite with an absolutely amazing harbor view. Imagine walking into your hotel room and seeing the Sydney Harbor Bridge and Opera House out your room window!Window opens slightly, no balcony. Laundry facilities in the room. Two bathrooms with a kitchen area. There's a mini bar and an empty refrig for your personal use. Includes microwave oven. Comfortable and clean. We were on the 23rd floor which is the same floor as the indoor pool and fitness area. Can't comment on the hotel food because we didn't eat there. Staff was helpful. We did not rent a car. We were able to walk to all of the important sites. This hotel would have received a higher rating from us had it not been for the following.....Strange encounter: Don't mean to sound paranoid but we thought it strange when we we returned to our room in the late morning unexpectedly and found our room door inoperable. It had been bolted from the interior. We persisted only because we had had a room key issue earlier and were shocked to have a man open our room door. Although he was in a maintenance-type uniform and had a tool box, he was in our room and had bolted the door. He immediately said, Oh, your heat is fixed. This was really strange because we hadn't reported any heat issues. He immediately left. In retrospect, we realize this should have been reported to hotel management. None of our valuables were missing but we had only been out of the room for a short time before we returned. ","annotations":[]}
