{"text":"The Grand Canal with a view This is a small hotel with character and friendly staff. The location is convenient and centralized. It sits right on the bank of the Grand Canal across from the train station. The walk to the hotel from the train station is about 150 yards over a bride of stairs (that lack a ramp or handicap access). Neither my wife nor I are handicapped, but I sure felt immobile after dragging 5 luggage bags up and over the stairs. In Venice, you apparently have to have a license to transport luggage or goods over a certain distance. Our options were to take the water Taxi across the 10 yards (I could literately throw a rock at the hotel) of water to the other side for 35 Euros or drag the luggage over the bridge. As you can tell I am still happy about it.The hotel has a small bar and breakfast area on the first floor with a public computer. Our room was on the second floor over looking the Canal. The view is great, but I would recommend a room at the back of the hotel because of the noise from the boats. The room was clean and adequate. It had a tub\/shower and large sink. The lighting is poor for women, but it was clean and covered is nice grey marble. The bed was firm, but comfortable. The hotel has free DSL internet and local TV. If you like to watch movies bring your laptop because CNN World news was the only station in English. Overall I would recommend the hotel. Be clear about non-smoking requirements though.FYI: Take a taxi to Murano and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get strong armed into buying from a factory on the spot. Shop around for glass that you like. Once you look in enough stores and factories you will realize that there is a lot of the same stuff for varying prices. If you buy anything over 400 Euros make sure it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ real Murano glass certified by Vetro Artistico.
