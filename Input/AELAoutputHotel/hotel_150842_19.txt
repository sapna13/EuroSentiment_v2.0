{"text":"Get More For Your Money Elsewhere This is the 5th All Inclusive resort I've stayed at and was the worst of all. However, the beach was by far the most beautiful of all places I've been to. The food at the resort wasn't anything great. I would avoid all the al-a-carte restaurants except the Oriental. The food at the restaurants was not great so you're better off eating the buffet every night. The buffet had enough variety but definitely lacked in size compared to all the other all-inclusive resorts I've been to.The rooms were always clean, ac worked well, and the maid-service was outstanding. The room itself was dated and the beds were very firm. Double size beds were actually extra wide twins so book a room with a King size bed if possible. Even though it's all-inclusive, everyone demanded tips so that was a huge downfall, especially when tips are included with the price of your stay. And if you don't tip, you get slower service especially at the bar. So plan on spending quite a bit more than what you already paid for.There weren't a lot of activities to participate in at the resort. The shows were supposed to start at 9:45 pm but realistically didn't start until close to 10:15-10:30pm since the first half hour is an introduction to what the show is about and the show performers. My opinion - you can get more for your money elsewhere in the Dominican Republic. I would choose a different hotel than the Iberostar complex. I would recommend still going to the Dominican Republic as it was very beautiful and a great culture\/atmosphere. ","annotations":[]}
