{"text":"Comfortable and well located The Red wall is literally around the corner from the Forbidden City and only a ten minute walk from Beijing's main shopping street. A taxi from the central train train station cost only 16 Yuan. The hotel check in procedure involved relaxing in some comfortable armchairs with a glass of iced water whilst the staff dealt with all the paperwork and took our bags to our room. We were asked to pay an 800 yuan deposit on arrival for mini-bar use, etc. Whilst some reviewers have complained about this, I don't really see what the issue is. The hotel simply cancelled the credit card transaction when we left. Our room on the first floor, 3201, was clean, reasonably sized, with big twin beds and a two seater couch. The air conditioning was very efficient, but quiet. The mini-bar fridge was big enough to put all our own drinks in - there is a cheap shop to the right of the hotel front door with bottles of beer, soft drinks and chocolate. But the mini-bar prices aren't too bad if you can't be bothered with the 10 metre walk to the shop!The bathroom had one drawback - the shower tray was only a couple of centimetres high, which meant everytime you had a shower, the water overflowed and the whole of the bathroom floor got wet.The Red Wall was good value for money, clean and comfortable. Our one dinner in the hotel was delicious - just make sure you eat early. The room was well appointed, clean and comfortable. Whilst there are mixed reviews for this hotel, we had no problems and would definitely stay there again if we returned to Beijing.
