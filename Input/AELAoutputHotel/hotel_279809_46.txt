{"text":"excellent !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I loved this hotel, although having mixed reactions when I first arrived but that just shows that you can't judge a book by its cover!The hotel is very nice with a lot of trees and plants, athough i do advise in the morning  the evening spray some insect repellent around otherwise you find the next morning you will have loads of little red bumbs on your arm.!!the beach  pool are fantastic the sand is so soft and there are loads of places to sit.There are activities during the day which are soo fun, I really enjoyed these and the animation team are ever soo friendly and you can really get to know them.I played Volleyball and did water aerobics  stretching but do not attempt to do volleyball  darts at the same time like i did its very hard work...!!On the beach there is a water sports centre and I do advise doing something. I did Parasailing and it was amazing its completely different up in the air looking down on the hotels and the sea.In the evening there is entertainment  a bar called the Calypso bar..the food is lovely, for breakfast  dinner there is a buffet and for lunch there is another buffet which has things like burgers  hotdog. There is also an Italian restaurant  another one which open on alternitive days..I also recomend going on the half day trip to this little floating island where you can swim with sting rays  sharks and much more !!!.I loved this hotel and would love to go back AMAZING !*!
