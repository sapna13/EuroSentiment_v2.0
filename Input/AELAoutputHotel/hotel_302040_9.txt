{"text":"Perfect Peninsula This was my Hong Kong Heaven. Upon arrival at the airport the Peninsula staff greeted us directly from the aircraft and guided us to the waiting Rolls Royce. We were checked in with speed and we had originally booked a Deluxe Harbour View Room but were upgraded to a Deluxe Harbour View Suite. The suite was on a corner so the windows overlooked the harbour and star ferry site. A good size with lobby, lounge, bedroom, dressing area and a fabulous bathroom with a jacuzzi bath which was surrounded by windows overlooking the city. We were located on the 19th floor in suite 1915. The room had fresh fruit daily, we took breakfast in the suite every day as the Peninsula has a strict policy of no flip flops or sandals in any of the restaurants which was a pain as due to the humidity this is all I had with me. Trainers or enclosed shoes are the only acceptable footwear no matter how fancy your sandals or flip flops might be! Breakfast was limited and they only had smoked bacon. You pretty much got what the menu dictated and extras were not readily offered. Drinks in the lobby were on average √ä√£¬¢8 for tea or hot chocolate. No kettle in the room so this was the only option unless you wanted to go out of the hotel. The hotel view was fabulous on a clear day and the hotel is centrally located for Hong Kong transportation and Kowloon central shopping district. The Concierge service, particularly Edwin and Jackie, were amazing. This is a 5 star deluxe hotel and I enjoyed every moment. The gym and pool facilities were excellent, the spa was a little overpriced but what I would expect from this type of hotel. The bar at the top of the hotel, Felix, was disappointing and was actually quite tacky considering the prices and rating of the hotel. Overall we enjoyed our stay here and felt it was in a great location with good views and a great place to end our trip.
