{"text":"Exec Level is the way to go We had a great 2 night stay here. The lobby was undergoing renovation and was very underwhelming. We were directed up to the Exec Level check in which was smooth and friendly. Unfortunately we couldnt have a room with a view but no problem, just kept the sheer curtains drawn. A non smoking room was requested and it was great- no smell of smoke at all.We had a twin bed room which was reasonably spacious. The decor was OK, neutrals and an Ipod docking station and plasma TV.The linens were all fresh and clean and I requested non feather pillows which arrived after 2 calls to housekeeping along with an adaptor plug.Bathroom was very well appointed, we recieved hotel toiletries then an additional range of Neutrogena products with the turn down later that evening. Water was hot with good pressure The shower is over the bath.The stay was made all the better for us because of the perks of the Exec floor. The cocktail hour( s) was great- nice lounge with gorgeous views and plenty of snacks and drinks (We later stayed at the Metropark Causeway Bay and the lounge there was not a patch on the Regals). We also had b\/f included that could be taken in the lounge or in the cafe downstairs, we opted for the cafe- great food, big selection. Our room also included free airport transfers, we used the in bound one and it was free (I think a previous reviewer had been charged), we had the free minibar and in room snacks that were replenished daily, we also recieved a HK$500 credit on meals which meant that our buffet dinner on the 2nd night cost all HK $50!!!! Amazing value stay. I would stay here again for sure. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":975,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":971}]}
