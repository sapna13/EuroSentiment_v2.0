{"text":"great vacation site Sept 14 2008 I read many good reviews during the planning of my trip here and had wished they were more recent as my arrival time got closer. So I am in the resort and hope this information will help someone with their own plans.So far the place is superb in all respects. The service is extremely good and the food has been excellent. I booked Royal Service based on the reviews I read that expressed many complaints if one did not pay the extra fee. It is expensive but is does include everything I can think of wanting.A Melia van took us here from the airport - that was fine. There are 2 arrival sites, so I eventually had to take a separate cart to the Royal Service registration. There, the staff went out of their way to help us with everything. Drinks were given readily and English was spoken.We enjoyed the pool while the room was completed. I beloieve this is a very slow season and that may have a large impact on how easy and quickly things were done for us.The room is great with large jacuzzi, balcony with gorgeous sunset, huge bed, 2 TVs, kitchen facilities and for us Internet connection. Wireless is available in the lounge, here in the room it is wire and reliable.The beach is the best I have seen comparing many other islands and Hawaii. Sand is beautiful and chairs and even beds under straw huts for shade. Most guests do speak Spanish and i try my HS lessons which works very well with the staff.Many people from the UK, Canada, as well as US and Spain.No problem getting reservations in the restaurants we want, but again it is not crowded. Easy rides to everyplace, the beach is a good walk but is rather hot to do so.Free water sports, we enjoy catamaran daily, windsurfers and there are many motorized activities (for cost) which entertain us.So far I would highly recommend this resort and will write another review upon leaving as my final assessment.
