{"text":"Nice anniversary trip to Dreams My husband and I took a 4 day\/3 night trip to Dreams for our 10th anniversary. This was my first trip to the Carribean but my dh has been to Bahamas, Jamaica and also Mexico. Overall it was very nice. We booked an Apple Vacations package thru BJ's travel. First negative was the hour ride from the airport - apparently this is one of the furthest resorts. I will say though that it was very eye-opening to see the living conditions of the Dominicans - the poverty is very sad. We were a bit disappointed in the size of our room - it had a king size bed but that was about all that fit. I have never seen a King size room that small. There was no shower curtain so we had to throw a towel over dh's toiletries kit so it wouldn't get ruined! Room was spotless though. Pool was beautiful although we were disgusted with the fact that you had to get up early to claim a chair by the pool - we were away from our small children and the last thing we wanted to do was set our alarm! If you are an early riser this should not be an issue for you. The pool and grounds were absolutely beautiful. The swim-up bar was very fun. We were not wowed by the beach - it is on the Atlantic side. I grew up in NJ and we have vacationed up and down the east coast, this beach was no nicer than what we can get here. If you plan to go to the beach bring water shoes - we wished we had them. We took a full-day excursion to Saona Island which is on the Carribean side. It was AWESOME. It was another long bus ride but well worth it. True blue-green water, beautiful sand, you just had to be careful where you swam b\/c of the rocks. We took a catamaran out (90min) while they played music and watered us with rum and cokes. On the island we had a beach bbq lunch, laid in the sun and swam, then took a speedboat back. It was extra $ but well worth it. Food-wise, we had some great hits and some awful misses. We ate at World Cafe for breakfast , lunch was on the beach and at SeaSide Grill and dinners were at Nimitsu, Bordeaux and Oceana. We also had dessert at El Patio which was awful. We found that any dish involving grouper was good. Others were dicey. We had no digestive problems at all - we only drank bottled water and it was fine. The staff was very accomodating, but language was an issue at times. DH speaks a bit of Spanish so that definitely came in very handy. Overall we had a very nice time, but if I was going back to PC I would try another resort for curiousity's sake. Rumour has it that Eden is the best on the island - we heard this from a couple of other Americans.
