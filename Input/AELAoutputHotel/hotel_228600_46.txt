{"text":"Very nice hotel - an oasis of quiet in Madrid We have just returned from a late February\/early March 2007 trip to Andulasia via Madrid and this and another small hotel in Cordoba were the only non parador hotels we used. I selected the Maria Elena based on other Tripadvisor reviews who mentioned how quiet the hotel was because of it's location in a small alley despite being near the Plaza del Sol and walking distance to all the major museums and palacio real. This is a real asset since Madrilenos are out until very late at night and the noise from the street can be significant. When one has arrived from a trans Atlantic flight and suffering from jet lag, having a quiet place to sleep and adjust is a major plus. The hotel is sparkling clean, with nice public rooms and excellent breakfast buffet as mentioned by others. The rooms are small but still comfortable. The bathrooms are very high tech (took a while to figure out the shower with its 6 spray nozzles, fixed shower head and hand held shower!). The room was very warm when we arrived but that was quickly resolved by opening up the windows (very high quality, when closed the noise level dropped considerably) and turning off the heater in the bathroom since apparently the air conditioning was not working. Maita and Neria in particular were very helpful receptionists with excellent English. (I had left my credit card in Granada at the parador and Maita quickly contacted them and had them shred it.) One receptionist did give us wrong directions and was less helpful with phone calls, etc. Other reviews mention the proximity to a red light district; I feel this is absolutely a non-issue. Compared to other cities (we live in San Francisco), the area is clean and filled with people. We never felt unsafe walking to the hotel and were never hassled by people. We took taxis to and from the airport as well as drove our rental car to the hotel to retrieve luggage and were able to negotiate the small alley easily and park outside the reception area. My only negative comment is that several times the housekeeping staff did not get to our rooms while we were out in the late morning and early afternoon. Because we were sleeping in the mid afternoons during the jet lag adjustment period, once our room did not get cleaned at all because we opted to sleep rather than leave to have them clean the room. So better attention to our coming and going from the room (they have electronic locks and should be able to monitor this) would have been nice. And finally, on our last night before leaving for home, we were given a different room than our earlier one. Despite asking for a non-smoking room in the original reservation, they gave us a smoking room because it was the only one with an available double rather than twin bed. This wing of the hotel is adjacent to the restaurant which is the only public smoking area and the room itself smelled mildly of cigarettes. Make sure to ask for a non-smoking room in the opposite side of the hotel away from the restaurant. Fortunately Spain and Portugal as EU countries are passing more and more restrictive smoking laws so maybe in the future we in the non-smoking majority can go to bars and restaurants without having to reek of tobacco. I noticed my very mild asthma symptoms were increased during my stay in Spain. The back portion of the hotel is very smoke free. All in all I would highly recommend this hotel as a good value for the money (make sure when comparison shopping the web sites that you include meals and VAT taxes plus any fees to make sure which offers the best value). I had booked three days via the internet but also got very good rates at the desk for the additional days I added at the beginning and end of the trip (around 130 euros for room and breakfast).
