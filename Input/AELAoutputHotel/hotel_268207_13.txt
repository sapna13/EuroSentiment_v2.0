{"text":"Great Place to Stay I have stayed at this hotel every time I stay over in Boston. The location of this hotel is great and the price is much better than the hotels in the center of the city. We usually walk over the bridge to the North End (little Italy) where you can find any number of top notch Italian eateries. Our FAVORITE is Giacomos at 355 Hanover Street (617-523-9026). This place is the absolute best. They don't take reservations, only take CASH, no desert, no cofee, just great-frsh-homemade food. Rachel Ray ate here and loved it too. You can also pick up the Freedom Trail in the North End. The Old North Chuch where Paul Revere raised the lantern is amazing. There is a portrait of George Washington and the booths that famous families from the 1700s used.Keep going through the north end down Hanover Street and you'll end up in Quincy Market. Here there are all kinds of bars. My personal favorite is the Black Rose, a nice Irish bar with live music.The Hotel is also a great place to stay for concerts at the TD BankNorth Center. You can see the arena from the hotel. It's a short walk or like a $10 cab ride-you pick.The hotel is also very close to the US Constitution and Bunker Hill. The Constitution is a must see. It is actually an active war ship with a full-time Navy crew on board. In the naval yard they also have a WWII destroyed and a few other ships that you can tour. The museum has a lot of information about the naval yard.Overall we have found this hotel to be our place to stay in Boston.
