{"text":"Fantastic location! If there's one thing I regret about my stay in Hotel 1898, it's the fact that I only stayed for a night here. I loved this hotel -- from its facilities, the room, the service and the location.Location -- It's along Las Ramblas, so there is a lot of activity going on right when you step outside the hotel. It is a touristy area, so for some it may not be your cup of tea, but it is conveniently located beside MANY shops, cafes and most of all, the La Boqueria (a large public market quite famous in Barcelona. Make sure to go here if you're a foodie). You'll never get bored (shopping and lot of street performers) or hungry here. There's a McDonalds and KFC a few minutes walk away from the hotel, so if you're starting to miss the fast food, you can always go there. Room -- Immaculately clean. The design was very nice. My room was navy blue and white, very classy. Quite spacious for one person, really. They were quite generous with the amenities as well. There's a cool room feature that sort of sets the overall lighting of your room depending on your mood \/ activity -- for watching TV, for entertaining visitors, sleeping, etc. :)Staff \/ Service -- Professional and accommodating. Although I really didn't get to interact with them that much except for check in\/out and when I asked for an electrical adaptor. But all in all, they were alright.Price -- Got this hotel because of an error made by the travel agent in my booking, so this was a pleasant mistake. But I would say it is still good value for the money. Facilities -- I haven't had the chance to use the facilities, but from what I have seen of the spa and the pool, I would like to go back and try them sometime. Food - Nothing remarkable. Don't expect an eye-popping spread, but it's alright. Overall - I love the hotel for the location, primarily. The fact that the other factors such as the room and staff were great is just icing on the cake.
