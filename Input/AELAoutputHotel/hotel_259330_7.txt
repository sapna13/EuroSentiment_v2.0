{"text":"Beautiful Resort I was at the the Grand Paradise Bavaro from the 14th to 21st of December. My overall experience was great. We were located in the 6000 range wich was located right infront of the beach and very close to the breakfast lunch buffet. This resort is very large and there is always alot of activities to keep you occupied. The beach in the winter season is not calm but you still can swim, just be alert of waves, and bring your own gogles, and flippers as they do not provide them unless the water is really calm. Breakfast was great the first couple of days buts its like going to the same buffet after a while you get tired of if it. There are two luch buffet one close to our room and the other one accessable by the trolly, unfortanetly we didnt find the second one till the day before we left, because the club section buffet had the best food. I didnt try all the food just because i didnt know what is was and didnt know if it would be palable. Dinners for sure where the best meals. You are given three reseverations, to restuartants on the resort. The service at these restuarants is as good as any 5star restuarant. They bring you another drink before you even finnish your food, And the food is amazing. Be for warned Nobody speaks good english, even if you want to compliment a waitor, bring a transulator book. The best part of our trip besides the amazing weather was the shows that took place everynight. Amazing dancers. My two negative points i would like to share are a couple of prostitutes and pimps that lurk around, and the locals get rooms on the weekend at it gets really roudy. But overall all I would say i had a great time and most people that were returning with us all wanted to stay. p.s. Juan was the best server and the breakfast buffet u will be sure to meet him. Bring about 50 one dollar bills for tips. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":828,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":824}]}
