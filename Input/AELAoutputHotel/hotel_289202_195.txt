{"text":"Excellent hotel!!!! I booked this hotel months before our trip based on excellent reviews from this site. I was not disappointed in any way. This was our 2nd visit to Venice and Hotel Antiche Figure provided the perfect location for our stay. I contacted the hotel directly to make reservations. We needed a triple for two nights prior to our cruise and one additional night after the cruise. Normally they don't book one night on a Saturday night, but kindly made an exception since we were booked to stay several nights before the cruise. All dealings with them were timely, positive, and friendly. Several days before we were due to arrive a possible train strike in Germany meant that we needed to get to Venice a day early. An email to the hotel easily arranged an additional night. The location was very convenient to the train station, though we had to lug our heavy suitcases over a very steep bridge. We arrived late at night when restaurants were closed, but the management got some food and wine rustled up so that we didn't go to bed hungry. The room was absolutely beautiful, overlooking the Grand Canal. It was huge and the bathroom was also very large and very modern. The management of the hotel was accommodating in many ways. They suggested Osterias and Trattorias. They also arranged a water taxi to take us to the cruise ship as well as to the airport when we left Venice. I give this hotel and its management my highest praise and will stay there again any time I return to Venice. ","annotations":[]}
