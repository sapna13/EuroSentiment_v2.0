{"text":"Generally comfortable stay at the Golfhotel We were visiting relatives in Purmerend for a week, and their house was being renovated, so we decided to check in to the Golfhotel nearby (despite not playing golf!) We chose the hotel because of its location. It was also offering a decent rate for a week's stay.The hotel is best reached by car, though there is a direct bus from Amsterdam Centraal to Purmerend that stops about a 10 minute walk from the hotel. We took this bus to Amsterdam a few times.The hotel itself has a lobby (with restaurants and bars) and a long, curved two-floor wing containing all the bedrooms. Our room was right at the lobby end of the wing, meaning it was an easy walk. It would be a healthy walk for anyone stuck in the middle of the wing!Things we liked about the hotel:+ location, very convenient for what we were doing+ room was large, bed was comfortable. There was a writing desk, lots of storage, and a second door to block out noise from the hallway.+ room had a fridge.+ free wireless access+ good breakfast in the morning+ attractive locationThings we didn't like about the hotel:- the room got very hot at night. We didn't want to leave the patio doors open, because we were on the ground floor and anyone could have walked in. - they played music all night in the lobby. While we couldn't hear it in our room with the inner door shut, if you left the inner door it was quite obvious.- some of the staff working in the breakfast room were quite rude and unpleasant. One person told us repeatedly that we could not eat outside (despite it being boiling in the room). However, lots of other people kept going outside to eat. We eventually went outside anyway, where it was much cooler, and were harangued by the staff member. I eventually asked her for her name and said I would inform her manager of her behaviour. This seemed to shut her up.- you are staying at a golf hotel. Some guests are not as interested in a quiet night's sleep as others might be.Overall, our stay was fine. We'd go back, particularly because of the location.
