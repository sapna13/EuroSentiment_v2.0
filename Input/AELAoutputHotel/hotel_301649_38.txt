{"text":"One of the Best Hotels I've Ever Stayed My friend and I decided to head to Bali at the last minute in early Octobver 2006 after originally planning to go to Phuket. We originally wanted to stay at the Intercontinental at Jimabaran Beach given the reasonable price and all the great reviews. However, it was booked, so we decided to stay at The Legian which we had read about here. The Legian was also the top ranked hotel in Bali in our Luxe high end travel guide which we have relied on all over Asia (and it is rarely wrong).The Legian exceeded all of our expectations. My friend and I had a two bedroom suite with a huge living room, kitchen, balcony and two enormous bathrooms. The beach was quiet and clean. the two-tiered pool was perfect. Weather was awesome for 6 straight days. Hotel service was top notch and as good as I have seen (with the possible exception of several hotels in Thailand). My friend and I had the best week of our lives in Bali and our experience at The Legian was a significant reason why.The Legian is fairly quiet but that is what we were looking for after heading out on the town every night. I am not sure why anyone would stay anywhere else in Bali. Seminyak has the best restaurants and is most convenient to everything. The Legian is small but offers all the amenities of the more well known hotels. Paying three times as much to stay at the Four Seasons is just not worth it. I've stayed all over the world in the nicest hotels and I can honestly say that The Legian was one of my favorites.-- Laurence, New York City ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1392,"mention":"Four Seasons","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Four_Seasons_Restaurant"],"startOffset":1380}]}
