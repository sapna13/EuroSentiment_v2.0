{"text":"Perfect Location We stayed here for 7 nights on a room only basis in mid-December 2007, as part of a month visit to Australia.The staff were very helpful and friendly. We arrived at about 8am and as our room wasn't available yet, we had breakfast at one of the restaurants in the very nearby Darling Harbour. There is a walkway around the left and side of the hotel that gives you easy walking access across the main road to Darling Harbour.Our room was available from about 12 noon and given the flight times and time differences, we wanted to have a few hours sleep before hitting the streets of Sydney. Unfortunately, the hotel was carrying out fire alarm tests all day and so the intercom in our room was noisy with testing voices all afternoon and we were unable to sleep! Whilst we appreciate fire alarms need testing, the reception staff could have warned us that this exercise was being undertaken that day when we checked in.Although the room itself was small, we had a wonderful Darling Harbour view and the bed was extremely comfortable. We could not fault our room or the servicing of it.We didn't eat in the hotel at all, as there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby. However, it did become difficult to find a table in numerous restaurants in Darling Harbour for dinner, as it seemed that every possible office in Sydney was holding their Christmas parties that week.We often walked down to Circular Quay, which took about 20 mins and we also sometimes took the ferries as well, which leave in front of the aquarium. Overall, we thought this hotel represented good value for money and was in an ideal location. We would recommend this hotel to others travellers and we would stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
