{"text":"Can't wait to go back... A few short weeks ago I was waking up each morning to the most amazing view from the 35th floor....This was a special trip for us - first time away like this without our 4 kids in over a decade and we were very pleased with our hotel choice.We booked an Executive Ocean View room over their website and got a great rate ( and paid in full when the Aussie dollar was 98 cents - phew!!), and were thrilled when we saw the view from our room. Being so high there was minimal traffic noise, and we also found our room to be quite sound-proofed from our neighbours.The bed and pillows were among the most comfy we've ever had in a hotel, and it was great to have a larger flat-screen TV to watch from bed. There was a little mini-bar-sized fridge that was empty, so we could fill it with sodas to take cold to the beach.We had a complimentary continental breakfast each day - cereals, bagels, pastries and fruit which was more than enough to get us started for the day, and the staff in the (temporary, below-ground) executive lounge were always so cheerful!We used the fitness centre each day and found it OK - the ellipticals needed some maintenance and it could use a few more weights, however we got most of our exercise in the ocean swimming and snorkelling anyway.We enjoyed the walk into the main drag each evening for dinner and always managed to catch the sunset with a drink in our hands first.My only real disappointment from our entire stay was the location of the wardrobe and what transpired as a consequence!! It was concealed behind the door in the bathroom and took us a while to find when first unpacking. Unfortunately I had succumbed to stomach flu from a bad oyster I believe and my husband did the packing on our last evening - he emptied all the drawers but forgot the wardrobe.I didn't remember this til mid-flight back to Australia!!I phoned the Hilton as soon as we landed and spoke with someone in house-keeping who had found our clothes - these were kindly packed and sent home to us at our expense. My big disappointment was that a few items were not sent home, and all of these had been on the same hangers with stuff that was in the parcel....Anyway, it was our fault they were left behind so I shouldn't complain. We were most grateful for all that DID make it safely home, however will always wonder what happened to my favourite top and pair of shorts...Apart from that one issue, we were ecstatic with all the hotel offered and it was ideal for a romantic week in Waikiki! I would highly recommend it. ","annotations":[]}
