{"text":"Disappointing stay from Dec 20-27, 2007 I am going to keep this review simple. We have traveled a lot and have stayed at several all-inclusive resorts in addition to cruising. I must say that our expectations were not met. Beach was amazing, average quality snorkeling right in front of the hotel.Hotel grounds are expansive and well groomed, however it is a long walk to anywhere. The roaming peacocks were beautiful.Food was poor, in fact, one of our family members was taken by ambulance to the hospital and hooked up to I.V. the last day of our holidays and we were uncertain if she would be able to fly home with us. Flies were abundant in all food service areas; not just open air spaces.Drinks were marginal unless you ordered beer. They were way too strong and I am Canadian, we like a strong drink. The frozen drinks were all from slushy machines and very sweet. Check-in...smooth except that out of the group of 12 travellers and 6 rooms, 8 of us had to be moved the next morning because of the strong smell of sewer disinfectant\/deodorizer  three rooms because there was no air conditioning. It doesn't sound like a big deal, but we didn't get any sleep that first night. Packing up and moving rooms cost us a lot of vacation time. Our replacement rooms were new, spacious and comfortable without any unpleasant odors and air conditioning was fully satisfactory.Towels. In order to get a towel you either had to produce a towel card or another towel. So if you happened to forget your towel card in your room, you had to walk back to your room or go without. This is the last thing you should be worried about on a vacation.Entertainment was enthusiastic but lacking substance. Good family fare I suppose.Excursions, we only took one, Marinarium (snorkeling with nurse sharks and rays). Very poor. Snacks were build your own sandwiches out of dry bread, piece of cheese and ham. Mustard Mayo and Ketchup via squeeze bottles. Snorkeling was better at the hotel. What a disappointment for $83 per person price tag. No fins so it was hard to swim because you are always fighting the current and waves. We expressed our disappointment respectfully, and they did make amends by giving each couple a bottle of rum.Diving, weather conditions were poor for diving so no fault to Dressel Divers, the sites were limited. Professional and very accommodating staff. Four stars to the Dive Shop! We ended up coming away with a credit for dives that were paid for in advance but were unused due to conditions. Staff were friendly, and responded well to any attempt you made to communicate with them in Spanish. We left the Dominican Republic with disappointing reviews of our hotel but with lots of fond memories of vacationing with family and friends. We will continue to travel and it is unlikely that we will return to the Dominican unless they produce a good 5* quality resort like a Sandals property.
