{"text":"Excellent hotel This place looked too good to be true when I booked it but reality was everything I'd hoped for. It's a totally nice, modern, clean, and efficient hotel in a superb location. The hotel has a huge atrium with what's basically a massive fish tank that rises up from over the bar to the roof. The reception was very fast and friendly ans we were quickly on our way to our room. All the public areas were absolutely spotless and had the appearance of a brand new hotel that had just been created for a style magazine photoshoot. The rooms were a good size and again very modern and sleek in style - a good sized LCD TV, nice furniture, very effective a\/c, tea\/coffee maker, wireless access, plenty of desk space and a massive bed. Everything was shiny and spotless. The bathroom was also superb if a little on the small side - definitely a one person at a time bathroom.Prices in the bar were very good - especially coming from the UK - and the happy hour was a fantastic deal. We ate at the Noodle Bar and it too was great value for money. I don't like eating breakfast in hotels and there were plenty of nearby alternatives.All the staff we dealt with were friendly, helpful, and efficient.The location of the hotel was perfect. Close to just about all the main sightseeing places and a pleasant walk, or cheap taxi ride, through the parks to KaDeWe and all the main shopping areas.Next time I'm in Berlin this hotel will be top of my list.
