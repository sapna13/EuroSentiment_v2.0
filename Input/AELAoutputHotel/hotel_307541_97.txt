{"text":"Amazing~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ i stayed at this hotel twice. when i was starting my travel and after i was done with it, before going back to my country.but jus lovely!!they will give u that flower necklace, wet towel, cold welcome teaupon arrival, and u don't even have to check in at the front desk.u just sit there and enjoy while the front desk associate come to you...the room was just lovely lovely.. i was very lucky to getone of the best standard room.. it was only $72 a nightbut i had two private balconies with tanning beds.probably because i'm a hyatt member but ask for room 3312..if possible. they had a welcome letter with my name on it, fruit basket, 2 bottles of complimentry water in the room and i had free coffe and hot chocolate room service in the morning for free.front desk associate, bell men, and everyone was so nice.i use to work at marriott but i don't think i have ever been that niceto anyone. --,-++the pool was nice also. grand hyatt's pool is better but if you want to go to the ocean.. bali hyatt one is better.no one will bother you at all. you can definately have a quality timei took hotel taxi to denpasar and it was only $8 which was very reasonable compare to blue bird taxi.. since the hotel taxi waswayy bigger and better.the internet in the hotel is really expensive tho.. $6 for 30minand the store is expensivebut brand hotels are always expensive..i didn't think it was too bad since i already been to a very nice hotel and they charged a glass of milk for $9.check out was fast and i liked how they deal with security.many hotels will just give you the room key or just ask the name on the account but they actually told me to sign again andlooked up if it matched or not..i was relived to see this.ooh it's getting long.. but anniewayz.. it was very VERY nice..plus very cheap ($72 a night) for all the facilities and service they hav offeredplus there r free shuttle buses to grand bali hyatt in nusa dua..it's nice to go there for a day.. but i don't think i would actually stay there. it's a bigger, nicer hotel but there was just too many japanese.. over 50%.. i actually asked the bellmen.. he said that it was because grand bali has a contract witha big japanes travel agency.. i'm an asian myself but it was just too much see that many asians in the pool, lobby, etc. i didn't feel like i was in bali.. it just felt like being in a resort in japan.
