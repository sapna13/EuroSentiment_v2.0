{"text":"A Little Gem in a Great Location! My husband and I stayed at the L'Horset Opera for 5 nights during Christmas (23rd to 28th December 2007) and had a fabulous time.The hotel room was on the small side but we had a large kingsize bed with clean crisp white sheets and it was very comfortable. The room was very clean and the air conditioning\/temperature control worked very well. The room was also very quiet. We stayed on the 6th floor which was a none smoking floor. My only complaint would be the lack of drawer space as I prefer to unpack everything rather than live out of the suitcase. Also the bath was on the small side but had an over bath shower and also a hand held shower with constant hot water. The room was perfect after a days sightseeing.As mentioned by other reviewers, the location was excellent, very close to the Galleries Lafayette and of course the Opera. We travelled around on foot (Concorde and Place Vendome were within easy walking distance) and also used the Metro - we purchased a 5 day ticket from the Tourist Information and we got some good maps from them too.The facilities in the hotel were fine, breakfast as expected, continental with freshly squeezed orange juice. The staff were very friendly and helpful and were able to deal with all our requests (kingsized bed, extra coathangers, toast with breakfast and booking taxis) and I am sure they would have been able to assist with other things had we required them.This hotel does not have any additional facilities such as a pool or a gym, but has a relaxed atmosphere and a more personal touch than some of the larger hotels.We took a taxi from Chales de Gaulle and it cost around 40 euros (50 euros on the way back due to traffic). We had originally planned to use the train but a lot of people were stood up and we had a lot of bags and just thought a taxi would be the easiest option.I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again.
