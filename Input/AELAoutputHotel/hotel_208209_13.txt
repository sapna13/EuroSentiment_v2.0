{"text":"A great city centre hotel First of all I would like to say that my stay in this hotel was a great experience. I booked my stay in Barcelona at the very last minute and took this hotel without doing any research. After I booked it I read some very negative reports from fellow travellers on this site and was fully expecting to change my hotel after one night. I could not have been more wrong. Booking in was easy and efficient. Good reception staff and really helpful. I got an automatic upgrade to a much bigger room with a lovely bathroom. It was noisy outside (as you would expect from a city centre) but the windows were effective at cutting this out. The location was first class, right in the city centre and brilliant for all the tourist and shopping bits. Only 10 mins walk from Placa de Catalunya, the same from La Pedrera and El Corte Ingles. The bed was comfortable and there was a nice big TV to watch. The room was cleaned beatifully every day and there were loads of good toiletries etc to use. Very unusually, there was loads of lighting in the room making reading really easy.Breakfast was a triumph. At only √à√\u2020√ü?7 a day I managed to have a huge meal (breakfast like a king, they say) setting me up for a day's sightseeing without the need for a big lunch. Hot and cold food alike, it was all good quality and plentiful. I fail to understand why anyone should think so poorly of this lovely and good value hotel. I shall make a point of returning to the Gran Havana when I next go to Barcelona.
