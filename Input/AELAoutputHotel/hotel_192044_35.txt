{"text":"Fantastic Hotel Stayed in this hotel between October 12 and october 18. I only have good things to say about this hotel!On arriving on the 12th, our room was ready and the check in was fast and very efficient. I stayed in this hotel with my girlfriend and were in London to see the city and everything that makes this city so great.The room was a superior double and had everything we needed. A very comfy bed, wish was excellent since everyday we came back to the hotel very tired of all the day's walks. Breakfast was also great, with a wide range of food, that helped get trough the day and only have light snacks at lunch.In terms of location, the hotel is situated opposite the London Bridge Station, wich also has a underground station that is served by 2 different tube lines. This was great for us, since from there we were able to get to everywhere we wanted in a short period of time. It was also great because we arrived in London via Gatwick and all we had to do was take an express train from Gatwick to London Bridge Station that only took us 15-20 mins.The staff was also very friendly and the concierge was excellent, helping us with anything we would need.To sum up, this is a great hotel ideal for some vacations in London. To some people this hotel might no be the ideal, since it's located near a business center and at night lacks any sorts of animation and even the restaurants aren't that many in the area. But if you are like me, and loves a quiet hotel to rest after a day of sightseeing, this is without a doubt a very good hotel for you to stay. ","annotations":[]}
