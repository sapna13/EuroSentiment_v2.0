{"text":"Don't hesitate.....you won't regret it! We spent two fantastic weeks at the Riu Bambu and would recommend it to anyone (except extremely miserable fussy people who expect 6 star luxury for 3 star prices!)We booked our holiday in November for the period 11-26th December via Thomson's on-line company 'First Resort'.We paid √ä√£¬¢590 per person all-inclusive including flights and transfers. It was originally nearly √ä√£¬¢800 each but we monitored the website for a few weeks and when it dropped to around √ä√£¬¢630we called the company and got the agent to discount further.Riu class the hotel as 5 star but I think Thomson's have got it spot on as 4 star plus. If you want total peace and quiet in 5 star luxury book the Riu Punta Cana Palace next door and pay at least √ä√£¬¢300 each extra. If you are a family and\/or enjoy a lively atmospheric hotel the Rui is by far the best of the 5 on the complex. Evidence of this is that many from the Palace hotels are seen day and night in the Bambu. The hotel rooms are spotless, have two double beds, the famous 5 bottles of spirits on optics, fridge with beer, tonic, soda, cola, and lemonade. What a difference that makes! Cable TV has at least 6 english speaking channels with movies on throughout the day and night. Ideal if you fancy an early relaxing night after your meal or the show. We even got to see live premiership football on Mexican TV (Channel 35).If you can't find food to satisfy you every day you must be extremely picky. There was chicken, pork, beef, vegetables, pasta, fish, pizza, burgers, hot dogs, salad, fruit, deserts, ice cream EVERY DAY! In addition there were speciality nights that presented lamb, rabbit, turkey, shrimp, barbequed meats etc. All were well cooked and hot. Obviously the earlier you dined the fresher the food was as it was less likely to have been standing for any time. We had in addition the choice of 3 other restaurants. Steak House, Italian and Fish (this was part of the Palace Macau on and on the edge of the beach). You had to book on the day (between 7-10am) and could do so as often as you liked and availability was good. The animation team were excellent. The evening shows were varied and never repeated in 14 days and as good as any and better than most I've come across. My only complaint is that there were was too much 'adult' content particularly in the audience involved games. The team also do the same club dances in between the 5 language announcements every night which are fun but 14 days on the trot is just too much.As for day time this can be as quiet and peaceful as you like (the beach, fantastic!) or busy and hectic (around the pool and joining games and sports)You could get whatever drinks you wanted with an array of cocktails and branded (Gordon's, Johnny Walker, Smirnoff)as well as local spirits BUT you must ask for them by name. Only let down was the beer but it was passable. The beer in the fridge was bettter.This is a perfect family location. We had two teenagers (15,17) who loved it. Children can roam freely, eat and drink when they like. Parents can relax without worry. The staff are the most genuine friendly people and really add to the holiday.Of the 4 of us who travelled only one had a bad stomach that lasted 2 days. It goes with the environment. I don't believe it's a hygenic issue. I've seen more problems in Spain.We did not do any trips as we are beach lovers who relaxed the whole time. They seemed well reported on but are quite expensive starting at around √ä√£¬¢40\/50 each. That said, you spend on nothing else, even the safety deposit box is free!I've been on all-inclusive holidays in Majorca, Tenerife, Turkey, and Portugal. This was the best by far in quality and value. Med holidays don't compare unless your paying twice the price and they still don't have the beaches the quality of beach locations.
