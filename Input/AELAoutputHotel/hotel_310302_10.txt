{"text":"SmallSmellyDangerousExpensive==Washington Shinjuku Here are the list of my comments:1, First of all the bathroom was very Dangerous.because the door step is too high it was about 8 inch and is accident prone especially for old people and children,the door was also dangerous because its kind of weird because you have to push it instead of pulling in when you are inside which can be very dangerous when someone is waiting outside.....2. The front desk staff did not even care to ask first if we wanted a non smoking floor or not i believe that this did not meet international standards worst, we would like to move to a non smoking floor but was already fully book!3. There was no complimentary bus going to the shinjuku station(only takes 5 minutes.).4.There was no cabinet doors only hangers5.The toilet is too small and you cannot move comfortably. the bathtub is like a baby bathtub.6. They only give one key and you have to insert the key to have the main power switch on ,when you are outside the power is off 7.i found one of the bed sheets it has several holes in it.8. The max volume of the TV was too low i can barely hear the sound from the bed.9.It was the first time in my entire experience that you need to fully pay your bills during check in....10. it would be impossible for Yao Ming to stand inside the room he will have back pain!..11.The Center table is too low and is wiggly(Made of 1x1 wood only and a small piece of glass)..12.I cannot tell if it was a chair or a sofa..13.I could not tell whether if it was a refrigerator or a safebox because it was small and empty.14.in order for the internet to work you need to open the Television..15.The trash can was very small.16. It was weird the elevator stops at 3rd floor every time when going up and down for no reason..I Rather stay in a capsule hotel than in this hotel.its like a expensive budget meal it was not worth my money (20,000 YEN) From.Room  23**  ","annotations":[]}
