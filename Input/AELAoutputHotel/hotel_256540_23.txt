{"text":"The best hotel of our round the world Honeymoon We are just back from our honeymoon and I wanted to review this hotel as it has been one of the highlights of the whole trip only competing with our weeding night hotel in Helsinki (check hotel Glo if you go there).I found the hotel because I read some good reviews in travel forums and even it sounded great on paper I was a bit nervous as Sydney was a special place for us in this trip and I wanted the hotel to be up to it, but as I did not know the group I was not sure it was going to be so good. Fortunately not only we were not dissapointed but found it nicer than expected and my husband congratulated me because it was really a nice surprise to him.The hotel is really modern, chic and nice and full of special touches. The entrance in a back street is a bit strange and at the beginning we were a bit surprised and a bit worried but on the plus side it adds to the feeling of discovery and place reserved to a few and if you do not like to go in from there you can always get in and out through the bar entrance and stop for a drink in your way! The lobby is nice but also a bit strange as it gives you more the feeling of being in a club lounge.The staff was really friendly and check in and out was very smooth. We only had a small problem as we booked a parking space and when we arrived with the car the places were full but they finally found and extra place.The room was big with a very nice modern and minimalistic decor, a comfy bed, great stereo, a domotic system through the phone to control temperature, do not disturb sign, the lights... very nice to change the mood of the room from the bed. As a night snack instead of the classic chocolates they left two gigant chocolate cookies every night that were truly fantastic.The bathroom was also great (especially the huge walk in shower -there is also a big bath tub if you prefere- and the Bulgary amenities) and could be comunicated with the room if wanted.The only minus point was the lack of a view as it faced the back stree and the surronding backs of office buildings a pity in such a nice city but the location of the hotel was very central and handy.Breakfast was included in the room rate but it only included Continental, not the cooked menu options even the price was almost the same. That was a bit of a problem as we where staying 4 nights and the continental selection is of a very good quality (freshly squeezed juice, greek style yoghourt, fresh fruit salad...) but very limited (only bread with butter-marmalede, cereals, fruit salad and pastries but not salty options). When we asket the front desk they say we should negociate it with the breakfast manager and we could finally change at least for a day to have some nice fresh pancakes, but it was a bit annoying. Another plus of the hotel is the set ot restaurants and night clubs attached. Normally we are too tired after a long day out to go out at night but here you have a nice trendy bar just downstairs so it is great four a drink before going to sleep. We where twice in the main bar to check the salsa, and back to school nights, both very animated and fun and we spend a third one in the upstairs lounge that was nice with relaxing music but the atmosphere was a bit strange with to many men waiting for women to arrive and keep then company.If I go back to Sydney I will stay here again.
