{"text":"Great but Not for Everyone My wife and I had a wonderful 8 night stay at the Hotel Amrey Diagonal. This was our second trip to Barcelona, which we feel is a city that has it all! The hotel is located in a rapidly gentrifying area in the shadow on the Torre Agbar, one of Barcelona new premier buildings (which, unfortunatley, one can not tour). While other equivalent hotels near the center of town were charging around $250, we paid $ 140 a night (weekends were higher and weekdays lower. So this is a blended rate). We booked the hotel through the web site, Venere, which does not require a prepayment--so you can see what you get before you have to pay.The Ambrey Diagonal is four metro stops from Placa Cataluyna. It also is serviced by the No. 7 Bus( which takes you to the center of town as well as where one gets the train to the ariport) and the No.4 tram ( which takes you near the very interesting water front. ) None of these rides is longer than 20 minutes.The rooms are rather large by European standards, well appointed, and modern. The hotel was build in 2002. The 01 and 10 banks are slightly larger than the other rooms. If one is above the 8th floor, there is a nice view of the foot hills of Barcelona and the Foster communications tower.One of the very nice aspects of the hotel's location is the the Rambla Poblenou,the street immediately to the left of the hotel as you exist the hotel. You get a interesting sense of a real neighborhood here--unlike the hordes of tourist on the Rambla in town. Here one actually hears Cataluyan spoken rather than English, German or French! There also are several servicable restaurants on this street. We like Xorus where we ate several evenings.Another advantage of the locations is that it is within 15 minutes walk to a wonderful beach at the bottom of the Rambla Poblenou. There is a great walk from the beach toward town--which will take about 3\/4 of an hour all along the sea front. The hotel also is very close to the Musical Museum--a new museum housed next to the National Theatre and well worth seeing. Near the Glories metro stop, there also is one of barcelona's largest flea market--which is open several days a week.The staff at the Amrey Diagonal were friendly, reasonably proficient in English, willing to be helpful in giving directions as well as being willing to call restaurants to reserve dinner reservations.The one down side is that if you plan to spend a lot of time around the center of town, going back and forth more than once a day can be a bit trying. However, given all the other benefits of the area and the price, we felt the trade off was worth it.
