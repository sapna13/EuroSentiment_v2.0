{"text":"Didn't like the Bali Hyatt I had high hopes for the Bali Hyatt since it's highlighted in several books for its uniquely Balinese landscaping, but I was very disappointed in the place, especially in comparison to the other comparable places we stayed in Bali. Here's what I disliked: 1. The rooms were very dated, from the yellowing tub to the past-their-prime tiles. 2. Our non-smoking room smelled like smoke. 3. The pools were really crowded. 4. They had trouble patching phone calls to our room so we couldn't connect with our friends. 5. They charge crazy prices for amenties, drinks, food and anything extra they can squeeze out of you - they charged me $6 for 30 minutes of internet use, which is just rediculous! 6. The staff is not very helpful, and they foist their expensive car service on you when you ask them to call you a taxi (which is like 3 times more expensive than a taxi - you have to specifically ask for, and insist on, a metered taxi if you want one. They won't even give you the option of one, which is lame.)We had rooms of similar price at the Conrad in Nusa Dua and Sofitel in Seminyak, but those rooms were way more spacious, everything was updated and\/or new, the resorts were a lot less crowded, they had nice amenities (such as feather beds and comforters) and the staff was way more attentive and helpful, and those resorts never nickled and dimed us like the Bali Hyatt did. Compared to the other places we stayed, the Bali Hyatt was a huge disappointment.There were tons of families there, so maybe it's a good place for people travelling with kids, but for people searching for a peaceful and plush Bali getaway or a great deal, this isn't it.
