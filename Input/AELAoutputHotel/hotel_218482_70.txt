{"text":"Good times at Catalonia Bavaro :) This was my third time in the Dominican and I have to say it was also my most meamorable visit. The overall hotel property is huge. My room was close to reception, which was perfect for nightly entertainment, bars and dinner. However, it was on the complete opposite side of the beach and pool so it was sort of a walk to get there. The resort has many places you could eat at. Two buffet, one by the pool and the other by reception. There is also a grill at the pool which is always open that serves amazing pizza! Then there are four a la carte restaurants, which include: American, Italian, Mexican and Japaneese. The American and Mexican were my top two. Be careful with the meat there because for some reason it always tends to be undercooked. There is also a crepe cafe where the gift shops are, which is absolutely incerdible. They are only open in the afternoons and serve all kind of things from crepes to banana splits. Also, of all the hotels I have been to this place has the nicest cocktails I have ever had. I highly reccomend the Banana Mama and Miami Vice. Amazing! The bartenders are by far the friendliest staff. Some staff are WAY friendlier than others. I did not find the service to be too great. Our maid for some reason always forgot to leave towels, any towels! And when I called reception it took 45 min to an hour sometimes until someone brought them by. I found the nightly entertainment to be okay. I went to the disco once or twice and it was never ever full or very busy. The beach was not the nicest and huts were ALWAYS taken. I woke up at the crack of dawn one day to try and reserve one, but they were already taken. I went with my boyfriend and we both had a good time! We always tipped and found that some of the staff were much better to us.
