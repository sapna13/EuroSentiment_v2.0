{"text":"Wonderful Boutique Hotel I stayed at the Hotel Griffon because I was attending a conference at a near by hotel and that hotel had been fully booked. How happy I am that I was able to stay at the Griffon instead! The Griffon offered such polite and personal attention, unlike the other larger chain hotel at which the conference was held. Immediately upon registering, I was warmly greeted by the desk clerk who knew all about my state's crazy NFL quarterback situation. It set the tone for the kind of service I received thoughout my entire stay. The rooms were small, but appointed with lovely furnishings. The breakfast provided in the morning afforded a great light start for the day without having to get out of my PJs too early. I was not able to eat at the restaurant because it was under renovation, but I had no problem with construction noise. One note-be prepared for the tiny elevator. It can get very cozy with two or three people riding. The robes provided in the rooms could be a little nicer, too, but just the fact that they were there was a nice feature.Overall, this hotel was well located, had a very caring staff ,and was more than comfortable. They also offer free wifi internet in the rooms, which I find to be a real ammenity in the pay-per-day world of many hotels. I would not hesitate to return to the Hotel Griffon, and would reccommend it to anyone looking for a quiet spot in the heart of San Francisco.
