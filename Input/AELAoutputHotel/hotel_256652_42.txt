{"text":"this place is great do it My wife and I stayed at the Observatory hotel it was on 21st and 22nd October (Room 223).I also read several reviews about this place some good and some bad.We are just 2 ordinary people and have 9 children between us so you can appreciate that finances arent free flowing.But we got married on the 20th and I* booked several months in advance for 2 nights.Well i dont know what a hotel has to do to please people or what people expect for there money we found that ALL the staff were friendly and went out of there way to help us and get us anything we wanted. from the moment we arrived and yes it was on the motorbike, we were met at the the front door and helped to unload the bike we were followed to the desk and had the lift waiting for us to take us to our room we were shown all the features of the room and our bags placed in a cupboard for us.then straight to the underground pool well what can we say ..Awesome. My wife needed her heat pack warmed throughout the night due to a sore back and this was done at 2 am with a smile. So it was time for breakfast scrabbeled eggs and bacon, there was so much i couldnt eat it all the waiter was very professional and friendly, my wife had the pancakes with strawberries in her words they were incredible.Yes it is not the cheapest hotel but when you chose to spoil yourself this is the place to do it and you should do it once in your life. this place is great ,the turn down service and the touch of the water beside the bed was nice. Babita even folded our clothes for us. Go to this place and discover it for yourself...
