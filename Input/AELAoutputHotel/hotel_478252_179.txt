{"text":"Punta Cana is beautiful! My husband, kids (13 and 11 yrs.) and myself stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe for a week at the end of April. We chose to upgrade to the Golden package, hoping to get an ocean view room. We were in building 6 on the Punta Cana side. There are very few ocean view rooms at this resort, the buildings are basically one behind another√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√πe could not see or hear the ocean from our room. The beach is very beautiful with soft, white sand. The waves are fun and manageable. My kids loved the boogie boards and parasailing. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have any trouble finding shade on the beach regardless of the time of day. We were disappointed that the beach bar closed at 5:00 PM each day. The pool bar closes at 5:30 PM. If you want a drink after 5:30 you have to go to the lobby bar which is a 10-minute walk. Not very convenient for all-inclusive. The bartenders are fun but the drinks are a little light, not a problem if you tell them mucho tequila!Rooms are nice, not luxurious but comfortable. The showers are interesting. There is a glass wall from the top of the tub to the ceiling, but it only goes about a third of the way down the length of the tub. After my daughter stepped out onto a very wet floor and slipped, we put a wash cloth at the end of the glass partition and also on the wall side to trap the water. We found the beds to be OK, but there is definitely not a pillow top mattress as the web site promises. Our room was cleaned thoroughly each day, furniture is moved away from the walls and the floors were scrubbed. Please remember to be generous with the housekeeping staff, they work extremely hard to keep the rooms looking nice. We loved the fresh flowers and towel art. We were on the ground floor and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see any unwanted visitors (ants, roaches√à√\u2020\u2022?.Food is good√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√£ach day we ate at the buffet for breakfast and lunch. The main buffet near the lobby offers many more breakfast and lunch choices than the other buffets that are more convenient to the beach. We ate at the Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ French, the Grill, the Japanese, and the Mediterranean. Our Golden representative told us the buffet, the French and the Japanese restaurants on the Punta Cana and the Bavaro sides were the same. All of our meals we tasty, but I do have to warn you√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√°t the Japanese restaurant, as the chef was preparing our meal in front of us, a roach scurried around the counter top. He pretended not to notice, but the 10 of us around the table noticed! I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ help but think where there is one there are many! Each of the restaurants we went to were nearly empty, I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not sure why it is difficult to get a 7:00 reservation as opposed to an 8:30. We had both, arrived early for the 8:30 and were seated right away with many tables available. Be prepared for a leisurely dinner at the ala cartes, it takes about 2 hours from start to finish.We went to 3 shows, The Lion King, Michael Jackson and Sexes vs. each other. The Lion King was good, younger kids would enjoy this show. Michael Jackson show was fun to watch. The Men vs. Women show was pretty lame. I was sorry to miss the international show, but do to our ala carte reservation time, we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ make it.We golfed at the Punta Cana golf course, which is next door. It is very expensive and the course is not in very good shape. We made our tee time through the Golden Club and were told it would be $145. per adult, $45 for kids. When were arrived at the golf course, the kids were each $75. Ouch! If I had it to do again, I would look into a different course.One last note, this is a very poor area. We took toys and school supplies for the children. If you choose to do this, get in touch with Mike at mike@mikesmarina.info or [--]. Mike came by the resort to pick up our donations. Very simple and very worthwhile.We enjoyed our first visit to the Dominican Republic. Punta Cana is a beautiful place, I would love to go back some day√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2020ut not to the Gran Bahia Principe. Next time we will try a different resort.
