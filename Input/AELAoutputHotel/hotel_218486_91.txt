{"text":"Very Impressed With The Hotel!!!!! Loved It! Me and my boyfriend (Mid-20's) stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from the dates of April 19th - 24th. We loved it!! We are from the USA, and we went with an open mind knowing we were going to a 3rd world country. I have been reading the reviews like a maniac keeping up to date on what people were writing. I have to say this... You get what you pay for and then some!FOOD: The best that it could be for eating food that is not from your country. Barcelo tries so hard at accomodating everyone visiting their resort. There are so many Europeans, Canadians, etc. Not a lot of people spoke English, but I kind of liked that. I thought it was cool, to see how others communicate. That being said, we are all accustomed to different types of food. I am a true Italian and I have to say the pizza was really good... We did go to the Japanese and that was awesome! That was my favorite, great dessert as well! The buffet's breakfast was soo yummy!!! So many different options, and for those that don't like to try anything new, there was always, fruit and yogurt available. My boyfriend did get very sick on the 2nd to last day. I was worried about him, but at the gift shop you can pretty much get anything you need. We got immodium and pepto bismal. PEOPLE: Very nice! Everyone: travelers, entertainers, workers.. Great! Very accomodating! I was impressed at all of the different languages they spoke!POOLS AND BEACH: This place is the best! Always chairs available on the beach, little huts for those that like the shade. 3 different pools, in which we went to all of them! Our biggest decision was should we go to the pool and if so which one? The beach had so many activities going on at all time. The boys that entertain the beach are hysterical. I pretty much laughed all day at them. The water aerobics was cool too. Soccer balls, volley balls, ping pong, pool tables. There was just so much to do!Drinks: Very good, if you tip them they will make you a frozen margarita, if not you get a mix. They were yummy as well... Oh and there beer (Cerveza) was sooo good, and I dont even like beer! ROOM: I loved our room. Loved it! High ceilings and nice balcony. We did not pay money to upgrade we were happy as is. I was very happy and I am sad that I am writing this review because I am home! Overall I am very impressed with Punta Cana and the Barcelo Dominican. I truly believe that they try very hard and they want everyone to always be entertained!!!!!!Please contact me if you have any questions.. Otherwise... ENJOY!!!!
