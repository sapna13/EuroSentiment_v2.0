{"text":"Superb experience Stayed at The Four Seasons for three nights in April 2006. Have previously stayed at The Four Seasons in Las Vegas and Sydney so were confident of a good experience. As it was the last three nights of an eight week tour of Australasia we wanted to end the trip with a bit of style so arranged a limousin to pick us up from the airport(This was arranged via the hotel website). On arrival at the hotel about 10pm we were met at the car by the duty manager and our registration was processed quickly. We were then informed that as the hotel was extremely busy we were to be upgraded. In fact we were allocated the sleeping quarters of the Presidential Suite on the top floor.The accomodation was superb - huge room, enormous bed and a magnificent bathroom of excellent proportions.The quality of everything in the room and bathroom was of a very high standard and the service by the staff faultless. The room also had a great view of the city. We took breakfast each day and it could not be faulted. Plenty of variety and there was no chance of going hungry.One evening we had dinner in our room and again the quality of both food and service was top notch.This was our first trip to Singapore and my wife and I just loved the place and staying at the 4S was the icing on the cake. Will definately return and will probably stay at the same hotel.
