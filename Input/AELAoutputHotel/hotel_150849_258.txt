{"text":"The Best This was our first trip to another country and I am thrilled we chose Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. I read the reviews and made my choice for the RIU BAMBU and am thrilled at the results. The food was excellent and great choices if you are staying for a week. Highly recommend the Caribbe Grill which you have to book, the view is magical. We opted to use the swim up bar only once as the view of the ocean was what we paid to see. Get your beach chairs early because they're gone by noon. Incredibe sunshine, spectacular beaches, beautiful people. I was surprised some people said the staff were a little crabby, I'd be a little crabby if I had to deal with the number of tourists roaming in an out of there. My husband and I found about 95 percent of the staff were extremely friendly and ready with a smile and Ohhhh-laaaa!!. Yet the other tourists were the ones who rarely smiled and seemed crabby. Take that as you may the staff were some of the hardest working people we ever met. All in all, highly recommend going to the RIU BAMBU which was the best out of all 3. We met a few people from other RIU resorts who said that ours was the most fun. One of the most important things to remember, bring your own pillows. That was the best advice we got off the reviews and it sure made a difference. The rooms were not musty at all, and everything in them worked fine. Book now and enjoy a fantastico holiday!!!Stacey and Terry Calgary, AB, CANADA ","annotations":[]}
