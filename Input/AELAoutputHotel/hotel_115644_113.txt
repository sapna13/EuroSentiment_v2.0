{"text":"Excellent Customer Service! We stayed at the Chancellor from Jun14-17 and absolutely loved it. The location was great, right beside Union square and near all the shops. Ton's of restaurants in the area within walking distance, sushi, pizza, chinese, all american, whatever you are in the mood for. It was easy to get to, we took the BART from the airport, took about 25minutes to get to our stop, just followed the directions, cost was $5.35each one way, walk to the hotel from the BART stop was slightly up hill along Powell, Cable car line, approx 4 blocks or so, took us maybe 10mins. Lovely reception area, check-in could not have been quicker, staff at front desk were very friendly and welcoming. They gave us a package at check-in giving us a discount for the dining area as well as 2 for 1 drinks at the hotel bar. We also received a coupon for the 11% discount at Macy's given to foreign passport holders. Now to the room. I had done my homework and was expecting a smaller size room based on everything I'd read and yes the room is smaller than some, however it is not the smallest room I've ever stayed in and I have travelled a LOT. The room was efficiently layed out, with nothing in the way of the other and SPOTLESSLY clean. I loved the rubber duck in the bathroom and the bath salts that soothed my aching blistered feet. There was more than enough room for two girls who planned on shopping and bringing takeout back to the room. The closet was huge, walkin with a safe in the back, iron, ironing board and an umbrella, just in case, I love it! There was a jar of candy on one of the tables, mint, butterscotch, cinnamon, Jolly rancher, nice touch, we had several. Room service was available, not particularily expensive, however we did not order anything becase coffee was always available and freshly baked cookies as well as apples. We would grab a coffee and cookie in the morning as well as a complimentary newspaper . As mentioned in previous reviews, there is no air conditioning, but the windows in the bathroom and the room open, allowing for air to circulate and there is a fan overhead if you need it, but I don't think you will, average temp during summer is in the mid 70's and it cools down at night. We did not use the fan. We had two single beds and covering up with the lightweight duvet was more than enough to keep us warm or cool at the same time. The bed was extremly comfortable. There is a tour desk in the lobby. They will make arrangements for any tour you like, pick up from the front lobby. We took a day tour of the city, highly recommend it, it took us to all the spots you must see, first time in SFO. If you don't want to book a tour, from this location you are within blocks of China town, taking you maybe 10-15mins to get there. We walked from the Wharf back to the hotel, took us 45 minutes, most of it uphill. No problem. Now to the part that made the biggest impression on us, the hotel staff. It wasn't just the staff at the front desk that were friendly but everyone that worked there said hello to us and smiled. Once we were getting into an elevator and the bellman who was already in the elevator got out to allow us to use the elevator first. He insisted, even though we told him we'd wait. The employee's all seemed happy to be there and ready to work, no private converstaions going on that you fear interrupting or conversations that continue while you wait for someone to notice you are waiting to ask a question and that means a lot to me. I hate feeling like someone is doing me a favour by answering a question. We loved this hotel and stay here again in a minute.
