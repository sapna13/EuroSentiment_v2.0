{"text":"Home away from Home This hotel is amazing, a jewel in Mexito City.LOCATION: The most central location while still in a safe neighborhood, most rooms overlook El Angel, which is Mexico City's main monument, in the heart of the city. Easy access to anywhere you want to go in the city, which is amazing given that Mexico City is the largest city in the world!!!SAFETY: THe hotel is very safe and they have their own taxis waiting outside, that you can take resting assured that they are monitored and safe. Also, the front door and on the inside has great security. Felt very safe ,which is very needed these days in Mexico City. SERVICE: Amongst the best i have ever experienced. From the moment you step out of your cab at the curb, expect worldclass service. They know your name, they anticipate your every need. As part of the Starwood Preferred Program, we were upgraded to the Towers for 2 nights. We had butler service, welcome champagne and fresh fruit in our room, plasma TV, free pressing of our clothes and shoe shining, they woke us up with cofee and orange juice at the time we asked...it was absolutely amazing!!! The other night we stayed at the regular tower, and still had amazing service and a super nice room.ROOMS: Expect spotless rooms, as clean as can be. Marble floors and counter tops int he bathroom, shower, etc. Safety box, coffee machine, spacious and modern rooms. Do not stay at the old tower, the one without the view, because those rooms are old and not very well taken care of (they are chepaer, but not by much). ON SITE ATTRACTIONS AND SERVICES: excellent on site restaurants and next door to Sanborn's, a great local place for magainzes, pharmacy, and a wonderful restaurant that offers traditional mexican food. Back to the hotel, their bar is awesome, with live music and shows alomost every night. the lobby at this hotel is splendid, all marble and beautiful. Great on site shops, althgough very pricey. Did not get to see the pool. Free showe shining service for guests in lobby. Overall, i feel at home in this place...and for someone who grew up in Mexico City and has been away for nine years, i think it says a lot. GREAT hotel! i will always stay at this hotel when i go back to mexico city.
