{"text":"Amazing hotel Rooms are amazing - high ceilings and decorated in a 15C style. The bathroom was enormous. Breakfast was good - cheese, bread, cereals, fruit - the normal european hotel breakie. Very close to all the sites - walking distance. It is on a busy road, so best to try and get a room on a higher level. Our room faced the road (with the windows closed the sound is very muffled, except for the odd occasion) however in walking around the hotel we came across other rooms that looked out into internal patios which would be better - one room looked like it had its own balcony - that would of been great!Internet is expensive at the hotel - best to use the numerous internet places near the hotel. The hotel staff organised a personal wine tour for us - great recommendation and well organised. Reception also booked tickets for us for the academia with no problems.Whilst we were there they had 2 different ladies on reception - their service was exceptional. On one occassion there was a man, who wasn't very personable - a bit abrupt and rude. However the rest of the staff were great - especially the 2 other ladies on reception. This hotel is decorated beautifully and is such a nice haven to return to after the busy pace of florence. We really liked this hotel and would recommend staying there - if we ever go back to Florence, it will be to stay here again.
