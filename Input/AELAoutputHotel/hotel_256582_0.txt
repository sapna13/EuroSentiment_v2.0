{"text":"Perfect spot We arrived at Medina Harbourside on Christmas day - our family that live in Sydney had organised lunch and as the apartment had a full kitchen they came to us. On checking in we were advised our room would not be available till 2.00pm we were shocked as we had been advised we would beable to check straight in. We then advised of all the food we had with us and the two behind the counter advised they could store it in the kitchen at the restuarant next door. We were very disappointed on prompting again I asked could they not check with house keeping I then got a flat no it wont be ready and you cant check in! It was Xmas day for goodness sake could there not be some compation and a bit of friendlyness. When the gentle man was on the phone the younger man on the desk could see our prediciment and picked up the phone then came back with you room is ready we were so appreciative we beleive that the first gentleman had the 2.00pm rule in his head and would not budge that was disappointing. The young man then organised a trolley and helped us unload the car of luggage and food and took it up for us. After that experience we were rapt we were in a back unit on 3rd floor, so no views but the double glazing did the trick no noise at all and also was cooler with the sun off the room for most of the day. The house keeping was ok and the room was done every day with light clean. We were there for 9 days and got a couple of full cleans in that time. The position of the Medina is fantastic and New Years Eve was a easy 1 minute walk to watch the fire works. We only had one other gripe the swipe cards were very sencetive an often did not work. We definately will be staying there again. ","annotations":[]}
