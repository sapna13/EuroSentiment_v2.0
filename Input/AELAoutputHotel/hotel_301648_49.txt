{"text":"Lovely setting and good service We stayed 4 nights at the Alila and found it excellent.I do agree about its distance from ubud. However the shuttle is convenient and it is easy to find transport back to the resort if needed.We had a superior room with a nice view. The room was big enough and the shower in the bathroom fantastic. I do not know how many times a member staff entered our room in the evening: to turn down the bed, light a candle and mosquito coil on the balcony, bring some biscuits. We saw staff going from room to room several times..We had a free 3 1\/2 hours nature walk and lunch included in our package starting at 8am (worth $60\/person). We walked through the countriside stopping at a farmer's house for coffee and fruits, walked down to the Ayung river and back through paddy fields to a bale for a very early but wonderful lunch. That was very romantic overlooking the terraced fields.There are also other trails from the hotel.The Alila restaurant offers excellent but pricey food with very good service. We had one late big lunch in Ubud and skipped dinner and also a full day out with lunch with Dean. Breahfast on the terrace is very well cooked and plentiful and served at the table rather than a buffet which is nice.The pool is indeed wonderful. The hotel was not that busy so we did not have any problems to get a lounger but some guests who arrived later were not so lucky. This could be an issue if the hotel is full. A nice touch was a tray with two wet towels, two glasses of iced water and a water spray for when it gets too hot.A short walk out of the lights of the hotel in the evening and the paddy fields become magic with fireflies flying around and croacking frogs.A troup of monkeys gives some entertainment during the day and there are also lots of birds to spot.The Spa was too expensive and not very busy as the staff sometimes wondered around to remind the guests of their services.An heaven to come back to after a day of sightseeing and\/or shopping.
