{"text":"Loved It! After much deliberation, I booked this hotel for my husband and I for a 5 day stay.It left me torn between this and the Four Seasons. I enjoyed the decor and ambience of the Mandarin so much. Views were incredible. We were in a Hudson River view room and it was lovely. The washroom met and exceeded my expectations and this was my biggest concern after staying at the Four Seasons. Truly everything about the room was perfect and I cannot fault. From the cleaning, to turn down, I loved coming back to it and enjoyed being in it which is saying a lot for a hotel room. Public areas over the top in terms of decor and views. Service in the Lobby Lounge was awful as stated in previous reviews but you kind of let it go when you're just so happy to be there enjoying the view.It's a bit of a nuisance having to take two sets of elevators to get up to your room, but again you get over it - fast. The elevators are very efficient and smooth.We found the doormen, front desk, concierge staff all outstanding. We were offered rides in the hotel cars on a number of occasions.The spa was insanely expensive and I do mean insanely expensive, but the most luxurious spa I've ever been to - oddly the reception staff at the spa were not great in terms of service or competence. Would I do it again? No, I think I'd spend the four figures on dinner somewhere or a new handbag. Glad I tried it though.When booking the hotel and getting confirmations of same I was a little worried - things seemed somewhat unclear and disorganized, but when dealing directly with the hotel and concierge we were extremely happy on every level.My personal preference for location was the FS in terms of shopping on Madison etc., but if you enjoy the mall below the Mandarin then it would be the perfect place to stay - also it's very convenient to the subway if that is a priority. In summary, the FS washrooms are probably a bit better, but not by much, the room decor and ambience of the Mandarin was better in my opinion (not bigger - but better). Location is a personal preference. Service is almost as good as the FS, but as i said it's easy to overlook the shortcomings when you're happy on so many other levels. Give it a try! I would absolutely go back.
