{"text":"A very pleasant stay Me and my Mom went to the Layne in June 2008 and stayed there for 4 days. It is very central-located, just 10-15 min walk from Union Square and Market Street and just 5 min from the bus stop. As soon as we arrived the first thing our taxi driver told us, was not to go right down the hill, but only left. Well, in fact, we discovered that on the right side there were a lot of poor and homeless people and also drug addicts. But just don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go there alone late at night and you will have no problems. Our stuff in the room was always still there when we came back and it was also very quiet, at night too (remember we stayed there during the Gay-Pride Weekend!). As soon as we entered our room we recognized a little muffy smell, but after two days with opened window it was gone. Our room was cleaned every day and they gave us always new towels and soaps. There was a refrigerator, a microwave, an iron and a hair-dryer and also cable tv, although we were so tired every night, that we just fell asleep in our beds!. The beds are in fact very comfortable, however the bed cover smelled a bit. There was always hot water in the shower, but it came not so much water down from it. Anyway, the hotel staff was very very friendly, explained us the ways to get to the various parts of the city and always gave us two cups of coffee or two donuts for breakfast, if we asked for it. The elevator is one of the old ones, with the grate, but it worked and was very characteristic. So, in conclusion, our stay at the Layne was satisfactory, especially if you consider the price and the fact that it is very close the the centre of S.F. I would recommend it to young people that want a place value for money while they visit the city, but also to families, couples or older people that content themselves with not so much, but that appreciate friendly and kind people at the front desk. My mother and I were very satisfied with the Layne!
