{"text":"Best location in Waikiki; City View = Partial Ocean View We went to Oahu in mid-October (which I think is the best time of year to go). Park Shore's location is awesome because it's close to everything Waikiki, yet away from being surrounded by tall buildings and city noise. It's at the end of all the Waikiki hotels, on a corner, across from the beach and Kapiolani Park and Honolulu Zoo. We arrived way early and the staff was able to hold our luggage in a storage room until our room was ready. The same happened at check-out because our flight was late at night. The staff also let us use the hotel restrooms if we needed to change our clothes. An ABC store, restaurant, and Starbucks are all at the hotel. We requested a City View room, and got a partial view of the ocean (I think all the rooms have some sort of ocean view). However, the room is pretty small (I heard about 260 sq ft), but it was enough for all of us (3) because we spent most of our time outdoors. So don't stay here if you want a big room. You'll probably end up making some lame review complaining about how small it was and say that you checked out early and went to another hotel (ha!). The room had two small closets, coffee maker (with free Hawaiian coffee), small fridge, cable TV, a Lanai, safe, iron w\/board, hairdryer, and a shower\/tub. It was the best value for the little money we had. We'll definitely stay at Park Shore again when we come back to Waikiki. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that this hotel has free surfboard storage, short or long. Very important for the surfer(s) in your family.Oahu Tips: Rent a car if you're gonna explore the island, like the North Shore or the Windward side. If you use the bus, you'll be wasting your time at the stops. Using the bus is ok only if you're gonna stay just in the Waikiki\/Honolulu area. You must try Malasadas (Portuguese doughnuts) at Leonard's on Kapahulu (try the Haupia cream-filled ones, they're awesome!). Also, on Kapahulu is the Rainbow Drive-In restaurant. They have a bunch of Hawaiian plate lunches to choose from and they're very generous with their food. Their LocoMoco is soooo good. Also, when you're in the North Shore, you must eat at Mackey's Shrimp Truck and try one of their delicious shrimp plates. The shrimp are huge (they catch it fresh from the North Shore) and they are really generous with their food. Also, try LL's in Haleiwa. They are really really generous with their plate lunches. Try the Deluxe Spam Musubi at any 7-eleven for a really good quick snack (sorry, I'm a food person). Bring insect repellent; the mosquitos here bite hard and you'll be itching for days. Go to Shark's Cove in the North Shore for good snorkeling and Turtle Beach to see sea turtles upclose (you gotta climb the rocks and go to the tide pools to check them out). Lastly, you gotta go to the Farmer's Market at Kapiolani Community College on Saturday to sample a lot of different Hawaiian flavors, like Guava Butter (yum!).
