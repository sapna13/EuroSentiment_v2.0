{"text":"Faultless I have stayed in several 5* hotels arond the world, but this is a class above anything that I have experienced bafore. From the second you are met in the arrivals hall you are entering into the world of the Peninsula: the operation is so slick it could not be improved upon. We were escorted to the awaiting Rolls Royce for the transfer (excellent value at around √ä√£¬¢50) and treated like royalty. There was no waiting and every person who I was passed onto greeted me by my name. Good afternnoon Mr Jones. As the car came to a halt outside the hotel, the door was immediately opened. Just excellent.The remainder of the stay was accompanied with the same excellent service. The room was excellent. Quite frankly I can find no fault. Even if you are not staying at the hotel I would recommend a visit for afternoon tea. And take the time to visit the loo where the attendant turns the taps on for you and passes you a pressed linnen towel to dry your hands.I had my 42nd birthday whilst I was staying in the hotel. Imagine my surprise when I returned to the room in the afternoon to find a birthday card and cake from the hotel. It was not asked for, they just did it.The return to the airport was equally efficient and slick. I was taken to the airline desk where the hotel staff assisted with the check in and thereafter along to the passport control where we parted.I could go on with supurlatives, but what is the point? It was just faultless.
