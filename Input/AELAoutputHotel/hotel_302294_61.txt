{"text":"Perfect for business travel; also great for leisure stay I stayed at Pan Paicific for 6 nights on a business trip. The hotel stay is by far my best lodging experience while traveling for work!Location - right in the center of the pricy colonial district. It's great for both business\/leisure. It's got indoor walkway through a shopping mall to suntec center, so you won't even be exposed to the tropical humidity. Orchard Road (for shopping, not that there's not enough shopping within walking distance of the hotel), is only a brief bus\/subway\/cab ride away.Room - tastefully decorated in neutral tone. Bathroom has separate shower\/bath. Bath tub is generously sized, I used it every night. The room has central light control, very much like any 4+ star hotel rooms in Asia (Japan, HK, Taiwan). Nice audio\/visual capabilities w\/ the flat screen TV and wireless internet ready. Food - I had room service about 4 times during my stay for both breakfast and dinner. The eggs benedict is one of the best I've had. Didn't have a chance to try the restaurants, but I dare say they probably measure up to the rest of the hotel services well. Amenities - large outdoor pool, which never got busy during my stay there (I had a direct view of the pool from my room). Service - extremely efficient front desk and concierge, no compliants whatsoever!Overall, I just wish that the 5 star hotels in the US could be as nice as Pan Pacific! Tips - Singapore is such an easy country to travel to. There's great shopping and food all around town. Many travel books suggest a day trip to the Sentosa Island. I did just that. However, I don't recommend at all, unless you've kids (even then, there are better attractions on the mainland). The island is full of man made attractions. I was not impressed with anything at all. You'd be disappointed if you're a nature lover or want a taste of the south east asia.
