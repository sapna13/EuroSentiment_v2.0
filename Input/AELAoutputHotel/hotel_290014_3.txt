{"text":"Easy to find by car and a good touring base We stayed at the San Gallo Palace primarily because of its location in Florence. If you intend touring by car in the Tuscany area the hotel is a great base as it is very easy to locate, particularly with a sat nav, and offers secure parking for √à√\u2020√ü?0\/day. We originally selected a Triple Room but altered our booking to a Junior Suite for a slightly higher rate. The suite provided more than enough room for us and our 16 yr old daughter. We had a large bedroom, she had a comfortable sofa bed in the lounge which was as big as a normal hotel room. The bathroom was spacious and we also had use of a small balcony at the front of the hotel to enjoy the morning sunshine. The breakfast area is very pleasant particularly if you manage to obtain one of the outdoor tables. All of the front desk and breakfast staff are very helpful and friendly. Because of its location there is a slightly long but not unpleasant walk into the city centre. This brings you past some of the main museums including the one containing Michaelangelo's statue of David. Driving for the uninitiated in the centre of Florence is not to be recommended, parking is impossible to find, some of the streets are narrow and cluttered with parked mopeds, scooters etc. Taxis are very easliy arranged from the hotel reception and any of the restaurants. You will receive a ticket for a designated taxi that will arrive  take you to your destination a lot quicker than you might anticipate or like!!.We managed to see some of the main sights in Florence and in the surrounding areas. Siena, San Gimignano, Pisa, Lucca are all within driving distance. If we return to Florence we will definitely stay here again.
