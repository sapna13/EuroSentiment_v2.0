{"text":"Party of four loved the Alessandra We just returned from our two week Holiday Italiano. Part of it was a four night stay at the Hotel Alessandra in Florence. I had read all about the hotel on its website--which is excellent. And I had read the reviews on Trip Advisor. There were four of us (we had booked two rooms--one large room, #21, overlooking the Arno, and another large room, #16, on the other side of the hotel and this room had a view of the top of the Duomo) and we all really loved the Alessandra. Andrea, the manager\/owner, was a huge help. From the first email I sent him, months before our trip, to the last email I sent him, just days before we left for the holiday, he answered all of them immediately. When we arrived in Florence at the Alessandra, he checked us in, showed us to our rooms, made sure everything was to our satisfaction, and went over the details of the arrangements that we had asked him to make for us. These arrangements included making reservations for the Accademia (David) to bypass the long lines. Andrea also arranged a car and driver for us four for a 9 hour tour of Tuscany. The driver picked us up a few steps from the hotel's front door at 9 in the morning and dropped us off in the same spot about 6.15 in the evening. I had mentioned to Andrea that we wanted to see Montepulciano, Pienza, and Volterra. The driver alread had the day planned with this exact itinerary. The only detail to be decided was how long to spend in each village. (We would recommend the most time in Montepulciano. It was wonderful--the perfect Tuscan town. Pienza was a bit of a disappointment. If you go, get a sandwich, some wine, and walk behind the buildings on the right as you walk through the main entrance to Pienza for your picnic and some really fine Tuscan views! The drive to Volterra was incredible!!! And the views, once you get there, are totally awesome.) Ok, I got a bit carried away describing this day trip! Back to reviewing the hotel. (I just wanted to show that Andrea arranged the day exactly as I had asked.) As I said, the rooms were huge, the hotel's location is wonderful--just steps to the Ponte Vecchio, the breakfast is delicious, and the staff--from Andrea to the evening staff who got ice for our drinks before dinner and gave us directions to a supermarket--were all uniformly attentive and helpful and nice. A quick recommendation for a restaurant just steps from the hotel's front door: IL BOCCALE. Large menu, good food, and a staff so welcoming that you immediately feel like family. So, if you are planning a Florence holiday, we would all highly recommend a stay at the Hotel Alessandra.
