{"text":"Not bad Stayed there for 4 nights in July. The hotel is pretty close the the city central and is about a block away from Metro and Tram stops, not to mention about 5 minute walk from one of the cool Town Squares in Amsterdam. We got a pretty decent rate of 99 Euros a night( 141 Euros for the weekends), which isn't bad for Amsterdam since hotels that close into town seem to be pricey. The hotel was clean and easily accessible. But dont get it mistaken, it is a no frills hotel. The walls are very thin so I was woken every morning by the sounds of the staff cleaning in the hallways. This was usually between 10 and 10:30 so if you don't sleep in late, its not a problem. The beds were nicely designed, but were very hard and I had a bit of trouble sleeping on them. Not a deal breaker but should be noted. The bathrooms very very compact but surprisingly since they were designed so well, you didn't notice.The breakfast, well, it was included and it was pretty bad. I am usually not picky with eating, especially when its free, but to put it bluntly, I only ate there once and then bought breakfast from then on at outdoor restaurants.There is Internet access but you have to pay for a pre-paid card.staff was nice and accommodating and they even corrected a problem on my bill without argument. They made it worth it. Also the cleaning of the rooms was great as well.All in all, I would stay there again if i had to but I would probably shop around for a little different experience first ","annotations":[]}
