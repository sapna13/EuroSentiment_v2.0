{"text":"Loved this old hotel that has some smart touches and tries extra hard! We recently had a 4-night stay at the Chancellor and it was one of our best hotel stays ever! First, as a family of four, we knew we are not the ideal customer for the Chancellor, which only has small queen or twin\/twin combination rooms. But the location, service, parking option, and price were right so we went for it. The central location just off Union Square and on the cable car line is perfect.Our visit didn't get off on the great start because a really expensive two-bottle pack of wine (from our Sonoma Valley winery visit) was inadvertently left on the sidewalk outside. Matt apparently got everything except for the wine and we didn't notice until we were in the room. It was just as much our fault for not making sure we had everything before we headed up. Well, by the time we realized the wine was missing, somebody was probably already enjoying some great wine!With all that said, Matt was friendly, helpful and informative (and later apologetic about the wine). Check-in was very smooth. The hotel uses a parking garage a block over and, with the in-out privileges, it was very convenient whenever we needed to drive somewhere. Another nice thing is that the Chancellor lets you leave your car in front of the hotel while you check-in and get your stuff upstairs.As other reviewers have already pointed out (and we well knew), the rooms are on the small side and don't have AC. However, the high ceilings make the room feel bigger and the ceiling fan helps cool the room even though we were in SF during an unusually warm week. Despite the tight space, we packed our family of four in and still managed just fine. One unique thing about the Chancellor's rooms are that they each have a small walk-in closet. My 7 year old son liked sleeping on the closet floor so we all had enough room to sleep and get around! The beds were comfortable and we all slept well. The room had nice little touches like free candies, wi-fi access and an in-room safe. And unlike the vast majority of hotels who can't be bothered with it, they recycle! Also, we liked the fact that they only launder and replace towels that you place on the floor, and not all towels each day. On the downside, there was a step up into the bathroom that could pose a tripping hazard, the toilets are very loud (loud enough to be heard in adjacent rooms at night) and there was no refrigerator. Also, our third-floor room only had a view of the back of an adjacent building 10 feet away. We forgot to ask for a view. Oh well....What separates this hotel from the average is the exceptional staff and thoughtful touches around the hotel. Everyone we encountered was very helpful and friendly. Cookies, fresh fruit, coffee, iced tea and ice water were plentiful in the lobby\/bar area.We had breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Luques, several mornings, and we enjoyed the pancakes, waffles and french toast!Overall, it was a great stay!
