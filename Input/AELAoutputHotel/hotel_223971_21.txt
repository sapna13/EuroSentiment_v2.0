{"text":"Beautiful Complex - But Spread Out I had the opportunity to stay at the Marriott Complex down in Doral where the famous Blue Monster Golf Course is. The area is beautiful.Parking was a major hassle. If you valet it is done at the main lodge which is a couple of minutes from the outermost buildings. If you self-park it is a few more minutes of a walk, which is the Florida heat isn't too great.When you check in, take advantage of a bellman to take you to your room. My colleague and I attempted to find our building and it took 15 minutes in the dark because it was not easily accessible or clearly marked.The rooms were great and most opened out into a courtyard. Good beds and it was quite clean. Strangely you had to turn the AC down very low to get a workable temperature - not sure why. However, mine sat on 60 for most of the week.Area is beautiful and well landscaped. The hotel was easy to find and only about 10-12 minutes from the MIA. Just down the road is a McDonalds and Burger King for breakfast. And a little farther west is a Starbucks. The main building of the hotel has a coffee shop, but not as good as Starbucks.The exercise room is fairly big and nice. It is kind of hidden but once you go there once it is easy to find.I'd love to return to the hotel and golf, but I have a feeling the regular rate would be quite costly.
