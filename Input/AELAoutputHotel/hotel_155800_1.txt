{"text":"Great getaway We have stayed at this property over 20 times when it was a Wyndham. Since the new owners took over and made it more of a Miami vibe hotel we have stayed twice, and changes certainly have taken place. First off every single employee of this property rates between an 8 and 10. Frances, at the front desk rates an 11. She was always courteous, kind and welcoming. We have chosen to stay in the garden lanai, a separate building from the tower because it is quieter than the rooms in the main building. The room is larger with a balcony overlooking gorgeous vegetation. The down side is some of the rooms on the first floor have jacuzzis and if the guests want to, they can stay out on their balcony using the jazucci and the sound does travel (although I am certain that is not their intention). The restaurants in this hotel are fantastic and guests from other hotels come here to use the casino. The Palm (steak), Yamato (Japanese) and Brother Jimmy's BBQ on the roof are all fantastic. We went to Koco for dessert one night (they have their own pastry chef) which was more than fantastic. We tried eating there Friday night but they were having a private party. The pizza place is not New York Pizza, sadly. There is live music in the majestic lobby Thursday and Friday nights with people from the island coming in to dance. What fun to watch! Yvonne Ramos, the Front office Assistant manger, handled any of our inconveniences professionally and to our utmost satisfaction. The gym is state of the art. There were free yoga classes offerred outside between the hotel and the pool shed. We stayed a week and were sorry to leave. To all the workers and everyone we met at the El San Juan: Prospero Ano Nuevo.
