{"text":"Overpriced and Overated I have traveled with my family (wife and 2 kids) around South Asia for 2 weeks, and decided to spent the last 3 days in Singapore in a 'quality' hotel as a treat. -my mistake-We stayed in the 'Garden Wing' overlooking the pool. The room was large enough, but overall looked quite dated. phone didn't work properly (old) and had problems with lighting. (enterance light worked intermittantly and reading lamp needed replacing)Overall the food was average and when dining at the poolside, (x2) the food kept ariving without the sauces or dips. The pool was large and the kids loved it, however the contant noise from nearby construction sites gets on the nerves quickly.  The 'Line' was good, but not cheap. Best to eat out. Room Service - This was always slow, compared to all other hotels we stayed in. The longest wait was 1 hour for 2 kids meals ordered at 9pm. On one occasion I rang room service for a bucket of ice, only to be told they couldn't talk to me and would ring me back(!?!?) .This has never happened to me in any other hotel I have stayed in before. I contacted the front counter to express my annoyance\/amazement but was simply told the issue would be passed on to management. Room service finaly called back about 15 minutes later - no apologies or explanations.My advice to other travellers is stay somewhere else. At SG$550 per nite (++ taxes, fees etc) I feel this hotel is way overpriced for what it offers. Many other hotels in Singapore can provide better for around half the price.I chose this hotel based on reviewes from this site and others. Will be more sceptical in the future. ","annotations":[]}
