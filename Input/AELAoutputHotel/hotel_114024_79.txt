{"text":"Awesome hotel, excellent service My husband has some business to attend to and I opted to tag along. I had a choice of several hotels, and chose the Royal Hawaiian on a whim, as it looked so interesting on its website. After booking it, I then went onto Trip Advisor and read the reviews. Needless to say, I had serious second thoughts and was very hesitant to stay here. I am so glad we did as we had an excellent stay. First of all, Glenn at check-in is professional and courteous. He was a pleasure to work with. We were greeted with a fresh Lei and treated wonderfully. Our Starwood Preferred Card was not able to be found in the system, and Glenn got it fixed, with no hassle and a minimum of time. He then upgraded us to a beautiful suite on the 5th floor. We were in the OLD tower. It was fine. The rooms were large, well decorated and clean. The decor was superb. The bed was comfy. There was a fridge and complimentary water daily. AC was perfect, we had a garden and slight ocean view. Nightly turn-down and chocolates on the pillows. The bathroom was small, but how long is anyone in there, anyhow? Our suite had a huge living room and we could have hosted a party for 50 people and had more than enough space. The beach is just outside, and we had no problems getting a chair and umbrella every morning. There was no horrendous line or crowds like we read about. We got chair side drink service on the beach. There is a little snack bar with burgers, etc right there as well. The food was pricy, but it's pricy all over Waikiki. The driveway to the hotel and the hotel itself is an oasis in the middle of such a busy city. The hotel is just tucked away and secluded. Incredible gardens and large trees. very lush and green, open and just a beautiful place. Stores (Louis Vuitton, my fav) are right across the street. The concierge was helpful and found us some great restaurants. We also went on a dolphin excursion and whale watching on a big (20 person or so) pontoon boat and snorkeled with the dolphins. Was great and worth the money. We booked that excursion through all hawaii tours on line.They picked us up on time, had a fresh fish lunch, and we saw dolphins and whales. This was a wonderful hotel and we would absolutely come back again. There were not many kids (and we left ours at home!). But it was Jan and not school vacation time. This is a great hotel and don't let the other negative reviews scare you off.
