{"text":"beautiful european experience in NYC I recently returned from a amazing vacation over the last weekend in New York City. Part of the vacation was assisted by the fact that this was the best whether that New York is apparently had in the last three months.The best part of the vacation was our hotel, and we had upgraded to a king-sized standard room instead of the suite. This was slightly more expensive at $400 a night but certainly worth it. We have the best bathroom that I have ever seen in New York City at this hotel.We also had a convenient lunch while we were waiting for our room because we arrived a little bit early. They were very helpful and moved us up a couple of floors and also gave us a much better view so that directly out of our window was the Empire State building. However, we went on three tours while we were in New York City and let me tell you that everyone there on each of these tours feels that you really need to look at the Empire State building so I have pretty much seen it in every view the you can possibly see and likely have at least 50 to 60 pictures just because of the number of times that was mentioned and I much like a lemming feel the need to take a picture each and every time.The bedding is sumptuous, the room is very comfortable. the only thing I would have liked is that I would've greatly appreciated having free Internet access in the hotel room. There is no information on the hotel website to indicate whether or not the Internet is free or not however I have discovered that virtually all the hotels that I stay at that are in the $200-$400 price range never include free Internet. Oddly when I stay at hotels in the $50-$75 range they always include free Internet.I would recommend joining the membership club as well because of the expense of the hotel I have quite a substantial amount of points now with the membership club and will recommend everyone to join because it does enable you to have a late checkout and also provides you with two free drinks. Unfortunately by the time that they gave us the to free drinks we are he had a complete meal in a restaurant and we never got around to returning back to the restaurant and having another drink because of our entire vacation we were on the go.This is one of the top hotels I've ever stayed at including throughout Europe. In the room was standard size unlike most of the hotels I stay at in New York which are extremely small and I would highly recommend that you stay here for just about anything.
