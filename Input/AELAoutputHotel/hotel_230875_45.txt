{"text":"My most favorite place! My friend and I had just had a crazy 3 days in Paris and a serene couple days in Norwich...then we ended it with a big bang in Amsterdam....WOW! It is my new most favorite place ever! The hotel is in the best part of town...right on the side of the Red Light District and the coffee shops...I'll get to that later. We arrived at the Radisson and the room we had reserved wasn't ready, so they upgraded us to business class! NICE! By European standards, a large room with a large bathroom. But once again, we ran into the half shower door...something I'll never understand. The room was clean and comfortable. They had some normal tv during the downtime we all have to take when traveling abroad. We had a great view from our window. The street wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ noisy or busy...which is why is it such a gem...the next block down was were all the action started!Excited, we droped off our bags and go outside to look for a coffee shop and bingo...right there, The Rusland. Wow....what a great place, off the beaten path for most people, but right in front of our hotel for us...lucky us. :) Again, mellow, quaint and nice. We traveled everywhere around Amsterdam but between the best coffee shop and the hotel being there...that was our favorite place to be.As for the food, breakfast was included for us, it was great...cold and hot foods. As for dinner, I had a wonderful tuna steak...the best food I had since I had been on my trip.This is a great hotel and the people who work in it are just as pleasant and kind. When I go back Amsterdam, I will be going to the Radisson.
