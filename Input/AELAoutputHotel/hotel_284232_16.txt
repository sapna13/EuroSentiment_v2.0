{"text":"The worst i ever seen I would strongly recommend to any one reading theses reviews NOT to book here. In all my travels over the years to Amsterdam, this has got to be by far the worst hotel i have ever stayed in. Dirt and dusty are everywhere, the rooms are small, smelly, carpets stained and fraying at the edges, the curtains are disgusting. The bathroom was disgusting, and the glass is clear plain glass, so you have got blinds to pull for privacy, but only some !!! The room had not been cleaned since the last people checked out, there was used tissues on the floor, bedding was once white but now grey and full of holes. The mattress is as firm as a marshmallow!! The reception is as bad, stairs to rooms are filthy at best, fag ends all over, litter behind doors. We noticed that a young group of folk were also not happy with their room and were checking out, but they were getting charged for one night, even though they refused to stay. I noticed then that the staff are shocking, one guy in a suit was swearing at the young group and being very intimidating. The reception is always full of the  staffs family and friends, and make you very nervous when you walk through, they stop talking and watch you and carry on their conversation when you are walking away. As for helpful !!!! not in the least, we were waiting for a call from the airport regarding our baggage, they did call, just reception could not be bothered passing on the message. Hit them with a problem and they will blatantly walk away, as happened to me, i stood there unable to believe that they walked away!! and carried on their conversations. We stayed the one night, only because we could not get a refund for the whole stay, checked out the next morning after being told we would be refunded for the other two nights!!! We had to fight to get our refund after being offered it a few hours previous, then told they could not refund the payment to our card as they did not know how to!! and then told we can do it, but it will take a few weeks !!!! i was not prepared for that and eventually got a refund in cash, but i think it was only because of my size and stature or the fact that i had red mist decending and was about to rip the head off the manager( george) if he is the manager ? Take it from me , dont not even consider this hotel, how any one can give this place decent review is beyond me!!
