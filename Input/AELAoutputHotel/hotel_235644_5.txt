{"text":"Great Hotel and Location We stayed here for five nights. I went with my daughter and my sister and her two year old daughter. We had previously stayed at the Seqouia Lodge Hotel and enjoyed our stay apart from the endass walk to get to the restaurant or the reception from our room. Not wanting the same inconvenience we opted for the Disneyland Hotel this time.This was definitely a great choice! When we arrived there was no queue at reception (on our previous stay at Sequoia we had queued for 15 minutes) The room was great, really clean spacious and a cot already in place for my neice. We had a great restaurant for breakfast where the children met up with different Disney Characters daily. The only negative was the fact that we felt slightly abandoned at breakfast with no-one asking if everything was okay or if we wanted hot water or tea instead of the coffee on the table.The hotel is literally ten metres from the park turnstile entrance which was brilliant, when my neice fell asleep we nipped back to the hotel and then out again when she awoke.The character buffet in the evening was great (if a little pricey at 50 euros per adult) but there was a constant stream of Characters to our table and no pressure to eat and leave. I would definitely recommend the half board option. Check out was a breeze and we were escorted to our coach when it arrived to take us to the airport.All in all a great holiday and a super hotel with friendly and helpful staff!
