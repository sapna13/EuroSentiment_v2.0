{"text":"Elegant Argon I have stayed twice at the Argon Opera, and was so impressed I shall be returning later this month for a three-night stay. What I liked was its superb location; so close to the U-bahn and the bus stops. Even a walk down the K'Dam, to the Kaiser Wilhelm Church, can be done comfortably in less than half an hour. For homeward-bound travellers, the bus to Tegel stops right across the road from the hotel. Even a taxi ride is not too expensive, say 15 to 20 Euros at most. There is a nice beer garden (in good weather anyway) on Lietzenburger Strasse about 10 minutes walk away, and a visit to the nearby indoor shopping centre, I think it's called KuDam Allee, is always interesting. It contains the Story of Berlin Museum, loads of great shops, including one that sells model trains, cars, buses and trucks, and a variety of bars, everyone welcoming and where reasonably priced beer is on sale. Sports fans will like one in particular, as it has screens all around the place showing the latest football matches. Travelling a bit further, a short U-bahn ride from Adenaur Platz (three minutes walk from the Argon) will take you to Charlottenburg S-bahn station from where regular trains wil take you to the Zoo Station and on into old east Berlin. The other way you can travel out to Potsdam, which is always an interesting day out, or to the Olympic Stadium where last year's World Cup Final was played.
