{"text":"Fantastic, Relaxing weeklong visit Stayed here a week in June, for the Red Sox series in Phoenix and just a girls getaway weekend. We had a great and very relaxing stay at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs.I wasn't expecting much, after the registration clerk who checked me in very late Wednesday night was not very friendly or informative, but everything was great thereafter. It is a bit overwhelming at first, seeing the layout and many buildings that are mostly up on the hillside, but the very friendly bellman gave me a map and directions to my room, and I found it with ease.THE SUITES:-All rooms are two room suites: a living room area with wetbar, bedroom, and bathroom with a separated sink area. There was also a balcony with chairs\/table to enjoy the view.-The beds were very comfortable, the regular Hilton Serenity bedding type.-The room was very clean, as were the linens and towels. The towels were also a bit more substantial that a standard hotel bath towel.-Bathrobes provided for your use during stay.-Plenty of closet space and drawers to unpack your belongings.-Fairly soundproof: I didn't hear much noise from the adjacent suites, except one evening when a child was crying fairly loud.-Drawback, is that there is no in-room safe for storing belongings.RECREATION:-7 pools total: the large Falls Water Village, which featured two pools, waterfalls, activities, etc., as well as smaller\/quieter pools scattered throughout the property. The smaller pools had nice padded lounge chairs, which were a plus.-Ability to reserve a poolside cabana at the Falls Water Village. At around $50 for the day, well worth it. It was sometimes difficult to find enough shade at the regular chairs. The cabana gets you two padded lounge chairs, table and chairs, ceiling fan, mini-fridge and TV.-Poolside service at the Falls Water Village, including food and a full bar. Just raise the flag on your lounge chair and they will stop by for your order. Someone will also come by about once an hour and provide you with an ice cold towel to cool down.DINING:-Enjoyed a late lunch at the Pointe in Tyme restaurant. The service was excellent, and although we ordered only sandwiches and french fries, they were really excellent.-Had room service a couple of times: typical of hotel room service. The menu was similar to Pointe in Tyme, and the food was good, but not as great as it was at the restaurant. They were very prompt, and after waiting only 35 minutes for dinner one evening, the called to offer apologies and brought complimentary dessert (which was excellent!)-Food ordered poolside is provided by the Cascades. It was OK(since I didn't need to leave my cabana), but I've had much better. However the margaritas are excellent.-Coffee, lattes, breakfast pastries and fruit are offered all day in the gift shop. Nice to stop in for a quick latte or snack.-I didn't get an opportunity to try The Cantina: tried one evening, but despite seeing several empty tables, was informed by the hostess that it would be a 45 minute wait. OTHER:Service- The front desk staff and the concierge were not particularly friendly or helpful. The rest of the staff: waiters, bellman, bartenders, etc., were very accomodating.Location- Easy to find, about a 15 minute drive from Sky Harbor airport. Not much within walking distance given the size of the resort, so you will likely need a car to get anywhere outside the resort. There is a Starbucks within a 1\/2 mile of the resort entrance, and Scottsdale is an easy drive for finding dining and shopping options.Housekeeping-They did a great job each day, and were quiet while they went about it. I slept in every morning, and wasn't awoken by the sounds of nearby rooms being cleaned.Parking-Not enough parking at the buildings up on the hills. Each building easily had 20-30 Suites, but only 6-8 parking spaces. Since everything is on hills, it can be quite a hike up to your suite if you have parked nearer the main building. View-I paid extra for an upgraded view ($5 based on availability via the hotel's website). I think in some cases, the view from a standard room's balcony would literally be of the back of another building.Business-Just a quick note, since on my last review of a Hilton I noted that their internet charges were excessive, this Hilton also charges for internet use in the room, or $0.49\/minute in the business center BUT at least this Hilton lets you print boarding passes for free.Overall - my friend and I really enjoyed our stay at the Pointe Hilton. It was just right for a girls weekend away. If I visit the area again, I will certainly consider staying at this resort.
