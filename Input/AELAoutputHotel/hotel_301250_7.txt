{"text":"Fantastic place -- cerulean Was in Tokyo for 3 nights for business. Our Japanese colleagues has suggested Cerulean and, after reading the tripadvisor reviews, we decided to accept their suggestion.Based on what I'd read here, I asked if there were any corner rooms available when I checked in. The man at the desk offered me a much more expensive corner room. I declined, as it would have increased the rate from 3500Yen to 5000 -- too much for my company's blood (and I was traveling with the boss).The main at the desk then thought about it and said, Will you be coming to Tokyo frequently? I said, Oh yes.He said, You seem like you know a lot about the hotel. [True -- thanks to Tripadvisor reviews!] How about you join the Cerulean guest club (for 500Yen = $5) and I give you a free upgrade to a corner room?Since I was staying three nights, this was the best $5 I ever spent at a hotel!The hotel room was exceptional. The view overlooking Shibuya is tremendous. I could see the mobs of people crossing the big intersection 32 stories above and off in the distance. Very cool.Our group ate at the Mediterranean restaurant one night. I wouldn't recommend it. The food was ok, but incredibly expensive. The beer was $10 for a small glass. I had a shrimp risotto that was tasty, but small portions. The menu is also quite small.The staff was very friendly. I enjoyed the view from the bathtub and there were plenty of nearby shopping and restaurants so it was a fun place to take a walk.The breakfast in the lobby restaurant was pretty good. Not a huge selection, but enough to fill us up. If you want something lighter, walk to the Starbucks not far away.The Shibuya train station is almost directly across the street, so that is a major convenience too if you will be doing any train traveling in Tokyo.If I make it back to Tokyo, Cerulean would be on the top of my list.
