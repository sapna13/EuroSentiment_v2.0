{"text":"All I can say is EXCELLENTE! We just returned and Secrets Excelllence was absolutely wonderful. We booked our trip about a year in advance and I began reading the reviews about 6 months ago. I was seriously considering changing destinations based on some of the reviews but I'm so glad I didn't.The hotel is clean and well maintained. The staff works very hard to keep everything looking nice and as everyone has said the pool is outstanding.We upgraded to the Excellence Club upon arrival and I'm glad we did. Otherwise we wouldn't have had the opportunity to meet Maria who works in the Excellence Club. She provided us with outstanding service and always brightened our day with an Hola, waving at us from the balcony.We had a lovely room with no bugs (I had taken spray to kill them just in case.) The housekeeping staff did a great job. Our bar was stocked well, we got a call every afternoon to see if we needed or wanted anything and if we did it was there in 5 minutes. We had nightly turn down service with lovely flowers and towel art each day.No, all of the food is not great but most of it was. We were able to make reservations for a couple of the restaurants and the tables were waiting for us with appetizers and wine already set up when we arrived. I was extremely impressed with the service we received.All in all our experience was great. I don't know if it was because we tried to leave adequate tips or not but one thing I noticed was that other people didn't seem to tip alot. Just because the resort is all inclusive does not means tips are included. All of the staff works very hard to make sure the guests have an enjoyable time so why wouldn't you tip them well. If you went out to a good restaurant in the states you'd leave 15% to 20% of the bill so we tried to put a value on the meal and tipped accordingly. Like I said they all work very hard and put in long hours and deserve to be recognized. I hope to be able to return to Secrets again in the not too distant future. It was a wonderful place.P.S. We took the helicopter between the hotel and airport and it was fabulous!Only negatives are the rough sea if you want to do ocean activities and the music in the dance club.
