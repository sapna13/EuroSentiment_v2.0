{"text":"Elegant hotel behind the Sorbonne We stayed at Le Jardin de Cluny for 3 nights, and enjoyed it very much. The hotel is generally in good shape and spotlessly clean, and the rooms are very elegantly furnished (we had a deluxe room). The service was good and the reception staff friendly and helpful. Everything in the room and in the hotel (the parts of it that we saw) was well maintained and worked well. Except for the bathroom door in the room, that was made of transparent, white glass and touched the bathroom floor (when the light in the bathroom is on at night, the whole room is lit up).The hotel tries to keep a green profile by inviting the guests to sort their garbage, and some of the food served for breakfast was ecological.Wi-fi internet was included in our room rate, and worked fine.The room was very quiet, no noise from the street or from other rooms. However, sounds from outside the hotel room door was easily heard (and vice versa). Breakfast buffet was very good and served in an atmospheric cellar- like room in the basement. At 14 euros it was more or less worth the cost (in particular if you arrive late and make it a brunch). The hotel is conveniently located in a quiet street 5-10 min walking distance from Place St Michel. The neighbourhood in the other direction (around Maubert Mutualit√ã√\u2022√ñ M√ã√\u2022√ñtro) is quieter and far more local and Parisian, with several good food shops and eating places, and a small morning food market.
