{"text":"Location, Location, Location.............! Booked this hotel via the Internet as we had already won the free flights. I had never been to Amsterdam before so wasn't really sure location wise what I was booking.As it happened, this hotel couldn't be in a better location, right on the corner of Dam Square and Damrak, the main road to the station and for restaurants. It was fantastic. We had a room on the 4th floor with juliet balconies on the windows overlooking Dam Square, couldn't have asked for better. The staff were very, very helpful and even when we requested a late check out, they sorted it no problem with no charge, even though it stated in the hotel guide an extra charge would be made. The rooms were quite small but more than adequate for a long weekend. The air-con was somewhat efficient, but as the weather was boiling outside, was quite welcome! The beds were very comfy and the bathroom was more than good enough. The hotel didn't have a bar, although there was a public restaurant downstairs, the food looked quite expensive. We used the minibar for any drinks\/snacks we wanted, wasn't too expensive like the rest of Amsterdam, 3eur for a beer for example.Amsterdam itself is a fantastic place, with more than enough to see and do. We took a trip round the canals and went to various odd museums you won't find anywhere else. The red light district is also a must see!!There are 300 'coffee shops' around, so the place has a very distinct smell wherever go!!! The best place we found was The Grasshopper and 2 min walk from the hotel with a bar upstairs and a coffee shop downstairs and had a wonderful outside terrace where you could drink or smoke or do both if required!!!!I can't wait to go back and would definately stay at the same hotel again and would recommend it to anyone.Everyone is so friendly ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1589,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1583},{"endOffset":1589,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1583}]}
