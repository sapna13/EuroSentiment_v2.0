{"text":"I love it I was in Grand Bahia Principe from Oct 17-24 , 2008 with my husband  little daughter . We really had a great time and absolutely love it .The Resort is beautiful, clean  huge. Our check in  check out was Breeze. All staffs are friendly and helpful.The food is good, in buffet you will find lots of different foods with good quality  taste. We were in Japanese, French  Mexican Restaurant. The outstanding was Japanese , we love the food  service . French restaurant was terrible; it took almost 1 hour  half to get our food. My daughter got so sleepy and tired of too much waiting, we ignore the desert  ate our food so fast. We heard such this complain from some other people as well.The Mexican Restaurant was awesome too . Good welcome drink, tasty appetizer  great food. .Most of the people were happy of Garden Grill  Steak house too .Bu we could go only 3 restaurant per week and we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try those one .There is a buffet at the beach too , even though the food was almost same everyday but No complain .We spent most of our time at main swimming pool  beach which has lots of activities  Entertainment and you never notice how the time fly .I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ describe the Beach, you must see . it is just beautiful with lots of chairs and white sand . The Ocean was as blue as the sky . we did lots of swimming and enjoyed a lot .We thought we will have lots of rain , but one time andtook only 5 min shower . the other time was around 11 pm with heavy rain . Other days was sunshine and beautiful .There are lot of bars everywhere with tasty cocktails . Even thought the international drinks wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ included, but their domestic drinks was good though .The room was clean , air conditioner was working well . The mini bars was always full of water , coke  beer .We heard Punta Cana is a high risk of Malaria , so that all us took prevention pills , but in this resort you hardly see any mosquitoes . I saw a small truck do spray all over the resort every afternoon .The entertainment at night was great , it starts at 8 45 pm with lots of game in the main Theater , then at 9 45- 10 45 pm you will see the shows . I loved Circus  Michael Jackson , others was perfect too.Then you can go to Band live music from 11 -12 pm with lots of dancing in outside stage , they will serve you with lots of drink and there is a snack bar as well .From 12-2 am you can go to disco or Casino .In third days of our arrival , my daughter (she is 6 years ) burn her hand . She wanted to take pancake in the buffet and the dish was so hot , her skin was pilled off completely . We run into the clinic , the doctor did a perfect job .he cleaned up and did the bandage , he advised a shot injection to prevent infection and apply Anibiotique cream .. My daughter couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go swimming for 2 days and was a disaster for her. However she had great time with lots of activities around the Pool and not to get bored at all . The management feel guilty about this accident, and thought they shouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ put such a hot dish so close or they should put a note as a √à√\u2020\u2022?Hot cautious √à√\u2020\u2022?.They sent us fruit basket to our room every day with Balloon√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ decoration to make my daughter happy. they called two times per day to see how is she which was so nice from them  .The customer service manager  the resort manger were so nice and helpful too .I will send my special √à√\u2020\u2022?Hello √à√\u2020\u2022?to them .they tried their best to make our vacation wonderful and they did .It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Ü almost one month after this accident, her hand didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get any infection and today it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hardly to see the scar , thank God .Overall , we absolutely are happy of this resort and would come back again ( I wish I could back NOW ) .
