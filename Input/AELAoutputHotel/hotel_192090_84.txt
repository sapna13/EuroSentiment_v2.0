{"text":"Even better than the reviews say! I planned my first trip to London for months, researching hotels with great care. We stayed in Parkcity Hotel our last night in London only because the first few nights my 16 year old niece and I wanted a more central location to see the Trooping of the Colour festivities. Parkcity is a little out of the way of central London, but you can take a cab in for about 10 GBP or take the subway.Parkcity was everything the great reviews say and more. First, it was the most immaculately clean hotel I have ever stayed in. From the moment you enter the bright lobby you are impressed by the sense of perfect order and high standards.We were greeted warmly by front desk staff who speedily checked us in. An elegantly dressed young man took our luggage and escorted us to our rooms, taking time to point out the features of each room and showing us how to use the TV. Even the elevator was exceptional, very modern with a voice system announcing the floor you are going to.I had chosen a superior king room and it was huge by UK standards and large by American standards. It was on 2nd floor and had a big bay window area with lovely drapes I could open to reveal a pleasing view of the residential street in front of the hotel. Bed was the most comfortable I ever slept in with a lovely soft duvet cover. Excellent minibar and also mineral water provided bedside. Flat screen TV was great and easy to use.The bathroom was as incredibly clean as everything else with a big rain shower, large tub and nice toiletries. The towels were big and very soft! Had continential breakfast delivered -- no butter was provided but otherwise excellent. Even little details like the light switches -- unusually designed small metal switches so you could control all the lighting from your bed -- were delightful.One little quibble was that when we asked the front desk to call us a taxi to take us to Horse Guards, they called a private car instead without letting us know in advance. This was more expensive than a regular cab would have been. It was comfortable, with a knowledgeable driver, classical music playing, and newspapers provided for us during the drive. But if you want a cab, be sure to tell them clearly you want a regular public taxi, not the private car unless you want to pay more.We booked online for the nonrefundable discount rate too which was a terrific deal. I would return to the Parkcity in an instant and recommend it to everyone.
