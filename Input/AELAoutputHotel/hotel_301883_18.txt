{"text":"Service Excellence Having stayed in many other luxury (5+ star) resorts around the world including Vanuatu, Tahiti, Hawaii, Australia (Noosa, Hayman Island, etc), I have to rate this on par with some of the world's best in terms of service.The negatives exhibited by some others here are all easily addressed if you speak to someone. For example, if you don't like your villa, ask to be moved and your issues will be resolved if there is availability. We made sure that our special requirements were communicated ahead of time and checked that the communication got through despite our travel agents confirming them. Moral of the story is - if its special, you make sure the job is done right.The Good: Service (exemplary) - they remember your name even if you call them several days after you have checked out!!!, architecture\/scenery (lush green like you are in a forest), remoteness (doesn't get quieter\/more remote than this in a luxury resort in Bali), in-room cleanliness (no dust even on the mosquito nets!!! and no geckos got into our room - that is an achievement in itself if you know Bali), room facilities (love the large bathroom), hotel facilities including bar and restaurant - the food is some of the best in Bali which you can experience in a hotel\/resort.The Bad: Buggy wait times can vary depending on how busy they are, Spa experience isn't the best but still acceptable, restaurant service can fluctuate (they took away our forks when there was still a plate of danish pastry sitting there expecting us to eat with our fingers I guess).Overall, the bad wasn't enough for us to say we won't be returning to this place. In fact, we plan to come back here whenever Ubud is on our travel agenda.Our other destination resort was the Bulgari. Service there is no match for the Four Seasons Sayan. Period.I would recommend that if you are coming to Bali, you make the Four Seasons Sayan your first stop. This is because its about an hour\/hour and a half from the airport and its better if you go there then come back to a resort\/hotel nearer the city\/airport when you are close to your return trip.
