{"text":"Vacation fro Hel I recently returned from the Sirenis Tropical in punta Cana. It is a long drive from the airport, over an hour. We arrived at 9:30pm local time. Upon my arrival they had screwed up the room reservations for a few of us arriving. They scurried us off to the buffet to eat before it closed at 10pm and assured us that the rooms would be straightened out by our return. The luggage was left in thier care and they assured us it would be watched by them. Mine was watched so well that my passport was taken. They were no help even though they could see I was visablely upset. The representative did nothing as well the next morning. After 3 days of worrying and no help from the hotel or the tour operator I cancelled my passport via a conference call from my home number in Canada. I had spent numberous calls over these 3 days talking with the Canadian Consulate and the passport office. I can't and don't have time to go into great detail my negative experience with this hotel and the Nolitours reps. People I was travelling with also had thier room key, safe key and money taken from thier beach bag while there as well. Besides loosing these they were charged 30 US for the safe to be opened and 20US for the loss of the room key including what was taken. They also tried to double charge me for a service when I was checking out. I have been to the Dominican Republic 6 times and although I love the people there I doubt I will ever return. I definately will never use this tour operator again or will I ever go to this resort again. If you're going there don't leave any of your stuff in the care of the hotel staff or do not leave it unattended while you go in the pool or ocean and think twice about using a different tour operator as the ones at the Sirenes Tropical are of no help.
