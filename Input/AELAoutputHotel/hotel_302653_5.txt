{"text":"Fourth time in three years! Recently returned from our fourth holiday in three years at the Melia Bali in Nusa Dua and felt I had to write a review.My partner and I have been holidaying in Bali at least once a year for over 8 years; we used to stay in Sanur but changed to Nusa Dua and the Melia Bali three years ago. We have always enjoyed the facilities and the fantastic gardens at this hotel. This year however, the hotel excelled themselves; we were upgraded to a de-luxe room on the 3rd floor, provided with a de-humidifier (necessary) and a bunch of flowers for my partner. We were also given a card giving us access to all of the Garden Villa facilities (separate breakfast dining room, afternoon tea etc).For anyone who is interested, I had two suits made (and three shirts) in Nusa Dua and I have to say they were of very high quality and value! I used Rezky tailors which are just around the first left turn after you leave the main gates going out of the Nusa Dua hotel complex. The suits worked out at √ä√£¬¢75 each!We also used the same spa we have used on each of our visits the spa Sekar Jagat (google bali massage) - who will pick up and drop off from the hotels and are a fraction of the hotel prices.All in all, we will continue to visit Bali every year and will be happy to stay at the Meli Bali, all the time their standards are so high!
