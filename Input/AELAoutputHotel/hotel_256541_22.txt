{"text":"Great Location Four Points I stayed here for a work trip (included one weekend). The location is terrific (similar to what other raters have posted). The hotel is walking distance to many sightseeing attractions (as well as the business district). In Darling Harbor there are many restaurants all around the perimeter of the water.Note, right now they do not have internet access (high speed) in the rooms on floors 4 and below so if you want a room with in-room internet access (that you have to pay for either hourly or for the day) you will need to request a room on floors 5 and above. There is free wireless access from the lobby though. Concierge was very helpful--got us 4th row tickets to the opera with only 2 days' lead time. The bellhop at the hotel recommended not using the Airport Connector bus (there are other bus services that will service the Four Points to\/from the airport). He said they were not very reliable and my friend had that experience--she bought a round-trip bus ticket when she first arrived in Sydney and took the bus to the Four Points hotel. She called to make her reservation to head back to the airport the day before her trip. They never showed up! Another alternative is to take the train from the airport to the Town Hall stop and then walk to the hotel--not bad with light luggage. The train was very quick (15 min). Overall, I would stay there again for leisure or business. ","annotations":[]}
