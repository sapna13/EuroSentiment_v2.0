{"text":"RIDICULOUS!!! WOW I just came back from my trip to Puerto Rico...it was my first time and definitely will not be my last. This hotel is SICKKKK...it's definitely for young couples or singles. I stood here for a long weekend and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this hotel. Let me start by mentioning their hospitality...the minute we arrived the gentlemen at the door asked us our names and throughout the stay they would always say to my boyfriend, Hey Alex How is everything?. No matter what any of the employees were doing they would always stop and say hi, they were definitely on top of their game.The Room: I knew my trip was going to be a blast the minute we checked into our room. Our view of the beach was just flawless. The bathroom, yes was small but I wasn't planning on spending my vacation in there...it was spotless and that means more to me than anything else. There's an Ipod Dock that allows you to place your ipod and play music...That was my favorite part b\/c I got to listen to my tunes the whole weekend. Overall the room was amazing.The Food: We went to a couple of restaurants that were amazing. Levi's which is on Ave. Isla Verde was realllly good..it's located about 10 minutes (driving) as if you're heading to the Condado..if you go you must try the Mofongo (smashed green plantains)..one of the best! There's also 'La Casita' just a couple of blocks away that was cheap and excellent. Every morning and afternoon that we would pass by the restaurant there was a long line, so we knew then and there that we had to try it. The massage: It was my birthday and my boyfriend called the hotel in advance to book an hour massage for me. The hotel contracts the services of this young lady named Karen Lugo. This massage was like no other. It was the most spiritual massage I've ever had...she's a body healer and you can feel all the negative energy you have inside just release your body as she massages you. The massage took place on the second floor balcony of the hotel..it was surreal to look up and see the turqoise water as I was getting this amazing massage done. YOU MUST YOU MUST GET A MASSAGE...her phone number is (787)635-1440 or email her at bodyhealer@hotmail.com....TRUST ME you will love this!Activities: There plenty to do around there. For starters, the hotel has a lounge called 'Wet' on the roof, which also has a pool that yes is small but it's really nice if you want to just lay out in one of their white beds and soak up some sun. At night a lot of people visit the loung upstairs because the view of the island is amazing from up there. There's also El San Juan Hotel (ESJ)...the minute you enter the lobby of that hotel there's people dancing because of the salsa band that plays there at night. It was very crowded and a mix crowd of young and older people They have a really nice casino as well. And of course, you must go and visit El Viejo San Juan (Old San Juan), it's just mesmerizing beyond words. We spent a whole day just walking the beautiful streets...it was just so romantic.Altogether I have to say I've never had a vacation so flawless as this one. DO NOT THINK ABOUT IT TWICE..BOOK IT! Trust me you won't regret it!
