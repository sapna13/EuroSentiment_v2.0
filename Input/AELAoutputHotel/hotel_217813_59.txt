{"text":"Convenient, clean hotel with good service We stayed here for 5 nights (June 10-14) in 2008. The room was ready upon arrival and was very clean. We called ahead to ask for a room along the north face of the hotel as this would give us a view out towards the bay. When we got there we were told they really didn't reserve rooms in spots just details like King bed or non-smoking. So our view was just another wall of the hotel. Other than that, the staff was extremely nice and I realize that everyone would want that view so I guess it's just the luck of the draw.  The complimentary breakfast was pretty good. They had cinnamon rolls, bananas, bagels, various cereals, bread for toast, bacon or sausage (seemed to alternate), biscuits, gravy, milk and various juices. There may have been more but we can't remember. The food was good (not great). And the crowds were generally not too bad except for Saturday morning.  The room wasn't large but it was fine for what we wanted. Just a place to relax between excursions around San Francisco. It was very clean and had a decent decor for a regular hotel. The staff was always friendly and willing to answer any questions we had.  We considered it an excellent deal for the price we got off Hotwire as the location near Fisherman's Wharf was the best feature of the hotel. A quick walk to several attractions made our sightseeing easier. We didn't rent a car because so many forms of public transportation are within a couple of blocks from the hotel. The selection of television channels were pretty sparse but we didn't spend tons of time in the room aside from showering and sleeping so that didn't bother us too much. I would suggest trying to find a deal online if you can. We saw a guy walk in off the street and they were asking $239.00 for the one room they had.
