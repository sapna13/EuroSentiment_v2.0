{"text":"Loved the Jazz!! My husband and I just returned from a long weekend in Paris celebrating our anniversary and stayed at the Hotel d'Aubusson. We had a wonderful experience!! The minute we arrived we were greeted with a smile and very prompt and professional service. The staff at the hotel were very courteous and helpful with all of our requests. The hotel provides jazz in the Cafe Laurent 6 nights a week and it is fabulous! We travel extensively in the states and in Europe and I was very happy with our decision to stay at this hotel. The excellent location, service, breakfast, jazz and size of our room were perfect for a quick weekend get-away! We had a superior room near the elevator and I was worried that we would hear a lot of noise but it was extremely quiet. We loved the large windows that opened up to rue Dauphine where you could hear all the action going on outside but when we closed the windows it was absolutely sound proof! The area around the hotel includes many great little shops, cafes and chocolate boutiques! We had dinner at the trendy Alain Ducasse restaurant Spoon, close to the Champs-Elysees and also Guy Savoy's Les Bouquinistes, located very close to the hotel. We also went to the chic hot spot Le Cafe Marly at the Louvre for the best people watching! I would highly recommend all three restaurants but definitely make reservations for Fri\/Sat evenings. It's hard to come back to reality after such an incredible trip to Paris but we will return to the Hotel d'Aubusson soon!
