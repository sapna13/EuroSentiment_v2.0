{"text":"it's ALL about the convenience We booked a one night stay at the Sheraton Frankfurt airport as we were working our way home to Toronto Canada from Venice Italy via Frankfurt and needed an overnight stop between flights.VIsibility and Signage for the hotel inside the airport is non-existent (at least, we didn't see any). An airport employee gave us directions or I'm not sure how we would have found the hotel. Figuring out how to access the hotel from the main terminal wasn't so simple either. There are two bridges but we required an escalator to get from the baggage claim level of the terminal to the check-in level of the hotel. For 3 people with 7 suitcases, this was not so simple! There is a lift accessible inside the terminal for one of the 2 bridges but we didn't see this (or know of it) on our arrival and on check-out the following morning, the lift was out of order.We had booked a superior family room which was very large and had a king and 2 twin beds. Mattresses and pillows were very comfortable. An extra blanket would have been appreciated by my teenage daughter but was nowhere to be found and it was late at night so we didn't bother trying to call for one. Bathroom was equally large with separate tub and enclosed shower, lots of little bottles of shampoos, etc., and an adequate supply of good quality towels. The coffee maker was well stocked with coffee, tea, cappucino, and hot chocolate supplies.We had dinner in the main restaurant as it was late and we were tired and disinterested in making our way back inside the terminal. The meal was good but very costly at 150 euro for 3 people (only one of whom had wine with the meal). We had starters and entrees, no dessert and no coffee. Definitely a high price for the convenience factor and few willing to pay it as the restaurant was large, silent, and all but empty.The hotel itself is a little strange, lots of large open industrial areas, no warmth whatsoever to the interior of the building. Front desk staff were polite and efficient. Internet access is priced at an extortionate rate so we didn't use it. Many hotels offer free or inexpensive internet access to clients; this hotel is not one of them. Overall, the Sheraton served its purpose which was to give us convenient access to a good night's sleep between an evening arrival and a morning departure. 500 euro for the room and dinner, not inexpensive by a long shot, but it got the job done.
