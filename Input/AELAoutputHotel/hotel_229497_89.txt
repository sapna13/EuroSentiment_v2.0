{"text":"We Will Never Go Back A mix of bad luck and bad hotel services turned our stay at the Renaissance into a nightmare. It was a bad omen when we had to walk to the hotel from the train station as it was too close for any cab driver to take us. The front desk was staffed by an inexperienced trainee who had major difficulties finding our reservation. The room was OK, but rather dark and the halls were dirty, lined with room service trays that had not been picked up. The worst feature was the lack of an in-room safe which is peculiar given that Amsterdam is a dangerous place in terms of theft of personal property. To that end, we had a carry bag stolen that night while we dined outdoors, and without an in-room safe, we were left to carry our passports on our person forcing us to spend half a day at the US consulate getting new passports ($200 later). We also lost a camera and diabetic supplies.The next day, we used the safe deposit boxes at the front desk for what was left of our valuables. Later that day, when we went to retrieve some personal items, we find that the front desk clerk neglected to give us a key to the box. Instead, she left it in an envelope with our room number in an empty break room. Luckily, nothing was missing.Even though the Marriott site says there is a fitness center at the hotel, the fitness facility actually is not part of the hotel itself and has a hefty premium charge. Not even the priciest Marriotts in New York have that fee attached for health club access.The last oddity was our ride to the airport. The concierge arranged it with a shuttle service advertised in the lobby, but we were taken instead by a private cab. That caused us to wonder just what√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ going on at that place!
