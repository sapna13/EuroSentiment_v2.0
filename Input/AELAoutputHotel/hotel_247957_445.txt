{"text":"Uneven for an Occidental Grand We just returned from a week long vacation at the Occidental Grand Flamenco (a key word- see below to know why) and had a pretty good time, but the experience was not NEARLY as good as the one we had at an Occidental in Mexico. We had two rooms booked for ouselves and three kids ages 8-12. On arrival we were upgraded to a two bedroom suite. Not bad, but the upkeep needs work. There was a hole in the sliding glass door that was 1inch by 6 inches, air conditioner dripped condensation on the floors, and no weather stripping (the cause of the break undoubtedly) in most of the sliding glass doors, causing them to rattle alarmingly (this is plate glass, not safety glass- if it broke you could be badly hurt). I wedged them with wads of paper to keep them secure and informed the desk- who did nothing about any of these things the whole week. The beach is beautiful beyond compare, but prepare for the 400 meter relay race for chairs in the shade- there are none after 7:00 am. I don't know why but seemingly people stake out the chairs (possibly after bars close) so you've got to really hustle to get one if you are a melanin challenged northerner who can't take a lot of sun. People just leave their stuff there unoccupied - sometimes almost all day. Pool by the beach is losing stucco- needs work. Food was also uneven. The Oriental and Mexican are great, the buffet and Italian are ok , and the Grill was awful-hockey puck meat! The Pizza is terrific- woodburning pizza oven- the best. When we arrived my husband met somone from an Apple tour who said 40 of 80 on their tour got the dominican trots so we avoided fresh fruit and vegetables. We did ok, and lots of others seemed to eat it- so I don't know- I'd still bring the antidiarrheal stuff. There are mosquito's- bring bug spray. Activities are a bit limited and there isn't a lot of staff to guest ratio, so they do their best. Went on two trips Catalina Island and Altos de Chavon- both spectacular- but we only got 20 minutes at Altos de chavon and the River boat got stuck and we had to climb off. Horseback ride on the beach is amazing! My husband went on afree shopping bus trip to a nearly empty mall and got stuck because he didn't use Flamenco as the name and went to Allegro- a twelve dollar cab ride back the turned to 15 after his return. All in all we had a good enough time, but I didn't feel it was on a par with other hotels in the chain.
