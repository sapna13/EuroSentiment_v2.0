{"text":"Truly A 5 Star Resort And Number 1 In The Dominican Republic!!! My boyfriend and I visited the Bahia Principe Punta Cana resort from aug. 26th to sept. 1st of 2007. We both travel a lot and had been to the Dominican Republic in the past. As a result of our previous experiences, we were skeptical about what to expect. However, as soon as we arrived at the hotel we were immediatly charmed by the professionalism of the staff and the beauty of the surroundings. The check-in was quick and we were brought to our room right away. I must say that we were also quite impressed with the cleanliness of the room and of the hotel in general. It is spotless and beautiful. The beach is gorgeous and the ocean is a delight to swim in. My boyfriend and I were pleased by the lay out of the resort, which also comprises the Bahia Principe Bavaro resort. The property is just big enough as we enjoy taking long walks, and for those who don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like walking as much, it also offers a continuous shuttle service. Throughout our stay, we got to eat at several √ã√ë√∏ la carte restaurants as well as at the buffet. When it comes to the food at all-inclusive resorts, we usually expect the worst but surprinsingly, we were more than happy with the quality and variety of the meals served. Although we enjoyed all of our meals, our favorite √ã√ë√∏ la carte restaurant was the italian one. We both had pasta and pizza and thought them to be quite good! One thing that we really appreciated about the Bahia Principe is that the crowd was mainly families and couples. Never did we come across drunks screaming and making fools of themselves. During our previous stays in Punta Cana, we had experienced different hotels and although they had 5 stars ratings, they were not half as good as the Bahia Principe is. The food was never up to standard and the people were loud and classless. Staying at the Bahia Principe Resort definitely reconciliated us with the idea that Punta Cana can be a wonderful travel destination. It is definitely nicer and more updated than other resorts such as the Majestic Colonial, the Iberostar Bavaro and the RIU.The standards of quality at the Bahia Principe Punta Cana are high and definitely meet the expectations one can have when staying at a 5 star category hotel. For us, The Bahia Principe Punta Cana resort is without any doubt, the number 1 resort in the Dominican Republic.
