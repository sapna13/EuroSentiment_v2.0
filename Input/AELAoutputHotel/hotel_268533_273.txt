{"text":"Mixed Feelings Having read the positive reviews on the Tripadvisor website, I had higher expectations about this hotel. Although the daily wine tasting (not so much wine tasting, more like free unlimited wine or beer) is a great opportunity to unwind after a busy day, the reception area was swamped daily with unruly children and dismissive parents. The locals also tend to use the facility! Not a great atmosphere to relax.The decor itself is tastefully done, bordering on gimmicky, and being a themed hotel is likely to attract youngsers and families. We had a problem with the room, having booked a deluxe room, we found the only available room overlooked the cannery courtyard with loud jazz music blaring out, and was next to a room containing a very yappy dog (beware this is a pet friendly hotel and the whole 3rd floor smells of dogs). We requested to move and were informed we could downgrade to an inward facing, quieter standard room, or pay $80 per night to upgrade to a bay view room. We decided to take the downgrade and the room was much quieter, apart from hearing next door's TV through the very thin walls all night. To compensate we were given free breakfast vouchers, worth about $30 a day.The location is great for the cable car stop, however is right on the edge of Fishermans Wharf and the walk to the main area in the dark can be a bit intimidating.If you're looking for grandeur or business-like facilities, definitely stay in one of the large chain hotels in the city.Otherwise, this hotel is suited for families, youngsters and people wanting to experience true San Francisco.
