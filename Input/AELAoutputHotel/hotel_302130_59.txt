{"text":"The Shang: a mid-life identity crisis Absolutely agree with the previous post. Nothing spectacular (except the view), I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know what the fuzz is all about.We stayed at the Deluxe Harbour view room for a couple of days. While the views are simply breathtaking, the room definitely has a style-mismatch. The Peninsula has the history and old-world charm; The Landmark MO is phenomenally contemporary: the beacon of style; The Mandarin has a deep root in Chinese tradition; The Island Shangri-La has nothing but a view that is similarly shared by the Conrad and JW Marriott. Everything about this hotel seemed pretentious. A European chandelier in the room doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ automatically give an old-world charm. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe got to earn it to deserve it like the Peninsula. Then comes the gigantic √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022√¶he Great Motherland of China√à√\u2020\u2022?painting on the atrium to exude a Chinese tradition. Next is the Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ TOO, which definitely has the best buffet in town and is furnished in a contemporary setting with blonde wood. By now you almost get the whole picture; it is a supermarket of style in one hotel. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ like having a mid life identity crisis.And the worst of all is the cheap room key. This is the second top hotels I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed (after the Grand Formosa Regent Taipei) that uses room key instead of electronic card in the defense to exude old-world charm, which stunned me as superficially shallow. Either the Shang doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have the budget to update the room key system (which I doubted so -considering how high they set their astronomical room rates) or simply shallow thinking that a traditional key holds the epitome of style. They don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ consider how hard it is to store the key that could easily get lost; doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ fit into the pocket and certainly not in your wallet. Yes we could have left it at the reception, but I rather not: seeing the fake smile and all the staff pretentiousness, I rather suffer the bulging in the pocket.Sure it has the view, but the InterContinental  Peninsula has better. Yes it is atop Pacific Place and MTR station, but the Four Seasons is better: atop the magnificent IFC Mall  Airport Express Station. Oh yeah, it has outdoor pool with view of the Bank of China Tower, but the Four Seasons has the world√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ best edgeless pool and view of the whole Kowloon for yourself. Fancy the electronic curtain and TV in the bathroom? The Peninsula has it too, but best of all The Landmark MO√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ L600 has 2 LCDs and an extra one in the 15sq.m bathroom with circular spa bath and diffused natural sunlight, and most importantly what Shangri-La doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have: style.Last but not the least, service that it has boasted and have people keep telling, which I did not encountered during my stay. A good concierge yet not as impeccable as the Four Seasons. A bellboy and porter who seemed hunger for tips; failed to deliver the luggages and upon calling to check, even asked me which ones were mine!. A particular female reception staff that was unsympathetic, almost robotic but certainly pretentious and snotty who greatly impacted the convenience of our stay. A fax machine that discreetly left messages, but the wrong one: a sudden message pass 10pm for a delivery of an envelope only to discover it was a reconfirmed business class ticket to Sydney of another guest on other room, which was clearly written on the envelope. Upon asking why this happened, the staff still claimed it was written my name. Surely not only they are pretentious, they are also blind. The only thing we enjoyed the most from the Shang was the sumptuous buffet we had at the Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ TOO. Other than that, you can count on what previous reviewer stated: √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠on√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be afraid to try somewhere else√à√\u2020\u2022? I once stayed at the low priced, highly-rated Langham Place that sits amidst the slumps of Mongkok, with only 1\/3 of the Shang rates, but the overall experience was far much better, even the service is outstanding: young, energetic and passionate from all the beautiful people.The highlight of my stay in HK this year is definitely at the Landmark MO which eclipses my previous excellent stay at the Four Seasons. But somehow I doubt that people who like the Shang will get accustomed to such panache.
