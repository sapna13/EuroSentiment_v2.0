{"text":"Recommended Stayed here for 6 nights while on holiday in April. Had an excellent room (#1705) - a deluxe queen with views of the park. We went through Expedia and paid around $300 but this was on a special deal. On arrival we were offered an upgrade to a junior suite for $100 extra per night which we declined. The staff were ultra-professional in every way.No problems with street noise and liked that we could open the windows. The candid traveler photos give an excellent idea of what the room is like - quite minimalist but clean, comfortable, good TV, iPod dock, Bose CD\/radio. The bathroom is amazing - large, has 2 windows, massive bathtub and shower, Molton Brown toiletries - a definite selling point. Fresh linen  towels were provided each day, and a bucket of ice in the evening. Location is ideal for tourists - easy to walk to Times Sq, 5th Av, ESB etc and subway station on the same block. You can get a great breakfast at Pax wholesome foods (right next to subway) for less than $10. We went to the hotel's Cellar Bar on Friday evening, it was quite fun but very loud, expensive and full of young 20-somethings going crazy. Didn't check out the hotel restaurant, but always seemed busy.Recommendations for eating\/drinking (ideal for both):'Cesca (relaxed Italian in the UWS, W 75th St, b\/w Amsterdam  Columbus)Kittichai (trendy Thai in the Village, Thompson St, b\/w Broome  Spring)Kemia (bohemian Moroccan in Hell's Kitchen, corner of 9th Ave  44th St )The Bar Room restaurant at MoMA was also excellent.
