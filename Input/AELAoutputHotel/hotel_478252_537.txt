{"text":"LOVED the Gran Bahia! We stayed at the Gran Bahia Principe from August 19 to August 26 in celebration of our 25th wedding anniversary. We booked the Gran Bahia based on reviews from friends and acquaintances. The resort greatly exceeded our expectations. The minute we arrived we were greeted by girls wearing traditional costumes, men playing the merengue and waiters bearing glasses of delicious fruit juice. What a way to start a vacation! Greetings of HOLA resonated throughout the spacious lobby putting all the travelers into an instant holiday mood which lasted the entire week. We upgraded to the Golden Club which allowed us to be checked in while we were enroute from the airport, so we were taken to our room immediately upon arrival. The rooms are gorgeous. They are neat and meticulously cleaned every day. The bathroom is spacious and very clean. We were nervous that there might be some insects in the rooms due to the country's location, but that was certainly not the case. Our mini-fridge was well stocked and became even more so after a tip to the maid of only $2. We usually left her $2 - $5 a day. We were very unsure as to the appropriate amount of money to tip, so we asked our tour guide and she assured us that we were being quite generous. Canadians are used to tipping 15% - 20%, so we thought $5 at the a la cartes was a little cheap, but she said it was quite the contrary. The wait staff at the restaurants were so very eager to please and accommodate. The people were always smiling and they tried their hardest to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Sometimes the language barrier was difficult, but since we were in their country and did not speak Spanish it would be very unfair to place the blame on them. We tried to learn a little Spanish, which was kind of fun, and after a few days we could communicate well enough with the locals. My wife is even considering taking Spanish lessons as she found the people so endearing and the language so lovely. The bar tenders on the beach and the entertainment staff by the pool\/beach were quite entertaining. They would break into song, dance the merengue with whomever was close by and bring a smile to all those around them. The mood they created was quite infectious. The beach is gorgeous, lots of white sand and turquoise waters. It was easy to get chairs and talapas; we never had a problem and we did not get to the beach until around 11 a.m. It was easy to spend 5-6 hours at the beach\/pool. The restaurant on the beach allowed you to take a break from all the lounging around and refuel for the next round. The nightly entertainment was fun and different every evening. Our villa was right on the oceanfront and the restaurants were close to the lobby at the far end of the resort. Most often we walked from our room to the restaurants, which took no more than 10 minutes. If we were too tired we took a shuttle bus. We had 5 a la carte dinners. We ate at the Garden Grill, the French, the Japanese, the Mediterrean, and the Italian restaurants. They were all great; my wife's favourite was the Japanese as you got to see the chef prepare your meal. We took a couple of day trips off the resort in order to see more of what the island has to offer. The Bavaro Runners was excellent. It is an outback safari trip throughout the Dominican Republic. It is an eye opener for those of us from developed countries...a definite must to help put things into perspective. We also took a marina tour which included snorkeling and swimming with stingrays (minus the stingers) and nurse sharks (herbivores). That was pretty exciting! There is not one thing my wife and I found lacking in our holiday. It was such a wonderful way to spend our 25th and will cherish those memories forever. For all of you planning a trip to Punta Cana you will greatly enjoy yourselves. For all of you planning on staying at the Gran Bahia Principe, please do not pay too much attention to anything negative you might read on other reviews. I have read them upon my return and cannot believe my eyes. I can only concur that some people are very unhappy and find little pleasure anywhere they go. Enjoy your vacation and be happy. Adios!
