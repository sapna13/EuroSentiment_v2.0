{"text":"Terrible Vacation! Wouldn't recommend! Maybe it's because we chose to book our vacation through Apple Vacations! Our number one mistake! I couldn't have imagined a worse vacation. The area of Punta Cana is absolutely beautiful and the people there are very friendly, as in the city. At the hotel, if you have a problem, except them to pretend they can't understand you, when most of all the employees can understand exactly what you are saying, but they forget when you have an issue. We got there and were suppose to have a king bed, we had a a room with two double beds pushed together with a large crack in the middle, not real great for your honeymoon! We were also suppose to have beach side, we received the side that faces the dumpsters and the back side of the street that you can walk down to go shopping, so not very impressive! The hotel remained farely clean, but if smoking bothers you then don't bother going to any shows, bingo, etc, because it's pretty bad. Then scheduling dinner can be really a chore. They say everything is inclusive, but you have to get up at 6:30 in the morning to go down and put your name on a list for an actual resturant or plan on eating the buffet every meal, and it was always the same food! Later come to find out, if you go with lots of American dollars and plan on throwing them around to get what you want, in a place that is suppose to be all inclusive, then you will get what you want, but you will be paying for it! We met several people down there who were wine and dined for 100 to 200 dollars a day. ","annotations":[]}
