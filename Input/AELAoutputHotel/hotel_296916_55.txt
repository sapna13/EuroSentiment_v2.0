{"text":"Fantastic in every way. This hotel is slightly expensive in comparison to other 3*'s but the service and quality of the hotel could easy make it a 4\/5*. We had a room that faced onto the internal coutryard. At first I was unhappy about this and was going to ask them to change it but then thought it may be less noisy then those that faced onto the main road. The hotel staff were great and couldn't do anything more for us. They recomended and booked us great restaurants. The pc's are not connected to a printer so they went on our airlines website and printed off our flight tickets rather then going to a net cafe. The bathroom was a good size but was lacking in supplies. There was no 2in1 shampoo and conditioner or body lotion, only shampoo and a shower gel which looked and smelt like fairy liquid. So i went and bought some supplies. I didnt try the breakfast or the bar. For breakfast i found a great bakery at the top of Ronda di Sant Antonio just off Placa de la Universitat. The shop underneath the hotel has some basics but the fresh stuff wasn't that great. The metro does run underneath the hotel and you can hear the rumble of the passing trains but if you are going to stay less then 300m from the metro then you have to expect it. Overall a great hotel with a great location. I will definitely be staying here on my next trip to Barcelona ","annotations":[]}
