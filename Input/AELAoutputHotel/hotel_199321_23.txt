{"text":"Excellent Value! We stayed for two nights in early January, and the hotel met our expectations. We contacted the hotel directly and stayed for E69 per night - a real deal, we thought.It was convenient to get to, fairly centrally located, the room was clean and comfortable, the breakfast was just fine for us, and we enjoyed our Binding beer when we arrived!We ate at the train station one afternoon, and there is a small grocery on the metro level where we purchased incidentals and snacks.We found the hotel staff to be pleasant. We were pretty tired after check-in and had a little difficulty figuring out the room key, but we finally got it.There is a second lift near the breakfast room which we used when the main lift took so long (we stayed on the 8th floor so stairs weren't too convenient).One evening when we returned to pick up our key from the front desk there was quite a wait. There was a large party checking in (about 15 people) and the staff was a bit frazzled. I tried to sneak in by the side, but ended up waiting about 20 minutes since the agent was unable to locate my key. Not a big deal, just had a cup of coffee and visited with my husband until the crowd was taken care of.We were just a 5 minute walk to the river, and strolled along the waterfront both nights. Lovely stay! It's a budget hotel that definitely offers a better-than-budget experience.Cheers,D ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1130},{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1130},{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1130}]}
