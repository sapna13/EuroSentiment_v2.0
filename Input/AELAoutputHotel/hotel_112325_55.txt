{"text":"Good hotel for the price, perfect central location We stayed at the Cartwright for 6 days at the end of August. The hotel is perfectly located for a holiday stay - a 5 minute walk from the BART stop from the airport, and directly off Union Square in the Downtown area. This was a huge positive for us and it's almost worth booking the hotel just for where it is. The room was small but neat, and with a large closet for storage. The bed was extremely comfortable! The bathroom was tiny but super clean with very fluffy towels and great toiletries from a local SF company. All in all, the room was fine for sleeping and getting ready in the morning.We were disappointed that there was no mini bar or fridge, although room temperature water was available (at $2.17 a bottle) alongside a coffee maker with Starbucks sachets. There was also no room safe. The street noise was noticeable at night, but that's the case in any major US city. None of these things really bothered us. There is a computer for free internet access and printing in the lobby which was good (although there was often a wait of around 10 minutes to get to use it).The breakfast wasn't brilliant - cereal in boxes which doubled as bowls, toast, apples and self-service waffles - but it was fine on the days we had an early start, and SF has so many great cafes that we were happy to wander around to look for a cafe for breakfast most mornings. The Cartwright is an absolute bargain if you want a central base from which to explore SF. The staff are friendly and helpful and the room is fairly basic but clean and comfortable. If you're travelling to SF as much for the hotel as for the city it's not the place to pick, but, for the price, it's a good 3-star with an excellent location.
