{"text":"Love to Lounge at the Nadia I will not be able to say enough about the hotel and the staff. Travelling from Nova Scotia, Canada, we arrived, and as advised, our bags were taken immediately to our awaiting room - 4th floor (top floor). We were greeted with a free non-alchohol beverage and very warm smiles. After a tour of the breakfast room, we were advised our room was ready. We were celebrating our 1st wedding anniversary and my husband casually mentioned this when booking the hotel, late in 2007. Though we didn't send a reminder, there was a fresh flower bouquet with a Happy Anniversary message from the Nadia. That was the first of many surprises.Our room was small, but the celings were very high, there was plenty of shelving and a closet. There was also an in room safe. The room was immaculately clean. Our bedspread had the most terrific message - Lounge. We had a balcony, which was a wonderful added touch -like another room altogether.The breakfast was a perfect start to the day - a variety of breads\/pastry and cheese - tea\/coffee\/orange juice. Lots of choice for spreads - loved the nutella and croissants - and the coffee - Wow!The in room fridge was put to good use as was the in room kettle and tea supplies.There was a very powerful fan, for any one who likes to partake in the greenery of Amsterdam - this worked well to keep our room smelling fresh.The bathoom was also extremely clean, and the shower was powerful and HOT! Just the way I like it. The cleaning staff was excellent, even calling our room to make sure everything was okay.The customer service desk was open 24 hrs\/day - with a buzz to get in rule, it is best to get a 24 hr hotel instead of one that will put a curfew on your evening out.Yes, it was rough to walk up four flights of stairs after a full day of walking but it was so satisfying to get up there and take a load off.I would recommend this hotel to any one who is able to handle the stairs. I must assume though, that a lot of the hotels in the area would have the same steep stairs.Thank you to the Nadia for helping to make our first visit to Amsterdam the best it could be. We miss you.
