{"text":"wonderful ocean Its like heaven the heat the sun the sand but not without its problems. We are a honeymoon couple who wanted the perfect time to round up a perfect wedding instead we were a bit disappointed. On the surface it looks like a very nice hotel what you would expect of thr Riu chain however there were alot of problems to our stay. First the air con in the complex is Very Very old we had to change rooms 4 times because it just didn't work (don't ask for high floor rooms as 4 floor and 3 floor are the worsed)Im not saying we didn't enjoy the stay at this hotel i must admit it has the best pool of all in the complex of Riu hotels it was the quiet one of the lot so if your wanting to relax and enjoy peace and quiet this is the one for you.Food was really good lots of choice and different things. the waiters can't do anough to help you, they remember your drinks and are very polite. If you can tip do cause it is very much appriciated by the staff.The beach is beautiful everything you can imagine and lovely to walk on, just a little hint if you don't like being contantly asked to do this water sporting things stay off the beach they are constantly asking to get there commission and they don't let up easily.The entertainment is on very late in the evening starting at 10.30+ which was a bit late for us and not at all worth the effort of going to see.If you are looking for a good value for money holiday with a beautiful area then this is a wonderful place to come for both lively and relaxing holidays unfortunately we did get very unlucky with our rooms and weren't happy with entertainment but we made it into a brilliant holiday dispite the problems best being armed with all the knowledge i would definately recommend this holiday to anyone but you need to know pros and cons of all the places you go to not everywhere is perfect weather was good but a bit in the air at times mind you think that is all over the world at the mo.i hope this helps people its honest and fair ","annotations":[]}
