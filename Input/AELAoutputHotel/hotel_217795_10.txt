{"text":"Constantly impressed, time after time!!! We have stayed at the Coast Gateway Seattle well over 2 dozen times since 2002 and have yet to be disappointed.We have found the staff to be friendly, accommodating and most helpful with special requests. With 4 children we must book 2 rooms to accommodate all the bodies and often stay on both ends of our flights (or Mariner games) just to get in a few extra moments of pampering. We cannot say enough about the kindness shown the children and ourselves. The desk staff are quick at check-in\/out and room service from the Sharps Roaster Ale House next door is always prompt.The beds are comfortable and the airport noise is practically non-existent. While the bathrooms themselves are on the small side, it functions for the intended purpose. The rooms are spacious, and when staying on the airport side the upper floors offer terrific views of the airport and hours of viewing pleasure if you like to people watch. The bathroom amenities are generous and the bath linens are satisfactory.The morning complimentary breakfast offers fresh made waffles w\/ your choice of toppings, yogurt, various breads  bagels, hard-boiled eggs, oatmeal, coffee, tea, a variety of juice options, milk, hot chocolate, apple cider and three choices of cereal. We always walk away more than satisfied and the children look forward to breakfast before flying out.The business center is well supplied and complimentary. Access is controlled by the front desk so there are no children in the way when you need to print tickets or check email. Computers are up to date.Although a pool\/ spa would be a nice addition, they offer a small fitness room that has limited equipment that is adequate to get a decent workout.The property offers airport shuttle service and while we have never waited more than 10 minutes to get the shuttle, we have begun to walk to and from the airport just to stretch our legs a little more. The airport doors are only a 7 minute walk away so the location is excellent for a little pre-flight fresh air.The Park and Fly lot is located at Masterpark Lot C, about 1mile north from the property. While it is a little bit of a hassle, the security and service of Masterpark is excellent and well worth the extra time and energy.We will continue to use the Coast Gateway as our primary Seattle area hotel. While we have on occasion stayed at other properties in Seattle, The Coast Gateway is the our preferred option and we have recommended this property to dozens of our family and friends and no one has been disappointed with many returning anytime they travel.
