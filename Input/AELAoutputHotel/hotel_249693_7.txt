{"text":"Exceeds the Gold Standard for Customer Serice I just returned from a quick business trip where I stayed at The Brentwood Inn. From beginning to end, Kanuja did everything she could to make my stay the best possible - checking me in early, offering refreshments when she learned that I hadn't had lunch, suggesting things to do, printing out my boarding pass, and being so polite. I even got a message saying that there had been a wake-up call request that they thought was left over from the previous guest. They cancelled it but asked that I call back if I still wanted the wake-up call.The room was clean, comfortable, and very 21st century with the plasma TV, remote control for HVAC, a two-alarm clock radio, and a high-tech system for preventing folks from leaving the lights on when leaving the room. I agree that the bathroom, at least in my room, was on the small side, but it was fine for the single traveler. Even the shower had its own ventilation system. Plus there were mirrors galore, and free high-speed Internet access in the room (they'll supply Ethernet cables if you don't have one).I really enjoyed the continental breakfast, especially since there was my favorite - oatmeal! The location was quiet and within walking distance of both nice neighborhoods where you can safely get some exercise and the farmers' market on Sunday mornings.Normally, I stay in the Westwood area, but I will definitely The Brentwood Inn to my list. This former motor lodge has been in the family for two decades, and they definitely know how to treat guests like royalty.
