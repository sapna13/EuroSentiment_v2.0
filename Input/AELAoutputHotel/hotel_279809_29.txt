{"text":"Not deluxe! We have just back ,we spent 2 weeks there.We read the comments and we're a little worried,but it was better what we're expected.Rooms1. we had to change our room twice,first it was not clean,second we wanted to be in building 4 or 5.( 4 is being refurbished).We slept in building 2 on our first night,it was average with lots of ants.2. We had been waiting for our other room in building 5 for 1 day.They told we will get a room there on the next day,later they were more specific,they said we can change at 17:30.Than they made a phone call there is a problem with the room,but give in building 3,ok.My partner went to see them and gave to them(him), a little tip and a miracle happened, we finally got our room in building 5.This room looks like an crime scene there were a lot splash all around the walls,our locker was broken etc...Room was average,bed very smelly,AC always leeking.We left some dollars to the maid every day,expected more care about us,but it was average ,not too much different.I think all the rooms are the same and does not matter which building,cos all of them are near to anything.Food:Food was ok,but not any special.After a couple of days really bored,the same food.But the taste is nice,Sometimes the cold food is warm ,the hot is cold etcThere are 3 rooms in the buffet but 1 is always closed :(1 for smokers,1 is for non smokers :) good pointYou have to wear shirt for dinner other time does not matter.Waiters if you need something get it yourself it works faster and better,but sometimes they can look after you well.A'la carte restaurant.ItalianWe tried 2x ,first i left very hungry cos the portion was very smallarea looks better,but the service :(They are not able to teke an order.Menu is crap,no starters and only pasta dishes,not all italian :(2nd time we stood up and just walked out,they could not cook our beef well done,they served our food after 5 min to placed the order ??? what is very quick,but when and how did they cook it??Pools Very nice and useful,but i never tried :)Beach10\/10 best beach on the area :)ShoppingGo to the beach turn left walk along for 5 min and yuo will see lots of boutiqs,be warned all wants your money.If they say 50 dollar it worths 5.Gym and spaGym is ok just wear sport shoes,clothes and take your towels...Spa for extra dollarsSumVery nice place eith lots of fun,good area.All the staff are very helpfull for some dollars :)Nobody makes favour ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1770,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":1765},{"endOffset":2330,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2326}]}
