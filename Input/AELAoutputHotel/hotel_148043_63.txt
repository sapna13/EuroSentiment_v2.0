{"text":"NIce stay in Old Town from a frequent traveler We stayed at the El Covento to experience the charm of Old San Juan (this hotel is not the place to stay if you want to relax by the pool or beach). However it is a lovely place to stay if you want to shop, eat and experience some history. A good place for couples. A great place for adults- I would not recommend bringing children. It was quiet and beautiful albeit somewhat expensive (an additional $90 in fees PER night for hotel tariff\/taxes in addtition to the nightly hotel rate when booking trhu the hotel website). Walking distance to many great restaurants, and the forts. There is a small but very nice hot tub on the roof with a beautiful view. The pool is TINY. You do have the ability to use one of the beaches in Isla Verde. There is a complimentary wine and cheese reception every evening which was very nice. If checking out at noon- i may recommend checking out a little early because there is somewhat of a crowd. My husband and I stayed here for a few days to experience the city and the restaurants and then moved to a beach resort to enjoy some surf and sun... (which is what i recommend doing if coming to san juan for the first time)Cons of the hotel: 1. Small pool2. I thought our tariff was slightly expensive (a little over 800$ for 2 nights) 3. Frazzled staff when checking out on Monday afternoon- come earlier than noon if you want to beat the line (however, staff was normally polite and helpful during the other parts of the stay)Restaurants in walking distance:-Marmalade- great food, atmosphere ($30 per entree)-DragonFly- small restaurant, but great food, service is only OK\/ sometimes rude on the weekends when it is exptremely busy at prime hours- but food makes up for it. may have long wait. (25$ per entree) -Aguaviva- great food, wonderful service ","annotations":[{"endOffset":659,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":655}]}
