{"text":"Great hotel in superb location! Having read all the Tripadvisor reviews for the Chancellor Hotel, my wife and I booked 4 nights for our first ever stay in San Francisco. Having read many good things and being particularly impressed with General manager Wes Tyler's responses on this site, I am pleased to say that the hotel lived up to all our expectations. We had a friendly welcome upon check-in by Steve, the guy who dealt with us and the process was quick and very efficient. He also gave us a map and told us to come to reception with any queries. I had made a request to Kevin Vossen prior to travel for one of their reburbished rooms on a high floor with a good view of Union Square and they were able to fulfil this request so thanks very much Kevin!! Brilliant view of Union Square day and night and the windows did a great job of blocking the noise out. The room was nicely decorated and clean. It was more than big enough for our needs and the bed was very comfy! Bathroom was clean and maybe a little small for some but we were happy with it. Having complimentary coffee and tea available (along with the cookies) is a really great idea and gives the guests so much freedom and free use of their computer for internet access is an added bonus. One of the best things about the hotel must be it's location to Union Square, the San Francisco centre and everything else. It's fantastic! We could spend all day sight seeing and then spend the evening shopping with it being so easily accessible! Union Square is also close to all the main transportation routes so is ideal as a base. We were originally going to stay on Fisherman's Wharf but upon visiting it are very glad that we didn't. Too touristy for our liking and a bit further out. Our recommendation is stay around the Union Square area, you won't regret it! So, to get back to it, we throughly enjoyed our trip to San Francisco and our stay at the Chancellor Hotel. San Francisco as a city is really great and our stay was made all the more better with us staying at the Chancellor Hotel. Well done Wes and co. keep up the good work! We may not be heading back to SF for a while yet but we hope that when we next return, the hotel will still be keeping up it's high standards and we'll be staying there once again! One last thing! A nice and thoughtful touch is to have an umbrella in the room closet for us to use - came in handy on our last full day when it absolutely rained all day!!!
