{"text":"relaxing and sunny, but will not go back, rude staff!!!!!! Airport: Expect to walk out of the plane and onto the runway strip. Once you walk into the airport there are people that will stop you to take a picture. You can purchase these pictures at the end of your stay in DR upon departure. You HAVE to pay $10 for entering DR. The line is very long for customs. We had a rude pickup transportation driver. This was the beginning of our bad trip...Upon arriving Melia, at check in there is a little posting with prices of upgrade for royal service and regular room rates. My friend and I decided to upgrade and skip all excursions. Upgrading is well worth the money for an extra $30\/night. We were told that they'll be a butler driving us to our restaurant every night and to the beach. The only service we got was housekeeping and Benjamin driving us back and forth whenever we saw him at the beach. Housekeeping and Benjamin was the best service we received at Melia besides the waiter at the French restaurant because we tipped the guy!!Restaurant: Hokkaido was good, it is a Japanese hibachi grill restaurant but on my first night at Melia the clock in our room was slow by an hr, without realizing this, the host at Hokkaido was not willing to accommodate my friend and i because she said we were late for our reservations and she was very rude. I mentioned this to the VIP Royal service desk and they were not nice about it. She just brushed us off!!! We were forced to go to Gabi restaurant at the Royal service and was bitten up with lots of mosquito bites!! The American Grill was good and so was the French restaurant. We didnt get a chance to try any other restaurants on the property.The lunch at the Royal Service side was by far much better than the Tropical buffet. Pool: There's always available lounge chairs at the Royal service pool area and never crowded in the pool. We did get a chance to walk over to the other pool. It's much larger with more people around the pool. Bring lots of sunscreen.Beach: The beach was pretty clean with the exceptions of occasional seaweed. I did see the people cleaning this up one afternoon. There's always security walking around the beach area. And like the Royal service pool area, the Royal service beach wasnt so crowded. The water is clear and strong waves. Even though we upgraded to royal service, we had a regular room that was only around the corner from the royal service pool and Gabi restaurant. The service sucks here!!! The hotel servers\/waiters will either be really nice to you or ignore you completely. I think some of them are racist. There was one couple sitting next to us one morning and the waiter refilled their cup of coffee and walked away ignoring our request for refill. The waiters at night is much more nice than the daytime staff. The VIP lounge has free internet, books to read, coffee\/tea\/drinks and snacks through the morning and night.Spa: I couldnt find the spa at Melia. The property is so huge that I spent an hour walking around looking for it. There are two spa at this resort I booked a Aromatherapy massage. It was ok but she spent most of the time lightly rubbing my back. I can tell you this for sure, NY spas are much more experienced!!Overall the resort was relaxing, weather was nice and food was good. We didnt get sick but do be careful, we did hear several guest getting sick during their stay. I would not recommend this resort to any friends unless you want a quick getaway from the city life and hang out at a resort. The staff and Dominicans are rude!!! No offense to some of you out there. I would return to this hotel if there's a deal. This is my first and last time I would go to DR. I understand why some of my friends refuses to visit DR after one trip. Beware of flies and mosquitoes. There are lots of them all around!!!!
