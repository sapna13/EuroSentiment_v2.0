{"text":"So nearly a great hotel We have just returned from a 6 night stay at the Grand Stanford that included the new year. We booked two club rooms with a harbour view for ourselves and our two sons based on previous complimentary tripadvisor reviews and a decent price.Our rooms wer both good with the promised harbour view. Decor is European in style. Not particularly modern but nice enough. Room sizes were fine and amenities good - although the lack of flat screen TV did give a dated feel. Our one complaint was that our room's bathroom smelled very badly of 'drainage'. We had seen this comment in previous reviews and based on our satisfaction with the view and the fact that the hotel was full, we didn't make too much of it. If you have the same problem, complain immediately. Our sons' room was odour free the whole stay.If you can afford it - club level is a must. The club lounge is very nice with superb views (especially at night). Food is good with hot  cold choices.You can easily substitute this array of snacks for one meal a day if you wish. Alcohol is also complimentary in the evenings and it is well worth having. Champagne, cocktails, or whatever you wish. All served with impeccable manners. A great end to a busy day.(If you still have energy after the club lounge closes, head to the downstairs bar to see the house band. They play most nights and are worth the price of an extra drink.)The hotel is a good compromise for price vs location. Not as good a view of the light display as the Shangri La or the other Intercontinental, but a view nevertheless. You can walk to the MTR station and just about to the Star ferry but why bother. Taxis are cheap and efficient. Around 20HKD (just over $2 USD) should get you to the ferry and 180HKD took us all the way to Repulse Bay on the other side of HK island). We recommend the Kowloon side. This area is pleasant and relatively spaciously laid out. You can walk in a straight line without the push  shove of the much more cramped HK island area (plus HK as viewed from Kowloon is much better than the other way around).On the downside - well, the smell and a hint of arrogance on our last day when we needed a late checkout. We got it but at a price - after 12 room\/nights at club prices, I thought we deserved a small reward.Would we recommend this hotel ?Absolutely. Just be aware. Would we recommend HK ? Yes again. It is a taste of what China could be with the safety net of western hotels, English spoken almost everywhere and streets safer than most European\/American cities .(By the way - if you have a long flight inbound, get the hotel to organise limo pick-up from the airport. Costs 650HKD but well worth it to get off to a good start.)
