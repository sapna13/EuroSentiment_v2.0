{"text":"Horizon Club is a disappointment Stayed at this hotel for four nights during March as a stop over whilst on holiday. Generally the hotel was fine, is large and has a lovely swimming pool. In terms of location it is a 20 minute walk to the nearest MRT station (Orchard) which may not sound like much, but after a long day walking around the tourist sites and the fact that we used the MRT again in the evenings to visit restaurants at Clarke Quay, I would say the location is not as good as some of the other hotels. The hotel does run a bus service at certain times during the day but preferred to walk than wait around for the bus.We paid extra to stay on the Horizon Club level which has always been very good in other Shangri-La hotels. My opinion is the Horizon Club at this hotel is not as good. We found the service to be slow. Evening cocktails and canap√ã√\u2022√ñs in the Horizon Club lounge was over crowded and therefore difficult to find a seat; during one evening I asked a female member of staff if I could sit where there was two empty glasses and was abruptly informed that a party was sitting there, with no offer of anywhere else to sit, so we sat in the internet room which wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ very enjoyable. On one morning, at breakfast (which is served at the Blu restaurant) we were shown to a table which had previously been used by another guest, as their crumbs were still on the table cloth.Overall good hotel but not sure I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° pay extra to stay at this Horizon Club. I also agree with TAMember1234√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ review on 3rd March, which I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ read until I returned. You don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem to get a better room if you stay on the Horizon Club floor. The bathroom does not have a separate shower.
