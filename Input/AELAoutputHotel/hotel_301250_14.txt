{"text":"Absolutely the best hotel experience I've ever had! Absolutely the best hotel experience I've ever had, bar none.I travel frequently for business, and my experience at this hotel surpassed that of any other stay. When you get to the higher-end hotels, the minute details are what make the difference, and there were no shortage of those here. Since everyone else has spoken in general terms about the hotel, here are a few of the details.I came back from my day and tossed the business cards from my briefcase on the desk. The next day, after I returned to my room, the business cards were sorted into piles, by company, and stacked in perfectly square piles next to each other. I left my pants crumbled up on the bed. They were perfectly folded when I returned. Rather than disturbing where my things were in the bathroom, they moved the hand towels to the other side of the counter top.Everyone wants perfection in a room but has to settle for second best. We all subconsciously accept defects in the room, like a handle that doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work right, a scratch on the counter, or a dent in the fridge. But there wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a single defect in the room that I could find, and the quality of construction was superb. The grout lines in the granite on the walls was so perfect, they were art. There were great details like the way the granite tile was rabbited where it came together, details that they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to do, but did. There were no scratches, dents, rips, smudges, in anything in the room. And the service was incredible. Others have described the quality of the staff. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l cite one example. My colleague and I were taking the 11:50 a.m. shuttle to the airport. We had been asked to be at the porter√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ desk by 11:40 a.m. I was running late packing and hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ yet checked out. At 11:38 a.m., the phone rang: √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢r. name, are you still planning on taking the 11:50 p.m. train to the airport.√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬µes I am.√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022√ä??ery well, you must hurry.√à√\u2020\u2022?I got down to the checkout desk at 11:42 a.m. Two people were waiting for me with my bill already pulled. While I checked the bill, a porter came to me and apologized, but she needed to take my suitcase to the bus. She handed me a tag and whisked it away. Another person apologized, explained to me that they would call us in just a few minutes and motioned for me to sit in the lobby. In one minute a woman came through the lobby with a sign saying √à√\u2020\u2022?1:50 p.m. Narita Bus√à√\u2020\u2022? I watched as simultaneously each bus passenger (ten or so people sprinkled about the lobby, intermixed with other people not waiting for the bus) was approached by a staff member and invited to follow the woman with the sign. The woman walked us to an escalator holding the sign and motioned us onto it. She then ran down the stairs next to the escalator (presumably out of respect), and directed us out to the bus. There was no way they could have made that experience better for me.I have many more examples about the quality, but you get the idea. Superb! ","annotations":[]}
