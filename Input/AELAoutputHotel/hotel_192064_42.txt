{"text":"Pampered Luxury My wife and I stayed at The Chesterfield in Mayfair earlier this month. We travelled down to London on the Friday evening and checked in late. Upon arrival the hotel staff were warm, friendly and extremely pleasant and efficient.Tired and with a big weekend ahead of us, it was important to us that we made the most of the weekend. We made good use ofroom service and again were impressed by the staff, not to mention the quality of the food.The room itself was well equiped and decorated nicely. Most things were catered for and compared with other similarly priced hotels in London, The Chesterfield offered a more spacious area that helped create that feeling of pampered luxury.Prior to our visit, I had organised for chocolates and flowers to be in our room upon our arrival. The hotel staff carried out this request perfectly and helped to make our stay a wonderful experience. Finishing touches, such as the fruit that was provided in our room, also helped to make our stay extra special.The hotel also provided us with the opportunity to cater the room for our particular tastes and requirements. As an allergy sufferer, I found the ability to order non allergenic pillows and duvets a welcome facility.The hotel is centrally located in the heart of Mayfair. All the staff proved themselves to be courteous and charming. The Hotel bar provided us with an ideal area for meeting our guests and later, for a relaxing drink in nice surroundings.The reception staff were extremely helpful and were able to make suggestions regarding our plans for the day and the Concierge were only too willing to hail taxis and help with luggage and all with a friendly smile and a warm manner, not something that is always on hand in London.All in all, I would thoroughly recommend anyone to experience the luxury of a few nights stay at The Chesterfield in Mayfair.We'll be back!
