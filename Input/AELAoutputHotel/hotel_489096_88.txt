{"text":"Great family stay - highly recommended We put up at the Meriton while in Sydney for a family wedding in July 2006. We rented for just over a week in one of the larger corner 3-bedroom\/2baths apartments as we were with our 3 kids. Ever tried a hotel holiday with children? Uually you end up frazzled, fighting and heavily out-of-pocket to sleep in 2 small adjoining rooms with many hotels still treating kids like a problem not a customer. Here we had an enormous city centre apartment with wifi, huge living\/dining area and a well-equipped kitchen and laundry. I know some folks seem to have an issue with the lifts and I agree at peak times there can be delays but hey, for the views alone, if you're not a busy business wo\/man you can bear a few minutes wait. Great facilities - we regularly used the pool and gym (tip: our kids were too young to last the full wedding so we bought some DVDs locally and booked the little advertised and no-charge theatrette for a movie show. Big cheers all round!). You could not get a better central location with the monorail on your doorstep, a cab rank outside and the metro a few minutes walk. The nearby foodcourt en route to the Woolworth's in the basement of the shopping mall is great and we ate some of the best sushi we'd ever had. Some nice Spanish restaurants down the street too. Walk a few streets further and find the charming Chinese peace garden - a big hit with our girls. We were very pleased with our apartment which was an ideal base for our family and great value. We booked the previous night as our flight landed early morning - a good idea if concerned about longer check-in times at peak hours\/dates. We most definitely will be back.
