{"text":"Grand Oasis with Family We stayed at the Oasis from Jan 14-22. I was with my mom(Granny) and 2 boys, 3  5 years old. We checked in at 10:30pm. Everything was fine. I had requested building 2 on the lazy pool but was told it was unavailable. After showing some money I was told I could be moved in the morning, but the desk clerk walked us to a room he said would be better. It was building 6 near the adult pool. It was a suite, with 2 rooms, 2 balconies. Very spacious and nice. We decided to stay.Food was plenty and good. Always choices that pleased adults and children. Pools were clean and not too overcrowded. We did swim in the lazy river it was much cooler and didn't have alot of action for the kids. The kids club was a little lame. We did play there but I would not leave my children unattended as no one seemed to watch them carefully. The beach was nice but had a lot of seaweed. The hotel had men cleaning it up constantly so it didn't bother us. We did 1 excursion to Animal Adventure Park. The boys loved it. They picked us up on a boat for the 2 minute ride to the park. We got to touch sea lions, parrots, a nurse shark, starfish, sea urchins, monkeys, large snakes and a tiger! My boys were in awe. All in all we had a good trip. The hotel is a perfect size with everything within a quick walk.If anyone has questions feel free to contact me.
