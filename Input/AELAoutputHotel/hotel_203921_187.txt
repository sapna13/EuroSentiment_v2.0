{"text":"Wonderful  We just returned from a 2 1\/2 week trip to Italy, 2 nights of which we spent at Hotel David in Florence. We LOVED it! While the hotel is not directly located in the heart of the city, it's extremely close and easy to reach, both when arriving to the city (via car) and traveling to the historical district. It's a very short block from the Arno and on several public bus lines, so it's very very easy to get anywhere you'd like to go. If you're a walker, you can reach Ponte Vecchio in about 15 minutes, strolling along the river on a lovely paved path.The hotel staff could not have been more welcoming. The staff was very friendly and extremely helpful from our arrival until departure. On arrival, we were given a 1 page map of the city with all major attractions clearly marked (and a huge star marking the hotel location). Reception then drew out the route of 2 bus lines (marking the stops) that they recommended to easily reach all major sites (Duomo, Uffizi, etc).Our room was very large (particularly by European standards, but pretty large by American standards as well IMO) and spotlessly clean. The room decor was tasteful and simple - antique wood desk, huge wall armoire\/closet, TV (CNN\/BBC were only English speaking channels we noticed), mini fridge\/bar, huge windows overlooking a courtyard (no view obviously but nicely private), and huge marble bathroom with everything you would need.Free parking was also available - inside the hotel gate - very nice bonus since it can be very expensive  difficult to find.Breakfast in the morning was delicious - typically some pastries (croissants, etc), rolls, cereal, fruit, coffee, tea, juice, yogurt.There is a lift, but it's teeny tiny  kinda shakey. We're skinny  we barely wedged ourselved  2 bags in there for the ride up!Overall, it was our favorite hotel in Italy! The staff were very kind, everything was kept very clean, the decor was cute and the location was perfect.They claim to be a 3 star hotel, but i think it's more like a low 4 star.Don't hesitate to stay here :)A++++ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1482,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1478},{"endOffset":1603,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1595},{"endOffset":1615,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":1605},{"endOffset":1651,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1645},{"endOffset":1656,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1653}]}
