{"text":"Nice hotel in Bali Stayed here for my last 5 nights of my Bali trip and thought i would see what Nusa Dua had to offer.Went through Accor hotel website and got a deal for 79 US Dollars no change no cancellations No refund.The hotel is situated next to many other resort style hotels in Nusa Dua and looked quite impressive on arrival.The check in was quite slow and at first i thought i had got the wrong Novotel as it had only been booked over the web an hour previously and the staff were unsure whether i was booked in.Eventually booked in and went to my hotel room which you had to cross the road to get to but once inside the room i was impressed the room was a very large size with a nice balcony to sit outside and relax.The bathroom was very clean and a nice size all you could ask for really.The hotel has a buffet themd night each evening to be honest never tried it as it didnt look very good value for money so i ate most night in the beach bar and the food was very good the pizzas were excellent and they did a mean kebab.The beach attached to the hotel was very good when the tide came in but at low tide didnt look too impressive.If you were a watersports fan you will not be dissapointed and looked quite reasonable.Tried the internet in my room and was charged around √ä√£¬¢8 for 24 hours use and as the connection speed was slow this was definitely not worth the money you would be far better off going to a local internet cafe and logging on there.Overall the hotel was very good but not very good for a single traveller as there is not much to do in the evening and much preferred the hustle and bustle of Tuban And Kuta as this seemed to be more of the real bali and its people ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":694,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":690},{"endOffset":694,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":690},{"endOffset":994,"mention":"pizzas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":988},{"endOffset":994,"mention":"pizzas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":988},{"endOffset":994,"mention":"pizzas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":988}]}
