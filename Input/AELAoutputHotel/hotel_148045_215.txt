{"text":"Definitely not 5 star I was staying at the El Con resort for a wedding. First of all, we booked our rooms when the resort was owned by Wyndham. Our preious reservations were not accepted by the new managment, an we had to redo our reservations (at double the price of course). Upon checkin the problems started. They booked us in the wrong section of the resort, even though we called the resort directly to confirm that we would be in the newly renovated Las Briasas wing. After complaining they at least bumped us to an ocean view room. Rooms were nice upon first inspection, but as we started to use them we realized there were many problems. the toilet stoppped working ourfirst night. It may have been a hotel wide problem, because it wasn'tjust our room that experienced such problems. The sink in the bathroom did not have a plug. There were problems with the stereo anddvd player. The restuarants that we went to were not acceptible (we tried to eat off the resort whenever possible), service was incredibly slow and the food was not good and over priced (like most hotel food).Additional charges for everything were outrageous. if you had acar it was $15 to $25 a day to park (although locals using the casino could park for free), and the internet service (not even wireless) was $15 a day. The island beaches were nice, but not much to see snorkeling, and they did at least give you complementary beach towels at the pools and beach.
