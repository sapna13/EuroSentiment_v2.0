{"text":"Hotel Condado - a mixed experience Our stay was in Sept. 2008. I remembered that the hotel had specifically contacted us to fill out a review on tripadvisor. Here goes...As for our experience at the Hotel Condado, we had a mixed experience. The downstairs hotel staff was very helpful. The rooms were nice. The free drinks (soda and water) were a nice surprise as well.We did have two big disappointments after staying at the hotel for 5 nights. First, we had asked for a single room, and our confirmation indicated we had gotten a family room for 4 people. In my notes to the hotel, I had specified that we wanted a single room, but we received two rooms that were joined by a small space with the outer door. This situation of two rooms was not made clear to us, because we thought all 4 of uswould be sharing a room. They actually do not have a single room for 4 people (according to what the front desk told us). Instead, they have 2 separate rooms that is separated by a small shared area that can be locked from the outside. The interesting thing is that they charge you for 2 rooms, although you may ask for just one. This situation was either unintentional or deceptive, but either way, it was not what we expected.The second problem we had was with the cleaning service. We posted do not disturb on the door at least 3 different days we were there. Every single time without fail, they would come into the room even when the posted Do not Disturb sign was on the door knob. We were sick on our 4th day, and I had to worry about them coming in while I was sick (Sure enough, they attempted to come in). This was completely unacceptable. Why have those signs for guests to hang from their doorknob if they are completely disregarded?As far as location, the hotel was a bit further north from Las Ramblas that we would have liked. My suggestion is to look elsewhere if you have other options and stay here if you can't find anything else.
