{"text":"Wow - still an oasis of understated luxury We stayed at this Sofitel between Thanksgiving and 1 December. We'd previously stayed here in 2002 and I am seriously impressed that the quality of both the accommodations and the service at this hotel has not noticably diminished with time. We arrived at around 2.30pm and our room was already available - we were upgraded to a suite on the 29th floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building and Bryant Park 1Check in was super friendly and welcoming - our stay could not have got off to a better start. The suite was just as I remembered- - clean, spacious, comfortable and very VERY quiet. We never heard another guest during our entire stay. Bathroom amenities include a power shower with fantastic water pressure, a soaking tub and other little touches including robes, huge fluffy towels, slippers and Roger  Gallet Oatmeal toiletries(excellent for those with sensitive skin - not too perfumed). Room service was excellent as was the housekeeping - everything was replenished daily and extras always left. We had fresh flowers in our bedroom (orchids) and a single orchid in the bathroom. The turn down service left a box of chocolates and bottles of water every evening. We didn't use the hotel restaurant or bar as we were out and about a lot so I cannot comment on these facilities. There is a mini bar in the room and the prices weren't too outrageous by big city standards - however it would still be nice to have tea and coffee making facilities for first thing in the morning... On the day of our departure I asked for a late check-out which was granted with pleasure (I asked for 4.00pm - although we actually left at 3.00pm) There was a slight problem with my bill at check out but this was modified immediately with apologies from the staff. The concierge and the door men offered umbrellas and assistance when it rained and were able to call a cab to the airport without delay - great service and always with asmile. Overall I would categorise this hotel as understated luxury - quiet,efficient and charming. The Staff go out of their way to be both welcoming and helpful. Add to that the brilliant location and I don't think you can get a better deal in this city.
