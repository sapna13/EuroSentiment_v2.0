{"text":"Nice hotel for families Just returned from a family vacation to Puerto Rico. 4 of us, 2 preteen girls. We stayed here on 8\/1-2 and then switched over to the Westin Rio Mar by plan. See that review separately.This hotel offers what many families have come to love about Embassy Suites...a large clean suite where the sofabed can serve as separate sleeping quarters, the fridge and microwave, 2 TVs. It is a resort but don't expect, well, the Westin Rio Mar.The breakfast buffet is fine, gets very crowded at prime time (9am), but well below the standards of many U.S. Embassy Suites locations in terms of the variety offered. For a Caribbean island, I would have at least expected some fresh fruit (nowhere to be seen) as well as fresh juices. The OJ came out of a mixer nozzle warm and was undrinkable. Add your own ice from a bucket touched by the hands of hundreds. The Manager's Reception was fine and on par with most Embassy Suites. They charge $7 for parking which is a bit much. (Definitely rent a car wherever you go in PR for flexibility and excursions). $10 charge for wireless Internet as well unless you are a Hilton Honors member. The grounds were very nice, good pool, nice clean beach but small and protected by rock jetties. This cuts down the waves for the littles ones but detracts from the ocean feel. However, it is quite a nice setting. There is not much else to do at the resort, no scheduled resort activities. The golf course looked just OK, too hot to play in my opinion. You don't get the trade winds here to the same extent as in Rio Mar which is more exposed to the easterlies. The staff was very nice, friendly and accomodating.About the locals...for a mid-week stay, the place was indeed very crowded at the pool with local Puerto Ricans on vacation. There is an attached time share building called Aquarius which must pack them in and they get to use the hotel facilities. Americans were most definitely in the minority. It does calm down at night.Bottom line, for the slow season, you can work a much better deal at the Westin Rio Mar and experience a true resort vacation. I am just glad we stayed at the Embassy Suites first before the Westin as my family would probably still not be talking to me.
