{"text":"Classy Hotel Rex I had a fantastic stay for 3 nights at the Hotel Rex. All the staff were charming, helpful and friendly. The rooms are nicely decorated, with great bed linens and a CD player and jazz CDs to listen to. Like those in many San Francisco boutique hotels, my room was quite small, but it had every amenity I could want, and quite frankly in SF you don't spend much time in your room anyway. The room was located away from the street, and I'd recommend asking for that, so as to be away from any Sutter St noise. I slept really well - no noise any night (unlike other SF hotels I have stayed in). The Rex is close to Union Square, and it's easy to get to other parts of the city: one of the cable car lines is nearby, and there are buses which will take you to North Beach for example. It's an easy walk to the BART and Muni Metro stations at Market Street. When I needed to get to Berkeley upon checking out, the staff on the front desk went to great lengths to check town car rates for the trip - very helpful.Room service: great food from Cafe Andree (located on site). I recommend the pancakes for breakfast. I did eat in Cafe Andree one evening for dinner, and the food was excellent, but quite pricey. It's aiming to be a fine dining experience; there are other places nearby if you want something less upmarket.I didn't have my laptop with me, and was impressed to find that the Rex has a 'study' room with two terminals for guest use - absolutely free, unlike many other hotels. Really useful, and it was nice to be able to check email with some privacy rather than in an open lobby.The lobby, by the way, is lovely - leather armchairs, wood panelling. The feel is that of a literary salon, and it's very classy - like the Hotel Rex in general. Highly recommended.
