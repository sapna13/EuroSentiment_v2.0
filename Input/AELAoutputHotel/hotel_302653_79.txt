{"text":"Nice but too isolated I stayed at this resort with my girlfriend one week in April 06 and we were quite surprised to see that occupancy was barely 50% (probably due to the recent terrorist attacks) but nevertheless on the other hotels nearby it was even lower. I remember entering the Hilton beach area (as there is a walkway along the beach that links all hotels) and seeing absolutely no one. All in all it was a very sad view as Nusa Dua is a totally touristic-focused area and if there is no people around rather than being convenient (which in fact it was) it felt also a bit odd.The good part is that all services, restaurants, taxies, shops, etc were at our convenience without the need to book at all.About the damp feeling that allegedly impregnates all rooms, we stayed in a baseground one, and turning on the air con solves the issue, as the atmosphere gets drier.Rooms are average for this type of resort, although a bit worn and quite dark. The gardens and common areas are really nice and very well preserved, there are flowers dropped everywhere daily. Service was excellent and all employees always had a smile in their face. They spoke many different languages so anyone can feel at home here.The massage and spa area was under renovation but we had some treatments in one of the villas that had been specially appointed for this purpose, which was even better as it is a very private area and you feel being in heaven there, with the small pool.The only negative point was that prices of drinks were a bit too high, especially compared with the local deals that you can find a short walk from the hotel.The Nusa Dua area is on the south of the island in a small peninsula which means that any trip to the rest of the island has to go through Denpasar and the airport area, which adds for a longer drive wherever you want to go.I would not recommend Kuta at all as it is a McDonalds and Hard rock cafe spot infested with booze-eager teens, so anyone willing to meet th real bali should avoid this. On the other hand Ubud is such a melancholic and bohemian place that is really inviting. I only felt such a thing in places like Pipa in the north of Brazil. Those places where you would like to stay for ever and forget about everyhting. Next time I will book a hotel there as it is well worth to trade the beach for staying there.
