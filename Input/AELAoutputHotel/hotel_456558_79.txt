{"text":"Great location and Great Price This is a small hotel in a great location. Only 5 minutes walk to Galleries LaFayette and Opera. There are many nearby shops, restaurants, a mini-mart across the street. There is a street just around the corner, which is lined with wine shops, cheese shops, delicatessens, bakeries and pattisieries - not touristy, but I think for the locals!The hotel has 4 floors and has rooms with WC\/bath and ones which are shared. We paid 101 Euros for a double\/shower and bath. The room is standard size for Paris ( but compared to US - its small ), has a flat screen TV, indoor safe, desk. All rooms require a keycard. The bathroom is more than average size, with good hot water and towels replaced daily. The rooms are quite clean! nothing luxurious, and cleaned daily. Our heating worked very well, we didnt have issues like the previous contributor. the windows are double glazed and we had a room facing the back of the hotel - not a great view but extremely quiet.There is breakfast at 7euro which we didn't try. Thomas, who at reception, was very helpful over the emails and also in person when recommending estaurants - very polite, not rude and speaks english. There is a free nespresso machine to use in the reception, amidst a small but cosy seating area.The hotel is only 8 minutes to Gare Du Nord station by taxi, and only cost 6 euros. Of note: you have to pay the first night in advance by PayPal. You pay the rest of the stay once you arrive ( but we only stayed for 2 nights ). Highly recommended for the price, and will stay there again! ","annotations":[]}
