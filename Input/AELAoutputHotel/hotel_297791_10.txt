{"text":"You get what you pay for! Well, we got what we paid for! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Coqui Inn because of the cheap rate (apparently there was a 10k race in town when we went and almost all other lower priced hotels were sold out). The Coqui Inn provided what we needed, a place to lay our heads and night and shower. Good points: staff was really friendly (treat them like you want to be treated), location was close to bus line for trip to Old San Juan, larger hotels (for tour to rain forest) and the beach, $10 cab ride to\/from airport (extremely close!) and Internet access in the lobby to check email. Not so good points: someone mentioned no wash clothes or shampoo, TRUE!, was very noisy (walls and doors paper thin), not very safe secure room (no sprinkler system, actual keys for entry with just an additional chain to lock the door) and the water pressure in showers leaves A LOT to be desired (we changed rooms once bacause of water pressure, 2nd room was better, but not much) and forget about an iron and ironing board!All in all we had a good stay, probably because we weren't in the room much and it was just the two of us who went to the island to see the island, not to see the Coqui Inn.All in all, we got what we paid for and had a fabulous time on the island. The Coqui Inn left a lot to be desired but was not all that bad. Fortunately for us we didn't have any travel delays and our reservations were in order when we arrived. We did request and got a late check out with no problems or additional costs. ","annotations":[]}
