{"text":"Well Done Wyland! Wyland Waikiki Hotel was top notch and super considerate. We booked a One Bedroom Kitchenette Suite and then took advantage of some deals we found on the internet that includes daily continental breakfast for two, a third night free and a room upgrade -- Make sure you ask!-The cleaning staff practically waited by our door until we left, and they emptied our garbages at least twice a day (good, because of stinky diapers...) -Our room was quiet although it was right next to the elevators, and our daughter LOVED the fish aquarium that was just outside of the elevators in the lobby. -The massaging chairs were quite aggressive, so they weren't used much, but the Xbox was fun. -Complimentary continental breakfast was very closely guarded (no extra drinks or pastries) but we managed. -The lobby\/concierge knew our daughter by name and sight (probably sound too: HI FISHIES!!!) and were very considerate in getting us late night pizza, cutting our pineapple and helping us get to some good eats around town. -There is a warmer salt water pool used for spa services that was absolutely empty and in the shade, in the other tower, which we used daily. Big pool was a bit too cool for my daughter and the whirlpool was a bit too hot for pregnant me, so this worked out perfectly.-When asked to delay our checkout from 12 noon to 2pm (due to napping hours) the staff didn't even bat an eyelash and waived the $100 late checkout charge (we later used the late checkout, since our flight was such a late hour --11pm)-Free freezie\/ice pops in the freezer next to the big pool.We had hoped to buy the things we needed for breakfast and lunch, but the prices were SO EXPENSIVE. The cheapest thing was a pineapple, and it was about a dollar less than Save On Foods prices here in Canada. When we got it back to our hotel, we discovered that they didn't have a knife to cut the sucker and the restaurant Spada wouldn't cut it due to Food Safety Laws. The concierge took our pineapple home with him, cut it into small pieces and brought it up to our room. Needless to say, this was the first and last pineapple we bought in Hawaii, pineapple town. We ended up tipping the concierge double the cost of the pineapple just for his troubles!Downfalls were that there are no stovetops in the kitchenettes, the couch bed was lumpy (thank goodness our daughter is little and sleeps like a stone) and the spa services were not very diverse. The restaurant Spada, as good as their food was once it arrived, was ridiculously priced for such small amounts and the service was lousy. We went down the street to Moose McGillycuddy's on the advice of the concierge and continued to go there for breakfast, lunch and dinner until the end of our trip.
