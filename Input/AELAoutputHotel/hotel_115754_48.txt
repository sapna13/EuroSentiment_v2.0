{"text":"comfortable, good value, service lacking! I did enjoy most of the things about my stay here! We paid $99 plus tax for a king suite which was immaculately clean (something i am very picky about) and comfortable and nicely decorated. I liked that there was a bar onsite and we could order room service. We walked around the area a little bit but mostly stayed in the hotel and enjoyed ourselves. The breakfast was nice but I could see how it could get boring after more than a few days! We didn't use the pool at all because it was always busy! I noticed they had a computer area where you can check email which I think is a great amenity! Things I didn't like: At check-in the clerk did not give us any information at all, not even to tell us where our room was or when breakfast was or anything, so I had to call down to the front desk later when I had questions. No opening windows, so no fresh air! The bartender was a complete snob and very rude to not only us but other people in the lounge. He had a major attitude problem! I didn't hear any of the traffic noises that people have complained of, but there seemed to be a fan on in one of the rooms around us all night long and that kept me awake! I also did not care for the forced $16 valet parking.I would stay here again! The price we paid was worth it for being comfortable, the luxury of room service, and breakast. ","annotations":[]}
