{"text":"excellent hotel in great location Having read numerous good reviews about this hotel I decided to book for 9 days. We have absolutely no regrets and would stay there again. As we did have plenty time, we were able to sit a couple of hours on three suny afternoons at the pool terrace. The views are wonderful.We could not fault the staff, who went out of their way to ensure we had all we needed, and offered advice on travelling around.As we arrived at 9am, we were delighted to be told a room was being prepared and we were in by 10.15 after an amble round Victoria park.We booked a harbour view room, and as seen in others' review this is often a slightly sidewards view, as directly in front is a school and many sports courts. This did not detarct from the views as it was interesting, for instance, to see all the school pupils in straight lines at 9.45am prompt, folk doing their early morning t'al chi and activity in the Victoria park as well as cruise liners and the Star Ferries etc and over to TST.The Tin Hau MTR is less than 5 minutes away, [for speed] as are trams[who needs to rush on holiday, anyway] and buses. Often in the evenings we walked into Causeway Bay proper after dinner -less than 10 minutes brisk walk, either via the main road or the Park. The library, en route, is the most beautiful we have seen and has great views from upper floors. It's worth a look.It took about 8 minutes to get to Admiralty to change for TST, over the Bay, although on several occasions we walked though the park the on to the prom at the front right along to Wan Chai\/ The Convention Centre.Some nights, for speed, we ate in the Cafe de Coral, opposite the Tin Hau MTR, where the food is pictured- we could not figure out the Chinese language, and which was amazingly cheap- HK$79 \/ less than √ä√£¬¢7 for 2 meals of sirloin steak, with coffee! Staff there, too were very helpful and ensured we did not 'miss our number' on the board if they forgot to put it up.We did have breakfast in the Hotel a few mornings, and on some we bought juice from the Wellcome supermarket next door and delicious pastries from the bakers a few shops further on.As other posters have said, the hotel breakfast, though bountiful with cereals fruit and choices of eggs meats etc as well as dim sum, it is the same daily so can be boring as well as working out expensive by comparison if for a large family.While the rooms are not huge, they are perfectly adequate and very clean, as are all areas of the hotel. Kowloon, while wonderfully atmospheric by day or night was almost claustrophobic for us so the Causeway bay area around the Park and Metropark was a welcome Oasis.It is also important to say that at no time during the duration of the holiday did we feel at all intimidated, even when we got lost. To the contrary, people stopped and offered guidance, even taking us back on to the right road.All in all , we had a wonderful holiday.
