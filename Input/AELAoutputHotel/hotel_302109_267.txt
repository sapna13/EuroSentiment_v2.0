{"text":"Stunning Shangri La We stayed at the Shangri La for four nights in July at the start of our trip to South East Asia. The hotel is a 10 minute walk from Orchard Road although the hotel has a frequent shuttle bus to take you there and back. We took taxis to most places that we visited due to the fact that they are incredibly cheap e.g. we went to the night safari about 35 mins away and the taxi fare was around √ä√£¬¢3. We had booked a hotel in the tower wing which was spacious and had a floor to ceiling window overlooking the pool and gardens. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom had lots of toiletries that were restocked twice a day. We also recived complimentary jasmine tea on our first two nights as a welcome which was a nice touch.Breakfast at the Line was included in our rate. It was absolutely fantastic. The choice was greater than we have ever experienced before - dozens of different cuisines to try and you could eat as much as you liked. We also went to the Line for dinner one evening and the dinner buffet was definitely along the same lines and we would recommend this as well.We had dinner at Blu on our first evening and had their signature tasting menu which was excellent. The views of the city from the restaurant are well worth it. If you didn't want to spend your money in the restaurant there is a bar that serves cocktails where you can get a similar view for a fraction of the cost (note alcohol is not particularly cheap in Singapore).We made use of the pool and spa facilities, both of which were excellent. The spa, in particular, was very reasonably priced and the therapists were very friendly.We cannot fault this hotel which set the standard for the rest of our trip - the food here even put the food at the Mandarin Oriental in KL in the shade - and would definitely recommend this if you are visiting Singapore.
