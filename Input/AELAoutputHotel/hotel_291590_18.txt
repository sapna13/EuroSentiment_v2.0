{"text":"well, we liked it We have just returned from spending 4 nights in the Barcelo Atenea Mar in Barcelona, and in our opinion the hotel was top class. Barcelona itself, is out of this world, we loved it, and the hotel was certainly everything we needed.If you are looking for a bustling few days right in the middle of the city, then its probably not for you, but if like us, you're looking to spend some time in the hustle bustle of the city during the day and then something a bit more relaxing in the evening then dont hesitate to stay there.Its a short walk to the metro station and then only a few stops to Placa de Catalunya which directly leads to La Rambla.The hotel itself was spotlessly clean and all credit to the staff who, despite other reviews, we found to be entirely helpful and friendly, especially the female bartender who served us there on numerous occasions.I cant comment on the hotel restaurant because we didn't eat there, only because, if we had eaten in every place we wanted to then we would have spent our entire (short) holiday in eateries! The bar was modern without being uncomfortable and very reasonably priced.The hotel itself is about a half hour walk from the Olympic Port. Its a very pleasant walk along the front of the city with the beach to your right. Once you reach the port then you'll find it full to bursting with restaurants and bars with everything you could possibly want for filling your tummy......may I highly recommend the steaks, anywhere.Go on.... book your barca break, you'll love it.
