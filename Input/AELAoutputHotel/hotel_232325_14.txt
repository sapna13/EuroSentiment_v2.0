{"text":"Avenue was perfect! As a single female leisure traveller from India, I was concerned about booking good hotel rooms for myself when I travelled to some European cities. I found Avenue on Venere.com.....everything about it on the website coupled with the reviews on this site made me book a single room for myself for 2 nights in May 2008. On reaching Amsterdam Schiphol Airport, I very easily got myself onto the train that got me to Amsterdam Central in no time. As instructed very cleraly on the website, the hotel is just a 5 minute walk away from the station..which proved to be very convenient. The man at the reception was very friendly and welcomed me though I reached there as early asa 8:00am!!! I was requested to leave my bags in the luggage room and come back later in the afternoon. After going about the city in the canal bus (hop on hop off), I returned to the hotel later in the afternoon and was delighted with the single room I was given. It was on the 4th floor...had no view (but that's ok)....it was very comfortable, had a lovely bath and a bright cheerful feel to it. The location is perfect....all the places of interest are within walking distance. The breakfast which was included in the price was wonderful....breads, jellies, cereals, milk, juices, eggs, pancakes......didn't feel hungry until much later in the day after eating breakfast like a king!I enjoyed an Italian meal just across the road from the hotel...regret that I don't remember the name of the restaurant. All in all, I had a wonderful 2 night stay at Hotel Avenue before I left for Belgium and France. I would not hesitate in recommending it to anyone and would love to stay here again!
