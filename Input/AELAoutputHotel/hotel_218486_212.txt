{"text":"Amazing Trip and Beautiful Resort Well, this trip was my highschool graduation present from my family. I went with 14 other people all between the ages of 17-25. Reading some of the reviews here before going, I was shocked and very afraid. It was to be my first trip and the resort sounded like a nightmare. However, it was totally the opposite. I had the time of my life. The grounds were beautiful and very clean. The resort was huge and all facilities were kept clean and in order. The buffet food was good but the a la carte food was delicious! My favourite was the Japanese and the Spanish. It seems that many people complained about the staff but personally I had absolutely no problems with them. In fact, I became very close with and spent a lot of time with the entertainers\/animation crew. They were very funny and always kept me and my friends smiling. The rest of the staff such as bartenders, cooks, waiters etc were also very nice. People complained about that fact that many do no speak english but they should remember that they are in a different country and it is difficult to be expected to know so many languages since tourists are coming from all over the world. Even if they didnt speak english, they were always pleasant and I foundways to communicate with them anyway. The shows were great and the clubs were so much fun. The entertainers always kept things very lively. The best entertainers were Richard, Pinky, Isaac and Peppito. If you go, find them, very funny guys. The outside club they took us to was also sooo much fun. It was $10 US to get a ride there and back, entrance to the club, and first drink. The beaches and pools were beautiful and there were always activities going on on the beach. The rooms were very clean and air-conditioned. I had no problems.they were cleaned everyday and drinks were refilled. Our tv had over 60 channels but we were too busy to use it.I would definitely go back to this resort. The place itself was beautiful but i have to say that the tourists and staff made this trip very memorable for me. To all those that complained, honestly, when you go on vacation, your supposed to relax, not find little things to pinpoint and complain about that are really irrelevent and ridiculous such as seaweed. Keep in mind you are in another country so the lifestyle is different. Be open minded and relax and you will have a great time!
