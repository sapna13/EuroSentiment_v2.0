{"text":"Cremorne Point - A Welcome Surprise Trying to get a room in Sydney CBD the weekend after Valentines Day proved impossible - there was little available, and what was had inflated prices, but I wanted to take my hubby somewhere special for his birthday. I saw Cremorne Point Manor in Wotif.com.au and thought I would give it a go. Even though the description was great, I was still quite reserved - I have stayed in places that look fantastic over the web, but actually end up being rat traps in real life. To my surprise, Cremorne Point Manor met and exceeded my expectations. Directions to the Manor were spot on and the on-street parking was a real bonus (as opposed to $30+ for valet arking in the CBD). Check in was good and we were totally blown away by the quality of the king spa suite. The room rate was very competetive at $229, and I didn't even realise that this included a bottle of bubbly, some chocolates and breakfast! The facilities in the room were great - right down to chilled champagne glasses. There was even an IPOD dock to set up some mood music in the room. The highlight for us was the massive ensuite containing a shower big enough to house a footy team, and the awesome spa! We had one of the most relaxing stays away from home ever!The other big bonus was the location - the trip across the harbour on the ferry was so perfect! We live 2 hours from Sydney and visit the CBD fairly regularly but I have never stayed in this area before. Our stay at Cremorne Point Manor helped us discover another wonderful and absolutely charming side of a sometimes overwhelmingly busy city. Thankyou Cremorne Point Manor!
