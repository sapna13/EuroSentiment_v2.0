{"text":"omg it was the best-trust me-it was and I am picky oh my! Where do I start? This was the best resort ever--At first I was a bit scared because of some of the reviews but I don't understand the bad reviews because everything was perfect. As I arrived, the man excorted me to the room and he was so soooooooo nice and just left. He wasn't standing there waiting for a tip but I tiped him anyways because of his kindness. Than me and my friend went to get our towel and the towel people were so nice as well. So polite and than we went to get some pina colada and drinks, even there was nice. All the staff made me feel as family and some of them even sat with us during lunch time and dinner. The food waas awesome. I read that it would not be that way but I went to each and every restaurant and the food was the best. Every night they had a different theme at the buffet restaurant. One night it would be German night, the next it would be Dominican style night and etc. Sports bar was fun. Had pool table and other activies. At the pool, they had all kind of activities going on every 30 minutes or hour. Had spanish lessons, volleyball games, bikinki contest, dance contest, dance lessons and more activites that is a lot to mention. Than me and my friend went to ride bikes and that was fun and played basketball. They also had a tennis court. Something for everyone. The jucuzzi, omg--is so awesome--is great and beautiful-relaxing and the beach and pool--gorgeous. Everything was perfect. You cannot ask for me. Because e verything was just perfect. But so that you know, this is not a honeymoon resort. This is more like a single, group of friends or family resort. Is a place to have fun and be free. No one would be on your face. If it wasn't great, i would not spend my time writing. So trust me, if interested, go. (-: ","annotations":[]}
