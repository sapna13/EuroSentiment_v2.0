{"text":"Overpriced and disappointing I chose this hotel because although the rate was still over $200, it was more affordable than some of the others in the area. The parking is an additional 12.00 daily and is a tight fit if your car is anything bigger than an intermediate. The room has tired appearance, the desk lamp did not work and the soundproofing from the next room was non-existent. Fortunately, other than some coughing, the person next door was alone and didn't watch TV.The 1960's vintage bathroom had a sign that said if you take a shower one minute less you will save 9 liters of water. I don't think you could have gotten 9 liters of water through that shower head in 30 minutes - the worst I have experienced in Australia.The restaurants are overpriced and the food mediocre. If you are into huge heaps of chips (fries) with every menu item then you might be satisfied.The absolute worse part of this stay was the Internet service. You have a choice of 1 hour for 10.00 or one day for 27.95. I chose one hour and after about 8 - 10 minutes on line was interrupted buy a phone call. During that time my laptop went to energy saver and when I went to re-open the browser I was hit with another request for money (the one hour is continuous and if you stop, you lose). My complaints to the front desk were met with absolutely no sympathy - just that's Telstra.Will not consider this hotel for future stays near Sydney airport.
