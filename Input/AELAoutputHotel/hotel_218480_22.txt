{"text":"Loved it...second visit in 8 mths After careful researching and comparing of ideal vacations, you come to realize that most people tend to post reviews when they were less than happy with their experience. As a result, its easy to pass up gems like the Barcelo Bavaro as a fantastic vacation property to relax and indulge at. So why review now? well for us to have had a consistent experience over two visits within 8 months says alot about a place and makes it less of an anomaly of a great experience. Based on that, it would seem that this location is well deserving of a little kudos from its mucho happy guests. Us: 6 people aged 23-35Visited: February  November 2006Stayed: Barcelo Bavaro Golf (both 1 bdrm apartments and 2 level lofts)The Barcelo is a complex of 5 hotels all within easy and close access to the beach with a variety of activities to keep singles, couples, families and retirees quite happy. For those of you worried about the Golf or Casino hotels being too far from the beach, well think again- 2 minutes is really only two minutes so don't be deterred. So the key attributes we considered in finding the perfect week haven that may be helpful to you:Rooms: clean, lots of room, well maintained, great cleaning service and staff. Fridge always stocked. We were located near the pool and bar- never experienced too much noise at 1am. Although keep in mind the walls are thin and so you can hear inconsiderate guests who enjoy slamming doors or closets. But thats about people and not the place. Food: Great variety. Fresh and very flavourful.Buffets- grilled\/ prepared to your preferences, lots of selection, changes everyday. Breakfast is definitely worth getting up early for- if you are so inclined on vacation Restaurants: Steakhouse- striploins, baked potatoes, onion rings- in the middele of the carribean a welcome change of pace amidst the buffetsItalian- great lasagna, breaded veal- worth standing in line for 10 minutes for Mexican- enchiladas and faijitas do not disappointBeach Grill- calamari, grilled shrimps, pizza and fries- perfect for in between sun soaking or parasailing (a wait depending on time of day)Miss your starbucks? Cappucinos are delicious and addictive- you've been warned. Pools: In general,-all clean, no need to wake up at 7am to save a lounger and of course bars to keep you quenched with your beverage of choicePools at the golf and the casino hotels: perfect for a little quiet to relax and read and a swim in between to cool off Pools at the beach and the caribe hotels: looking for eye candy, activities, music and partying- then head over to these locations for a good dose of fun and frolic in the sun by the poolBeach: well its Punta Cana the beaches are perfect. again no need to get up at 7am to get a lounger. Massage Cabanas at each hotel beach area- the perfect activity at sun down before a nap for only $45\/ hr. For daredevils: every imaginable activity is available. If nothing else, perfect people watching while toasting yourself, lathered up in sunscreen. Entertainment: if you like shows- there's lots of evening shows including the Tropicallisimo show. If you need to get your groove on- Disco Bavaro on the resort is one of the best clubs we've ever been to onsite. DJ's mix it up every night depending on the crowd. So don't be surprised if one night its mostly dance and RB, only to go back the next night to latin and top 40. Usually busy every night after midnight going strong until after 4am. So have a long afternoon nap to indulge in all the gyrating with the tanned and tireless. Need retail therapy: just down the beach closest to the Palace hotel is a mini artisans market where you should be prepared to bargain and enjoy the banter of the sellers as they woo you with their wares. Theres also a mini shopping complex on the resort, with lots to see and comparable to shopping at the market or offsite. There's also a golf course, a casino, mini golf, a spa, pingpong, tennis, pool tables, a trolley for resort sightseeing....and just think even with a week, we never got to do everything we had set out to...but alas isn't that what vacation is all about. Without a doubt, we highly recommend this resort based on our experiences but find out for yourself why we think its a gem and why we've been back twice in a year.
