{"text":"OK, not exceptional First things first. I was working for a company who made all the hotel arrangements, so I have no idea what the room cost or even what level room I had, but I think I was in a standard room which was on the 7th floor.This hotel was a very mixed bag for me. They get the big things right, but the small things are terribly wrong. The hotel is located a bit off the street and can be a bit hard to find the first time, but it is directly behind the tram stop on the right side of the street if you're leaving the city center. After entering the hotel property through a very strange gate in a fence with barbed wire on top you enter into a very calming courtyard and then into the lobby which is fairly attractively decorated in a modern fashion. The bar\/restaurant is at the back overlooking Oosterpark, the breakfast room to one side (also with windows on the park) and the front desk is located right across for the lifts, allowing the staff to keep an eye on things.Security was OK (despite the strange balcony mentioned in previous reviews) and you need your room key to get into the lifts.Checkin was very easy as I was all prebooked and they just handed me my keycard. I don't know what other experiences would be.The room was indeed small, but fairly nicely laid out with an adequate bed that was very firm, two side tables, a desk with chair, one additional side chair, and a nice wardrobe. The bath was small and with only a shower, but was adequate.One problem was that the towels were not replenished in any regular fashion and the number and size of towels varied from day to day. The ammenties were never replenished and the very small glycerine soaps melted away in about a minute. Other problems. My wakeup call never came, although by that time I had discovered that the TV had an easy to use alarm which sufficed. I reported that my door was broken and that I had to slam it to get it closed. It was never repaired, despite a promise to do so. The elevator lobby on my floor had two ceramic vases on a table, one of which was broken. Other minor problems were also present, but nothing extraordinary. They just all combined to give me the impression of a hotel that wasn't trying very hard.Breakfast was OK, but I wasn't paying as it was included with my room. The usual coffee, meats, cheeses, cereal, fruit, etc. but also cooked eggs sausage and bacon. I was worried about the location, but it was actually fine. The number 9 tram does stop right outside and runs frequently throughout the daytime but stops at about midnight. I actually walked into the city center several times, a very safe 30 minute walk, and easy to do. I actually walked back at 2:00 am one morning and I had no problems whatsoever as there were several other people out on the street as well. The area is a bit sketchy but OK. There is a weekend street market down the street and a few shops that aren't terribly interesting. Several restaurants and bars are close by and there is also a coffee shop if that sort of thing interests you. The park is nice for a morning walk or run but does get odd at night. If you stray too far you will very possibly find yourself in an immigrant area which seemed safe but not the normal Amsterdam.All in all, a decent stay but there are certainly better choices closer to the middle of town.It would be fairly easy to get to if you are driving, since it is located right on a main road that connects directly to the ring road and you don't need to drive anywhere near the center of town.
