{"text":"PIg with Perfume This hotel seemed like a good deal for the area (right downtown near Copley Square in between Green and Orange lines on the T) and looked okay from the outside, but it has some problems. First, the actual rooms are in sore need of either an upgrade or better cleaning. My room looked as if it had not been updated in 20 years or more and I know for a fact the shower was only clean 3 out of the 6 nights I was there. Cleaning of the floor was questionable, too, as a bobby pin from a previous traveler was there all 6 nights I was. When the bellhop on call first took me to my room, the light did not work and he said he would fix it immediately. I told him it was not essential (as there were other lights working in the room) and he promised to fix it the next day. This never happened. Secondly, and perhaps most crucially, the front desk staff are very inconsistent. Unfortunately, it seems that only some of them are proficient in English. There were two occasions that lead me to conclude that this is the case. First, my mother was unable to get through to my room after 3 tries one night and after repeating the room number several times in several different ways (seven eleven vs. seven one one. I heard only one of the calls and picked it up only to hear elevator music. The second instance was when a group of us tried to get information about the location of a restaurant that was recommended to us. The front desk person asked us to repeat the name several times and then went in the other room to look up online. It turned out that even though she could not get any information for us, the restaurant was literally 2 blocks from the hotel. Speaking of food, the breakfast was AWFUL. Stale bagels, engligh muffins, and fatty muffins were all you could find; there were no whole grain options. These breads were not replenished on the weekend, so whatever was left from Friday was what you got. Finally, when we were checking out, my collegue could not get her own bill even though she had had her own room. The problem was apparently that she had booked 2 rooms online for herself and for another collegue (one room per person, right?). Well, the billing system at the hotel could only give her a bill for 2 people, making it look like there were 2 people in her room since nowhere on the bill did it say single room. Since this was a business trip, the bill really needed to be correct. This could not be resolved and the clerk was not even able to print up a note on letterhead explaining the error. I hate to write such a negative review, but I have rarely stayed in a hotel in America that was such an embarassment, especially since I was travelling with collegues from overseas.
