{"text":"Lovely lovely lovely I am a very picky traveler and a neat freak. I have also stayed in a few nice hotels so feel I am discriminating. The Ritz in San Juan was just lovely. The service was impeccible, from the moment we stepped onto the property. They offered us ice cold bottles of water at reception and were eager to make us comfortable. The room was very spacious and tidy with flat screen TV. Food excellent all around - we dined at the poolside restaurant and BLT SteakHouse. Of course it wasn't perfect but relatively speaking, the ratio of perfect to not perfect was insignificant (room 432 has tub stopper issues and bed is just slighty lumpy if still comfortable). Yes, the drinks and food are expensive but the quality is outstanding. Go to Denny's down the street if you want it on the cheap. The concierge at the Ritz is happy, happy to recommend other, less pricely restaurants and they have a huge book of menus at the desk for restaurants around the city. But the BLT Steakhouse was phenomental and if you think about what you spend on cab fare it isn't that much (I had a Kobe beef cheeseburger for $22 that included pre-dinner bread and rosemary infused french fries). Our room looked out over the pool and we could hear the Coqui frogs (I say they were piped in, hubbie says it was real).The pool is great and you can walk out straight to the beach. Perfect caribbean exprierience. Given that Embassy Suites, Marriott, Hilton, Intercontinental are charging as much as the Ritz, this is a great deal. If you have any problems at the hotel, the RItz, I am sure would be ready to fix them. Oh, and this is super convienent. FIve minutes from airport (no, I couldn't hear the planes in my room) and cabs are at the ready for a 10 min ride to old San Juan or cruise ship piers. Kodos to the Ritz!
