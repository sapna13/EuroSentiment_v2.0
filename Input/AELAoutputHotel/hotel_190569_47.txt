{"text":"Outstanding Service...Above and Beyond! My wife and I stayed at The Westin Palace for 5 nights in February and were truly impressed by the staff...especially the Concierge and Customer Support staff. We booked through Luxury Link and found the Junior Suite to be well appointed and spacious. Throw in such amenities as breakfast for two each morning, museum passes, and dinner at La Rotunda (the hotel's restaurant), and you have exceptional value.However, the true test of this hotel's outstanding service came during our third night in Madrid. While strolling the Paseo del Prado, my wife's wallet was lifted by a pick-pocket. Fortunately, we were just a few blocks from the hotel. Upon our arrival and explanation of our predicament, the hotel's Concierge (Carmen) immediately flew into action and summoned her Customer Support rep Marta, who quickly put us in contact with our credit card companies (to cancel our accounts before the thief could use them). Shortly thereafter, Carmen had the bellboy, Miguel-Angel, personally escort us to the police station (a few blocks away) to help with the police report. He stayed with us and helped translate...which made the experience quick and painless. When we arrived back at the hotel, Carmen had sent chocolates and fruit to the room...which was totally unexpected. Bottom line, the staff at this hotel turned what could have been a horrendous situation into just another day at the office! Finally, many thanks also go to the dining room manager, Angel, who made our stay most enjoyable...he pointed out many fine restaurants (including El Rincon de Esteban--close by) and numerous places of interest.
