{"text":"Great vacation at the Caribe Hilton! Had a wonderful spring vacation at the Caribe Hilton. I was very apprehensive on booking this hotel because the reviews were either great or horrible, however, I could not of been more pleased. I was traveling with my wife and two children ages 7 and 11. The hotel pool and beach area were perfect for them. My son loved snorkling so much that it was hard to get him out of the water. Plenty of fish to look at along the rock wall they constructed to make their lagoon. The pool was clean and inviting with plenty of chairs. We mostly sat at the beach and had the attendant put up an umbrella, always tipped a couple of dollars and they remembered for the next day. Service was excellent at the towel hut and a couple of dollars tip goes a long way in getting good service. There was bingo and pina colada tasting every day, the rest of the advertised activities did not always appear to go off. There was always day old bread available to feed the fish off their pier which went into the Atlantic. The hotel lobby was open air and reminded me a hotels in Hawaii. For a hotel nearly 60 years old this hotel was renovated to stay up with the times. Got my room on Priceline for $110 a night so I was sure I would get a room on the first floor looking at the AC units or dumpsters. Was pleasantly surprised to get a room in the HHonor Tower (I am only a HH blue) room 766 looking out at the Atlantic. The room was modern and the bathroom was luxury. The shower was a huge walking in shower with two shower heads including a rainfall shower head which was great for a tall person as myself. Never had any problems with hot water as some had mentioned, but I am not up before 6am. I believe all rooms are non-smoking as they mentioned this at check-in was the Puerto Rican law, which was perfect as I hate smoking rooms. They had very comfortable beds which had down feather pillows and comforter which my wife is allergic to, so I had housekeeping come make up new beds, which actually took three seperate trips. However, my wife gave the housekeeper a $20 tip and she was more than happy to get it taken care of. Must of had the same housekeeper take care of our room a couple of days later as we got extra towels, soap, and toiletries. It is amazing what a few kind words and a couple of dollars can do to improve the attitude of the workers around you. Breakfast a Palmeras was excellent and the kids eat for free. Dinner was good at the hotel, but we eat most of the meals outside of breakfast away from the hotel or at the beach. $10 - $12 cab ride got you into Old San Juan which is a beautiful old city. $22 - $25 cab ride to the airport. Rented a car to go the El Yunque rainforest. Easy to drive around Puerto Rico and was not as dangerous as travel books had indicated.Overall we had a great time. My wife and kids said it was one of the best vacations that they ever had. We typically stay at Hyatt or Marriott's and I would rate the Hilton at the same standard as these type of establishments.Enjoy your trip to Puerto Rico.
