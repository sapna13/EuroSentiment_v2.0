{"text":"Good Location - Get the right floor. We arrived at 09:30 AM on New Years Eve somewhat tired after a poor flight from Singapore. I had read the previous reviews about noise levels and as it was New Years Eve had requested a high level room.When we checked in we were given a room on the first floor, and even after some discussion was told this was the only one available. We went to the room which was located on the corner of George Street and an Alley way down the side. It was gloomy and smelled of smoke, and was noisey at 10:00 in the morning. We went back to reception and was tol that the manager had found a 2 bed appartment on the 9th floor if we were not hppy with the previous one.A much better room and location, however the rooms are showing signs of age and could do with a major makeover. The rooms were however clean, and cleaned on a daily basis.Interesting views over George Street, New Years eve was noisey with the windows open, however the Double Glazing worked very well.Location is brilliant for the whole of Sydney, we were able to pop back during the day to drop shopping, pick up water etc.The cooking and washing facilities are OK, more for doing a pizza than anything more elaborate, however they do have all the things you would need to cook a 3 course meal.Overall a good place to spend 5 days in the City, would go back again.
