{"text":"Don't Stay Here -- Unless You are on Spring Break My husband and I stayed at the Outrigger on the Beach with my parents recently. I was very distraught that I had made the arrangments for us to stay here while my brother was getting married at the Halekulani down the street. You enter the hotel on the busiest strip of Waikiki Beach, which is certainly not the Hawaii of serene Paradise but of cheesy t-shirts shops, chain restaurants and hoards of people. As we ascended the elevator I noticed only the horribly ugly rugs that cover the lobby area and, again, hoards of people in line for one of the Outrigger's three restaurants. Our rooms were ocean view on the 3rd floor. My parents room had an obstructed view and was very small. Our room was bigger and had a full ocean view (we paid the same rate). We thought we were the lucky ones until we opened our sliding glass doors to hear the noise from Duke's Waikiki right below our balcony. It was loud out there until well after midnight and, after that, the noise moved to the hotel hallways. In the end, it was not horrible and it was not wonderful, it was just simply fine and disappointing given some of the other hotels we saw on the strip. The place had an overall feeling of Spring Break or Girls Gone Wild. Duke's was a madhouse most of the day and we fell asleep each night to some bad Jimmy Buffet song streaming up through our room as the backdrop to drunk people laughing and carrying on. Now, I am not against a good time but when a hotel bar will only give you one drink per person and you are traveling with people in their 40s and 60s, this has got to be a sign. If you want a relaxing stay (tough for Waikiki) at a beautiful hotel, travel further down the beach and spring for the Halekulani! ","annotations":[]}
