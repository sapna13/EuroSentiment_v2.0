{"text":"Never again! We booked through Continental Guest Services from August 3-8, a continental club floor corner room. We booked a package which included several tours and 3 Broadway shows. We had to pre-pay for this package.We arrived early around 10 AM. We were told to check back around 1 PM in the event our room would be available. We went back around 1:30 PM and were told that a platinum starwood guest still occupied our room and the guest had the privilege to check our at 4 PM. I asked if we could have another room and I was told that it wouldn't be a club floor room but we'd have club floor privileges and a $100 credit. I agreed since my husband and I were dying to shower, and I was assured that the next day, Monday they'd take care of moving our luggage from our current room to the room we'd reserved and paid for in advance as long as I'd packed everything.We got back from our shopping tour Monday after 8 PM. I went to the front desk to get our keys for our new room. Guess what, the room hadn't been cleaned, and our stuff hadn't been moved. Can you imagine, unpacking, packing, and unpacking again in a span of 1 night? Not a good way to start a vacation.My husband was upset because he already felt cheated. There was no manager to face us or anybody in authority to offer us compensation for their shortcomings. I was told to return the next day. I went back Tuesday morning and was offered an additional $300 credit for our troubles.On hindsight, had it not been for the Broadway shows (Little Mermaid, Legally Blonde and Wicked) we really shouldn't have booked a package, because had we not prepaid, we'd have left the Westin the very next day. The hotel is conveniently located for watching shows, but the service, coordination, and hospitality is very poor. It just didn't make sense to me that a room would be left uncleaned, and that there was no housekeeping staff on duty at night.The experience at Westin Times Square has totally turned us off from booking with any other Starwood properties in the future!
