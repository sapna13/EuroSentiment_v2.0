{"text":"Better than expected Our visit to this hotel was with a degree of trepidation given some of the adverse comments on Trip Adviser. What we found was a high quality hotel in a quiet area of the City.A nice touch was, on arrival we were given a pack which included a very good travel guide for Florence and the invite to book a welcome dinner that evening. We took advantage of the dinner offer and found the food to be of a good standard and the waiters very accommodating,which added to our perception of value for money. All other extras in the Hotel are quite expensive, but then so is most of Florence.We opted for a deluxe room which was of ample proprtions and very comfortable. The quality of decoration and furnishings throughout the hotel is of the highest standard.The Hotel only has about 60 rooms and during our stay was a tranquil oasis after the hustle and bustle of the City centre. Under local ordinance smoking was also prohibited in all the inside public areas,a feature we found particularly attractive. However the Hotel did have the benefit of a very attractive outside courtyard area where such restrictions did not apply. The breakfast buffet will satisfy most guests, but if your expectation is for hot foods you will be disappointed. Rubbery scrambled egg, fatty strips of bacon and sausages better not described are the only offer here. Much comment has been made about staff attitudes and perhaps it has been the odd experience which has given rise to these very negative views. We did, on one morning, encounter at breakfast, a head waitress who spoke to us like errant school children when we were having difficulty with the orange machine. But that incident apart we found the staff to be reserved, efficient and always polite and friendly.As for location, we found it perfect. Only 5 minutes by taxi from the main train station and an easy 10 minute walk into the City centre. Indeed the stroll along the river was very pleasant and certainly not arduous. Florence is a City full of of superlatives and there can be few better Hotels than this, to use as your base, for exploring all that it has to offer.
