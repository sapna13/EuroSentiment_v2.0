{"text":"Trash Dumpster with a box spring mattress First time in Puerto Rico..read all reviews and this sounded like a good way to spend less on hotel and more time on beach. After arriving at this place..I wouldn't even stay here at the Coqui Inn if it was free! To even call it a hotel or Inn is incorrect. The rooms are similiar to a dirty gas station restroom with a bed in it. There was a box spring on the tile floor with a thin foam piece on top covered with some of the dirtiest sheets and comforter I've ever seen. There was a huge hole in the side of the concrete wall where they had put an air conditioning unit but it didn't quite fit so there was a pillow stuffed on one side and cardboard on the other. The door was similar to a screen door with a colored plexiglass piece covering the opening where a screen would go. The fact we were given a 'key' to lock it was hilarious. The shower had a HOSE coming out of the wall with no shower head at all on it - just water spewing from a tap! I can't believe management, with a clear conscious, can take money from people to stay here. It is beyond a youth hostel..it's a dump with a ceiling over it. NOT across the street form the beach and in a pretty shady part of town. We DID NOT stay here. We didn't get any refund but left anyway. If you have to go this route to save money on your hotel..it's worth staying home a few more months and saving your money up so you can stay in one of the real hotels in San Jaun and feel safe and enjoy your time on the beach. We transferred over to the InterContinental and had a wonderful time. I only wish I took pictures to post online so people could compare the 'real' photos to the pictures the 'inn' has posted...a joke! The funniest part is that they are advertised EVERYWHERE on the island..spend less on ads and more on providing a decent place for people to stay! Or take yourself off the map! ","annotations":[]}
