{"text":"Honestly--This Is A Great Hotel I chose this hotel as for my budget it was the top rated hotel-No 5,and every positive report seen was true.We had an e-mail the day before we travelled to confirm room would be ready,so no nasty shocks upon arrival, cannot find booking and full.---great PR that e-mail.The staff at reception upon arrival were friendly and helpful and our room 1400(I reqested a high room when booking in January), was clean and airy. The furniture was clean and the beds were very comfortable with good mattresses and most important of all the bed linen was pristine whiteThe bathroom was very clean and well supplied with a few extras like cotton balls and buds and tissues and of course the YELLOW DUCK.In the room too we had a small room off,for cases, hanging spaces, an ironing board, umbrella and safe.The TV was good with stacks of channelsand we also had a modern alarm clock into which you could plug your MP player.Down stairs you have a lobby,bar and resturant with FREE tea or coffee and cookies from mid afternoon till evening time.The staff were very friendly (especially Mao in the resturant-a little gem) and all were very proffesional in they're jobs .The location of the hotel is a plus point too, being only 250 yards from Bart station, overlooking Union Square with all the best shops you could wish for nearby and a cable car stop outside the hotel. This hotel has been set up and run to care for its clients and it does so in a very efficient manner, I will, upon my return to SF hopefully in not too distant future, return to this hotel , not bothering to look elsewhere. I can say honestly, hand on heart this establishment is a credit to the city and I would without question recommend it to anyone.Read reports in Tripadvisor about other hotels--rip offs, dodgy areas, paperthin walls and torn dirty bed linen---you will get nothing like that here---what they promise in the brochures is exactly what you get and delivered in a friendly proffesional manner.
