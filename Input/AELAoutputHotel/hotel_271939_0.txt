{"text":"Great location, good value - would stay again We spent a tiny bit more than we planned, but it was beyond worth it. The hotel was located near so many sites - Notre Dame, City Hall, the Senate, Luxembourg Gardens, and within walking distance of the Louvre. It was also near metro stops and a train stop. Not to mention there were tons of restaurants nearby. Just ask the front desk where to go or walk around near Notre Dame for fast food type of stuff.The rooms were small, but not so small as to be a nuisance. They were very clean - no problems there whatsoever. There was enough room to not be tripping over your suitcases all week. (We stayed in two different rooms since we left mid-week for Normandy. They even let us leave behind one of our suitcases while we travelled! I was nervous but nothing went missing, etc.)We skipped the breakfast at the hotel. I believe it was 10 euros per person and we knew we could beat that price. One day we had a full breakfast for 18 euros and every other day we grabbed croissants  coffee for around 7 euros total.The hotel had free computer access, which came in very handy. It's located inside a little booth, so not the best set-up, but really no problem. It was a great help. They also posted the forecast every day.No real complaints about the staff. We met a gentleman named Bruno on our second to last night and wished we had met him sooner! It was a pleasure chatting with him!
