{"text":"Just so-so I used trip advisor review as a major part of my decision to stay at the Intercontinental, as well as a friends recommendation. We had stayed at the Ritz previously. I booked an ocean view rm and the price at the time of my stay was approx 400+ dollars plus the daily resort fee. We arrived around 1 pm and did have to wait for the normal check in time. Our room was gorgeous and had a great view. However, the walls were literally paper thin. Every day I would go up to the room around noon and there were children in the room directly next to us, they were singing and jumping on the beds, throwing objects against the wall and so on. This would go on until early evening, I never saw them, or an adult. I found that very strange. The beach was very nice but you had to reserve and pay for an umbrella. The pool area was nice, just small. The weather was very hot and very bright, no complaints. I think the one thing that really really surprised me was the cost of food there. Make no mistake, it might as well be Hawaii or the caribbean. Lunch at the beach restaurant for two daily was over $50 and we are talking pizza or salads. I was very disappointed in the housekeeping, very hit or miss. Some days I had to call after 4pm as they had not been there and we really needed at least more towels so we could get ready for dinner. We ate at Ruth Chris as well as the Palm and the food was very good but very very expensive. The hotel Italian restaurant was very good, very very expensive. I would guess each meal was close to $200 for two. The elevators were very hit and miss as well and as I read reviews today, I wonder why that problem cannot be fixed.some days only one elevator and it is a long wait. So I guess I would end my review by saying this hotel never lived up to my expectations, perhaps I had set them too high?The casino was very sad, very few machines and it seems there are no rules as to dress and behavior. I saw many many people eating food they had obviously brought from home -it just did not add to a resort atmosphere. Did gamble at the El San Juan, just lovely and what a beautiful lobby and bar area.
