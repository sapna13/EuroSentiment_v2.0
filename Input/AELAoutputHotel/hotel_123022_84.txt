{"text":"Pretty good but not my favorite We stayed in this hotel while on our honeymoon which was a road trip. I booked 2 nights at this hotel based on the reviews on here, and it seemed like a good value.We arrived and had no problem checking in and found our room to be quite spacious. We had french doors that opened out on to the road, but it was frustrating that there were no privacy shades. It was pretty much either have the curtains open or closed. Since we were on the 4th floor, people could see in from across the street, so a little privacy, as opposed to no sunlight, would have been nice.There are 2 elevator areas, but the 1 elevator by our room was really slow. You could spend 2 or 3 minutes waiting, which for a building with only 7 floors was irritating.The shuttle was okay, we went to the market, and then walked to the EMP and the Space Needle. The first night we were unsure how far away we were, but it only took us about a half hour to walk, and being that it was nice out, it wasn't a problem.We took advantage of the free laundry machines, but there was only 1 washer and 1 dryer for each floor. I ran from floor to floor checking for an open machine, which was annoying. I think next time I'd just pay to have it done by dropping it at the front desk.There is wireless on the 3rd floor lounge area only, and if you want to connect in the room, you have to have your own cable. Since I'm used to wireless, I had to buy a cable in the gift shop for $5. Just was a little annoying as every hotel we've stayed at on this trip (even Days Inns, etc) has had free in-room wireless.Restaurants across the street are great, and we LOVED I love sushi and BluWater Bistro. Stix is also fun for drinks and billiards.I guess I was a little disappointed in the nitpicky details, but overall it was a good hotel for a good price. ","annotations":[]}
