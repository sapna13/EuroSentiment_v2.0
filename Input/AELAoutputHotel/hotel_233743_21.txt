{"text":"Bassano Definitely Above Average Stayed in Paris for 3 nights as part of a small European tour (London, Paris, Barcelona). I have posted hotel reviews for all these locations.Booked Bassano on strength of Trip posts. We were upgraded to a Superior room, and I am beginning to wonder if they even have an Standard rooms, based on other reviews. However the room was quite nice. Only complaint is the seperate WC (as most are in France) was right there as you walked in the door, and the shower was on the other side of the room. Kinda strange configuration.We were able to switch to another room for the remaining two nights of our stay. It has a much better configuration, with a small hallway leading into the room, and the WC next to the shower \/ washroom. Get one of these rooms if you can.Overall the hotel was clean and quiet, even though windows open to the street. Very soundproof windows. There was a few areas where the hotel is showing its age, a little paint peeling here and there. A staff member indicated the entire hotel will soon be undergoing a significant renovation. However it was not that bad and did not detract from our stay.As with the Chesterfield Hotel in London, staff here were excellent, and most helpful in all respects. Location of hotel was one of the features, and we were very happy with being able to walk to le Champs and many major attractions. For breakfast we ate at boulangeries instead of the hotel, and saved about 50% of the cost vs. the hotel. As travellers know, breakfast at any hotel anywhere is usually 2 to 4 times the cost at a regular local diner. Last day was a Sunday and there was nothing open, so we ate at hotel and it was very good. Had two dinners in Paris, Laduree on the Champs Eleysee (on the recommendation of Frommers, somewhat disappointing) and at La Fermette Malbouf (on the recommendation of the Bassnano), which was truly fantastic. Both about same price at 90 EUR for 2. Would probably stay again. ","annotations":[]}
