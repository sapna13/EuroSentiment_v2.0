{"text":"Superb!!!!!!!! We just came back yesterday from our trip to Berlin. The trip itself was great. We love Berlin. The hotel was superb. It is located central, near to the 'fernsehtur'. We had a room at the 34 floor, in the corner off the building. We had 2 windows . One looked out at the fernsehtur and the other to another part of the city. What a view, we almost could see the whole city. The room was superb too. It was very clean. We loved the bed. We had a bathroom with bath. Everything in the room looked new (except the television, but it worked fine and we didn't really use it).The room was cleaned everyday and provided with clean towels. The breakfast was great too. I loved the Kaiserbrotchen and the scrumbled egg. The only thing that I can mention as a minor point is, that the coffee was not strong enough. But that was no problem, because near the Fernsehtur there is a Starbucks (there is no better coffee then Starbucks-coffee). On our last day we went for the Spa. 20 euros for a massage and after that you can use the sauna and chill out as long as you like. It was great. All the major sightseeings are nearby the hotel. There is a subway-station in front of the hotel, that can bring you anywhere. The public transport in Berlin is great, also because it still goes at night. Overall I think there is no better place to stay in Berlin.
