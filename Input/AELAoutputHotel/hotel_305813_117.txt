{"text":"The people make the difference If you expect people in HK to speak English fluently, I think you would be disappointed that most people do not speak the language, or at least pretend that they do not know. If not for the hotel staff in providing me with the utmost detail of what I needed to know, I would have had difficulty navigating through the streets of HK. I was especially thankful of Stephen Poon, the assistant manager on duty the evening of my arrival. Without his willingness to help my wife and I, our honeymoon through HK would not have been as good. The staff at the Langham will take the extra effort to make your time worthwhile. The facility itself is clean and neatly organized. The rooms might not be big, but they are made for the techie that I am. If you have not checked out the bathrooms, check out other people's photos. Yes they are transparent.The hotel sits in a pretty interesting area of the city. If you walk out to the Eastern exit, you will encounter the various shopping districts of Hong Kong from the ladies market to the electronics mecca of HK. To the Western side you can find the local street market where they sell anything from live chicken and seafood to the strangest looking so called food you can ever find anywhere. In all, a good place to stay. BTW, we ordered the pickup and dropoff service to the airport provided by the hotel (at a cost of course), and was happy with the service even if it was not cheap. It was convenient to have someone take you from door to door without much hassle.
