{"text":"Well worth the money The overall holiday was excellent, nice beach, nice hotel and nice food. The hotel is kept clean and tidy and your room is cleaned everyday. The hotel room itself is comfortable with a big big bath and a huge bed. You have access to television and there is some english speakingchannels and you also get a mini bar in the room which is stocked every day with soft drinks, water and Brahma beer. All balconies and terraces have a hammock which is nice to sit and have a drink on in the evening. The hotel itself is very spacious even though there is a lot of people there. The lagoon is very nice to walk through and look at the wildlife and feed the ducks. There is two buffet resteraunts both have a wide selection of different food everyday and the main buffet has a different theme every night such as Italian or Carribbean. As well as the two buffetsthere is 4 al a carte resteraunts they are nice to go too for a change however they do not offer a vegetarian option on their menus. Overall the Mexican was our favourite of the four al a carte resteraunts. The Japaneese and the Parisienne were also very impressive however the Rodeo Steak house was a bit of a let down. The main bars have a wide selection of local and international drinks, but they only have one lager (beer as they call it) and it's not very nice. I lived on coctails while I was there, Banana Mama's all the way. There is also a bar on the beach which is open till 5.The people who work there are very nice and friendly, even though they seem to work long hours, also a few tips here and there doesn't go a miss. The animation team are brilliant and keep the whole atmosphere going and try to get everyone involved but if you dont want to do anything you can do that.  The beach is gorgeous and is nice to relax on and sip a few cocktails. Overall a good holiday to relax.
