{"text":"The Melia is the place!!!!! If you are looking for a place that is great this is the place to be. My Husband and I and 42 of our friends and family stayed at the Melia Resort for 5 nites 6 days for our destination wedding. We were a little skeptical at first with the distant wedding planning. But baby the Dominicans know how to prepare a wedding. The first day we arrived we were greeted with such warmth and caring that we thought we were dreaming. The rooms are out of this world. The Royal Service is the way to go. Our Butler (Juan) kept us comfortable and wanting for nothing. The wedding planner(Evelyn) was awesome. We met her 24 hours before the wedding and we thought this is too late, she will never be able to pull all this together for the next day. Well Evelyn and the Grupos Staff were awesome the ceremony was so romantic and beautiful. Every request we made was followed through to the T.The reception was set up perfectly. The food was fresh and the cake was the best tasting wedding cake I have tasted in a long time. Besides the wedding event the Resort was huge and beautiful with lots of events happening and all night dancing in several places.The drinks were amazing and so was the food at the restaurants especially The Gabbi in Royal Service. The ATV excursion was great and worth the money. The weather was good and if it rained it lasted like 10 minutes. Whether you spend a day at the pool with the DJ playing music, the swim up bar making great drinks or a day at the beach you are going to have a ball. We did not want to leave. Keep up the good work Melia!!!!!!! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":973,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":969}]}
