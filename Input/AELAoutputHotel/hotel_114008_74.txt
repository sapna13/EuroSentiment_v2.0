{"text":"Faded Beauty I have been staying at the Kahala since the 1970s and have always had wonderful memories of the hotel. It is still a great hotel but it is looking a little worse for the wear these days.The fundamentals are still in place, but the hotel itself is looking tired. The location is fabulous - in the tony Kahala section of Honolulu, just the other side of Diamond Head from downtown - it is a great alternative to the touristy and unappealing Waikiki. The sandy and sheltered semi-private beach is beautiful and is a gorgeous backdrop for a seaside breakfast. Views from the rooms take in Koko Head, Kahala Beach, the neighboring golf club or the interior mountains of Oahu, and many of the rooms have terraces. The staff at the hotel were as they have always been to a person, lovely, and many have worked at the hotel in its various itinerations for years.However, for a Leading Hotels of the World property, the shabby condition of the lobby and guest room furnishings is fairly inexcusable and a little sad. The hotel looks like it hasn't had a freshening since it was dropped by the Mandarin group several years ago. Also, it looks like they have cut back on housekeeping services and it is difficult to expect a room cleaning much before 12pm.I have a bit of a sentimental attachment to the property, but a more discriminating guest might be a little disappointed by the current state of the facility. That being said, apart from the very nice (and very expensive) Halekulani (with its smaller rooms and Waikiki location), there is very little alternative to this nice old hotel in Honolulu.
