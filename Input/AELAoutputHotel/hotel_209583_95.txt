{"text":"Here's the real deal on the Palace... Want to make sense of the wide range of reviews of the Palace? Read on, for here's the real deal. The Barcelo Bavaro Palace is a slightly upscaled version of the many all inclusive resorts on DR and throughout the Caribbean. As an all inclusive that means: large buffets of mainly mediocre food, watered down drinks, basic caribbean service (meaning slow, especially at check in and check out). Second, the DR is a poor country. That means: watch your belongings, use the safe, bring some US $ for tips and other items. Third, the complex is spanish owned, and caters mainly to Europeans, not Americans, so don't expect staff to speak much English, don't expect super high-end rooms and facilities, etc. The good parts of the Bavaro Palace: the beach is spectacular (among the best in the Caribbean), and the Palace is situated on the best part of the beach, with many, many palm trees for shade, lots of chairs, gentle surf. This is by far the best feature of this property. The pool is also very nice, large and nicely laid out, also lots of chairs (you don't have to worry about getting up at 6 am to reserve your spot). The layout is fun for kids, and the swim-up bar is fun for grownups. They do not have a hot tub, though-just a bubbler in part of the pool. Also, the staff are friendly and helpful, especially if you smile, speak a little spanish, and give a US $ or 2 for tips. The grounds are well maintained and lush. The hotel and complex have a good security service. The shuttle tram to other properties is fun and works fine. The hotel in late March was fairly quiet, not full (may be good or bad, depending). They have some fun pool and water aerobics. The male staff like to flirt (also may be good or bad, depending). Beach hut massages are great and not expensive. The not-so-good parts: the rooms are not particularly luxurious, and the walls are paper thin. If you have a problem with your room, don't expect it to be fixed very quickly. The water is not drinkable, so expect to drink bottled water. The gof course is passable, nothing special. The special restaurants--aren't. If you get bored at the hotel, there are excursions, but most aren't worth the time and $. The shows, casino and other aspects of the resort are merely OK. A note on turista: It is easy to get sick from the food and water. We had several people in our group come down with GI problems. To reduce your risk: eat food freshly prepared (they have excellent grilled fish, steak, chicken, made to order omlettes, etc); avoid fruit, lettuce, mayo; eat dishes as they come out of the kitchen, not those sitting around for four hours. Don't eat the ice or let it melt much in your drink. (beer was popular with our group). Bring Pepto Bismol, Immodium, and Purel. Bottom line: The Palace (and Punta Cana) is a reasonable place to spend a week relaxing at the beach and pool. If your expectations match the reality, you can have a fine time at the Palace. If you want real luxury, go somewhere else (I jogged up the beach to the Paradisus, which looks much more upscale, but actually a bit out of place in the DR). If you want to do a lot of sightseeing and activities, think about going somewhere besides Punta Cana.
