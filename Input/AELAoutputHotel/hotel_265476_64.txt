{"text":"Hotel de Londres Eiffel I booked this hotel based on what I read from Tripadvisor and this was the BEST advise I have gotten. This hotel is very sweet and quaint I might say. Quite neighborhood. We stayed 3 nights the first week of Feb 2007. We paid 105 euros a night . The staff was very nice. Our room was very clean and the best olive soap, Queen Bed was firm and comfortable. Too cool was the flat screen T.V. with remote. Free Internet access is available in the lobby and offered english newspaper. Only two tiny things you need to know.........#1. The shower stall is really small. So If you are larger than us you might have a problem... I am 5'3 size 18 and my husband is 6'1 220 lbs. We were cutting it tight. It must have been made for smurfs......But The bathroom was Newly Remodeled ....Crisp and Clean  Modern. I loved that. #2. They DO NOT OFFER washcloths (facecloths). We had to go buy us kitchen cloths from the grocery store. I had to have something. :-). Our room ....I think it was room 24 .......it was facing the street...they are also small but that is the European style right. It was sooo cute. We went go downstairs and ask for ice.........they gave us 7 cubes. How funny. Better than nothing I suppose. Around the block we found a great little bar....in the mornings we would go there for our coffee....We did not eat at the hotel we just grab a roll from the bakery on our way to catch the sightseeing bus........and we would eat a big lunch somewhere. Also at night we would stop at the grocery store by the hotel get some salami  cheese and then stop at the bakery get some bread then go to our room and eat and have a mixed drink. We were tooooo tired to wait for the restaurants to open up for the evening and went to bed by 10pm.  We really like the location the most. The hotel is in a very short walking distance to the Eiffel Tower. Around the block from the hotel was a grocery store, liquor store, bars, and across the street is a Laundromat. We were in Paris 2-days. That was plenty for us. We saw everything we wanted to see......Eiffel Tower, Notre Dam, Louvre, etc. What we did was walk to the tower and catch the red double decker sightseeing buses.......2-days for 22 euros. Unlimited - on and off access. This was great. They have think over dozen drop-offs. One time we were tired.....and the sun was out that day.......so we just rode the whole route and sat up top and enjoyed the views. You see everything. They pickup every 10 min. This was cool.
