{"text":"Pleasantly surprised Stayed at the Elan the weekend of June 8-9, 2007. My employer usually uses Le Meridien, which is around the corner on La Cienega, but it closed on the 9th for a long renovation. Sofitel just up the street was too expensive.The Elan lived up to the promises made on its Web site. It is a clean, simple, small property in a fabulous location. I walked to WeHo nightlife, breakfast and shopping on 3rd Street, dinner, and shopping at the Beverly Center. In fact, I valet parked my car at 5 p.m. on Friday and had no need to drive again until 2 p.m. on Saturday---very unusual for L.A.!I stayed in room 209 which is on the street side, southwest corner. I recommend the room unless you are super-sensitive to street noise, as it had its own private balcony. Views weren't great, but from one corner of the balcony I could see the Hollywood Hills. Directly across the street was a Taco Bell and a Goodwill Store; to the west, Macy's and Bloomingdale's were so close, you could practically throw a baseball and hit the side of their building.Room itself was fairly spare but had everything one would need, and it was very clean. Modern, well-appointed, nice carpeting, good furniture, good bed, nice linens, and a clean bathroom with good quality soaps and shampoos. Honor bar. FREE wireless internet. Yes, FREE. You don't get that in the fancy places!I got a rate of $169\/night through my corporate travel agent, which beat the hotel's own Web site by $20\/night. Valet parking was $16\/night, which isn't cheap but not bad, really. There are nearby meters and when I did use my car, I sometimes parked at a meter rather than go through the whole valet drop-off procedure. Not to worry, though: when you call for your car, it's usually curbside within three minutes; the garage is under the building.There aren't many amenties on-site, but, really, who cares? You can walk to shopping, restaurants, nightlife, etc. There's a very small fitness center with 3 or 4 treadmills and stair machines. But it's L.A., for goodness sake, so if you want to go running, you just hit the streets. (Actually, I recommend visiting Runyon Canyon Park for a fun hike\/run and incredible views of the L.A. city basin; about a 10 or 15 minute drive from the hotel.)Room rate includes continental breakfast in the lobby. This was really quite decent: cereals, pastries, fresh fruit, yogurt, juices, coffee\/tea. What more do you need? Plenty of tables and seating areas, with views onto Beverly Blvd., where you can eat. Also some seating on patio.There is a small business center room with a computer and printer, where I printed out my boarding pass for flight home, plus a small conference table. Nothing fancy, but if you needed to have a little business meeting with a few associates, it would be fine.Staff were uniformly pleasant, cheerful, helpful, from the valet\/doorman guy to the desk clerk to the maids. No complaints there.One thing I was puzzled about was what the views are from the rooms that are on the inner corridor. As I mentioned, I was in a room on the exterior of the building, on a corner, but the hallway went in a full rectangle, so the inner rooms must look out onto some sort of courtyard or something. I would ask for a room onto the back alley or onto the street, myself. Again, I highly recommend room 209, as it's a corner room with balcony.So often you book a room at a hotel that looks kinda cool on the Web site, and then you get there only to have your expectations not met and your hopes dashed. The Elan was a pleasant surprise. Keep your expectations realistic (this ain't the Four Seasons, folks), and you'll be happy. Need nightlife? Lots nearby, and apparently the bar at the aforementioned Sofitel, a 3-minute walk, has quite the scene.
