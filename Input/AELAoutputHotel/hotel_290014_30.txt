{"text":"Room was nice, staff has major attitude problems!!! Based on the TA reviews, we booked 7 nights at this hotel. Yes, we were aware of the distance to the center of the city, but we did not mind. In fact, we wanted to stay away from the hustle and bustle of the tourist areas.Upon checking in, we were greeted by a front desk person with a snobby attitude, who didn't want to be bothered with some of our touristy questions.The room was very clean but small, we had a standard double, and got a fairly decent price, but I'm sure we didn't get the best price. They even have a menu of pillows in case you want to request a special pillow. They also had a TV internet for 10 euros for 24 hours if you wanted to use it. Breakfast came with the room, and you could have it delivered to the room for 6.5 euros.The breakfast was 'American Fare', with some cheese and meats. The breakfast servers were absolutely AWFUL! They walked around like militant food watchers. If you put a croissant into the toaster, they were all over you. You'd think they would put a sign up that said no croissants in the toaster. Also, when we tried to get coffee to go, they said NO, we have room service if you want that. Hmmm...that's not the kind of service I'd expect from a 4 star hotel.When we tried to call the reception to get a restaurant reservation, the night desk clerk actually had the nerve to tell me to call back in the morning, and that the morning person could help me. I made the call to the restaurant myself and got a reservation, but had to pay .45 cents for the call. What kind of service is that.Finally, they advertise that they make train reservations, well, they DO NOT! They will print the schedule, but then they tell you that you need to go to the train station and buy your tickets.In summary, although the hotel, boasts that it is a 4 star hotel, yes, the rooms were clean, nice marble bathrooms, but the quality of the customer service is right down there with a 1 star hotel.BEWARE if you book this place, you'll enjoy the room but you need to take care of yourself!
