{"text":"Great location but many problems I stayed in this hotel for ten days. I booked it through United Airlines vacation packages. As I told one of the very rude staff women at the front desk, I have been to 35 countries and traveled the world since 1978. When I ask a question, I want an answer not a smark remark. I would ask simple questions and get either a blank look or a curt reply. I had read in a book that the Dutch were down to earth and direct. Well, at this hotel that translated to rude and nasty. I asked one front desk person the same question twice because I forgot the bus number she had given me the day before. Didn't I tell you that yesterday, she snarled. The room service was deplorable. I got a very small bath soap which after some four days, was reduced to a nub. I had to leave a note to get a replacement. Since I am a participant in the Green Movement, I did not request that my linen be changed daily. Therefore, my towels were tossed in the tub by the staff instead of being folded. Two days in a row, my trash can was not emptied. Maybe I was on the wrong floor, but this service was deplorable. The coffee was cold in the breakfast buffet and I had to wait 25 minutes, yep, 25 minutes for scrambled eggs when they ran out half way through the posted breakfast time. When I needed ice, I had a 15 minute wait at the bar. No ice machine - you stand there and wait until they get damn good and ready to give you ice. As I said, the location was good and noise was not an issue. But the service and the staff: deplorable.
