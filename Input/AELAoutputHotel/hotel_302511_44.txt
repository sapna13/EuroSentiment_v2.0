{"text":"Don't stay here! After a wonderful ten days in The Maldives and six amazing days in Koh Samui, we stayed in this terrible hotel on our way home. (We are seasoned travellers and this is the first time i have felt compelled to complain about a hotel).I tried to book this hotel from their website but the website was down and it said to book through the hotel directly. I called the hotel and told them the site was down and said that i had still wanted to get the internet rate, they said okay. Well, we get to the hotel... off to a bad start! There was the longest line to check in and the guy we had to deal with was a rude pig. Maybe they need to get more staff! I explain the whole internet deal with the guy at the front desk. He refuses point blank to accommodate me. So we end up paying 315 singapore dollars. Rip off. He then tells us we will get a free mini bar included in cost. I then requested a quiet room as we were very tired from travelling all day. By this time it is 9.30pm. I also requested a room with a nice view. The guy says 'no problem'. So, we get up to our room, he has put us across from the maid's room! Early the next morning all we here is banging and talking. Probably the noisiest room he could have given us in the whole hotel. The 'free mini bar' consisted of two soft drinks, two beers and a chocolate bar. Wow! Are they kidding? We open our curtains to take a look at our 'nice view' and much to my dismay, he has given us a room looking directly at the tops of the trees! The ocean views were definitely not visable from our room. This guy was an absolute jerk. The next morning, having been woken up at the crack of dawn by the maids banging and crashing, we head down to breakfast. We were not even offered tea and coffee, and when we finally asked for some tea, the water was stone cold. The 'hot' food on the buffet was also cold. The miso soup was as cold as a glass of icy water. Total nightmare. Such a disapointing way to end our amazing holiday.One plus, is that the hotel has been recently renovated and was quite tastefully done. The rooms are definitely not worth $315!I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
