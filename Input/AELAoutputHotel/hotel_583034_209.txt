{"text":"Disaster Honeymoon thanks to Royal Service We stayed here for 11 days. When you break down what we paid it was $500 a day. Which I feel is a lot of money for what we recived. If you were to go someplace and give yourself a budget of $500 a day for food, room and drinks and recieve the service and food quality that you recive at Paradisus you would be upset. The food was OK but nothing was ever the right temperature. The lobster was cold, the soup was cold, yet lunch meats were warm and slimy. You had to wait up to a half hour for a drink and 20 mintues for someone to take your dinner order. Here is a tip HIRE MORE PEOPLE. The Royal Service is a RIPOFF and the staff in the office is rude and not very helpful. The butlers are a joke. Everyone has their hand out looking for a tip for mediocre at best service. It discusts me that this is considered a 5 star hotel. The atmosphere is the only reason it gets this rating. Staff, Service and food quality are a big fat ZERO. If you must go here I can only offer some tips:Do not book royal service, Do not eat at Bana, Do bring a bottle of water to all meals so you do not have to wait for a drink, bring lots of singles because nobody will break a 20 for you. Don't wander off the resort. Take immodium with you and insense or a candle to mask the musty room smell ","annotations":[{"endOffset":450,"mention":"soup","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soup"],"startOffset":446},{"endOffset":450,"mention":"soup","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soup"],"startOffset":446},{"endOffset":450,"mention":"soup","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soup"],"startOffset":446},{"endOffset":450,"mention":"soup","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Soup"],"startOffset":446}]}
