{"text":"Dissapointing My wife, my son, his friend and I stayed at this resort 7 days, from December 23rd through 30th, 2007. This was our fifth trip to Dominican Republic but first time at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach. During our stay at the resort it became apparent that Barcelo Bavaro Beach resort is the worst we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever stayed at among mid priced all-inclusive resorts. The appearance of the premises and the service attitude of the staff were less than appealing. Unlike other resorts we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in, there were no smiles, no greetings, and the overall attitude of the staff was just very poor. We felt like we were bothering them or they were doing us a big favor every time we asked something to be corrected, from asking a replacement keys when we were locked outside our rooms to clean our room when it was already 4pm, or to fix our leaking toilet that was flooding the floors. We met with other families from U.S. and none of them had anything good to say about the resort either. We almost felt like that we were the fortunate ones. We heard from bed bug infestations, leaking toilets and broken A\/C units to mold on the ceilings. This resort was built ca 1985, which was apparent. Bars serve local liquors (their whisky makes a good paint thinner) and anything better is $3 to $5 per drink.But the worst was the rude attitude the staff had towards our son√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ friend who is Cuban-American. The staff assumed him being a Dominican and treated him accordingly with no respect whatsoever. He was denied access to the disco when our son, who is two years younger but white, never had a problem getting in. This happened even after we had complained to the manager who assured that there would be no further problems. I could not believe that in this day and age anyone should be witnessing anything like this, and in an international Caribbean resort no less. We never book these vacations to expect any culinary highlights, but unfortunately also the food quality was disappointing compared to other resorts we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed in. Not to mention their √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºnack bar√à√\u2020\u2022?offerings were downright embarrassing.The beach was only ok and not as well kept as with the other resorts. It was very windy when we were there. Beach towels are not always available and you may have to wait hours for the clean ones.We won't be back. If you have not yet booked your vacation I recommend you look elsewhere.
