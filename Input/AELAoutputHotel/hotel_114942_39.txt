{"text":"Loved the restuarant not the hotel I spent last weekend at the adolphus. I have already done a review with hotel management so I will write most of that here.My wife and I recently spent the weekend at the hotel. We had planned on having a nice retreat away from the house, we live in the North Dallas area. We checked in at approximately 4 o'clock in the afternoon without difficulty. I then discovered that my wife had called ahead and asked for chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room and build to our room prior to our arrival. She called a couple of days ahead and asked for that to be delivered or around 330. Unfortunately it was not in the room when we arrived. Approximately 1 hour later and two telephone calls later to room service the strawberries arrived. We did call and they did say that they were very busy however I think that if you plan ahead this wouldn't have been something that would have been very difficult to do. In addition they do charge a pretty substantial amount of money for the cost and delivery of these so I wouldn't think it would be very difficult to accomplish that.Next we did have a dinner at the French room. I will try to write a separate review of the French room but this was the best part of the trip. I am trying to write this review about only the hotel. The restaurant was great we had an excellent dinner we enjoyed our waiter and all of the staff.To go back to the room, we had upgraded to a suite. Andunfortunately this hotel is quite old. They do not seem to have renovated their rooms in some time. The furniture was quite dated and in actuality the chair and Ottoman next to the desk basically felt like you are sitting on wood slats. Also typically when you get a sweet there is some room separation. The suites at this hotel however do not have that type of separation they have a dividing wall but the wall only extends up about 4 feet above the ground level thus not providing any real separation. The reason for this being the problem is because the fact that I usually go to bed earlier and get up earlier than my wife and the separation allows me to work on the computer or do whatever without disturbing the person who is sleeping. That was kind of the point of gettingthe suite.I feel that the bathroom was adequate however the colors are a little bit older and some of the furnishings are little bit older however as I understand it's the room rates are very reasonable. Unfortunately with the package that we got, one night in the hotel and dinner in the restaurant was approximately $660. We did have a great time at dinner however I don't know if this really feels like a substantial discount.I think that if you are staying in the downtown area and you get a good deal on this hotel that it is acceptable. There is a great lobby there is a great area to sit around if some of your friends join you. However the rooms are somewhat disappointing.I typically do stay at very high-end properties and I really thought that the Adolphus was in that same category however I don't think so anymore.
