{"text":"Time Capsule We stayed at the Askanischer Hof for two nights on our first 'toe in the water' visit to Berlin and were as delighted with the hotel as with the city itself. The location on the Kudam is hard to beat. The hotel is tucked away between designer shops (Chanel etc) just west of the Uhlandstrasse metro station. The hotel building appears undistinguished but as you climb the stairs (or take the lift) and open the ornately carved first floor door to the hotel itself you enter into a haven of quirky charm. 1930s is the stylistic watchword and calm prevails. The public areas are relatively limited: A lobby and reception area well stocked with interesting Berlin literature adjoins a bar\/breakfast area the walls of which are covered with interesting photographs of old Berlin and its people. Breakfast is huge (well, as big as you want it to be) and can be taken in the breakfast room up until 1100 or in your bedroom at any time. Fantastic! The hotel does not serve dinner but has a good relationship with a restaurant\/brasserie across the street (Austria Brasserie) that stays open late and offers good - if somewhat pricey - food.The bedrooms are large and airy and are full of antique furniture and prints. Comfortable beds and a modern ensuite (shower, no bath) plus all you would expect to find in a 3 star hotel bedroom make for a relaxed and easeful stay.All the hotel staff we met were charming, polite and helpful. I was able to check-in for our return flight online and print boarding cards using the hotel's reservation PC. Nothing seemed too much trouble.We would certainly revisit this hotel if we were to return to Berlin as I am sure we will.The room rate we were offered was something like Euro 145 per night, breakfast included. Good value indeed. ","annotations":[]}
