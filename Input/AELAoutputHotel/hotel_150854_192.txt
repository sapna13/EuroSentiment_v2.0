{"text":"Amazing!!!! What an amazing resort! We went for a weeks trip from March 6-13th! We had a blast! The Punta Cana International Airport was so unique! The airport is completely open with a thatched roof. The departure area as well, lots of fresh air and is so different. Once off the plane you get a picture with two Dominican women which you can purchase for $10 canadian when you depart. Once you clear customs, you will have guys waiting to help you with your bags, they will want a small tip but a simple no thanks will work. The ride from the airport to the Riu Palace Macao was interesting! They drive all over the road and makes it a little tense but so worth it when you get there!The hotel- wow - what a beaut! The staff are amazing! Widny at the front desk was so helpful. There is a server at the pool named Antonito. He was the best! You will always hear him say I love my job. The rooms were spacious, clean and cool. The mini bar was stocked daily. We noticed that most guests don't tip the staff. We did and they really appreciated it! The restaurants were great. Kabuki, the japanese restaurant was our favorite besides the buffet. Make sure you go to the gala buffet. They have dishes from all the restaurants. The Caribe grill and the steakhouse were also great! They only accept reservations from 730am to 930am but we never had a problem getting in and never had to wait to make a reso. We overheard a couple staying at the Riu Palace that the line up to make resos everyday was insane. We never had a line to make a reso. We walked over to the Riu Palace, it looked nice, don't get me wrong but it felt cold and stuffy compared to the Riu Palace Macao. There is a Caribbean Street right beside the Riu Palace Macao which had tons of shops. They have a Caribbean Festival on the Caribbean Street once a week with vendors on the street and you can barter prices. The prices in the store are fixed. We also never had a problem finding a chair at the beach or by the pool any time. You always have those who hold chairs all day, we didn't and we never had a problem finding it. Hidden jem, go to the jacuzzi behind the Caribe\/international grill, it has cool water and is secluded. We used it daily! What more can I say! We loved it!
