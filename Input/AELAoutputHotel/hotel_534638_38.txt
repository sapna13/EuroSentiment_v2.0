{"text":"Definatly not a 5 star hotel My partner and I stayed at the Sofitel Seminyak in Feb 2008. We paid quite alot for a delux room (by bali standards anyway). The room we had was quite small and needing renovating. There was paint missing from the walls and marks everywhere. Breakfast was included in our price however some mornings we had to wait over 15 mins to get a table. On one occassion we were given a dirty table that hadnt been cleaned and the used coffee cups from the last customers sat there the entire meal. Their main restaurant Husk looked quite nice, however was over priced (but this was to be expected) What was NOT expected was the fact that the only Bali Belly either of us got on the trip was after eating at this restaurant!I have stayed at alot of sofitels before and am always very impressed by them. I had big expectations for this hotel however I was very disappointed. We had friends where were staying down the road at another hotel and were paying $100 less than us a night and their hotel was alot better. I would definatly not agree that this hotel was a 5 star.On the plus side the main pool was nice and the house keeping was very efficient. The majortiy of the staff were also very friendly. It would be a good hotel if rooms prices were on par with other bali hotels that are of the same standard however the sofitel charge alot more and certainly dont offer anything more!
