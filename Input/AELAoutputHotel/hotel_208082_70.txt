{"text":"Lift not working We had 2 kids aged 6 and 2 with us and stayed at the hotel for 2 nights in early Feb. The hotel is a 3 star but the location is rather central. Like most hotels in this city, rooms come in small sizes and of course the lift is almost non-existent or too small to fit more than 2 adults! To be objective, I will list the good and not-so good points.ProsThe reception was friendly and allowed us to keep the baby stroller with them so it won't take up additional space in our room.The heating was efficient and can be adjusted. The bathroom though small had a heater next to the tub\/shower. The decor looked clean and modern.The room had ample wardrobe space to keep some of our things. And it had a safe where we kept our documents. The continental breakfast was very satisfying. They had a variety of cereal, cheeses, pastries, bread, yogurt, drinks and ham to choose from. You can also get orange juice, toast, boiled eggs and fruits as well as coffee on request. If you wanted expresso or cafe creme, you can request for that too. They also served hot milk for my son's chocolate. Anyway, I couldn't fault their coffee, it was good stuff.The hotel's location is very central (in Latin Quarter) and near to several metro entrants. Except when you have a stroller... There are tons of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, shops and take-aways in the immediate vicinity, so food is not an issue for those who stay here.The semi pedestrian streets are easy to stroll around and plenty of actions during the weekends and the evenings when the place gets more vibrant.ConsWe had a standard room for 3 and it was on the 4th floor - the view of room faced the unscenic view of the semi-delapidated building directly across the hotel. The lift was under renovation whilst we were there and so the noise of drilling can be heard during the day. But just imagine walking up 4 storeys, it was exhausting and something I'm not accustomed to. NOT good at all.The rooms are hardly sound proof and you can always hear your neighbours come in and out. Never mind that.But what's unbearable is that the street is noisy especially over the weekends and the windows are not sound proof enough from the rowdy activities out there. The noise level didn't die off until about 4am!Would I stay here again? I'm not sure as I suspect the rest of the hotels in paris are not that much better given my requirements for a central location without blowing my budget.
