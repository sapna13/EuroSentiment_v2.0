{"text":"everything you need to know about the princess! me and my family stayed at the princess in july 06. upon arrival we had no problem finding the princess, and when we arrived the hotel looked very impressive inside and out. while checking in we were delayed though because of the gentlemen next to us complaining about the hotel and wanted the manager and his money back! i can now see why. the rooms were very spacious and nice except the shower that leaked over the entire bathroom everytime you used it. also when we were there there was a storm and the whole corridor outside our room was flooded . the pools however were very nice, but slighty to small for all the guests in the hotel. the hotel resteraunt was always empty, perhaps because it was so expensive! so we walked to the restaurants around the corner- be warned, we encountered a lot of dodgy people walking there! we even got our bag nicked right outside the hotel by two men on a motorbike! the hotel were very helpful though. there is a bus stop right outside the hotel which was very useful, and the beach is in easy walking distace. there is also a mall in short walking distance from the hotel but a lot of youths hang out here, and i suspect that these are the ones that mahe so much noise outside the hotel every night.i would say that this hotel is more a business hotel then a pleasure one, i personally would not stay here again, and would stay closer to the centre of barcelona.
