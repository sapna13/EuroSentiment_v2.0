{"text":"Great vacation My husband and I stayed at the catalonia from April 30-May 13\/2008. We loved it. We have been to punta cana 7 times -and can honestly say this was our favorite. We really enjoyed the food in the buffet and in the specialty restaurants. I usually have stomach problems with the foods in the carribean and this was our first time staying for 2 weeks. This was not the case here. The pizza by the pool bar was so good we had it every day. The restaurant down by the beach was my least favorite. Everyone down there (except one of the morning girls in the internet cafe) was so friendly and very accomodating. You never waited long for anything. We spent every day down by the beach. The first week we had no problem getting a hut by 7.30 or so in the morning. Everyone was at the pool that week. But the following week the huts were really hard to come by at that time. Guess the crowd changes every week and so does everyones preference. We had to be down there around 6.00 to ensure a hut anywhere in the first 3 rows. But we always got one. The beach is really beautiful -tons of palm trees on the beach. We thorougly enjoyed our two weeks there and would not hesitate to go back. Everyone works really hard there. So don't forget to tip those people who work to make your vacation enjoyable-whether it is the servers, the lady who cleans the washrooms all day by the beach (because there truly are some slobs who come to these places, or whether it is the people making your pizza or your omellettes because not only do they appreciate it , they deserve it. My only warning to people is to be careful when you are at the airport leaving. We left our carry ons fairly empty-definitely under the 5kg each you are allowed and were told that our packed luggage was over. Ok no problem.-We asked if we could take some stuff out of our packed luggage and put it into our carry on. We have seen this happen with other people on occasion but did not think it was a problem. The guy flattly refused to let us do this. We tried explaining that if we put more into our carry 3 lbs between the 2 of us we would not be over on our weight.. He would not allow us. We were pretty mad because we ended up having to pay $30 for overweight. He also made us weigh our carry on which was way under and still would not budge. After our episode they were trying to charge the lady next to us $90 for overweight luggage. We have spoke to skyservice regarding this because they contract these people out and were told there have been a few complaints of the same nature. Just a warning -be careful. We really thought this was very unfair of the airport to do this and have never encountered this problem and have been through lots of other airports in our travels over the years. Anyway overall we had an amazing vacation and would definetly recommend this hotel.
