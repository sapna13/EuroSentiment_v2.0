{"text":"Excellence exceeded our high expectations Just returned from 7 days at the Excellence and had a fantastic time. Rather than repeat the basic items in the previous reviews (great landscaping, good reaturants, friendly staff etc) I will focus on specific details that made the Excellence special. In this regard, I will compare the Excellence to the #2 Trip Advisor-ranked resort in Punta Cana (Majestic Colonial) at which I stayed last year for a week.1. Beach Party: Super event at the Excellence. Food was very good; but the ambience of having dinner at the beach with 2 great bands playing was magical. If you go to the Excellence, don't miss this event. The Majestic Colonial did not offer this type of beach front function.2. Sax player at Martini Bar: Domingo the sax player was super. I spoke to a number of other couples from large US cities and we all agreed the quality of the sax player was great. The Majestic Colonial did not have the same quality of entertainment.3. Flexibility with Restaurants: The Excellence did not require any pre-planned reservations, so you had the ability to be spontaneous in respect to picking a restaurant and timing that suited you on any particular evening. At the Majestic, and other resorts I have stayed at, you have to rush to make all your restaurant reservations as soon as you arrive OR you may not be able to get in at all. Having the flexibility and spontanity was very welcome on a vacation.4. Lunches on the beach: The paella on the beach was out of this world; and the beachfront fajitas and burgers\/chicken were also great lunch fare. Having the ability to eat on the beach was an unexpected convenience and pleasure.5. Small details: The gym at the Excellence was large and very well maintained. The towel service at the Excellence was on the honour system versus the Majestic Colonial and others where you have to deposit your room key and then get to the towel station and pick up your key again. The waiters providing full service to the pool and beach areas; including offering pizza for a mid-day snack. As well, we did not fly out until the evening, and Jacqueline at the front desk let us use another hotel room to shower and change (after check out) at no cost. The foregoing details are small points; but they added up in the context of a ultra relaxing vacation at the Excellence.The one negative I would state about the Excellence is the invisible sand bugs. Myself and a number of other guests did NOT notice the bugs during the day; but upon return to the room in the late afternoon, we all had a number of bites on our ankles and legs. The resolution to this issue is to use bug spray everyday whether you notice the bugs or not.All in all, my stay at the Majestic Colonial last year was also very good; but our vacation at the Excellence this year was fantastic and it exceeded all of our expectations.
