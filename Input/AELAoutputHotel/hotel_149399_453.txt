{"text":"Royal Service The Only Way To Go We went to this resort with our three kids (2,7,8). This was our second time in the Dominican Republic. This resort was huge, but very clean. The ROYAL SERVICE was worth every penny. The Royal Service had it's own Restauraunt, Pool  Beach  Room Service. The room was beautiful and very clean. We were in Villa 49 and on the second floor. We had a great view of the pool  restaurant. The food at the Royal Service Restaurant was great and the drinks were top shelf. Even the wine was good. Tipping gets you everything. Try to go with the same waiter or waitress, they remember who tips them. A few dollars gets you great service. We spent another $200 in tips. But it gave us the best in service. We went to the other side for the kids club. Great activities for the kids. Even at night they have a game room which you can leave the kids. You can also pay for a sitter to come to your room.When we went to other side we could not believe the difference from the Royal Service. Our lounge chairs, huts  pool were so much better and not as crowded. The restaurants were good but needed a reservation. They will not let you in with out one. Call after 12pm for the next day reservation. The Italian was not good. The American Grill, Chinese  French were great. But every night we would finish the night at the Royal Service Restaurant. No reservation needed. We would definitely go back next year.
