{"text":"Cool Place, Excellent Breakfast The room is not a large at all ;-))) but it's nice furbished and clean. Bathroom was well equiped, the AC was working ok. The window was small and covered by a heavy curtain. Nothing to see through the window, anyway (just a grey wall).We have enjoyed the stay, though (holiday travel). The city is absolutely amazing (architecture, events, night life, gastronomy etc) so you don't need to spend too much time in the hotel room. Just sleep, shower and go back to the street. The laundry is not working on Saturdays  Sundays.The breakfast is +++++ (if you are not a vegan, of course:)): a large selection of catalan ham specialities is waiting for you here every morning.However, there is a cool pub just in front of the hotel. It's very catalan (a large selection of tapas, anchovies, bacalao, Estrella Damm bier and a very good  strrrrong expresso) The hotel it's very close to the Monumental de Torros de Barcelona (Bullfight arena). Every Sunday there is a Bullfight show here: if you like this kind of performance you can pay a ticket (from Euro 12 to 20) . If you hate it, you can join the bullfight protesters just in front of the tickets offices ;-)))Other touristic atractions next to hotel: the famous temple of the Sagrada Familia (15 min by walk) and Torre Agbar.Unfortunatelly the hotel is not very close to Placa Catalunya ... but you can manage this by subway or by bus ;-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":82,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":78},{"endOffset":804,"mention":"tapas","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tapas"],"startOffset":799},{"endOffset":839,"mention":"Estrella Damm","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Estrella_Damm"],"startOffset":826}]}
