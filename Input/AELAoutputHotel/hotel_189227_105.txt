{"text":"small, but very nice The rooms are a bit small, but the hotel makes effective use of every inch of space with built in cabinets and such. The room felt like a luxury room on a cruise ship. We where traveling with a large suitcase and two large carry ons and were able to stow away everything so we could get around. I would recommend getting a twin room, even if traveling as a couple. They are put side to side like a king anyway. You could run the A\/C even in October and you can control the thermostat. So A\/C in the summer probably won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be an issue.Some reviews complained about the noise level at the hotel. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ notice any big issue and I am a very light sleeper. We had room 19 which was at the top of the staircase, with a window facing the front courtyard, directly over the reception and lobby area and below another room. Quite possibly the noisiest room in the hotel, and noise was not an issue. This is of course with the caveat that you are in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Paris and in a building that was built before noise ordinances were invented. You will hear occasional noise from the street and people in the hall. But the hotel is located in a very quite street of Paris and most of the hotels guests are the older type who just want to relax and go to bed after having dinner. The staff is friendly and courteous. Most speak English. They have free internet access 24\/7. It gets quite busy in the morning. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only one computer. Breakfast is nice and free, but does get boring. The restaurant next door is very good. It serves French country food. The hotel is also located within two famous pastry stores. The very upscale Pierre Herm√ã√\u2022√ñ and the more traditional Luduree (both on rue Bonaparte). Luduree has a caf√ã√\u2022√ñ. It was a very nice hotel.
