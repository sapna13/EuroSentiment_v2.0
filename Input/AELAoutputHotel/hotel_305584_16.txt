{"text":"Not the greatest and shouldnt be a 4 star We booked this hotel through laterooms at 85 Eur per night and although its advertised as a four star we were not impressed.The location is good with about 2 minutes walk to the Metro station and its located in one of the business areas. We used the Metro to get around Barcelona and found it fantastic and used it as late at 1130pm.The reception area is impressive when you enter and looks very new and modern. We were situated on the top floor and although the room wasnt very big is was modern and clean. The downside was that they advertise soundproof walls and even if someone coughs in the hallway it sounds as though they are in your room as it does when someone showers in the room next to you. This isnt so bad if you get up before 7am however otherwise you will be woken up with the noise.The temperature in the room was boiling, and this was in january when it was only 17 degrees outside in the day and around 5 at night. We turned the air con onto full power at the coolest possible and it was still warm although manageable. This was made worase by the fact the every night they switched the power off so no air con, no lights etc at about 1am.The last awful part was the bar, but only was it quiet most nights. The night we went for a drink at 10pm when 3 other guests were there drinking, including one being served when we arrived and the close hours being 11pm we were refused a drink as they said they were closed. We were not drunk as my husband had had 2 glasses of wine and me being pregnant I'd had none and only wanted a fanta or lemonade before going to bed. We found this very rude.Overall Id say stay somewhere else preferably in the area La Ribera which is in the gothic area of the city and very smart if we visited Barcelona again and Im not usually fussy but i have to say I've stayed in more pleasant 3 star hotels elsewhere ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1592,"mention":"fanta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fanta"],"startOffset":1587},{"endOffset":1592,"mention":"fanta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fanta"],"startOffset":1587},{"endOffset":1592,"mention":"fanta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fanta"],"startOffset":1587}]}
