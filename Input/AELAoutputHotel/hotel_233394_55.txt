{"text":"Exceptionally run boutique hotel on Grand Canal near Rialto As reported, Matteo does do a superb job running this wonderfully decored boutique hotel right near the Rialto Bridge. Pros: Matteo, housekeeping and the night staff addressed my wife and me by name EVERY time they saw us. Matteo, being a man of effusive mien, never lets an opportunity for lengthy discussions on the wonders of Venetian life pass him by, is happy to supply recommendations for any activity and seems to have the water bus timetable memorized. Our room (non-suite, non-canal view, 280 Euro\/night in late March 2008) was spotless and large for Venice, with vaulted ceilings and full-sized king bed. Our bathroom was also large, with a shower over a jet-fitted tub. Arriving by water taxi directly to the hotel's private dock on the Grand Canal is a great convenience and sets the mood, as does the porter running out to grab our bags whilst introducing himself (and somehow already knowing our names). The hotel's common area, the hall, where breakfast  drinks (full bar) are served (and which leads to the outdoor terrace useful outside of winter) is beautiful. Matteo's Venetian spritzers are in fact good. One evening we went to the Gritti Palace for cocktails and tried their spritzer. On top of the Gritti seeming run-down and frankly a bit depressing, the drink wasn't nearly as piquant, voluminous, or inexpensive. It really made us think that we were getting a much better experience (way beyond the spritzer) at Ponte Antico and for almost a third the room rate (and half the cocktail rate).Cons: Matteo NEVER lets an opportunity for lengthy discussions on the wonders of Venetian life pass him by. Its charming, but sometimes we just want our room key or the tiniest bit of anonymity in our movements and activities. One annoying quirk, because our tub was raised a foot or two off the floor and the bathroom had low ceilings, at just 6'0 I had to hunch considerably to stand in the shower and had to fully squat to get my hair wet. If I were any taller or had a bad back I would have needed to switch rooms. Just when you start thinking that you're staying in a five star hotel for a three star price, the motel-style shrink wrapped complimentary bathroom toiletries and small tube TV remind you that you aren't (but those are, in my opinion, trades I'm happy to make for the reasonable room rate). AC was entirely non-functional, but we didn't complain or investigate further as our window kept the room temperature manageable; maybe it's only activated in warmer months. The hotel is very quiet, and our room was just off the common hall, so we could hear conversations outside (and vice versa). It would have been nice to have had the option for audio privacy with some AC or fan created white noise.On balance, given the excellent location, enthusiastic management, room condition, decor  ambiance, and fair room rate, I would absolutely return and will recommend the Ponte Antico to friends and family without hesitation. Bravissimo, Matteo.
