{"text":"Great hotel in the heart of NYC Stayed here for three nights following a cruise and we were really pleased with the level of service, the quality of the accommodation and the terrific location of the hotel.We arrived at 10am on the day before the NY marathon and had expected to store our bags and then head out for a while before our room was ready (we had advised the hotel of our early arrival by email); however, the hotel already had our room available, which was terrific and gave us a chance to unpack and freshen up before heading out for the rest of the day.The staff are all very professional and accommodating and couldn't do enough for us during our stay. The rooms are fairly small, but there was room for the two of us to move around as well as accommodate three large suitcases and we were just in a standard room. Room and bathroom spotless and welcomed the slippers and bathrobe for use.The complimentary refreshments, continental breakfast and cheese and wine are an added bonus as was the free internet access, which allowed us to complete check-in for our flight home before we even left the hotel, which was great.The attached restaurant, Madison and Vine, looked lovely but didn't seem to have a great choice for vegetarians, but as another reviewer said, with the dining concourse at Grand Central Station literally just around the corner, this was no big deal.Fantastic location within reasonable walking distance of all major attractions and would definitely recommend the hotel, having stayed elsewhere previously.We're sure to be back!
