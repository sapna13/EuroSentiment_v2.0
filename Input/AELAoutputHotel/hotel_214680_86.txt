{"text":"Horrible hotel!!!!!!!!! This hotel is 180 degrees in the opposite direction from what their website offers. The rooms are not cleaned, the carpet and drapes are filthy, there are cigarette holes in the bed spread and curtains, there was MOLD on the ceiling in the shower and around the outside of the sink lining, the list goes on and on. The rooms are tiny and the walls are paper thin, there were two of us staying in this room and with one other person over, talking in a normal tone, we had security come up and threaten to kick us out if we didn't quiet down. The partial ocean view is only visable if you walk out onto your 1 1\/2 foot balcony and lean waaaay over the edge. We specifically requested two beds and got only one, when we called down to the front desk they rudely barked that this is the only room they have and double beds are sold out. The front desk staff is terrible, they are not willing to help with anything and it took them two days to bring up extra towels. They are curt and rude with every request. The lobby is outdated and the carpets are stained, the furniture is scarce. It takes about 10-15 minutes for the elevator to come and when it does it is so packed you have to wait for the next one anyway, and it's filthy. You are charged for the free coffee, charged daily to use your safe, charged for everything. The sticker on the phone stating outgoing calls are 1$... my 3 minute voicemail was 12$. You also have to call the front desk to connect you to room voicemails... and I had to sit through 5 other messages from previous occupants before I even got to mine. This hotel is AWEFUL!!!!!!
