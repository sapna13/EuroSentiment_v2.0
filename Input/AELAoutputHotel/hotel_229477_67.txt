{"text":"Faded glamour! Please forgive me for writing in the present tense, but I am in the hotel room now, and feel so strongly about this hotel, that I had to write my review immediately. Last week I stayed in the Marriott hotel which is just a bridge away. I was quite impressed with the Marriott, but felt I should try the American as a friend had recommended it. The American was 5 Euro cheaper than the Marriott. It cost 160 Euro for 1 night (without breakfast). On first impressions, the hotel seems very nice. It has a cosy bar, and an inviting reception. The staff were pleasant and prompt.  When I reached my room I was very disappointed. The room is narrow and you have to manoeuvre your way passed the TV cabinet to get into the room. When the bathroom door is open it is virtually impossible to get passed the bed. The bid is a King-size, but the mattress is extremely soft and I am struggling to sit on it, never mind sleep. The sheets are cheap, and the budget didn't even run to a valance on the bed, as I can see the bed base (which is quite unsightly). The furniture and curtains have definitely seen better days. The bathroom is tiny. Barely room to take a pee standing up! All of this is in stark contrast to the Marriott, which has recently been refurbished. I will write a review of the Marriott as soon as I get home. To sum up: this hotel has certainly seen better days. If you are looking to stay in this area, book the Marriott. ","annotations":[]}
