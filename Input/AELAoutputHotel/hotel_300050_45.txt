{"text":"Buyer Beware It takes a lot for me to write a complaint, but I thought I'd share my experience so it may save someone else a disappointment. I didn't have a choice of the hotel, priceline selected this property based upon my request for a 3 star hotel for $80. After reading several bad reviews here and that others have paid $40 a night, I was flabbergasted (although I wasn't sure if it should be directed at priceline or HI). The hotel was far from a 3 star, and the front desk was not very accommodating with our request for a non-smoking room. I don't need to reiterate the condition the property is in, but will simply confirm the state of repair and observations of previous guests below.This is my first time booking with priceline, sadly, at the urging of a friend. Priceline does not and cannot guarantee a non-smoking room, and HI was completely booked (I believe for a wedding) that night and will not honour any requests from priceline. You also do not earn points with priceline bookings, in fact HI was clear they do not like guests to book with third party vendors. By booking at the hotel's website directly, you can always get similar rates plus you earn points\/frequent flyer miles. At the end of the day, priceline has to squeeze out a profit, so the extras will have to go.I am a Sheraton regular (anything from Four Points to Westin and le Meridien) and miss the Sweet Sleeper and Heavenly beds too much. I am not skimping $6 a night and have to settle for a lumpy bed and a bad night or in this case, two with HI again. It's like playing Russian Roulette with priceline. ","annotations":[]}
