{"text":"Great hotel, although we had some complications My husband and I stayed at this Holiday Inn for one week in April for sightseeing purposes. The hotel is less than 5 minutes from a subway station, which easily connects you to all of the major sites in Berlin. There are also at least 2 bakeries on the way to the subway, which made for decent, very cheap breakfasts.The hotel surroundings were very quiet and we never had a problem with noise. The room itself was small, but clean and well maintained for the entire week that we were there. The bathroom did have a bit of a funny smell, but it did not permeate into the rest of the room. We had a non-smoking room and had no problem with residual smoke smells or perfume used to cover up smoke smells (as stated in some earlier reviews).My main complaint is that we had some major billing issues. I had booked the room online through the hotel website. I brought my printout from the website with me and this printout included a total price that had to be paid. Despite this, the hotel insisted on charging me 10 euros more per night (this was after the extra person fee had already been taken into account). On 4 separate occassions I had to argue with the staff and show them my printout. On each occassion, I was told that I was correct and that the bill would be fixed. However, this only lasted until the next shift started, and then I had the same problems again. The problem even persisted through my departure and I had to work on the situation from home via e-mail. In the end, the problem was fixed and an appropriate refund was made.Outside of the billing problems, I thought that the hotel was a great value for the price, especially considering its close location to the subway. I assume that the billing problems were a freak event, so I would actually recommend this hotel to others. As for myself though, it gave me such a headache that I may try a different hotel next time.
