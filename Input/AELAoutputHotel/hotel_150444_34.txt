{"text":"Horrible The Radisson Ambassador Plaza Hotel  Casino San Juan is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. To start off the front desk agents were very unfriendly and unprofessional. The only person that gave us a warm welcome was the bell boy. The Buffet Breakfast was terrible. The same old thing everyday that gave us GAS the first time we ate it. The hotel is being renovated and when I booked my room, no one at the hotel told me that there will be renovations being done. This was so deceiving. The walls for the floor that I was staying on were a complete mess. The whole hotel had a foul smell. And let√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not talk about the bed. The bed was as hard as a piece of ply wood board. The television had a loud buzzing sound coming from it. One of our phone jacks was damaged and hanging out of the wall. The towels were smelly and old. Oh and there is no lobby, no where for you to sit and wait for your taxi. My goodness, I have never stayed at a hotel like this in my life. I will not suggest that anyone to stay at this piece of crap. It is not worth the money at all. Oh and to top it off the Pool had caution Tape around it. This was so tacky and disgraceful. This hotel is crap, please do not stay here. I advise anyone to stay at the Holiday Inn Express over this so call 3.5 star hotel. The Holiday Inn Express is right down the street and it is way cheaper and believe me you get better service.
