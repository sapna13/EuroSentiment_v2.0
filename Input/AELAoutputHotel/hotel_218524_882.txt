{"text":"Excellente!!! Wow. Where do I begin? First, let me tell you a bit about me, so you get a good view of this review. I am 28, I stay at about 7 hotels a month for work, I have been on cruise after cruise, and will never cruise again after this. This was my first all inclusive. However, I am a hotel snob. I like things immaculate, quick, and my way. So, a hard to please guest. If someone is rude to me, I am the first to ask for management. Yes, a snob. I like to get my money's worth. lol So, this review is coming from someone who is very strict on who gets all my stars. This place deserves all the good things you could say about it. 1-the rooms, are just as beautiful as the photos on their website. wow. Not the case a lot of times, but here, wow. 2-the drinks-wonderful, as the bar staff is as well- Pablo!! Gracias for the Coco Locos con Malibu all day at the pool. 3-food was very good, and I love some food. The sushi, the lobster, the stuffed manocotti, ah, moo moo! 4-clean. They rake the beach at night. They shock the pool nightly. My room was queaky clean every day. Fresh towels, water, mini bar. 5-the staff is amazing! wow. Never not a smile, even the groundskeepers were always 'hola!' Everyone was bilingual, except for the housekeeping, but all I asked for was washcloths-and got a pile of them! Very nice. No one wears a watch. You are truely on vacation. Its like, operation good time. I should mention the entertainment staff. wonderful. Natural, seemed to really love what they did. Ray-wow. High on life. Made us welcome. Thank you for getting us involved! Francisco, Isabelle, Mariel, Ines, how fun are they? I don't know how they keep up, but they are awesome. Great at volleyball, and karaoke!! ha. We did upgrade to the Excellence Club. I know a lot of people say its a rip off, etc. I think it depends on what you booked, compared to what they are offering. We booked the el cheapo room, which would have put us far and away from the pool. (Garden View). Excellence club was 600$, and it put us in front of the pool bar\/beach. We got free messages-and no one pressured products afterwards-cruises do. So, it ended up being less expensive than if we would have booked the pool room in the first place. And, you can go to the excellence club and snack, drink, watch the game in A\/C, or get online. Nice. Check on that. Call Roberto at the hotel. The concierge at the Excellence Club-Roberto. How wonderful. You could have screamed and demanded, and he would smile and say, yes mam, right away. (I didn't, as he was great, but you know what I mean). Very helpful, and made sure we were more than happy.  Matias-the front desk gentleman that booked our stay-wonderful man. Walked us to our room, etc. Everyone was so happy to be on the earth and helping us. On the beach-waitress, couldn't wait to get us drinks. How awesome. Never had an issue finding a towel or a place to lay. The grounds are so beautiful. Pink flamingos, parrots, turtles, and beautiful landscaping. Yes, it is about 1.2 hours from the airport in a scary bus ride. But, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. ( the bus had A\/C, and when we got to excellence, they had champagne and cold towels waiting). They were so nice to us. So helpful, and the food was great. If I do go elsewhere, it will be to another excellence property. We saw the other hotels on our way to ours-some not so 'great' as they looked online. I never saw another unhappy guest, and usually you run into one. the live shows were nice, the 70-80's show the best. Do the karaoke-its halerious. Email me with any specific questions, I know everyone looks for different things while on vacation-! Kristy and Travis Sept 12-18th 2007 room 1210 upgraded to 7101.
