{"text":"Great Location! Bad Food! Stayed here during Easter Week. My bestfriend and had planned the trip months before and heavily relied on tripadvisor. We finally selected this hotel since it's newly renovated plus its located at Scotts Road which is adjacent or across Orchard Road. I believe it was a great stay. When I was dropped by the Taxi at the lobby, I thought I was staying at a Mall (well like most of the hotels if you stay in this area have shopping malls on their lobbies). It never felt like a home hotel. Check-in was a breeze.We were given a room on the 5th Floor and we had a wall as our view. It's okay since we had this hotel at a very cheap price (booked at Asiabesthotel.com) and we got it at only S$210\/night which I believe is reasonable enough.The rooms were very clean. Very new and smells really fresh. The air-conditioning was really really really cold which was really great for me!It has great location and is walking distance to many food establishments and the shopping. It was also near the ORCHARD MRT Station, like around 5 minute walk. What I don;t like is the breakfast. Though you have many things to eat in the hotel.. I really miss the pork. The hotel I heard is owned by the Sultan of Brunei making it a haven for our Muslim brothers.. hence the food.Over-all I like it. But I will prefer another hotel just to have that home-like feel.
