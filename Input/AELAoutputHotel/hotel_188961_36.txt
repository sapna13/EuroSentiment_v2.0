{"text":"What a gem!! I cannot recommend this hotel enough. The staff were very courteous, friendly and seemed genuinely interested in each guest. They remembered earlier conversations and picked up on them later.We arrived early afternoon  so our room was not ready(checkout is not until noon); we were offered a glass of champagne  were happy to pass a plesant hour in the lounge reading the paapers.We had a room overlooking the palace (and would strongly recommend that you request this). It was pristine and, although the decor was black and whire, it was a warm and inviting room. The lighting system was unfathomable as the bathroom light that we'd turned off when we went to bed was mirculously on the following morning. This is by no means a criticism as the mood lighting was excellent - just an observation and a challenge to crack!Nothing was too much trouble and often the staff outnumbered the guests in the executive lounge .We stayed for the weekend of the concerts in Hyde Park and made full use of the butler's pantry when returning each evening. The spread was superb; meat,cheese, fish and shell fish, followed by fresh fruit. With a large glass of red wine from the honesty bar this made for a perfect end to a perfect evening!The continental breakfast was magnificant; simple but first class in every way.Andrew, the manager, went out of his way to make guests feel welcome, in a quiet gentle way - he never appeared hurried and seemed to be on duty from dawn until midnight!Yes, it is expensive, but it is very special and I will return as soon as funds allow.
