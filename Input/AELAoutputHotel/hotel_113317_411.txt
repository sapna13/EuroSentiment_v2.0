{"text":"Loved the Casablanca and the staff Just stayed 7 days at this hidden jewel of a hotel. I knew from the time that I made our reservations over the phone with Jason that this was going to be one awsome hotel. From the time that you enter the beautiful lobby till the day that you depart you are treated beyond excellence. The staff becomes your friends from the moment that they say welcome. Jason, Peter, Luke, Lenny, Yuri, Laura, Daniella and the ones that I can't remember their names go up and above what they are suppose. You are not just another guest.Location, Location, Location they have it. Right in the heart of Times Square. The rooms must be soundproof as once you are in your room you hear no noise from Times Square. Rooms are decorated to perfection and by New York standards they are a nice size. Good water pressure in the shower. Rooms are beyond clean. They sparkle daily !The breakfast every morning is awsome. Delicious pastries, fresh fruit bowls, bagels, juices. Laura and Daniella are such great women. You need for nothing when you are eating. They are always asking if you need anything else. The wine and cheese in the evenings make for some nice quite time. There is nothing one could say negative about this five star hotel. I see why it is rated #2 in the city.We will be back in December 2007 and you can bet the one and only place we will ever stay in New York City again is Casablanca.Joe and Carolyn T.
