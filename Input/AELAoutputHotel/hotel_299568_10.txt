{"text":"Lousy room Our room was booked on the Accor Hotels website, with a very generous contract discount. We didn't feel comfortable complaining about the room at the time, due to the price we paid. In hindsight, other clients must stay there, so I feel compelled to review the hotel based on our experience.Our room was 437--across the street from on the beach portion of hotel. One pool was under repair and the other on that side was small lap pool (looks really nice at night--hardly the same in daylight) and it was occupied. The main pool beachside was lovely--as was the beach area\/bar\/restaurant. We did enjoy that part of the hotel. The bar\/restaurant on our side was closed. Our room had dirty floors, a queen bed with clean linens, and a lounge w\/out cover (it looked soiled) so the only place to sit was the bed. The shower\/bath combo (not separate as described) had no hot water, so the cool showers were not pleasant. We each took showers at differing times and still no hot water. The patio door was difficult to open, as it was crooked and dragged along the ground--very noisy scraping sound. Agree with Fabiobol that the hotel is description is deceptive because there is no mention of the split location and divided facilities. There is only a superior room category listed on the website, so I was surprised that we had what I would certainly call a SUB-standard room. I wrote to the hotel manager today and I hope to have a reply from him soon. It was the most disappointing part of our 10 day stay in Bali. Had I known more accurate info about their rooms, I would have not chosen Novotel Benoa. ","annotations":[]}
