{"text":"Great Resort and Great Vacation We go to an all inclusive resort in the Caribbean at least once a year. We were there the week between Christmas and New Years.Resort: The place is beautiful. All the rooms are on tree lined paths running through the property and there are peacocks everywhere. There was a lot of staff constantly cleaning and raking so the grounds are immaculate. (One day I saw the hotel general manager picking up leaves and straightening little signs as he walked down the main path!) The lobby is huge and very nice, and the bar area was fine. (Service was sometimes a little slow √à√\u2020\u2022?it was a lot quicker just to go to the bar and get the drinks there.) The staff could not have been nicer and friendlier. Rooms: We requested a renovated room and it was very clean and neat, and just a few buildings from the beach and close to the pool. There were many more TV channels than most resorts -- not that we watched much TV but it's nice for when you're in the room. The lights over the bed were great, with built-in pinpoint reading lights. The bathrooms were spacious except for the area near the toilet √à√\u2020\u2022?I came home with a bruise on my leg from constantly knocking into the metal toilet paper dispenser. I noticed that guests did not sit on their balconies or patios as much as at other resorts. Maybe because all the buildings are only two stories and almost all the balconies and patios face the paths that everyone uses. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ notice any of the mildew and sewage smells that other reviewers have mentioned.Food: The food is fine, as long as you have realistic expectations. The buffets for all three meals were huge, with a lot of variety. Breeakfst is amazing -- anything you could possibly want. I must not have been paying attention (which is surprising because I always pay attention to food) since other reviewers have said that there is always something different √à√\u2020\u2022?we thought that the food was almost exactly the same thing every day. There was one √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºpecial√à√\u2020\u2022?entr√ã√\u2022√ñe for lunch at the buffet near the pool and maybe a few different things at night, but not much else changed. At most other resorts, there is more variety from day to day. After a few days, the menu became pretty tiresome. There are sometimes lines at the stations for dinner, and New Year√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Eve was a zoo; the hotel seemed a little unprepared. We ate one night in the Steak House (complete waste of time √à√\u2020\u2022?slow service and unimpressive food) and one night in the Japanese restaurant ( nice atmosphere, good food).Activities: We were there during an obviously busy week so we sometimes had a little trouble finding chairs on the beach, but we always did. The pool area was a little loud for our taste √à√\u2020\u2022?after all, it was the week of school vacations so there were lots of kids. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ usually do many of the organized activities, although the kids enjoyed the daily riflery and archery contests. At night, we walked to the other hotels on the property √à√\u2020\u2022?a five minute walk. There seemed to be more activity and more people there √à√\u2020\u2022?that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ where the casino and the disco are. (The casino was pretty funny √à√\u2020\u2022?lots of teenage boys playing.) One of our biggest complaints was the tennis: there are only three courts for all three hotels on the property. One of us had to wake up at 7:30 to get in line to sign up for one hour of court time for the next day.One final thing: This may seem silly but it affected our vacation. When the sidewalks and the marble floors in the rooms get wet, they are VERY slippery. Two of us had major falls √à√\u2020\u2022?one right after it rained and one in the room. Be careful.
