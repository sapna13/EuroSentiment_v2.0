{"text":"Honeymoon! Excellent... my husband and I went to this hotel for our honeymoon, for two weeks, dirt cheap. Granted we are not picky, and we didn't expect too much, but this place was excellent!! Service : Always helpful, though barely speak english. However, I do understand that I am in THEIR country, and I know a bit of spanish, so we found a happy middle and helped each other out :) Rooms: Never had a problem, always came to clean during the lunch hour, if not a bit before, when pretty much everyone is out and about. If we were in for some reason, they came back at whatever time you advised, not a minute later! Fridge always stocked with water and pop, and tipping does help in making sure this is done every day. Beach: Always cleaned and well-groomed, patrolled by security at night, so you're always safe! Never had a problem getting to the beach after lunch and always found chairs to lie on, both under the shade and in the sun!! you just need to take a short walk and always find some somewhere...Ocean: Gorgeous, refreshing, inviting! Beautiful little fish if you go snorkeling, they tell you where to go, there's a small reef nearby! Bring some bread, they'll come to you :)Food: Excellent...a few dishes were less appetizing, so I simply steared clear of them! Can't expect to like everything when there are tons of dishes to choose from! Always a carving station with beef or pork, fresh pasta station, LOVED the omelette station in the mornings, made fresh with your choice of ingredients :) Always plenty of dishes so that you could always find something you were in the mood for...also HUGE cheese tables, which I made sure to sample every day! hahaPool : Clean, lots of people, but that's to be expected~! It is a pool...activities around it were original and fun, though I simply watched and cheered from the sidelines :) ONLY DOWNSIDE: The washrooms next to the pools were kind of dirty...smelled of pee and were always full of sand, sometimes had no toilet paper...obviously not well-maintained, though the lobby bathrooms were made of marble and never had a spec of dirt or sand in them! And yes, there were tons of British tourists, but I don't understand why some people consider that a valid complaint...they were just as nice as all the other canadians and americans (although very few of us canadians were found...two other couples!!) We made great friends from Poland and France with whom we still keep in touch!! Lasting memories...beautiful honeymoon...WOULD GO AGAIN if I didn't like trying out new resorts every time! Definately would recommend for all kinds of people, families, couples and friends.Hope you'll enjoy!Cat.
