{"text":"Beyond expectation I stayed at B Hotel for 3 days. I wanted to stay on design hotel, I had many choices, but I decided to stay in this hotel for the value they offered the moment I visited Barcelona.LOCATIONPRO:This hotel located near Placa d' Espana (about 3 min walking), Montjuic area (the Olympic area), which is nice. The city itself is really worth the visit. The Metro station is near, the tourist info is also so close, the official tourist bus terminal is also on that location. Next to the hotel, I think they are building a matador arena. There are two OpenCor (grocery) nearby that open 24hr.CON:Being so close to the Metro station, you can feel the Metro running under you, even when you are at the 4th floor (this is where I was staying). Also, the area is not a very lively area (unlike Placa Cataluna). Everything is pretty much close, even restaurants are only open on a specific time (8pm -11pm). Even the hotel doesn't serve anything past 11pm. So, it's a bit hard to find food, although I did have a chance to dine at a very nice restaurant for a nice Paella nearby the area (ask the receptionist for advise). Another thing to consider, there is only 1 Money Exchange at the nearby hotel, so prepare to change your money first, since this hotel only accept euros.HOTEL  ROOMPRO:GREAT. Let me say it again GREAT design. It was spacious. The details are pleasently considered. You get the feel of modern art, and modern technology. The light switchs are hi-tech with stainless steel. They use a lot stainless steel in their design style, that makes this hotel a contemporary minimalis. I was awed with all the details they put in the design of the hotel. Even the bathroom blind uses switch to open and close. The placement of the lighting are perfect, gives you a soft, relaxing, and comfort environment. The Hotel itself has some unique nice smell. I got a room with a nice view, overlooking the Gran Via and Placa d'Espana from the little terrace in the room. The top floor supposed to have a terrace with a really nice view of the area, unfortunately it was closed for renovation when I stayed there. Overall impression of the room...WOW!CON:not much, just u can feel the vibration of the Metro going underground and the bathroom is not totally covered, they are only separated by a glass and there is a blind which you can close. And the side, there is a semi transparant green glass that separated the bathroom and the aisle. It was okay, just don't feel like there was total privacy when you take a bath. If you are couples this will be perfect. ;)SERVICEIt was okay. Well, more than enough, the staffs were really nice and friendly. They were very helpful, and they speak English fluently. The only drawback was that I had to carry my bag myself as there was nobody from the staff offered to carry my bag to my room nor when I checked out. Other than that, it's good service. They are really good at advising their guest to get around Barcelona.VALUEI booked this hotel for √à√\u2020√ü?00\/night include breakfast AND a welcome cava. THIS IS AMAZING, consider the kind of place you are staying and what you get by staying here. Can't get any better.OVERALL CONCLUSIONI really recommend this hotel to anyone who visit Barcelona. I myself for my next visit might want to stay somewhere closer to the Placa Cataluna (They have sister hotels like Jazz and Soho), depend on the promotion they will be having.
