{"text":"Average Stay We just returned from our one week stay at the Riu Taino in Punta Cana. It was our first time in the Domincan, however our 2nd experience staying at a Riu chain.We arrived at the hotel late in the evening, checked in, but we were left to find our own room with our own luggage. We eventually found our room, and noticed that our clock was not working, and our screen door to the balcony was broken. We called reception to notify them, and they were not very eager to fix anything. During our stay, our television would stop working for a while as did our phone. The phone would cut in and out or was just full of static.The location of the resort is right off the beach, which was great because the beach was only steps away. The pools were clean, and the staff were constantly sweeping and picking garbage up which was nice to see.There was a 24 hour snack area available in the case that you missed dinner, however the food selection was not the greatest. The a la carte restaurants were not what we expected, there was still a 'buffet' style which had the same foods as the main buffet dinner. Overall, the food was not great, pretty much the same foods for the whole week. The shows were not the greatest either, some shows were definitely not suitable for young childern, and some were completely disorganized and unprepared.There isn't much shopping around, just 1 main strip and you have to be aware not to pay the full price of the items you're intersted in. Many times, we would be offered the same item for several different prices, and majority of the vendors have the same products.The overall service of the staff was average, we found that many staff did not understand English or French, they only spoke Spanish, so it was difficult at times to communicate any problems or requests we had. Overall, the trip was nice, but we won't be rushing back to this resort any time soon. ","annotations":[]}
