{"text":"Staying with a baby at Hotel Continentale Just returned from a 4 night stay at Hotel Continentale with my wife and 3 month old daughter. We stayed on a promotional rate for bed and breakfast, which was fantastic value for money.The hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating, and were great with the baby. They arranged a room with a bath as well as a shower, set up a cot next to the lovely double bed and delivered jugs of hot water daily for us to make up the baby's milk. The room itself was spacious, air-conditioned, had a great bathroom and good furnishings including a flat screen TV at the end of the bed (and the hotel staff also kindly installed a DVD player for us). Two minor criticisms were that there was no spare toilet roll and on one day when we returned to the room at 2 p.m. it had still not been made up.The hotel breakfast buffet was very good, and we also enjoyed the cocktails ordered on room service. A couple of odd quirks: one day we ordered a salad and a parma ham sandwich, which were both huge and well presented, and the next day the same sandwich order produced a much less appetising offering; and one day the drinks were delivered to the room with nuts and crisps, the next there weren't any complimentary snacks.The hotel location could not be better - so central we could have quick trips back from all the main sights if we wanted to feed or change the baby, or just to have a general chill out in the relaxation room.All in all, very comfortable stay in a lovely (if slightly quirky) designer hotel, with friendly staff who were only too keen to help out.Florence as a place needs no write ups - beautiful city, we were blessed with good weather, and found some great little places to eat (with the baby able to sleep in the buggie parked next to our table) - try Convivio e Olivio in particular. Can't wait to go back!
