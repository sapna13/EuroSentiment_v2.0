{"text":"I LOVED it, L-O-V-E-D it! Lets start with the Location. Great beach, great vegetation, great sand, great water, great everything. It wasn't too hot, or too cool--though there were some windy days. The Hotel itself was made of bungalows. Cozy compared to the huge palaces. Pool need sto be cleaned more often, and possibly heated a bit more. Though there are two pools, and one seemed to be always heated more than the other. So anyway, I'm not soooo picky about my hotels. I really care about the service and Location. But still.Food was great. My brother keeps on bugging me to go back their for our next vacation. So we're going to Riu palace Punta Cana. Service, I don't quite notice that much. I never use room service, and the front desk got us to our rooms pretty quickCons would be the smoking. Everyone there was always smoking and it made the whole place make me gag. I always had my head on my shoulder to try and stifle the stanch of cigar smoke. Also, the dress code absolutely needs to be stricter. There were always womyn on the beach tanning topless, which disturbed my entire family. Rooms, well, they're okay, but to be honest I don't really look at rooms, and I just Spend my time outside of the room. Things i like would be how every day there was a man with a wheelbarrow full of coconuts, and he would cut a hole into the coconut and we could drink the milk. I would recomend this hotel to anyone who doesn't mind smokers and topless womyn.
