{"text":"Loved this Wonderful Paradise Resort This was our first travel to anywhere and we had such a great time at this resort that we are planning to return in the near future. Our stay was from Sept 2nd to 9th.This resort as whole is beautifully designed from the gardens to hotel rooms. The staff are extremely friendly and are always cleaning and working hard to please you. I recommend tipping as a good gesture and the fact that the service is great. We were concerned about the food as people had warned us before we left that it will not be great. This is not the case at this resort. The food was very good and there is lots to choose from. They have buffets from morning, noon and night and then there is there is 6 a la carte restaurants to choose from for dinner: Japanese (excellent), Le Gourment (excellent), Garden Grill (very good), Seafood (very good), Italian (didn't try) and Mexican (didn't try). Our Club Golden package allowed us to choose 4 out of the 6 restaurants.I recommend the Club Golden package, as this gives you many additional extras. Such as: Free internet access, private check-in, free 24hr room service, in-room mini bar (stocked daily) etc.Overall the beach, pools, staff, food, the weather and the villas was perfect. It was a great choice we made for our first time travel. PS- My husband and I didn't know any spanish and we still were able to communicate with everyone as you'll find most of the staff speak enough english to get you by.
