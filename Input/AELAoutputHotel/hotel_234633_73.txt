{"text":"Good Experience for the Most Part After spending most of a recent trip to Paris in business type hotels outside the center of the city, we finished our trip at the Hotel Residence Foch to experience a more boutique-type hotel. Since our other hotels were a completely different style I can't really say how this hotel compares with others similar to it, but I will try to explain the facts for my experience. First off, although there are three different metro\/train options nearby, none are particularly close and after a long day of sightseeing (i.e. walking and standing in line) it would have been nicer to get back to the room a little quicker. The area is safe, quiet, and mostly residential, but does have some cafes and a small grocery market (which comes in handy if you don't want to spend a fortune on food) within easy walking distance. The Arc de Triomphe and Champs Elysees were within a mile or two of flat terrain walking so the location has some plusses and minuses. The hotel staff was very friendly and English was spoken by all. The room we had was tiny (#60) and was located next to the elevator so sleeping in much was difficult. The view was similar to the pictures shown, but the room was in need of some updating and\/or basic touch-ups. Nothing horrible, but seemed easily fixable. The breakfast buffet was very refreshing, but should have come with the room based on my reservation and our credit card seems to suggest otherwise. Just check with the front desk before you assume your reservation with free breakfast is noted. All in all, not the best, but certainly not terrible. A solid price, but considering the streets of Paris are littered with boutique hotels, I think I would have rather spent a little more to be in a more central location with a slightly nicer standard of room for my boutique experience.
