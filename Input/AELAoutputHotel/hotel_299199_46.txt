{"text":"no flip flops please Well if you are a business traveller and if you like to be in a very uptight, overpriced, overgroomed and really- nothing -special type of places along with the attitude of the staff that THINKS they are special, than this is the place for youAgain, for a business hotel, this is an appropriate venue. Howevef if you are looking for charm, elegance, nice staff and attention to detail avoid this hotel! and flipflops? Heaven forbid! I had just had a pedicure and attempted to come into the snob lobby for a coffee at 2pm and was told I could not stay there as I had sandals on...I wonder what they do with the indiens who are often in sarong and sandals at this fine establishment!-I booked this as a last stop to a very long and harmonious voyage thoughout Thailand where the people are nice, and the hotels I chose were well appointed with very accomodating and professional staff. I stayed in a five star hotel and no one mentioned my inappropriate dress' so maybe that was why this was so much of a shock when I hit Singapore and this particular hotel.and for fine tuning:if you are lucky enough to be in the club lounge, no problem with internet however if you are just a Priority Club member as I am (geez what does t h a t mean)?? I had the honour of paying 6 singapore dollars plus taxes for each FIFTEEN MINUTES of internet use in the hotel...again coming from Thailand in a five star where this was free I thought this was a little pricey!Finally, as a Priority Club member, I was honoured with a very nice pamphlet on the desk in my room showing all kinds of local exotic fruit....and I had two very hard non ripe PEARS offered as my welcome gift! So much for lichis, mangos and the like. This little detail I found very silly and just plain stupid for a five star hotelThe worst was when I checked out and the front office staff did not even ask how my stay was, but when I kindly mentioned he just smirked. When I said this was peculiar for a four star hotel he said 'oh no we are five star' to which I responded that made it even worse!Drinks or service at poolside? Five star service, call on the phone and waitIn room robes? Yes they are there if you dont mind em grey and wrinkedBest things about this hotel:-The very nice concierge and the fact that I was able to have an early check in -Leaving knowing I paid absolutely nothing as I was able to use my free milesThe worst:-The extreme snob attitude (dont stay here unless you are on business meeting your customers saddled in Gucci or Versace shoes)If you do get stuck-Enjoy the size proximity and cleanliness of the room (well other than the bandaid wraps I found on the floor) and Go to the toastbox (just next door) for breakfast and really good coffee!try raffles or the mandarin ","annotations":[{"endOffset":375,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":371},{"endOffset":534,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":528},{"endOffset":1138,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1134},{"endOffset":1211,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1207},{"endOffset":1497,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1493},{"endOffset":1537,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1533},{"endOffset":1719,"mention":"like","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Like_Cola"],"startOffset":1715},{"endOffset":2260,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2256},{"endOffset":2758,"mention":"raffles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Raffles_Hotel"],"startOffset":2751}]}
