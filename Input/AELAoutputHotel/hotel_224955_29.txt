{"text":"no way! I visit San Franciso often and I've stayed in many hotels there, and this has got to be the worst. We booked with a large group of friends, so this is how we ended up here. It was entirely overpriced ($340.00 for 2 nights). First of all, it is right next to a homeless shelter. You exit the door and you are suddenly surrounded by people yelling at you, trying to sell you drugs, and hitting you up for money. One man was urinating right in front of us. Last night we were dropped off by a taxicab a block away from the hotel and some guy started yelling at us and chasing us (2 women) up the street. We literally were running up the middle of the street because everyone loitering on the sidewalks were so scary looking. Be advised: this is definitely not the safest neighborhood for women! The hotel really ought to get a doorman to help fend off the neighbors.The noise level at night was ridiculous. There is a restaurant\/bar downstairs and at 2 am when it closed, the screaming, yelling, and sirens sounded like they were in our 7th floor room. The room was a typical boutique hotel room. The bed and pillows were uncomfortable and the room small. I would only recommend this place if it were about $75.00 a night, and I still wouldn't stay there.On a positive note, the restaurant attached to the hotel has good food and drinks, and a perk is that you don't have to walk outside to get to it!
