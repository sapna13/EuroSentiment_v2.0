{"text":"Fantastic!!!!!! Just got back from a week's vacation from the DR. We stayed at the LTI and it was fabulous. The LTI is a smaller resort which to us was a plus. Most resorts are sooooooo large that you have to take a shuttle to the beach! The food was fine. The buffet is good and the Pizzaria is great. You don't always need a reservation. We even got a pizza to go and took it back to our room one night. I don't recommend the other a la carte restaurant. It was the fanciest but the worst. I got an upset stomach pretty bad one day but nothing that a little medicine didn't take care of. The nightly entertainment was pretty good with the exception of one night (Comedy Night) - it was really bad. Pool is clear, the beach is out of this world!!! Lot's of chairs for everyone. I highly recommend taking the snorkle excursion with the tropical fish, shark, and mantarays (they harmless!). I'm 54, never snorkled in my llife and absolutely loved it. It was a fabulous afternoon.One thing we did when we went to the pool or beach was taking our ice bucket from our room. We got the bars to fill it up with ice and kept our drinks cool for longer and had extra ice when we needed it. A great little trick has been mentioned before but worth repeating. Your room card key goes into a slot in your room to turn on the power and air conditioner. When you leave the room you have to take your key so the air turns off. Take a rewards type card (not a credit card) and use it in the key slot to your room to keep the air conditioner on. I know some people that even used cardboard. Housekeeping does not remove them.Anyway, if your thinking about the LTI I would say you made a very good choice indeed!
