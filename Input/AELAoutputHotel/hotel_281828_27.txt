{"text":"Dissapointed at the Olympic I will have to admit, this hotel is well over rated, especially for the price. I am quite surprised every one reviews it as if its as fancy as staying in one of the Las Vegas 4 or 5 star hotels or better.In Las Vegas, this hotel would be considered a 3 star.The lobby is one of the least fancy i have ever seen in any fairmont property, (and i have stayed at at least a dozen of them.)I will give credit to the fact there was one lady at the concierge was very very kind, it was surreal.There on the other hand, was a male concierge , who ignored me as he flirted with a woman who was in town asking where the hip clubs would be, he must have stood there talking to her for 15 minutes , not even looking at me, or telling me he would be right with me in a moment,, nothing.I never did get the help that i needed.Next off, there is no place to buy any snacks, well there is a gift shop in the lower level which has about 2 flavors of potato chips to choose from, 1 cooler of beverages, maybe 4 types of chocolate bars, etc,etc, and it closes quite early. My main beef with the Olympic is that the rooms are small, and we received two single beds in our room, (that was just great for a romantic getaway for me and my wife, we got to sleep in two seperate beds). I went down to the front desk and there was no option to upgrade to 1 king bed without paying extra fees.For that kind of money , this is very surprising to meI have heard of two queen beds, but 2 single beds?I worried I would fall off the edge in the middle of the night.Who out there enjoys sleeping in a single bed?I did not know they even make those anymore do-they?The rooms also could use some renovating, including a flat screen tv for starters, its not common to get the old sears TV in the year 2008 in your room if you are in a upper class hotel.The location was great on the other hand, right across from the Purple restaurant, which has an unbelievable wine wall that is so high , it has a spiral staircase built around it to go up to get the bottle they need.Also nearby there is a great restaurant named the Brooklyn, 5 star dining for sure, great atmosphere, no candle light dinners or anything but very hip. Walking distance to almost anything you would need, such as the famous Pike Place Market, or the downtown shopping center and shops.
