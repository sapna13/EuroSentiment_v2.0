{"text":"JW Marriott delivers.....couldn't ask for more I stayed at the JW Marriott in Mexico City this past Labor Day weekend with my girlfriend and another couple, and I must say I was highly impressed. From the moment we stepped out of the cab from the airport we recieved impeccable service that I have yet to see in any the many fine hotels I have been fortunate enough to stay in. Everyone from the lowliest maintenance person to the chief concierge made us feel welcome and at home, and seemed to make it their personal responibilty to fulfill our needs. The rooms and bathrooms were tastefully decorated and very comfortable. The pool and spa area were excellent, located on the 7th floor, outdoors with a sweeping view of Chapultepec park and most massive Mexican flag I have ever seen waving in the wind. Truly a majestic sight. Perhaps the best part of JW was the hotel car service. For about the same price as a regular taxi in the states, you can have a personal driver at your disposal. Both drivers we utilized were very excited to impress us with their magnificent city. At Basilica de Guadalupe, and America v. Tigres at the Estadio Azteca, the car service delivered a safe, informative, quick, and comfortable way to travel the city. All in all, the JW was expensive, but it was satisfying when we left knowing that our money hadn't been wasted. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to visit Mexico City.
