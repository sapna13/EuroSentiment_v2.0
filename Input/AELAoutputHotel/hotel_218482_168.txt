{"text":"Eighth Year Staying Here This was the eighth year in a row that we have stayed at this resort. This time we took our niece and nephew and they had a great time. We thought that we might rather stay on the Royal Side after reading all the reviews, but found out that we liked this side better. We had VIP bracelets so we were allowed to use everything on the Royal side except to sleep there. The Royal side is further from the beach and all the good theme restaurants are on the other side. There are no children on the Royal side but there were many rude people at the pool the day we were there. They were taking other peoples lounge chairs and just in general very loud and obnoxious. All the great music and fun is on the regular side. I liked the free internet on the Royal side, tho. On the regular side it costs $3 for 15 minutes. A great hint for everyone is: Please be sure to take your own sunscreen, tan lotion, etc. The sunscreen down there cost $42 for 2 containers. One was spray, the other a lotion. If you can't find it in 3oz bottles, put it in some travel bottles you can buy at the department store. As for the mosquitoes that everyone seems to think are there, forget it. We never saw any and it was a little cloudy and rainy a couple of the days we were there. Food was great, drinks were great, there are no friendlier people on earth and if you can't find something you need or have a problem don't hesitate to ask without being rude. ","annotations":[]}
