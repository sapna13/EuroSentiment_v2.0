{"text":"Tina I stayed at the Catalonia for two weeks from July 28th to August 11th. Usually I travel to Cuba, but I thought I would try Punta Cana. Boy was I impressed! I don't understand why some people are complaining??? I find that most are complaining about such minor details!!!I know that I wrote alot, but I wanted to share even the smallest details that made me enjoy my vacation.The Room: I had room 123 which faced the ocean. It was clean and very large. The bed faces the window! All rooms are junior suites, so there is a small living room. The bathroom is split in two with the round tub and sink in one room and the toilet and shower in the other. The mini bar is stocked with soft drinks and beer. If you need a re-fill, just leave a note for the maid. Once we asked for beer and she left us eight. She got used to what we liked, so after the first week, she would automatically leave us what we wanted. There is a hammock, two rocking chairs and a clothes rack on the balcony. The first floors don't have a clothes rack.The Beach:Yes, you have to get up early to reserve the shade. So what? The sunrise is beautiful and worth it! Since we were right in front of the beach, it was steps from our door. There is a bar on the beach. They also clean the seaweed every day. My boyfriend went snorkeling and said that there is a small coral reef that is interesting. Alot of women go topless on the beach for those of you that are interested.The Pool:There is a bar and a swim up bar. There is also a waiter that walks around and takes drink orders. I'm not really a pool person, so I didn't go there too often. I prefer the beach! The pool itself is quite large.The Buffet:Personally, we enjoyed it. Like I said, I usually go to Cuba, so compared to Cuba, it was great! No, it's not the Ritz, but it was still good. The service there is good especially since you are not assigned one waiter, they all take care of you. They also have a hostess that will seat you. The A La Cartes:Japanese: Go for the experience. You won't be disappointed. I tried the steak.American: The steaks and desserts are amazing! I had the T-bone. The first time I had the apple pie and the second I had the brownie. The brownie was so good!French: I had the filet mignon, it was ok.Mexican: I can't really give an opinion, because I always have trouble digesting mexican food, but my boyfriend like it. TIP: order a tequila and see what happens!!!!Other Restaurants:Pool snack bar: There is a machine where you can make soft ice cream cones...mmmmmmBeach Buffet: There is a smaller buffet by the beach that also serves breakfast and lunch.FYIThere are ducks and geese that roam the grounds near the pond.The paths from the villas to the main area are all shaded.There is a Creparie in the shopping centre area.They give you an actual metal key to the safe.A photographer walks around so you can take a picture with a monkey, iguana, parrots...etc....the pictures cost 8$. You pick them up by the lobby.The craft fair was every Friday. Make sure you bargain with the vendors.Men MUST wear long pants and closed shoes at the a la cartes.The staff is friendly, try saying hello every morning and you'll be surprised!Next time, we want to try the Royal side, it looks interesting.....Would I go back??? Yes of course!
