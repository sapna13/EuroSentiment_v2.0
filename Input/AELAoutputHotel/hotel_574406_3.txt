{"text":"Not Really One of the previous reviewers seemed unsure how they felt about this hotel. That's me too! Some positives, it's new, it does have great harbour views on higher floors. Plenty of local life nearby - from local laundry (much cheaper than hotel service) to ex pat and local night club style bars and a7\/11. The hotel's very small bar has a great character for a bar man (Randy, who is the only bit of atmosphere in this hotel). It also has to be said that the location is handy for all the main parts of Kowloon.Ask for a bath tub room, the one I had was positioned so you could take a bath and look out of the full length windows over Kowloon and Hong Kong Island.The negatives, the hotel is a bit on the noisy side, which is probably down to the design of the building. Limited public space, the hotel is tall but has a small foot print, which also gives a very disjointed design. None are real big problems, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just that overall, it is just not one of the many good and atmospheric Hong Kong hotels.If you are looking at the club or executive lounge packages then this is probably not for you. The lounge is totally lacking in any atmosphere and although you can use the bar on the floor below for inclusive drinks, on two of the nights I during my stay, the hot snacks, so much part of executive floor lounges, were out of action and when available where tired and unappetising. Given that the price difference for executive floor access between here and the close by Shangri La and Grand Stanford are not great, the Panorama is poor value and not in the same league.Would I stay here again? Probably not. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":292,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":288}]}
