{"text":"I give this hotel 9\/10! My husband and I stayed at this hotel for three nights this summer. We were VERY happy with this hotel! I think the reason for our great price is because the interior of the hotel is being renovated and some floors are under construction. The Good:- Nice location, not *too* touristy. Within walking distance of museums in one direction and tons of restaurants\/shopping in th other direction. Also very close to several Tram lines in case you need to get to a different part of the city.- Room was very modern looking, very clean, and very comfortable. The bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. - The shower is AMAZING. Our room had of those downpour shower heads AND another shower head to choose from. - The hotel staff is very helpful and accomodating. We were looking for a nice Restaurant to visit one night and asked at the front desk for ideas. She gave us several suggestions, then called the restaurant of our choice to make a reservation, and gave us a map of how to get there. - The hotel restaurant, called The Inn At The Park is very tasty and affordable! The Bad: (not much was bad, really!)- Our room was on the backside of the hotel, so we didn't have the greatest of views out our window.- There is not much privacy from the bathroom  shower. They are very much a part of the room, but behind this modern looking frosted glass. A little embarassing if you're using the restroom  there's people in your room! : )Overall I would give this hotel 9\/10!
