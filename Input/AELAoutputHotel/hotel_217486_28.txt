{"text":"Practical not Comfort Loaded The Aqua Marina is a budget motel in downtown Honolulu, something of a rarity these days. As you can see by many of the other reviews the rooms are not without their faults. They are just simply basic rooms, not great views, quirky, and small, but where else can you get a small fridge, free in-your-room, high speed internet access, and a convenient location to the Federal buildings, state buildings, Ward shopping center, Ala Moana Mall and Waikiki all for about $75 per night. If you are a frequent traveler to Honolulu or you just have a few nights before you head off to another Island this is not a bad choice. Lets face it there is not a lot of good reasons that anyone would want to be in Waikiki for very long, So at least at $75\/night you are not wasting your money also!If you are on a once in a lifetime vacation, first of all DO NOT go to Waikiki. If you must don't look at the Aqua Marina as a high end resort, because it isn't, but that is why you are paying $75\/night and not $350\/night.Some other good things about the Aqua Marina, there is available parking for an additional $18\/day with a remote control for the gate, there is laundry, and a pool. The website for all the Aqua resorts is very user friendly and makes it quite simple to make your own reservations, you can also explore their other properties and compare rates. They offer AAA discounts and something called the Savey Surfer. The location is very accessible to Waikiki without being right in the heart of the madness. Buses can take you to the other end of Waikiki if you are trying to get to the Aquarium or Zoo. Also the staff at the front desk were very friendly and helpful.I would not pay for the Ocean View room as the view is not worth the extra money, you have to wait longer for the elevator, and the windows only open a crack and are hard to see through due to salt air deposits.If you want a little more upscale (still at a good price $99\/night) try another Aqua property located on the same grounds called Equus (see reviews) it has more upscale rooms but all else is budget, if I am only staying one night I frequently book the Equus as it is cleaner and a little more comfortable.Finally across the street is a Hilton\/Sheraton? Very upscale nice pool, decent food, sauna, and you can pay a day fee for access. With all the money you save splurge!
