{"text":"A Must Stay! Well, after reading many great reviews of Affinia 50 on tripadvisor, I booked this hotel for a period of 5 night and believe you me, it is all that people are saying it is.Size, Price and a personal touch is what makes Affinia 50 great.We arrived after a long and tiresome trip at the the front desk with an announcement that we booked a room with 2 beds (which was correct, at the time of my booking it a great deal), but you are only two, yes we are, so don't you want a queen size then?, nope thank you.They offered us complementary breakfast or Internet but I wouldn't budge.Anyways, we ended up in a Queen size Suit and after my initial anger I found out that this Suite was Hugde and why was I even making this a problem!Damn, if only I had taken them up on their extra offers, oh well, I guess I need to have a little more trust in people.For the paid price the location (50th and 3rd) and size are incredible.The only minus point I can find (looking very hard) are the temperature in the room, suggest to put of the heating in total and book a room as high as possible (we were staying on the 6th floor (and that is really noisy).The bed was really confy and so we the pillows.Bathroom has all you need (i was only missing some bathgell, would be handy when having a bath!!).For good and simple breakfast go next door to the lunchonette.Also nearby (if you are craving a good steak) go to Smith and Wollensky.For the best Bagels in town, go to 3rd ave. between 49 and 50th st., wait in line for heaven.And also please pay a visit to the concierge on the second floor (Sid), besides being a very funny and friendly guy, he can give you a lot of great tips.On our last night we went to a restaurant called TAO (on madison and 57th i think), great food and you are looking at a giant Buddha with a size over 2 floors.I was thinking of checking out another hotel next time I am in NY, maybe picking up a good deal for some 5 star hotel.But to tell you the truth why take the change while you know Affina 50 is the way to go.Oh before I forget the doormen are really helpful and friendly.Gotten some good tips and they even knocked on my door offering some free cheesecake, awsome!!
