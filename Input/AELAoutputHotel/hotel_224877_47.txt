{"text":"not worh it We stayed at the MO in Miami for 5 nights during the New Year's holiday. Although we had a nice time and enjoyed the views of the bay, I would have to say that the service of this hotel is not up to par. We found the concierge(s) to be more dismissive than helpful. We found it difficult to get service at the pool or beach and the food was very slow in the restaurants. We also had to call three times to ask for help with our luggage. We ended up carrying all of our heavy bag ourselves. Not what one would expect at a 5 star hotel. The prices for food and amenities (not to mention the rooms) is astronomically high...and I'm comparring that to NYC.I also found it irritating that the service was already included with each check. That standard gives very little credit to the customer. I also think the hotel is too small. Granted it was New Year's weekend and one would expect a large crowd of families and europeans, but the pool was jammed packed all day as was the so called beach. These areas are just far too small to accomodate the hotel sufficently. The service could not manage to take care of everyone' s needs and keep the place clean. The pool area is way to small. It was difficult to even walk past the pool without almost falling in. The beach area too - Guests would leave books and such on the beds early in the morning and then not show up to use the beds till the afternoon. Subsequently there were not even enough beach chairs for everyone that wanted to sit on the beach.Some these things are understandable and I am not that high maintenance of a travellot. Ultimately I still enjoyed the hotel, but for the price you are paying they should be able to meet everyone's needs.
