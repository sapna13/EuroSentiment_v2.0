{"text":"My Stay Im 14 years old, and just beacuse im young, dont think i dont know what im talking about!...ii went from june 28 to july 3.i stayed in d.r. at the melia caribe tropical. I dont know where to start!!...well, the place was so darn big, there was a train\/trolley that took you from one side to the other! There are also many workers in golf carts that will drive u where u need to go...but i dont recommend this place for older people. I went with my sisters age 15 and 17, my uncle age 35, my grandmother in her 60's, and my great grandmother age 92...it was a hassle getting my great grandmother from one side to the other...she can somewhat walk, but not fully. She couldnt go on the trolley because of her wheelchair, and for her to get somewhere, someone had to either push her, or a golf cart had to take her. But, i highly recommend this place to any age!!! This place is action packed, and u wont wanna leave. There is a mall on the resort, but it's kind of wack...there is a baseball diamond, a very small basketball court, the beautiful beach, like 8 pools (2 with swim up bars), mad bars (on land lol), an arcade, a club, like 8 restaurants, and many many many more!...my advice to you is if you know good italian food, dont go to the italian resaturant. I highly highly highly recommend the dominican restaurant...we went there 2 nights in a row... When we first got to d.r., it seemed to me like the staff expected tips. But the staff is super cool! If you can, try to find a guy named danger... He is the best!........u will really enjoy it if you go here, and my family and i are plannning on going back!MY BIGGEST CON IS THAT ALMOST NONE OF THE STAFF MEMBERS SPEAK ENGLISH!...ITS ANNOYING!...ALSO, CHECK IN TAKES A SUPER LONG TIME!
