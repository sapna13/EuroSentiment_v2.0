{"text":"What A Stay In The City By The Bay! I stayed at this motor inn for one week in october I booked two queen beds, the room we had was facing buchanan street at the side of the building on the third floor the room was huge with two queen beds which would have slept three people easily on each bed. there was a table with three chairs, sofa, and a refrigerator and the bathroom was also very roomy, this room was just an incredible value for the money not to mention the free wireless internet access , free local phone calls and the most important thing the free parking we used our car to drive up and down the crooked street, muir woods and over the golden gate bridge into sausalito and other side trips dont forget to make reservations at spinnakers in sausalito the view was absolutely unbelieveable.we also purchased a seven day muni passport. the #30 stockton will get you to chinatown, northbeach, union square, and ghiradelli square where you can delight in the best hot fudge sundae I have ever tasted.I got one of the best feelings jumping off a cable car before it even stopped.you must use your key to get to the elevator which made us feel very secure,special thanks to sherman at the front desk for outstanding customer service and providing great directions there was some street noise at night but not enought to keep us awake I sleeped liked a baby.Im so glad I decided to go this route instead of staying in one of those cramped hotel rooms in union square with no car or a $40 a day charge to park my car thanks coventry motor inn for making my trip to sanfrancisco unforgetable .......
