{"text":"Not bad, some issues. We stayed at the Sofitel New York on 2 occasions, from dec. 22 till dec. 27 and again from jan 1 till jan. 5.During these stays we had 3 rooms, 1 normal room and 2 Junior Suites.This hotel has smoking and non-smoking rooms (floors).The smoking rooms are located on floors 8 and 24.We requested a Junior Suite, Smoking, King bed.We got the suites we requested, but strangely enough there was a big difference between the Junios suites we had on our first stay on the 24th floor and the one we had on our second stay on the 8th floor.Both rooms had some maintenace issues, the doors that lead to the bedroom had bend handles on them. In our first suite the showerhead was not properly stuck on the wall of the shower but it worked.The suites were nice. The one on the 24th floor had a strange layout with a relatively bigg hall and a small living area. The one on the 8th floor was much better. Both rooms were a bit dark, brown and could use a little brightning-up with more lively colours, they were a bit depressive now.As i said, the suites were quite different, for example the suite on the 8th floor had nice plasma tv's when the suite on the 24th had really old-fashioned normal tv's.We were not really happy about the housekeeping. We left in the morning and hen we came back in the afternoon our suite still had to be cleaned. If we called for cleanup it would always take at least 1 hour, sometimes 1 1\/2 hour to get somebody to make up our room. This is not acceptable in my opinion.We ate in the restaurant once, not bad but nothing really special. The bar was ok but al little expensive. We had breakfast once in the restaurant but prefered to go a few doors down on 45th street where a great new bagelshop had just opened (Milk  Honey)When we came back for our second stay we arrived early in the morning (about 10 am). I asked if they might have a room available for us to rest and shower in until our suite would be ready (they said it would be ready at 5.00 pm, in reality it was 07.30 pm before we could get in our suite). At first nothing was available and that would mean waiting all day until our suite would be ready. After some stalking of the front desk a room was available at 12.00 am. This room was next to our suite. This was a normal king-room and it looked quite nice. Not much of a view (the same as for our suite) but that doesn't matter to me.Taking all into consideration this was a good stay, with a few minor issues, but looking at the rate we paid well woth it. We will stay here again when visiting New York.
