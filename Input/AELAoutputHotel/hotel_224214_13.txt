{"text":"great service I ,like many others, really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. It was my first time in NY and i was travel with my twin children aged 11. As i was quite nervous about gettng out and about the staff were extremey helpful whenever I asked questions. The icing on the cake as far as the staff were concerned was that my daughter collapsed with de-hydrated one morning in our room. I called receiption and within a few mintues a doctor was on the telephone suggesting she should be taken to hospital.I panicked but didn't need to worry. within five minutes two membersof staff knocked on the door telling me an ambelance was on its way and did i need help. Everyone was so efficent!!. We finally returned some hours later to be greeted by a lot of the staff all checkng we were ok. When we got to our room there was a ballon say get Well plus a big teddy bear in a box! and a card sgned by the staff.The checked every few hours to see if we needed anything and there after always made sure we had plenty of water in the room. The front staff checked everyday to make sure my daughter was ok. I don't know of any hotel that would give this kind of service!!!!!!! I would like also to mention the door staff wjo were excellent. I would like to thank Darren Sumner who oversaw everythngThe other big bonus is in the park opposite the hotel, every Friday in the summer they have free concerts. The week we were there it was Usher!!
