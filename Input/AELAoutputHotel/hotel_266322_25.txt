{"text":"Great Hotel for the Price I stayed at the Clarendon recently for a business trip and took the advice of other Tripadvisors reviews. I was a little hesitant because the reviews were a mixed bag. Fortunately I would have to say I was one who throughly enjoyed this hotel and definetly would come back.To start off, the hotel is a little off center. It is in the middle of a neighborhood and not really close to much. The main entrance doors were broken, and when I entered the other doors, a man was photographing a young women for I don't know what. Moving past that, the people who worked there were extremely nice and helpful. They upgraded my room to a Junior Suite. Score. The room was huge, and the bed was a very comfortable king size bed. The bathroom was fine with boutique beauty products and nice decor, but the bathtub was a little dirty. The room and the hotel are definetly colorful with lots of artwork, but I thought it looked really nice and modern. The room was clean and it came with a 42 flat screen TV with HD, cable, and DVR!!! The wireless internet was really fast when I first got there, which is rare for me, but at night did not really work at all.The hotel is provided with an amazing looking pool in the central courtyard. I unfortunately didn't use it, but If I had more time, I definetly would of. The bar looked nice, and the upstairs bar was closed at the time of the visit (a little disappointing, but it was Tuesday). I ate Breakfast at the restaurant the next morning, and it was good, but a little pricey. Overall this was a great hotel and I would definetly recommend this to anyone coming to Phoenix. It was especially good for the deal (less then $100).
