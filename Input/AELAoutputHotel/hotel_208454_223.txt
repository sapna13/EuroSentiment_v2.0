{"text":"Fabulous Hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel New York from the 17th to 21st November and had a fantastice time.We have used Sofitel several times before in Europe and have never been disappointed so we chose this one based on our own Sofitel experiences and the Tripadvisor reviews.After a rather hairy ride into Manhattan in a NY cab we arrived at the front door. (Make sure you pick up a cab from the official stand at JFK - the drivers have to give you their details so you can make a complaint if you need to, and charge a fixed fare of $45 plus tolls and tip). The concierge was straight out to take our luggage and we headed inside for a very swift check-in by very efficient staff.We had a room on the 24th floor with great views, especially at night. The room was spotless and very well equipped - and it's true what they say about the beds!! Heaven!The hotel is very well situated just a stroll away from Times Square where we picked up the Tour Bus. We bought a 48 hour pass with Gray Line which was excellent. OK - so you get caught up in traffic from time to time but you are in the middle of Manhattan!! The Tour Guides were great fun and had loads of little tips and secrets to tell!From the hotel it's easy to get to 5th Avenue, Central Park, The Rockerfella Centre, Empire State Building, Grand Central ... infact most of central Manhattan!We had breakfast at the Red Flame Diner .... massive portions, more than enough to last the day and ate out locally at night. Ruby's, just along Broadway from Times Square was a great place to eat and had a great selection if you wanted to get away from burger and chips!We had drinks in the hotel bar where the staff were very friendly and efficient, infact every member of staff we met greeted us politely as we passed.The free internet in the lobby was excellent - much easier to email everyone than send a postcard - and checkout was quick and efficient.All in all a great stay in New York. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone.
