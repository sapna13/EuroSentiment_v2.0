{"text":"Sanctioned Theft - Proceed with Caution! I stayed at the Galeria Plaza while in Mexico City on business.The room was comfortable, the service was good, and the location was central. Breakfast was great, if a little pricey; neighborhood had a lot to offer, if a little shady after hours. I was happy with most every aspect of my stay - until I checked out.Upon checking out of the hotel, I was given my additional charges, as is customary.My phone bill - for four international phone calls of approximately 20 minutes each, to the US; 5 phone messages; and one domestic call - also under ten minutes - came to 5796.80 MXN! While I have traveled enough to know that international calls from a hotel room are going to be expensive, this was an expense I never dreamed of! I was cautious and limited my calls, but as I had no cell service, I did need to call home.$579 USD? Because I got a great deal on the hotel, it exceeded the cost of my stay. Because I got a great deal on my plane ticket, it is almost equal to the cost of my ticket. I was outraged, and personally insulted by the amount charged.When traveling, you know to gird yourself against theft. I did so, following all rules - i kept under $100 on me at all times, and I kept everything of value (watch, wedding rings, and Passport) locked in the hotel safe. I did not, however, imagine that I needed to gird myself againsthe hotel itself- alas, that is where the robbery ocurred! Sanctioned, at the check out counter!While the charges can be avoided by not making phone calls, it is the practices underlying the charges that should make you hesitate to book this location.
