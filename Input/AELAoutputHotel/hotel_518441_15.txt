{"text":"Strange but enjoyable I have been to Bali a lot over the years and deeply love the culture, food, atmosphere, scenery, etc. The Chedi Club at Tanah Gajah is like no other place I have been to in Indonesia and I am not sure this is a good thing. It can tick all the boxes for luxury resort but over-all it has a very cold atmosphere and not at all Balinese. We stayed in a pool villa and I think this was really the best thing about our time here. The villas are luxurious, the bathrooms gorgeous, the restaurant stunning, the pool lovely BUT you could be anywhere in the world.If you are going to spend this kind of money I would suggest trying to find somewhere a bit more authentic. Ubud has so much to offer I really thing you could do better. You couldn't go wrong with the Four Seasons Sayan!I do want to say thank-you to the head chef who went out of his way to please us. We will try anything and Indonesian food is a big reason for us to visit Bali. I have a severe allergy though and quite often this can restrict me in being too adventurous. This wasn't the case here as The Chedi head chef happily made me any dish I wanted on the menu whilst allowing for my dietry requirements.One last thing- PLEASE REMOVE THE BIRDS IN CAGES!!! They are everywhere around the resort and in todays day and age I personally can't understand why they would think anyone would agree with this.
