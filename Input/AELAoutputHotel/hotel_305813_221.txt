{"text":"The Other Reviews Said It All! I rely almost totally on TripAdvisor reviews when booking hotels, so was expecting a marvelous experience at the Langham Place Hotel. I was not disappointed! I have been to Hong Kong 4 times, but this time I decided to take my children  their spouses (party of 6) for 5 nights. I figured Mong Kok would be more fun for them than elsewhere,  wanted a somewhat newish hotel for their introduction to one of the world's most exciting cities. The Langham Place Hotel was perfect! Check-in was easy, probably because we had e-mailed our requests ahead of time. There was a large convention of cardiologists in the hotel plus a wedding when we arrived, yet it didn't seem crowded. The rooms we had were on different floors with varied views, but all wonderful. I note that the hotel offers Sunday entertainments for children, which was quite a nice touch. There are changing signs in the lobby (on the 4th floor) that detail coming events. I particularly liked the fact that the bar had rolling BBC headlines, and that at breakfast the placemats showed newsheadlines, DJIA, and stock market closes from around the world. Breakfast was great! Dim sum, sushi, eggs made to request, hot and cold cereals, fresh honey comb, fresh fruits (even lichees!), and some of the best, flaky pastries I've ever had. Breakfast was included in our hotel room price, BTW. The Ming Court restaurant has superb food, altho the English translations of the dishes leaves a bit to be desired (I had difficulty thinking about eating fungus for example, altho I know they meant mushroom). The decor is sleek, accented with excellent quality reproductions of bronzes and ceramics found in the Mong Kok area. Prices are not inexpensive  everything is a la carte ($5 US for a Tsing Tsao beer; $10 US for a glass of wine; $10 for a salad; $30 entree), but the quality is worth it. We wanted to return to Loong Yuen, a fabulous restaurant in the basement of the Holiday Inn (yes, really!), so asked the concierge to make a reservation for us. He did, but with the caveat that we would have to be finished by 8:30 because the restaurant had been booked for a wedding. When we arrived, we were surprised to find that the chef had put together a special menu just for us, complete with a Private Reserve Shiraz wine. How nice for the Concierge to request that special treat on his own!The rooms are adequate in size - actually quite large by HK standards. There is a desk, with desk chair, TV, Smart Phone, chest of drawers, 2 bedside tables, an arm chair, small refrig, accoutrments for fixing coffee or tea, a nice-sized closet with ironing board  iron. Again, there are charges for beverages and coffee\/tea. However, we received 2 bottles of complimentary water daily. The toiletries provided were fine - nothing special, but I really liked the turn-down service with slippers. We didn't have kimonos in our room, like my children did, but the terry-cloth bathrobes were nice. The spa treatments were impressive (price reduction if booked between 8-10 a.m.). For $200 US you get a 2 hour pampering: facial, mud wrap, accupressure massage. What could be better after a day running around Hong Kong  Kowloon?Check out went smoothly. There were no surprises on the bill. Our bags were picked up promptly. All in all, I'd rate this hotel highly, and would return in a heartbeat. The food and staff are stupendous!
