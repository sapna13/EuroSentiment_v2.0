{"text":"Had fun @ Sirenis My bf and I just returned from our trip to DR at Sirenis resort and we really enjoyed ourselves. Everyone was right about the trip from the airport to the hotel. Very bumpy and scarey! They drive soo crazy down there!As for the hotel overall it was very nice. The compound is very well kept. Someones out there everyday trimming trees and keeping everything clean! When we 1st arrived there we had to wait an hr. for our room. We were told we'd have a king bed. When we got to our room there were 2 full beds instead.But we did have a nice view of the beach  ocean so we didn't complain. We booked with apple vacations so our trip included free room service and free safe box in room. The a la carte restaurants were pretty good. The steak at the steakhouse was a lil rough though.The rooms were ok. When we 1st got there there were ants on the bed and ants on the counter in the bathroom. Beds are hard too. Other than that we were happy.The beach was very nice! We woke up early everyday to save a hut on the beach w\/ our towels.The pool was big but was falling apart. the tiles were falling off the sides. They even taped off an area b\/c part of the floor going up to the pool fell apart.Everynight they had shows which were fun to watch.We did 2 excursions too. We snorkled w\/ sharks  stingrays. We also did the zip lines which were awsome!Overall our trip was fun! Staff were very nice and grounds very beautiful. Hopefully this review helps some of you out there.
