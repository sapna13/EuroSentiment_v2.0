{"text":"Great hotel, good location Stay in hotel Adriatico was part of Gate1 tour that happened in Apr 2008. It was a very wise choice on their part - 20 mintes of leisure walk walk to all main sights. A lot of Italians were staying in a hotel as well.If you are not comforable in immigrant block, you might feel unasfe walking at night. But really there is no problem - its a city and you have to live its life. For italians it wasn't a problem - there are a lot of great restaurants, wine bars near the hotel filled by locals. We had one of the best meals just around the corner from our hotel (recommended by british guidebook Lets go Italy)Train and bus station is 7 min walk from a hotel - very convinient for trips outside of Florence.Due to the brand you'll find some amenities Americans are used to, it has more modern classic than traditional tuscan design. Hotel is eco friendly with light saving option. Breakfast was european style with cold meat cuts, bread, fresh fruit, some cereal, omlet (very runny) and deserts. Rooms are big enough with flat screen TV, hard wood floor, cloth press. Typical for Europe - absence of queen size beds - its two twins pooled together. Bathrooms have tab, towel warming rack. Modern windows keep the street noise down.WIfi connection was available at the lobby - It seems expensive, nezt door to the hotel there is a very simple internet cafe where 1 hr online cost you 2 euro. But I don't think you have much time to spend on a computer - unless you have your museum resrvations online. Highly recommend to make a reservation for Uffizi gallery before you leave for Italy. Otherwise its very hard to get tickets - hotel will be able to make arrangements for triple of the regular price. Its a hotel business - so its your choice how you want to spend your money. Average meal was around 22 euro per person including Salad or Soup or Pasta as a first course and entree as a main course including wine and coffee.There is a very good outdoor market by Palazzo Vechio be careful what are you buying - some scarfs are made in Asia or India (but have italian labels on them) - look around.
