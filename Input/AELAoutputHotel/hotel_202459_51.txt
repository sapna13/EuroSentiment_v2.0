{"text":"Excellent hotel, location and value I have lived in Berlin for 18 months and have passed the bland facade many times, noting only its prime location on the banks of the Spree, across from the Berliner Dom. I had never considered staying there (I have had to stay in hotels in between long-term apartments) until I read the reviews here and found a great rate.Wow! What a gem, especially for tourists.I stayed ina Business Class room for 159 EUR. The upgrade from 119 got me free internet access, free pay movies, bathrobe and slippers, free newspaper, prime Dom view, Nespresso maker, and an iron and pants press. You'd have to make the call yourself.At the lower rate, in particular, the hotel represents outstanding value. Non-suite rooms are 27 sq m (standard and business are the same) and don't feel crowded at all, thanks to very clever room design.The shower is a bath\/shower combination. If you need a walk in, you might want to double check.Had dinner at hEat, described as Fusion. I stuck to the Indian submenu, which was high-quality, but underspiced (i.e., mainstream), with a limited menu. Great service, though, and reasonable prices.The lobby is dominated by the huge aquarium rising through the center, which (as long as you never consider what might happen if it breaks) is a fun change from the norm. It does bring a lot of tourists off the street who just want a peek, rather than paying admission around the corner to ride up the center of the aquarium in a slow lift. Those crowds, however, are fully blocked off from the lobby, so noise is kept down.It is, however, a large hotel, so don't expect boutique charm and great people watching in the lobby.For a tourist, the location is outstanding. You are across the river from Museum Insel, and on the road that becomes Unter den Linden. (Tip: The 100 and 200 buses, which run across the city and provide a penny-pinching alternative to a city tour bus, stop right out front. If you want a quick shuttle along Unter den Linden -- stay, two stops to get to Friedrichstrasse -- ask for a kurzstrecke ticket from the bus driver. At 1.10 or 1.20 EUR, it's half the price of a normal AB ticket and lets you go six bus stops in one direction. Nice trick if you're feet are starting to give out).The hotel is also directly across from the Fernsehrturm (TV Tower) at Alexanderplatz, and an easy walk to Hackeschermarkt and the hipper areas of Mitte.In the other direction, Gendamenmarkt is also an easy walk. There are several good, upscale restaurants here including what I think is the original Lutter  Wegner and a very nice Italian restaurant Buca di Beppo.Underground parking with direct access by elevator from the lobby is available at normal parking garage rates (which aren't too bad in Berlin).
