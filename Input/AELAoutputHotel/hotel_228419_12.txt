{"text":"Exceptional service, very friendly Stayed in this hotel 10 days on a business trip so got to know the place really quite well. The hotel is located about 10\/15 minutes by taxi from the city centre and the Ramblas - the main street off which there are numerous side streets and alleys to explore in the Gothic part of Barcelona. The metro and buses are also located fairly close to the hotel. A few hundred yards along the main road is El Corte Ingles - department store open until about 22.00 selling everything from food to furniture, as well as several really quite good restaurants - try La Bo Tiga, excellent tapas served in a chic environment or my favourite (because it's authentic traditional Spanish) the restaurant L'Antull tucked away in a back street just behind the hotel (go down the ramp, turn right, immediately left down narrow alley, then right after 100 yards and you will see it on the corner) - doesn't look like much, basic decor, great fish, and if you get on with the waiter, as much agua diente you can handle! Don't bother with restaurant Si Senor right by the hotel - more like No Senor, bad food, service etc.Hotel rooms however are not great - clean certainly, but lacking charm, and not great prices either. However, on the 4th floor there is the executive lounge which serves free food and drink all day (no one seems to bother checking if you have an exec room!).Public areas are modern and reasonably comfortable with good bar service. Meeting rooms are very good but pricey - get your own lunch sent in or go out.Service at this hotel is excellent, any problems quickly resolved; all staff are cheerful and friendly. I would give the hotel 5 stars overal if it were not for the rooms as mentioned already.
