{"text":"Nice Hotel, shame about the little things A nice Hotel, but the holiday was spoiled by the Hotel messing up the booking and then being dishonest about it.Not what you expect from an Accor Hotel. (if you are interested the full saga is at the end)Swimming Pool was good, however there were not enough loungers. The pool itself was a strange green colour, with algae growing around the sides! Funny taste to the water.Rooms, although very tastefully decorated were lacking in some basics; blinds that did not close properly, poor air-conditioning, lack of hot water in the evening, not what you expect from a four star hotel. Very noisy kids on the adjoining balcony, which isn't the hotels fault but the sound proofing was very poor.I would give this place 3 stars.Booking Saga......Booked the Hotel via the Accor Website in March 2008 giving them my credit card, as is usual with AccorReceived an e-mail from the Sofitel in Bali a week before we were due to travel asking for my credit card details.Replied, saying I have already booked and I'm not prepared to send them again via e-mail. They said the room would be cancelled unless I sent the Credit Card details.Spoke to Accor in the UK, who thought this very unusual and advised me NOT to send them the details, they confirmed my booking with Accor was already made and guaranteed. I advised the Hotel this, and suddenly they changed tack, now they said they were over booked and the first two nights were to be spent in a 'Luxury villa'. I protested and queried why I was not told earlier, no reply. Reluctantly agreed.Met at Airport and driven to villa, very nice, but; 5kms from the beach, stinking hot and in the middle of no where. They then said we would have to spend 4 nights there.Protested and showed the staff the correspondence that said only two nights. Balinese smiles all round but difficult to get a straight answer.After 30minutes staying at the Villa the heat had gotten too much and got a taxis to the Sofitel Hotel to complain.At the very least we wanted a beach front hotel for two nights, Eventually reached a compromise. They booked us at the Hotel Padma which is on the beach about 1km to the south.It had good rooms\/location\/pool, all in all a better hotel and cheaper rates than the Sofitel.After all this hastle, not a word from Accor Customers services, just a free sports massage from the hotel worth a few pounds!
