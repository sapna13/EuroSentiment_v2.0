{"text":"Good service and nice room, still prefer Conrad I booked this four night stay on awards points using the AXON promo for 125,000 points (available only for Hilton AMEX card holders). Anyways, I wanted to book at the Conrad where I had a great stay on a prior trip, but they had already fulfilled their allotment for HHonors bookings. We came in by train from the airport and had trouble finding where the shuttle picked up. Luckily, we had rented a cell phone from the airport and were able to call them. It ended up being by the Keio Department store. It is confusing because it shares its bus stop with the city bus and there is only a little sign with the Hilton logo that marks it. Our room was not ready at 1PM (check in time is not till 3 or 4) however we were able to get some lunch across the street at Denny√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ while we waited. The room was ready by 2 and I got a free upgrade to the executive floor for being a gold member. The room was very clean and fresh. The views were also good. While the room was free, the roll away for the third person cost us a whopping 7000 yen a night (approx. $65). I know this included the occupancy charge for the third person, but still. The internet was also free on the executive floors. The executive lounge was very nice (I would say even better than Conrad√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂). It was very large and always had a full stock of soda√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ water, and beer that guests could just help themselves to. The evening reception was nice and had a full comp bar and snacks. The free breakfast had both western and Japanese dishes. The only problem we had during our stay was that when we booked a helicopter tour at the concierge desk they gave us the instructions to tell leave one hour ahead of time to get their early (and tell then that we were leaving so they could confirm it). After the one hour mark we were only just over half way their. When we called to cancel they said it was 100% cancellation fee. This ruined the entire afternoon because this was supposed to be the highlight of our trip. To compensate the hotel ended up being able to get them to waive the cancellation fee. The indoor pool was a little bit of a disappointment. Considering how much they charge ($25\/person\/day) it was quite bleak. Being gold I got free admission. They made you wear these dumb swimming caps and the place on a whole looks dilapidated and of need of remodel. They had separate male and female saunas and baths and this of course meant it was √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√òraditional Japanese√à√\u2020\u2022? I had to say I was a little bit hesitant at first to strip all the way down and √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µake a bath√à√\u2020\u2022?with other people, but when I finally did it I could finally see why they do it. It is very relaxing and worth a try (at least once). On a side note I would highly recommend going to karaoke. Basically, you rent a small private room for a couple of hours, buy a couple of drinks, get some bar food, and you sing your heart out with your friends and family. They have just about every English song ever made and the controls for the song selection are in English too. I am no singer, but we ended doing this almost every night. It only cost like $25 for a few hours. Just ask the concierge for the details. All in all I would only recommend this place only if you were not able to get into Conrad (200% better). If you do stay here, secure a room on the executive floor. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ well worth it.
