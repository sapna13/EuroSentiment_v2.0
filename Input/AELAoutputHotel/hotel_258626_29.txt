{"text":"Not what I expected If you are traveling for business, this is probably an OK hotel for you. However; I was traveling for leisure, and it did not meet my expectations. First - you have to pay for parking. Considering I felt I was already overpaying for my room, I was not happy about this. When we checked in, the front desk did not recognize the free breakfast promotion that was included with our reservation and we had to push for it. The front desk was also not very knowledgable or helpful when we asked for information about the area. On the way to our room, we noticed dirty dishes and trash in the hallway. Unbelievably, the dishes and trash were still there the day we checked out. They NEVER got cleaned up. The room was OK. It was very roomy and clean, but there was a large stain on the chair in our room. The door to our room was always jammed, so we had to basically kick it in each time we entered. The breakfast buffet was good in the courtyard. It was nice to be able to walk to the Galleria. We were staying at the hotel for a getaway, but it wasn't great. The pool smelled so strongly of chlorine and the temperature was unbelieveable. I know this is an indoor pool, but it was hotter than the hot tub. We couldn't even stand how hot the pool was, so we didn't get to use it. We complained to the front desk about the temperature, but they seemed oblivious to our request and said they would turn it down. They never did. We checked the next day and it was just as hot. We werent the only ones complaining. Bottom line...if you are on business and don't care about the extras, this will work for you. If you want to enjoy a hotel experience, don't go to the Prava Suites. ","annotations":[]}
