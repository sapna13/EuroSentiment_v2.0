{"text":"Upgrade your room. The Basic Room is TOO Small I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. The location is convenient with the subway station just around the corner from the entrance to the hotel. The service and staff are all friendly and I can't think of anything that really struck me as terrible or awful in terms of cleanliness etc.BUT...The Room Size is TOO SMALL.To save costs I decided to share a room with my associate so there are two single beds in the room. Now when we went up to our room on the 10th floor, I was extremely surprised to see that there was no gap between the two single beds. The reason for this being there is no space in the room to have a gap between the beds. I must say that the hotel really knows how to use up all of the little space in the room. The table has almost everything in it. safe, fax, mini bar, tv, radio, internet, etc. the room was a smoking room however the fire alarm went off often because of the limited space. This happens if you turn off the a\/c fan. Even when taking a shower the fire alarm went off. note: the fire alarm is a silent alarm that alerts security.Total space of the room in my opinion is around 100 square feet which includes the washroom. I'm not sure how the upgraded rooms are but i am sure they would be alot bigger than the basic room.In no way do I not recommend staying at this hotel but if you do intend to stay here make sure you upgrade your room from the basic standard room to a larger room if possible.
