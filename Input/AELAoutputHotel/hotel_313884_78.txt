{"text":"Great time at the Princess Our party of 8 stayed at the PCP from May 18th to the 25th. We were all in agreement that the week was a success.Check in was effortless. We were in our rooms and changed within an hour. The suites are good size and adequate for a weeks stay. Glad to have the mini-fridge and coffee maker. Off to a good start!The first sight of the beach and ocean was breathtaking! The sand was so soft. We got a drink at the bar and just took in the clean air and the peace and quiet.Our days were mostly spent at the beach in the a.m. (beach beds way cool) and poolside in the afternoon. We did venture into Bavaro plaza for shopping and found Steves Corner Bar. A must! Some of us did swimming with the dolphins at Manati Park, others did horseback riding, and the Carribean festival. All were enjoyed. Everyone was pleasantly surprised with the food. Alot of choices, as one guest doesn't eat red meat or chicken. Ate breakfast and lunch at Casabe and dinners at different restaurants. (La Cave, Shanghay, Mare Norstrum, Tues. night beach party, Tex Mex.) The only one we wouldn't have gone to again would be the Fondue. It just took way to long.We contacted guest services and had a private table and dinner on the beach for my friends 40th Birthday. It was spectacular. One that she will never forget. The wait staff, maids, guest services, etc. were proffesional and friendly. We had one problem with a dinner reservation, but guest services fixed it in no time. Do bring bug spray. Those buggers loved my sweet blood! I was the only one out of the 8. But I dealt with it and enjoyed the rest of my stay, bites and all!All in all, if we were to return to the DR, the consensus of the 8 of us would be to go back to the PCP!
