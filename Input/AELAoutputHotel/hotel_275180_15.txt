{"text":"Wedding group , International Travelers The location is great for beach fans looking for a place to relax and forget daily routines, not to american standards in service or customer attention. Laid back service at a laid back beach, almost like camping at a bungalow, no frills or thrills. Bungalow 21 was second floor, felt like a corona commercial you saw beach and no one else in your line of sight. one level bungalows are a little darker and warmer during the day, some AC units do not work properly, don't try calling for maintenance, water pressure on showers ok, not strong enough for some of my friends, we rented 6 units as a group, 2 were good, one look and smell funny, three were good for the price and location.They do have 2 or 3 stray dogs running, one was a little too agressive to not keep your eye on them near the restaurant. Restaurant was ok ,basic quality, better if you go to restaurants 3-4 miles. one iron for the entire hotel, wedding planners beware, wrinkle free comes to mind. Kid playgrounds and pool are ok, nothing fancy, needs updating. Game room or hotel store\/vending area had nothing worth spending your money or time. The natural pool in front of hotel is great for kids or people afraid of open ocean, rocks near the beach are great for exploring and pictures. Not a Euro or American resort style, but island retreat for budget minded vacationers with nature in mind. Beach is great! 4 stars for the beach,2 for service, two for property, one for restaurant.
