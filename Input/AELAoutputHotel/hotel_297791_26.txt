{"text":"Okay, but not great, for the price We stayed at the hotel because we wanted a cheap place close to the airport for one night coming in after a late flight at the beginning of our trip. The Coqui Inn is the new name for Casa Mathieson and the Green Isle Inn combined. We stayed in the Casa Mathieson side (the Green Isle building is just down the block). For $80\/night (including tax), it way okay but not great. I would not recommend staying more than a night here.Our room was big but not particularly nice, with two double beds and a gigantic bathroom as well as a kitchenette and mini-fridge. We had A\/C (which is necessary in San Juan) and cable TV. I found it hard to sleep through the night because the people next door and out in the hallway were noisy and woke me up during the night.The hotel is in a residential area, across the freeway from the beach, so you just have to cross a pedestrian walkway to get to the nicest beach in San Juan (Isla Verde beach). It is less touristy than other areas of San Juan (this does mean that there are fewer restaurants around), and has parking available. I thought that the location was fine - easy to get to the beach but also easy to park.I found the people at the front desk to be nice and friendly.For the last night of our trip, we stayed at the Mango Inn, which is right next door and which we liked much better. Rooms are about the same price there, don't have a kitchenette but seemed cleaner.
