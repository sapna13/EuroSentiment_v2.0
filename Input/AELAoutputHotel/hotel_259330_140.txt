{"text":"Amazing Time...But Hotel Could Use Improvements My family and I stayed at the Grand Paradise Bavaro from march 30-april 6. Overall the trip was very good, but the hotel could use some improvements. On our first day we arrived thinking we were staying at the Grand Paradise Bavaro main hotel. We ended up staying at the club, because the main hotel was over booked. We were so disappointed, but after a few days we were used to it.The resort was huge! You needed to take a trolley to get around everywhere. The trolley came around about every 10 minutes, but was filled very quickly. The entertainment people we so nice. You could have a conversation with them and they really make you laugh. The best was Raymond.They all respect you and treat you nice. The waiters were a different story. They spoke little to no english and to get a drink, it was like you had to beg forever!Next, the beaches were really nice. To get shade it would probably be impossible if you didn't reserve a spot by atleast 5:30 am. The entertainment was good. Every single night they had a show at the amplitheatre. You could also find entertainment around other places in the resort, like dancing or beach parties. The show at the amplitheatre had a kids show and an adult show. They always called people up on stage to dance or play games. You could never be bored at night.The food wasn't as good as everyone made it out to be. I didn't find it that good and it got very repetitve and we were all very sick of it by the end of the week. Breakfast was good though. We only ate at buffet becuase a la carte restaurants needed reservations and they messed up ours.MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR THE VOUCHERS AND RESERVE THE FIRST DAY BECAUSE THERE SO HARD TO GET. Long pants and CLOSED shows for men are required. And CLOSED SHOES means appsoulutly nothing showing. They will kick you out and ask you to change if you don't meet there requirements. SHEESH!Moving on to the rooms. They were clean and restocked your fridge everyday. Beware that nothng is free except for pop. We had to keep a card in a slot for power. And we asked for fresh towels and they barely ever gave us any. And when they did, they gave us 2 small towels, with 3 people in the room. The rooms also have no phone or any type of clock. Also it was sort of an open hotel. By open I mean the hallway had no windows. Just nice breezy wind. *I am not sure what the hotel rooms in the main section look like.Weather was good. It rained one day. It was also very windy all the time. The nights are very chilly.Overall the trip was very good, but not sure if i would go back.
