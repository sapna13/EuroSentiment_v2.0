{"text":"loved it, some very minor issues From the minute you arrive, the GO's are there to make you feel like home. We were greeted with all smiles and drinks (!!!) upon arrival. The resort itself is beautiful, with an ocean view from almost everywhere on the property. The rooms are set back quite a bit from the beach, and some of the buildings were a decent walk from either of the restaurants and activities. My room was clean, bright, and exactly what I needed to come back to everyday. The food was decent (I'd say a 7 out of 10), with healthy and tasty options for everyone. There was an activity offered at every minute of every day. Yoga was offered on the beach at sunrise 9AM, and sunset 5PM.....both of which I highly recommend. There was also a decent gym\/weight room there which was well kept and also faced the ocean. Windsurfing, snorkeling, kayaking, volleyball, and bocce ball were all offered on the beach. There were 2 bars, one being at the foot of the ocean. The few drawbacks I encountered: **First, the place is VERY family oriented and if you are there as a couple (as I was) it can be very hard to find a quiet spot where there no children screaming and running circles around you, however, we managed to scope out some relaxing spots for ourselves. **Second, the french tourists there can be a little bit rude and there is definitely a huge cultural difference, but I got used to it eventually. **Third, I found when I was booking the trip\/airfare that when I booked the airfare separately (not through Club Med) that I saved a very substantial amount of money. However, when you book airfare separately, you do not receive transportation provided by club med to and from the airport. This was definitely not a set back for us, as there are tons of taxi companies waiting outside the airport, and it is a 5 minute drive from the resort (about $10-$15). All in all, the thing that made our vacation amazing was the staff. They are always willing to accommodate every need and issue.A vacation at Club Med Punta Cana is definitely going to be money well spent!
