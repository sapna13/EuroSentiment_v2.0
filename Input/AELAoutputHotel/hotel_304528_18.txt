{"text":"A High Quality Family Resort Hello all. I am a Canadian expat working in China. I travel often and I recently chose the Bali Westin Spa and Resort in Nusa Dua as my holiday destination for my family and I. I have a wife and two children aged 7 and 9.At the Westin I stayed in a two-bedroom Royal Club family suite with an ocean view. The room itself was lovely, everything that you would expect from a 5 star resort. The beds and bathrooms were clean and tidy, the service of the staff was remarkably friendly and helpful; Bali is truly a service-oriented place and it was a pleasure to vacation there. I was greeted at the airport and my airport transfers were included with my room rate, check in was a breeze and the buffet breakfasts were great. Every restaurant at the resort, including room service, had a children√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ menu, which was incredibly helpful. The Westin is very child oriented.One note about the rooms, if you want an ocean view, be warned now that there is a bar\/restaurant on the beach at the Westin, just below the ocean front rooms. I believe it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ called the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∂kan√à√\u2020\u2022? and in the evening they have music and dancing and they throw a bit of a party; not good for little kids who are trying to go to bed at 10pm after a full day of swimming. So be ready, ocean view rooms mean later nights with loud music, it usually rounded up around midnight which is fine for the wife and I but a little too much for the little ones.A note about the location: for those who haven√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ been to Nusa Dua it is a fairly isolated place. It lacks any community and it is essentially just a peninsula of 5 star resorts sharing the same long beach. Fine for those that want to sit and rest; but a 30 minute taxi ride to Kuta if you want to play in the waves, enjoy some shopping or eat at a restaurant outside the hotel. My wife loved the spa treatments; my kids loved the swimming pool and calm ocean. Note, Nusa Dua has no waves at all √à√\u2020\u2022?great for snorkeling.I highly recommend this resort for anyone with kids. In fact when I was there over xmas it was packed with families, it was a great atmosphere.Enjoy.
