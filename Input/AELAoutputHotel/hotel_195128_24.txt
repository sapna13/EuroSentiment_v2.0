{"text":"Very nice days in the Ramblas! Me and my family (all adults) just came back from a 3 nights stay at Hotel Ambassador in Barcelona.It is wonderfully located in the very heart of Barcelona, just on a little street by the Ramblas!! The street is Pintor Furtuny and it just between the 1898 hotel and the Meridien, so you understand how exclusive the area is.The hotel staff is very nice and discrete: they don't disturb you but they're very nice when you need help.The hotel lobby is a bit cold and dark, but not so bad. They should light it up a bit more.Breakfast was very very very rich! And you can even wake up late, because you can eat from 08.00 to 12.00.The room was excellent. Very spacious, with a big bathroom. Don't bring anything from home, the hotel will give you: shampoo, shower gel, after shave, body milk, a razor blade with razor mousse, combs, toothbrushes, toothpaste, sponge, shower cap, paper tissues and soap!!! Everything you will need.Free candies always in the room. Also paper for letters and pen and pencils.... Even a big book of Barcelona to plan the visits during your stay.Small but nice swimming pool on the top floor panoramic terrace (5th floor), overlooking the entire city.Nearby the hotel there are bars, pharmacy and Carrefour supermarket. Also the Boqueria food market, with delicious fresh fruits salads and juices.Closest metro stop are Catalunya and Liceu. Bus stop in Catalunya square. Port Vell and Maremagnum area just at 10 minutes walk.Taxis from El Prat airport to hotel about √à√\u2020√ü?25.00. Journey 25 minutes.Safe area to wonder around even at night.Best area where to stay, very comfortable to come and go.We will surely come back.Ciao! :-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":9,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":5},{"endOffset":852,"mention":"mousse","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mousse"],"startOffset":846},{"endOffset":893,"mention":"sponge","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sponge_cake"],"startOffset":887},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"candies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":963},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"candies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":963},{"endOffset":1117,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1113},{"endOffset":1342,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1336}]}
