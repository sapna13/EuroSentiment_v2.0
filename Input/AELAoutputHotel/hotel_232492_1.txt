{"text":"Beautiful hotel with friendly staff We stayed at this hotel the last weekend before christmas. We booked it through our membership card of lhw.com. I would like to really emphasize the outstanding approach of the staff that is very rare and exceptional even in similar five star facilities. I believe this could be connected with the fact that the hotel is still privately owned by wealthy Dutch family.First of all, we checked-in early as we took early morning flight from Prague. It was absolutely no problem for the front desk. Secondly, we were upgraded from deluxe room to a beautiful spacious junior suite. And last but no least, we checked-out almost five hours after required time (after previous approval by front desk) and it was againg absolutely no problem and we were not charged any additional payment for this. The staff was helpful also in respect of our other requirements: taxi, reservations etc.The suite itself was very very spacious with beuatiful bed and antique style furniture. On the other hand, it was little bit dark and maybe little bit shabby. Anyway, this was no problem for us and we liked the suite very much as it was very convenient.I can also recommend the hotel formal restaurant Excelsior. The food was outstanding and the view of Amstel river is very beautiful. On the other hand the price was quite high for every day dining and the wine was poor (its my fault as I selected it :o) but it was included in the section recommended wines so I hoped...).Our overall impression was very positive and we will definitely come backy in 2009 as we liked the hotel and Amsterdam itself very much!
