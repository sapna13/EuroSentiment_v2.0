{"text":"Paradise at Paradisus Myy wife and I just got back and it was great. Here is a quick review of our experience.1. Reserve SectionTry to get in reserve section of hotel Rooms, pool, bar and restaurant less crowded and better service. Those in reserve section are aloud to use all facilities but only reserve members can use reserve area. Food, pool, restaurant, bar all better due to less people. Really try to get this section. All newer.2. RoomsWe got a bigger room with seperate bedroom and living area. Big bathroom and living area. Bring clock because none in bedroom. Don't use room service because of english barrier.3. RestaurantsAll great. Food really good. At Gabbi restaurant in 'reserve section had lobster and caviar along with other great food selections. Favorite restaurants were El Romantico, Ventom and steak house. Need reservations. Get 9:00 seating and show up at 8:30 for seating. It will be available and you get to enjoy more of day. Otherwise they will offer 6;30 seating. You'll still be full from lunch.4. PoolGreat at reserve and less crowded. Atmosphere awesome. Lots of places to sit and relax. Has swim up bar.5. GolfWe picked this place because of free golf. Plan on losing 6 hours of vacation time. Have to shuttle to course which is aprox 20 min ride. Course really nice and you should play at least once. Cost $35 per person for cart. Crowded and don't forget voucher hotel gives you or they will send you back to hotel to get. We took attitude that can play at home and spend less time doing while can't go to beach this time of year at home!6. BeachLots chairs available. Nice water and waves. Get to beach at 9:00 and grab your chair than go to breakfast. If wait until 11:00 have hard time finding chair.7. TippingBring some $1's and $5's for tipping. Believe me no one refuses a tip. Invest in regular bar tendors and servers. They will remember and take care of you. 8. EntertainmentWeak and not worth watching. Only good thing was shows are short. Lots of people walked out. Dancing in Lobby area after show very enjoyable and well attended.9. HotelAwesome. Great decorations and easy to check in and out. Everyone very helpful.10. BugsSome mosquitos around that will bite. Not as bad at beach due to breeze. Bring bug spray. We didn't but will next time.11. BarTop shelf liquor to include single malt scotch and any and all top shelf after dinner drinks. Johnny Black, Stoli, Bombay etc. You won't be dissappointed with choices. All in all a great experienc and we will return. Best most relaxing vacation I've had in long time ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1611,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1607},{"endOffset":2348,"mention":"scotch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Scotch_whisky","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Scotch_broth","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Scotch_pie"],"startOffset":2342},{"endOffset":2415,"mention":"Stoli","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Stolichnaya"],"startOffset":2410},{"endOffset":2423,"mention":"Bombay","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bombay_mix","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bombay_Sapphire"],"startOffset":2417}]}
