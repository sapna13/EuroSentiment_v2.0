{"text":"Great Place, average staff, stayed somewwhere else when we returned 1 This hotel helped to cause a little bit of a scare to my friends and family. I had told them I would be walking in the new territories (not especially safe) they were slightly alarmed when they had not heard from me by 8 pm (accidentally left my telephone in the hotel safe). Upon telephoning the hotel, the hotel told them they had never heard of me. After a few telephone calls later, they telephoned the hotel again and said they were very concerned and would have to telephone the police. The hotel then discovered that I had booked but cancelled my booking the day before. When I heard all the commotion on my answerphone on my return, I asked the hotel myself whether I had booked in, giving my name. They repeated that I had cancelled my booking and never checked in. When I revealed my true identity, all they could do was look sheepish. I am just glad there was not an emergency at home and my mobile telephone was not in fact lost.2 The breakfast was included in the price. However, we were not told that it had to be taken in a certain part of the hotel, otherwise you wer charged. Nor were we told at what time breakfast was served until. In fact, none of the usual information was provided to us on check-in.3 The pool has a great great view over the city. Lots of kids at the weekend as it doubles up as a local gym\/health club so not very relaxing. The gym is very very good compared to the hotel gyms you usually find.4 The concierge service was not really up to scratch. We asked them to reconfirm our flights. They telephoned the airline as we stood there waiting. When the number was engaged, they gave up and handed us back the flight details. For a comparison of this service in another HK hotel, see my review of the Langham Hotel.5 Generally, this hotel is out of the way but doesn't go out of its way to help. Perhaps we were just unlucky. For over √ä√£¬¢100 a night, we didn't think it was worth it and on our return went to stay at the Langham Hotel - also reviewed on this website.
