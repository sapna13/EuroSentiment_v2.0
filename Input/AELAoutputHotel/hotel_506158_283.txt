{"text":"Great hotel, some buts... We stayed at 1898 for New Year and the week afterwards.It's a great hotel with many plus points, but there are one or two things to be aware of, see below.Pro's:- great location, at the top of La Rambla within walking distance of many of the main sights including much of the Gaudi architecture - Casa Battlo, Casa Mila and Sagrada Familia, also very near La Boqueria - a fantastic food market, and close to other great shopping around Placa Catalunya-impressive building, impressive bedrooms and bathrooms - all constantly being kept clean- great facilities - good gym (bikes, running machines, some weights) very, very stylish indoor pool with adjacent steam room and sauna, along with spa facitlities. Free wi-fi access in the rooms along with an internet centre on the first floor with a couple of desktops and printers- roof top terrace with outdoor pool - open all year and all evening with great views of the city - this is one of the best things about the hotel - a real oasis away from the hussle and bussle of La Rambla and warm enough in the sun to enjoy at this time of year- many nearby cafes, bakeries, wine shops and supermarketsCon's:- and this is the biggest con - rooms on the second floor at the back of the hotel are noisy. Yes, the rooms are soundproofed so you don't really hear noise outside or other guests, BUT there is a bar and nightclub - Bar Lobo - in the same building as the hotel. Rooms on the second floor at the back are directly above it's dancefloor and the structure of the building very effectively channels through the sound of the music. Bear in mind that the Spaniards love to party from midnight to around 4am, and if you are in one of these rooms, and are noise sensitive, you are going to be kept awake particularly on Friday and Saturday nights. The hotel obviously have complaints about the noise regularly, as when we complained there were a set of stock answers we were given. However on one particularly bad night they did move us to another room to sleep for the night. Request a quiet room on one of the higher floors when booking.- don't bother asking the front desk for restaurant recommendations - it's not there speciality. A good option for tapas is Taller de Tapas - they have two restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. For Paella, Can Majo is a good choice on the sea front - 40 mins walk or 10 mins taxi (√à√\u2020√ü?0).- irons and ironing boards are not available. There is an ironing service, but taking a travel iron is probably easier.- there are tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms, but no milk. You can get milk in the nearby Carrefour supermarket (also great for buying bottles of Cava \/ Rioja)- √à√\u2020√ü?8 for breakfast - this is steep if you just want somethinbg small for breakfast. Around the back of the hotel (turn left past Bar Lobo) there is a deli\/cafe that the locals go to, which serves great pastries and hot chocolate at a fraction of the price. There is also a good bakery if you continue past the back entrance of Carrefour.In summary, it's fantastic hotel in a great location, but steer clear of those rooms on the second floor at the back.
