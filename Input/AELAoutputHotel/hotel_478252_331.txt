{"text":"Mixed feelings about Bahia Just returned from two weeks at Bahia Principe Bavaro Jan 27-Feb 10I read several reviews from TripAdvisor prior to booking. We stayed in the Diamond Club section of the resort, our room was located adjacent to the construction currently on site and we asked to be moved. We lived from our suitcases until our room was relocated 2 days later. We were welcomed into our new room with towel art, T-shirts, a bottle of rum and were very pleased. It was spacious and very clean. During the first few days we had encountered a bit of rain in the evening and after unpacking in our new room I left a pair of (expensive) white capri pants hanging in the bathroom to dry- adhering to the hotel policy of not placing any items on the railing outside. The capris disappeared the next day. I can only assume that the cleaning staff picked them up with the towels by mistake even though I placed all the dirty items in the tub. I reported this to the Diamond Club staff immediately but they did not seem alarmed by this occurrance and the pants were never located. I left a tip and asked for extra pillows- the tip disappeared but it was only when I saw a maid a few days later and asked again that I finally recieved a pillow. There were several different maids, no planned time that the room was cleaned and we were awoken early a few days, a maid knocking on the door, other days the room would not be cleaned until late in the afternoon. Late one night we were in bed when the maid knocked on our door delivering the beach towels .I accepted each day that something was missing- no face cloths for a few days, then minus a few bath towels, a bath robe, gel, shampoo. Two nights out of 14, we got the clean beach towels delivered to our room and turn down service with chocolates. On the good days I would leave a tip but that did not seem to encourage the service. It was a hit and miss most days. I would also recommend that you pay for the room safe as there were a few days that we arrived back to our room in the afteroon and the door was wide open as the maid was taking care of several rooms at once. The grounds are beautifully kept and immaculate. The food at the buffet had lots of selection but it was lukewarm, and the meat was often undercooked. The buffet is extremely busy but I felt rushed and often ignored -very poor service. We made use of the a la carte restaurants, found them to be run well and the waiters very friendly. Overall, from previous reviews I thought tipping would get you some extras but that is not necessarily the case. I suppose my expectations were a little high. Good and bad at this hotel, a little daunting with the size but after a few days you can find your way around without a problem. I would recommend that you upgrade to the Diamond or Gold Club, I would not want to risk the service being a 'regular'. Also, learning some basic Spanish would be helpful as there is little to no English spoken by the staff. I would still recommend this resort to others but beware of what service you will actually recieve and lower your expectations.
