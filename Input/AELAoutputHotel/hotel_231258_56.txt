{"text":"Charming and Unique My family and I stayed at this property and while we have written about it before yet we were disappointed that someone in Ireland complained about its location and someone in the UK about thin walls or tiny bathrooms.As an avid airline executive, and having a daughter who lives in the center of Florence, I have found the Ungherese location to be ideal because it is in a quiet residential, safe and yet upscale neighborhood, close enough to the center of Florence that you can be there in a couple of minutes.On the thin walls and tiny bathrooms, I have inspected many properties all over Italy and Europe and they are built with bricks and concrete as the Ungherese, and I would not consider the Ungherese's walls thin nor the bathrooms tiny as there is a specific harm to every detail of this property that makes it second to none -- you just have to understand the uniqueness and Florentine flavor to value what this property offers.Having spent several days at the Ungherese and having met the owners and the staff, this is without a doubt the nicest, most polite and highly educated service oriented group that you will find anywhere.The Ungherese is not only worth every penny but more and for guests looking for charm and high class details and services, this is most definitely the place to go.Take it from someone who travels over 300,000 miles a year and who has over 25 years of experience travelling abroad -- the Ungherese will provide nothing but the best.Enjoy,Maria Garrido ","annotations":[]}
