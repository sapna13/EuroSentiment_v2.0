{"text":"Maria Elena Palace an excellent Hotel Hotel Mar√à√¨√úa Elena Palace, Madrid, Spain.Date: 12th March 2008Reviewer: A Trip Advisor Member, Dublin, IrelandWe have just returned after spending 4 days in Madrid. The city of Madrid is lovely and the Hotel Mar√à√¨√úa Elena Palace is very close to all the Major attractions. Its five minutes walk from Puerta Del Sol and a quick Metro journey from The Prado and the Palacio Real. The staff could not have been more helpful and the room was spotless with a huge six foot bed and generous bathroom. The Hotel faces onto an ordinary looking street so we took an inside room which was very quiet and overlooked the internal atrium of the Hotel.The breakfast was very good with fresh juice, cereal, cheese, rolls, fruit and a hot selection.The reception staff recommended the Barbarroja restaurant in Cava San Miguel Street (near Puerta Del Sol) which was excellent with a great value Tourist Menu for √à√\u2020√ü?3. For a very cheap Oriental meal try WOK just around the corner from the Hotel. Also do not miss coffee and pastry for √à√\u2020√ü?.70 at La Mallorquina in Puerta Del Sol, the place is always packed and a great experience. There are lots of good shops near the Puerta Del Sol which looks good lit up at night as does the Plaza Mayor which is a stones throw away from Puerta Del Sol. Put aside at least two hours for the Museo del Prado and Thyssen -Bornemisza museums as well as the Palacio Real but the El Rasto Sunday flea market can be given a miss unless you really want rip off CD√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ or videos.The Metro is the way to get around in Madrid but BEWARE ! of pick pockets especially on Saturdays and Sundays. They push you when you are getting on or off the Metro and are looking to where you are going. So keep your hand on your wallets and bags when are getting on or off to the Metro and you will be ok! We did and they went away empty handed.
