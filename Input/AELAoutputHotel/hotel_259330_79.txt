{"text":"not grand paradise Arrival-We recently stayed at the not so Grand Paradise, 4 adults, 2 children and an infant, I had read some reviews with mixed feelings but as we left it until the last minute our options were running out so I plumpt for the Grand Paradise - on arrival I queued for approx 20 mins until I could check in (only 2 people on the desk at mid-day - mainly answering phones) check-in was fine, we were allocated two rooms close to each other and I asked for a cot in one of them which would be sent up with our bags, went to rooms, both seemed fine, nothing special but o.k. Our patio fdoor wouldn't lock which was a problem with the infant and the air con wasn't that cold but overall not bad. our bags arrived, but no cot, it was on it's way - (4 o'clock), we got changed, had some lunch, swim etc, checked to see if cot delivered, no, rang reception - be 5 mins, 1 hour later no cot, be 5 mins, went for dinner, at this time we child was ready for an early night after 9 hours of flying, went back to the room expecting the cot - nothing there, rang, it will be there in 15 mins, explained that the child was waiting to go to bed, so he said 5 mins. I went for a few drinks in the bar whilst my partner got our son ready for bed, I came back a couple of hours later to find no cot! - I stormed off to the reception, waited 10 mins to be seen and explained, the staff on the reception are so rude so I gave them both barrells which seemed to shock them, within 5 mins the cot arrived. Good start to the holiday.Rooms.Stayed in bock 4, 4321 and 4316, the even numbers are nice, they overlook the pool area and have the sun in the morning, our room 4321, looked into trees, fence and elecrtical sub station - no very nice.Rooms cleaned everyday - although the beds very soft, only 1 pillow each and are very flat, bed vallance stained and old - had to pay for TV remote.Water would go off for periods, or you would have only cold or only hot.Fridge - got Coca Cola and Sprite and small water each day as part of the all-inclusive.Food\/diningBest described as [--] - each day had themed nights but the food always seemed the same, we were all ill as were a lot of people we spoke to, most of the time we had to lay our own table and get our own drinks, the place was under staffed and often ran out of cups, glasses and food.Gardens\/BeachThis is the best thing about the hotel.PoolsNot too bad, never seen it cleaned and often had lots of sand on the bottom and scum floating on the top in places, at the weekend the hotel is over run with locals, these are so rude and loud, we had to get out of the pool one day as a lad was throwing rocks into the pool at other kids, and a couple we met had their kids (age 6) threatened and their snorkles taken off them. saying this they are quite large and nice and warm - the down side is that they are not suitable for the young as they are 5ft all over with no shallow ends.StaffReception - no help, rude, not enough - need sacking.Waiters - trying their best, made a fuss of the young lad, just too busy.Cleaners - good job.bar staff- did bare minimum but o.k.entertainment - o.k.Overall, I would give this hotel at best 2 stars, if you want somewhere to sleep and can put up with rubbish food and illness then go for it. If however you don't want to diet and would like a little service when you spend your hard earned money look elsewhere - everyone I spoke to says the Majestic is alot better!
