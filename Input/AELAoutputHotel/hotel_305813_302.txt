{"text":"Great Location Firstly, Thankyou all who wrote revies of this hotel, as it helped me choose this great hotel to stay at for 4 nights. We stayed at the hotel, whilst re-locating back from the UK to Australia, and in need of a rest....with a 2 yr old child. We booked directly with the hotel, and also arranged a shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel and vice versa. This was a great move, considering the luggage we had (Which would not of fit in a taxi) and for 180 each was not bad.The hotel itself was beautiful, and luxurious. The hotel was as described by other reviewers, and the room was big. We were upgraded to a club room (We choose not to go with the extras to have the actual club privledges - just the room). We were on the 35th floor (Which was a bit eary), but none the less had a good size room with a large bed. We choose not to get a cot for our 2 yr old, and had him in bed with us as there was plenty of room in the King sized bed for him. One complaint I had was that we arrived at 1am in the morning, and I asked where I could go for some Milk for my child. I was told we will arrange room service to deliver this to you. As I was tired I said ok, it might cost a bit, but I was curious why they did not suggest the 7-11 across the road. None the less a small glass of milk was delivered and I was charged 35 hong kong which is about 3 UK pounds. I complained the next morning and was given a credit for this, but it is something to be careful of.The location of the hotel was excellent. The hotel connects directly to the Langham shopping centre, where there is a great food hall where we ate dinner most nights. It was fun eating there as its the Chinese way and very cheap rather than eating in restaurants. The hotel was walking distance to the night markets and the Ladies market. Both places were great, and we did manage to spend quite a lot on the bargains at both markets....especially on hand-bags be a certain French designer. It is funny when they grab you and show you the catalogue for the bags....I guess what the markets are all about :-)The Metro station was close, and we went to Disneyland from there as well as downtown. It was cheap to use and efficient and cooler than walking in the ridiculous heat we were in in July. Disneyland was ok, I think the fact it was soooo hot spoilt it for us, but you cant blame the park for the whether. That said the park is reasonably small compared to other Disneylands, but still its a Disney at the end of the day.Overall the hotel is a great location, high quality and standard. It was pricey in my opinion, especially when tax and service are added to your hotel room rate. That said, I would stay again at the hotel, as its location location location.
