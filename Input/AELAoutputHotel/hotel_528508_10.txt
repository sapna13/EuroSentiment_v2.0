{"text":"Nice hotel, but EXPENSIVE There are many mixed reviews about this hotel so hopely this one will be somewhat informative. First of all the hotel is located quite some distance from the city center. If you need to get there from the amsterdam train station it is Tram #2. (In an altered state at night the night bus is #358) You can also take the metro, but its quite a walk from the metro station, about 2 miles. Its located somewhat between Amsterdam city center and the airport. Its in the same building complex with IBM and other corporations. The hotel itself is very interesting. The front desk staff is not the nicest. Not quite rude, but somewhat arrogant. Once we got to our room, i have to say it was nice. The only room left was a smoking room on the 8th floor costing 138 euro. Very Very expensive, but somewhat average amongst the other amsterdam hotels. The room was nice with a double bed and a flat screen TV. The bathroom was also very nice with standard ammenities. The room comes equiped with a mini-bar, and pay-per-view movies (12 euro each). Overall, not a bad hotel. The distance from city center is significant but honestly it is still very accessable by Tram or night bus requiring just a short walk. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet so it was not at all a concern. If the price wasn't so high and staff wasn't soo stuck up, i would highly recommend this hotel ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0}]}
