{"text":"A warming experience We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe recently returned from a weekend break in Berlin where we stayed at the Ambassador Hotel. This hotel doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pull any punches but merely √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëoes what it says on the tin.√à√\u2020\u2022?We arrived late Thursday evening and were ushered to our √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºtandard double room√à√\u2020\u2022?only to find that it was actually a twin room. This coupled with the fact that the room was boiling hot and lacked air conditioning hardly made for a good first impression. After a rather sweaty night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ sleep I approached the concierge to enquire about changing rooms. They were only to happy to show me another room, which for an extra 15 euros per night gave me a double bed, a larger bathroom, bathrobes, a much needed fan and access to the complimentary drinks fridge in the hall. I duly accepted and it proved to be well worth the dosh.Breakfast was a hot\/cold buffet open from 7-11am and was perfectly acceptable although a little tedious by the third day. The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and spoke superb English. Location wise the Ambassador hotel isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ great. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ situated near to the Zoologischer Garten station (similar to London√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ King√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Cross) and isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really near the Mitte (the hub of Berlin life). This of course meant taking public transport which as you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° expect, is extremely punctual and efficient.Overall, we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° have to stay that this hotel serves a purpose but be warned there is no air conditioning and I would advise against staying here during the summer months.
