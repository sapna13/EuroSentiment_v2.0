{"text":"A Very Nice Stay This was my and my wife's first trip to Puerto Rico. I loved this hotel right in the middle of downtown Ponce. You have to remember, that this is not a big name brand hotel. We stayed at a few of those as well. However, this was my favorite.  The hotel sits directly across from the town square. You are right in the middle of the heart of the small friendly city. The hotel and the location are well matched. It is on a City block (this is a small friendly city - along the lines of Ithaca, New York.) A hot dog man resides outside the entrance. The Lobby is beautiful. It houses an upscale restaurant. Nice easy going sitting area - very quaint.   Hotel wireless works great. No charge. Breakfast on the roof of the hotel (enclosed) is OK - complimentary. Coffee was fine.  Staff was great. Genuinely friendly and concerned. I cannot say enough. Helpful and eager to accomodate. Rooms are old style - again- this is not a big name brand hotel. Air Con is either on or off. Big switch over bedboard. I would turn it off and on to regulate temperature. But when it is on, it is cold.  My room - (Deluxe) has a terrace that overlooks the square.This was a fantastic experience. Far more interesting than San Juan. Ponce is a great place to visit. Humming pedestrian mall in the street first thing in the morning (at night - a bit quiet) - museums nearby - $2 Trolly rides, and lots of bakeries. I will most certainly stay at the Melia again.
