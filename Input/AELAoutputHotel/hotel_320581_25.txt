{"text":"Convenient  This was our first trip to Japan and this hotel was our first accommodation. We took the airport limousine bus (3000 yen pp) which drops you off directly at the hotel, which made it very convenient with luggage. The first bus leaves for this hotel at 2:15pm so if you arrive much earlier you can always take the train. The hotel is within a short walking distance to the Shinjuku train station, department stores, eateries and more. One can easily take the trains to major areas and they come by frequently. We actually purchased the SUICA cards (2000yen inc. 500 yen refundable deposit per card) for our train use in Tokyo and the surrounding districts. The SUICA was very handy for scanning at gates instead of always buying a ticket and funds can always be reloaded in increments at the ticket vending machines. These cards were also useful during our stay in Kyoto as we could use the JR local lines there as well. We did have the buffet breakfast at the hotel since it was included with our room and it was a very decent spread of both Western and Japanese dishes. The buffet costs about $15 per person but if this is too much there are cafes and other places to eat nearby (inc. McDonalds  KFC). There is a nice guest lounge on the 2nd floor with TV and internet. We were lucky enough to stay in a standard twin non smoking room which averaged about 248 square feet- quite roomy by Japanese standards. There are other much smaller single and double rooms which looked to have little to no extra space from what we could tell. Our room had a desk with a nice flat screen TV,(Japanese stations only) a small closet with some hangers, iron press, two drawer dresser, sitting chair, refrigerator, teapot, tea, sleepwear with comfy slippers and a view of some office buildings. The bathroom had quite a few amenities from the toilet with bidet, hairdryer, razor, toothbrushes and toothpaste, cotton swabs (black ones!), comb and brush, shampoo, conditioner and body soap. If you do want a little extra comfort and don't mind paying a little more for a twin room than I would recommend it. The staff was always courteous and spoke and understood English well enough that we had no problems. They were even kind enough to fill out some forms for us in Japanese so we could forward our luggage to Kyoto, which arrived the very next day as planned-wow! Overall the hotel has a fantastic location near all the action and lights but far enough away to relax and settle after a busy day of sightseeing. We would not hesitate to stay here again!
