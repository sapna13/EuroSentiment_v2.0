{"text":"Overall Excellent, but avoid the Executive Suites I have stayed at the Palace three times over the last several years, with my most recent visit in June. I stayed in a junior suite a few years ago, which was excellent, so booked one again for my most recent trip. Upon arrival, I was upgraded to an Executive Suite, which sounded great, until I checked it out! It was big, but strangely configured, with a large oval living room, and a strange ante-room\/ hall way connecting the living room to the bedroom, and really old, uninspiring decor (peeling paint, tired feel, drab bedroom). I asked to move to the junior suite I had booked, and was told it was unavailable, which annoyed me. They finally moved me to another executive suite, which was much better, with a very nice bedroom and bathroom, but still some issue with the living room set-up. It was still not set as good as the smaller junior suite, in my opinion (see below).The hotel overall is great, with a good small gym (but no pool), a really nice breakfast buffet which is served in a beautiful room with a glass domed atrium. The building itself is a classic old place . The staff was really helpful (except for one bad steer by the concierge for tapas - La Truja was pretty lame!) and overall it was an extremely enjoyable experience.Hotel location is great - across the street from the Prado and other great museums, 10 minute walk up to the Puerta Del Sol, with a host of bars and restaurants and old shops on the streets between. Great town, Madrid.By the way, on the way out of Spain 2 week later, I stayed at the Palace again for 1 night, got a junior suite, and it was absolutely great. Clean, nice decor, king sized heavenly bed, well laid out, etc. Get the upgrade (you know you want it!) but for my money, don't go with the executive suites.
