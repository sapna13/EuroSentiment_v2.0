{"text":"Looks good but cuts corners. This was the third hotel I stayed at during a trip to Singapore. The Fullerton building is beautiful and the location is convenient when working in the business district. The front desk, restaurant and bell service was helpful and efficient. The room service left a lot to be desired. They once delivered someone else's food. I was disappointed with everything I tried except the sushi and the great bloody marys. The hotel rooms were nice but you could see where they cut costs. Cheap soaps, the sheets could have been nicer and the odd configuration of the rooms is annoying. The desks where not very comfortable for working. The two rooms I stayed were hard to navigate. Furniture was and fixtures where in strange juxtaposition. I kept finding myself bumping into things.Make sure you do not get the cheapest rooms. They either look over the atrium, which is fine if you have an aversion to natural light, or they're tiny. The Grand Hyatt (club level) had the best room. Great layout with a closet that opened to both a large bathroom and the main room. The desk area was comfortable, ergonomic and even had a desk plate with AV hookups for VGA, S-Video  RCA to the 40in plasma and room sound system. The Four Seasons had excellent service, great food (much better than the Fullerton) and nice spacious rooms. The bathrooms were very large. The price was also right, less than 2\/3 the price of the other hotels. I wish I would have stayed here for the entire trip.
