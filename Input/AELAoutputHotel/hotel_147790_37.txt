{"text":"Soak in all that Nature. We just returned from a magnificent five day trip to Vieques. We stayed at the Hix Island House. The room was the 'Adobe Triangular Room'. Even the being on the lower level, showering, watching humming birds dance from lush flower to flower is quite the experience. The windows do not have glass panes, and have wood shutters. it is absolutely raw at its core, so it allows you to engulf the breath-taking surroundings of nature. Echoes of the coqui (the local frog), is absolutely relaxing under the moonlit sky.You can plan all you want, by trying to plan your activities ahead of time. But Brenda at the front desk will gladly help you out with the real deal. She made our trip all the more romantic and exciting with her careful recommendations for dinner, beaches, and the BioBay (which we missed regretfully). Also being a yoga newbie, I couldn't resist taking a class in the morning on the premises. Closing your eyes, breathing and hearing all that nature around you, again...is just amazing. Maybe it's being a city boy, that when I see flowers so rich in color, sounds of birds and coqui, geckos crawling everywhere, and seeing horses in the middle of the road...it's just so exciting.If you want to experience something out of the ordinary, totally relaxed, and absolutely amazing, I highly highly recommend the HIX Island House. The hotel is beautiful, the pool is beautiful, the surroundings are beautiful, and the staff are super friendly. My favorite thing about the HIX is the fresh bread on the kitchen counter, with eggs and fresh fruit in the fridge. Breakfast never tasted so good. Never experienced a vacation as refreshing as this. I will have to do it again soon. An absolute must! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1529,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1524}]}
