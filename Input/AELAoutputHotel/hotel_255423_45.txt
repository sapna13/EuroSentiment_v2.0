{"text":"Hmmmmm.... could have picked better. Well, we didn't have problems with noise and cleanliness as other people seem to have, but that doesn't mean we had a great experience. Sure the location was reasonable (a little closer to a station would have been better as we had to go to the olympic park daily for a conference), but the room was something else. Out of a different era - and not in a cute retro way either. It just looked like things had never been replaced or updated since it was built. Wallpaper, carpet, even bedding was dated (although I repeat that we did find it to be clean).The room was spacious and had a view (we were on the 10th floor).The worst thing was the malfuntioning lifts. Both of them! They were tiny, would take you to the wrong floor or stop at floors of which the buttons had not been pushed. The worst thing is sometimes it would just reset returning to the ground floor (or sometimes the basement!) just before you were about to arrive at your destination (especially bad for someone on the 10th floor. It usually took us several goes to get back to our rooms and we ended up always using the stairs to get back down.The pool was not great being almost enclosed by oppressive apartment style rooms (not sunny and open as suggested by the photos). What was more there was a large tour (high school students) group from the United States staying at the hotel. With the amount of luggage they had, you would think that they were moving to Australia. Needless to say that this combined with tiny malfunctioning lifts meant an arduous exercise getting back to our room each day (10 minutes plus at times from the front desk!)On the positive side, the service was reasonable and friendly and it was very cheap (less than $100Aus per night).I think we'll try something else next time.
