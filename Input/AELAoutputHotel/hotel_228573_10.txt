{"text":"the staff were great the staff at this hotel were very pleasant, but beware there are 2 parts to the hotel and if you are not staying in the main part you are not allowed to dine in the a la carte restaurant.the hotel was to hot at night and this was in november, could hardly breathe in the mornings and there is no tea making facilities in the room.the hotel do give you water each day in the fridge and the rooms are very clean but small.the hotel also do not have an iron they charge a fortune for dry cleaning so make sure you take your own unless you can afford it.didnt stay in the hotel much but 1 night i ordered a film as i was very ill and it cost me 12.50 euros which i thought was a bit steep but i suppose it was cheaper than going out.there is a lovely chinese restaurant called bamboo over the road from the hotel which i would highly recommend and i would also like to advise the hotel is quite far from the centre but the metro system is great there, you can go anywhere on the circuit for 1 euro.i love madrid as a city it is so big a must see is the retiro park and the zoo.party goers beware there is not much party life in madrid there are 3 clubs that are very expensive and they dont have actual bars with music all the bars are more like little cafes with no music wrap up very warm if not travelling in the summer months or the locals will stare as if your from another planet.
