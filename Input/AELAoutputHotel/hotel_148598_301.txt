{"text":"Westin Great for Kids We spent 6 days with our 2.5 year old daughter and had a great time. East wing 5th floor oceanfront, great views of pool area and ocean. Hotel and rooms very clean. Very kid friendly and safe. Ocean waves very strong, great for adult body surfing.Beach sand brownish due to mineral content from the mountains. Some small amout of trash on the beach but overall it was fine. Great day trip take the full day catamaran sail to Icacos island for snorkeling and a awesome white beach with great views. Snorkeling was above average. Crew was very good.Take the rainforest tour from the hotel. Good for the kids.Take the Old San Juan tour from the hotel and explore San Cristobal fort, very fun.Hotel service was very good. You will see various businessconventions at the hotel, so it will be a mix of familes and that.Only issue we had was the cost of the food for the week, very expensive. The Iguana Pub at the country club is your best betfor a decent priced meal.If you are a runner, you can run inside the resort, which is hilly.In either direction the beach runs for miles.I ran outside the resort also. Went out front gate took a right and climbed the hills for a great skyline view of the coast and the rainforest and you can see all the way to San Juan.For kids, they have Iguana feeding and outdoor big screen TV showing movies on some nites. The kiddie pool is great.Casino was ok. Friday nite was very rowdy and not enjoyable.Wed\/Thurs was slower and played blackjack for hours.So, the Westin exceeded our expectations except for the cost of dining.
