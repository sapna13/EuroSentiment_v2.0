{"text":"Nice Hotel - Central Hotel College de France was a better hotel than we expected for the rate we paid. We stayed 7 nights second week of July 08. The location is left bank - and for us that is not our usual stomping grounds (anymore) but we wanted to try the hotel given the rave reviews. Hotel College is within easy short walking distance to Notre Dame\/St Chapelle, the Louvre and d'Orsay museums. So how good was it?? By Paris standards (based on pus 25 trips) not bad at all. It is 2* - but about the best 2* you may find in Paris. Our room was a twin,with balcony and chairs  tables. Beds were comfortable, pillows are the role type, but regular ones were in the closet so we used those. Bathroom adequate, 1\/2 shower door ensuring water always got on the floor :). Clean towels everyday, sheets changed every other day. As other reviewers mentioned, no air conditioning, but ceiling fan adequate when you open the 2 sets of double doors to balcony. Toiletries were of a poor quality (when replenished) so we went out and bought (we travel light). The room was large enough for us with 4 small suitcases. Room safe worked, as did the free Wi-Fi (great to have) even up to our floor with 3 different network connections. Pictures on their website are accurate.The hotel is in a quiet location with the restaurant Le Pr√ã√\u2022√ñ Verre across the street. We had a so so meal there one night (with reservations) but we were not impressed (despite a great bottle of wine). Le Petite Prince a block south was much more charming, with superior food and service and is a better value.Last but not least, the hotel is surrounded by multiple locations (8 or 9) of camping\/outdoor adventure stores. The store is housed in many locations in the immediate blocks surrounding the hotel everything from clothing, camping, clothes, ski gear, travel gadgets (electrical converters and plugs), luggage, packs, a map and travel book store - Engish as well (best anywhere). Enough to keep a man busy for an entire day :). ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0}]}
