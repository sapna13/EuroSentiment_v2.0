{"text":"Perfect location for sight seeing We returned yesterday from a four day visit to celebrate our wedding anniversary. This hotel was recommended by a good friend who has stayed there 3 or four times. This was our first visit to Venice and we were not disappointed. VENICE do not be put off by the transport system it is very simple. From each airport you catch a blue coach (3 Euros) to the city bus station. You walk 100 metres to the water bus jetty catch the appropriately numbered water bus to the floating  very prominently marked landing station. Then the fun starts finding your way throught the alleyways  over the little bridges to your hotel. HOTEL Booking was simple  easy. Both owners speak very good English  one is always on site. Finding the hotel was no problem. Get off as instructed  walk about 50 metres with no bridge crossings if you go through the back door - look up high on the wall to the left for the small hotel sign at the entrance to the alleyway. This is an excellent location if you have large bags,children or should you find steps  luggage challenging. We stayed in the annex which is four rooms in the building behind the hotel. It was very private  quiet. You will not hear the boat engines here. It was a very quick 1 minute walk to the hotel for breakfast. ROOM was newly fitted very clean  well furnished. En suite was pristine  towels replaced daily. Small fridge in room with space for you to place your own goods in if required. Breakfast was plentiful.(continental) try the hot chocolate to start with  English brakfast tea. There is a guest internet facility available located on the first floor free of charge - handy for flight confirmations. LOCATION - perfect walking times:- Rialto Bridge 20 mins \/ St. Marks square 25 mins \/ Bus-water bus station 15 mins \/ Aresenal 40 mins. There are plenty of good local restaurants - our favourite was the Muro Pizza just behind the hotel (meal for 2 with drinks 28 Euros) Do not be put off by this hotel's two star rating - if you require a good room with a breakfast this is the hotel for you.
