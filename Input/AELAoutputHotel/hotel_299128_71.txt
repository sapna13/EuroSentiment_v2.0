{"text":"Luxurious but lacking in charm We stayed in a club loft suite for 9 days. The service was excellent - hotel staff were always very friendly, warm and welcoming (especially in our last day when they maybe hoped large tips were imminent ;-). The hotel grounds were large and immaculately kept with plenty of smimming pools to go around and (usually) enough sunbeds, so long as your not too fussy as to where in the grounds they are. Our suite was very spacious and luxuriously appointed. The marble bathroom was lovely - large walk in shower, jacuzzi bath and linked dressing area. The huge fluffy bed was the most comfy I have ever slept in. The only negatives were that the angled balcony door did not let much natural light into the room so we had to switch the lights on even during the day. Also, the japanese styled living area, although beautiful, was a little cold in atmosphere. The balinese styled rooms in other non-club wings looked much nicer and warmer.The room service food was good. The breakfast was always delicious and generous, whether room service, bufftet or club lounge. Champange  cocktails with generous tasty canapes all free between 5pm-8pm in the club lounge was a great touch although after a few days, we tired of eating in the club lounge as the outdoor area is cramped and lacking in atmosphere so the club rooms might not end up being the best value option. We ate at the Jimbaran Gardens restaurant which had a nice atmosphere and average but disappointing food given the hefty price tag - indonesian food was the better executed option. The italian restaurant seemed too overpriced for what is mainly salads, pasta and pizza and as quite formal and cold in atmosphere and not on the beach, we never ate there.The hotel has a long beach frontage with plenty of sunbeds overlooking, though not really on, the beach. The beach is lovely, clean, thick soft golden sand, a clean sandy seabed, swimmable at high and low tide, with small-medium sized waves which are fun for adults but I would reccomend accompanying young children. The hotel has a low boundary fence  planting between the back area of the beach where many of it's sunbeds are and the sea-side part of the beach. As a result you can't feel like you are ever actually sunbathing on the beach. Other neighbouring hotels arranged things more nicely, having sunbeds and restaurant tables spread out on the beach, un-impeded by low boundary barriers.There are limited options for eating outside the hotel in walking distance - the seafood warungs were good and well priced, and nearby hotels have fantastic but very expensive restaurant options.
