{"text":"Old World Charm with all the Modern Ammenities Its hard to judge a hotel on just a one night stay, thats why having stayed at the Lenox three times now, I am confident in my review of this hotel. The Lenox is a beautiful combination of unique and well appointed rooms with classic decour that transport you back to how Boston was years ago and all the modern ammenities you look for in a hotel today. My wife and I stayed in three different rooms on three different occasions and are looking forward to staying in another room as soon as we can get back to Boston. The heart of hotel is the staff and the Lenox staff is the perfect balance between attention to detail and allowing for your personal space. When you need something they provide it promptly without hastle and are respectful of your privacy. The soul of a hotel room is the bed and all three of our rooms had large incredibly comfortable beds, with amazingly soft sheets, mountains of pillows and the coziest down comforters. The duvet fit the style of the room with obvious attention to the overall asthetic. Stylish and smart it is nothing like the cookie cutter hotel rooms of a major chain. The bathrooms were no less impressive, marble counter tops and wonderful showers with both overhead and detachable showerheads. My wife and I truly felt refreshed after a stay at this hotel. Again their attention to detail was refreshing with Aveeda bath products and luxurious terry cloth robes.  had breakfast in the Azure restaurant and were blown away by the deliciousness and freshness of our meals. We had fresh squeezed orange juice, toast, coffee and the best vegetarian omelette I ever had, my wife equally enjoyed her eggs benedict and bacon. We had the same waiter all three times we stayed and he was a delight first thing in the morning, again attentive but keeping a respectful distance a combination hard to come by in hotel employees and wait staff.  Our car was handled with equal care and respect by the valet staff who parked our car in the attached garage.  In addition to all this you get wireless internet, flat screen tv, some rooms have fireplaces and the swankierrooms have personal home theatre and remote control blinds.  When I go to Boston to see the sights and spend the night I want to feel like I have privacy, like I have everything I need in the room and that I am well attended to by the staff. I get all this and more at Lenox and do not hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for more from a stay in Boston than four walls and a TV. Lastly I will mention that the manager at the Lenox Ms. White went above and beyond durring a stay for my and my wife's anniversary when she offered us a free upgrade to a beautiful suite that was available in honor of our anniversary. I have stayed at the Lenox since and felt equally welcome and immensly enjoyed our stay there.  Do yourself a favor and stay at a hotel with character and charm that is right in the heart of Boston close to all the shopping and events you won't regret it.
