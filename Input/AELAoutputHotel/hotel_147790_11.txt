{"text":"Amazing Hix Island House  Hix Island House, Vieques: My wife and I have just returned from what we consider our best vacation √à√\u2020\u2022?ever. Not enough superlatives to describe Hix Island House and Vieques. The accommodation was perfect for the ultimate getaway. No television, no noise, no windows even - just beautiful and tranquil surroundings and a chance to get away from the maddening crowd. Rat race behind us we could enjoy the architecture of the Hix complex (it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ stunning in an understated way) and the natural landscaping surrounding it from vantage points such as the private patio of our loft, a roof deck, the low-chlorine pool and even a hammock slung between trees in a quiet paddock on the grounds. You feel very much at peace and in a state of permanent relaxation whilst there. We spent a few days just lounging around, enjoying the fresh coffee, bread, and fruit and such that Hix supply to the lofts each day, cooking, reading, napping and simply trying to take in all of the flowers and accompanying wildlife that our loft (Adobe) was nestled within. The open-air shower with a panorama of flowers, trees and fauna was a joy each morning as was waking up with the shutters and doors open to sunrise. We slept under the mosquito nets provided and had no problem whatsoever with bug nuisance√à√\u2020\u2022?The resident host of small (and cute) Geckos etc. saw to that I think! When we did need anything the staff couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have been more helpful  friendly √à√\u2020\u2022?If you go, I recommend going to the owners√à√\u2020\u2022?cocktail party √à√\u2020\u2022?they have a house on the complex with (if possible) even more breathtaking views√à√\u2020\u2022?J Crew shot a catalogue at Hix I think √à√\u2020\u2022?I can see why. As for the rest of the island √à√\u2020\u2022?unspoiled, laid back and fun. Hire a Jeep (4 wheeler necessary) and explore. 2\/3 of the island is a nature reserve and that which is open to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√∂xplorers√à√\u2020\u2022?will by way of unmade roads and fun in a Jeep take you to secluded\/deserted beaches √à√\u2020\u2022?On the way out to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022\u201AÑ¢reen Beach√à√\u2020\u2022?we enjoyed two undisturbed days on a small beach (complete with cabana) and not a person in sight. Bio-Bay on a dark night is well worth it (the water glows when agitated) and snorkeling is also good. We enjoyed Chez Shack (a shack come gourmet restaurant) in the middle of the island as well as tapas and sunset at BBH. I could go on √à√\u2020\u2022?but most of all √à√\u2020\u2022?it is a complete get away from work-a-day life. We√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l go back to Hix and enjoy Vieques again. I recommend staying at Hix and getting back to nature, flying from San Juan by charter flight to Vieques rather than trying the ferry and definitely hiring a car√à√\u2020\u2022?Oh and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ worry about the hire cars √à√\u2020\u2022?their √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022\u2022heck Engine Lights√à√\u2020\u2022?are all, and always, on√à√\u2020\u2022?Stay at Hix Island House - have a great time!!!
