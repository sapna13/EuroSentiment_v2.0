{"text":"Would definetely recommend this Resort to my friends Oh man I wish I still there... The resort Melia Caribe Tropical was great, I loved mostly everything about it, the service was amazing, the bartenders were really nice, especially the ones at the pool, the beach was so beautiful, being a dominican from higuey which is about 40 minuted from Punta Cana, I knew exactly what to expect from the beach, lots of seaweed, which was cleaned up every morning, we found a good clean spot in the water and we didnt want to come out, the resort I must say has a very family oriented environment, it is not that great for couples, but our room was fantastic, the food variety wasnt that great but it wasnt terrible either, we had great japanese at one the A la Carte places, which were a hastle to get into we ended up making 2 reservations at some point because we thought we werent gonna be able to get in, I recommend you reserve on your first day for all the A la Carte because they are always booked.. Th elobby and the green areas were fabulous expectacular scenery, really tropical..The check in process can definetely use some help, it took almost 2 hours for our check in and the check out wasnt very pleasant either.. So far those were my only complaints, but everything else was great, Yes if I had to I would definetely stay again, but next time I am planning to go to Paradissus Palma Real which is their next door neighbor, we took a tour and were over impressed it was like nothing I've ever seen, cannot wait to go back I am having my wedding there next year.. I am Dominican I know my beaches and I have been to many resorts and I must say that Melia Caribe Tropical was fantastic.. At some points you have to remember it is not America, things are a little more difficult overthere and if you dont have royal expectations you will have a great time.... ","annotations":[]}
