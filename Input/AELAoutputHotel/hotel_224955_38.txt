{"text":"Great value, but shady location I got an incredible deal through Travelzoo. I didn't know the Union Square area too well, but Hotel Metropolis seemed like it was in a pretty central location, which it is. The hotel itself is an oasis, but only because it is in a shady part of town and once you get in, you're relieved not to be walking outside anymore. It's on the outskirts of Union Square and I was amazed at what a difference a 1\/2 block can make from nice area to shady.There's huge mall across the way and tons of great shopping and restaurants nearby, but I wouldn't recommend venturing out too late and would definitely have at least one other person with you at night. It's close to everything including the cable car turnaround and the BART, but again, the flipside to that is the neighborhood that its in. Our room was somewhat small, but nothing too bad. The decor is well done and it felt very relaxing and soothing. I thought it was very clean and everything was comfortable. My friends and I peeked in on a single room and were surprised at how tiny it was. Our double room seemed absolutely huge in comparison. My big recommendation for staying at the Hotel Metropolis would be to try to get a room on a higher floor and not facing Turk St. as it gets incredibly loud at night with people shouting outside and the occasional police sirens. It was difficult to fall asleep, but once its 2:30-3 a.m., it gets significantly quieter. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. Would I stay at the Hotel Metropolis again? Probably, but I would definitely request a room on a higher floor. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":460,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":456}]}
