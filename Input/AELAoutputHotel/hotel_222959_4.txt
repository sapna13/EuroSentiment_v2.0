{"text":"Wanna Be Luxury The reason why I know that this is a luxury hotel is because they tell me it is, but frankly few of the experiences here are luxury. First the good....1. The staff with relatively few exception is friendly (although the restaurant staff can be slow) and competent. Every time I returned to the hotel, the staff greeted me with a warm welcome and made me feel like I was coming home. 2. If you get a room with a view of the harbor, it is an awesome view. The Statue of Liberty is right outside the windows and it is nice to watch the boats pass by. 3. For a high end hotel, wi fi is relatively cheap ($12.95\/night or $59.95 for seven nights). I will never understand why wi fi is free at a Motel 6 but not at a hotel for which you pay $500 a night but the Ritz is no different than other high end hotels. Since most in my experience charge $25\/day (highway robbery), the Ritz price wasn't too bad.Now the bad. 1. The room itself is quite plain. For a hotel catering to business travelers it is amazing how few outlets there are to plug in computers etc. The toiletries are Bulgari, but they provide very few of them. 2. The room service menu is appallingly bad. There is very little to choose from in general and the choices are nowhere near the standards of most luxury hotels (dry rubbery hamburgers, pizza etc.) Frankly, the restaurant is not much better. While there are more choices of food, the fare is unimaginative and average. 3. The hotel lacks basics like a stocked sundry shop. I don't expect the a whole pharmacy but if I forget my deodorant, I find it preposterous that I can get a replacement at the Crown Plaza but not at the Ritz (actually they had Speed Stick for men, but nothing for women. Obviously in a pinch you wear what the have, but are women not business travelers too? Must I smell like a teenager going to prom in bad cologne?) . Nor can you get a magazine, a pack of gum or other basics. You can however, buy very expensive yuppie candles.I haven't stayed at other hotels downtown, but I will definitely look for other options the next time I must be in this area.
