{"text":"Amazing views, friendly staff, great location - highly recommended! We booked the Affinia solely on it's rating on Trip Advisor and I'm pleased to say that you all have excellent judgement! We only stayed 2 nights as we decided to spit the stay between here and a cheaper place as finances were tight, but I'm really glad we did as it was a fabulous place to end the trip. We stayed in a junior suite on floor 33 (or something around that number) and we got an amazing corner room. You can't determine the exact room when you book so it's partly luck of the draw, but we booked a fair while in advance and asked for a room that was high up with a good view and preferably on the corner and they obviously made the effort to meet our wishes.The room was huge - if one person was on the sofa and the other on the bed, you had to speak up slightly to be heard! The bathroom was impeccably clean and well fitted out and the spacious kitchen area was an unexpected bonus. Everything was spotless and the cleaners even washed up our dirty cutlery (which I felt very guilty about!). But by far the best feature of the room was the breathtaking view - you only have to look at the pictures here on trip advisor to see what I mean. The hotel is in a great location - not smack bang in the tourist district, but close to most attractions on the subway. The staff were friendly in a very genuine way, especially our lovely porter who was really helpful. We didn't eat in the restaurant, but were advised that there are many places nearby (hundred yards or so) that are nicer  better value. We ate breakfast at a great coffee place about 1min from the hotel and there was a great 24hr grocery store nearby on the corner with a lovely deli (the lemon chicken was to die for). With a kitchen in the room this means you can actually save quite a bit on eating out. All in all we had a wonderful stay, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a luxury stay at a reasonable price in central New York.
