{"text":"Not Worth the Money Our stop in Barcelona was going to be part of a 3 week European vacation and we decided to splurge for the Ritz Carlton. You can definitely get a 5 star experience if money is no object and you have low\/average expectations.But as someone who stays for free in the biggest suites in Las Vegas and has experienced service at the highest levels, the hotel was nice but definitely not worth the money.The staff was friendly but rather useless. If you pose something to them that they haven't trained for in their employee manual, you can see their head about ready to explode.The prices of the food in the restaurant were about double the prices of the very good quality food you can get outside the hotel. The only food that I ate within the hotel was the breakfast buffet. Very good and high quality but definitely not worth the $50\/pp price tag. You can get a very nice eggs\/bacon\/toast breakfast at the deli next door for about $9 + bev.The area around the hotel is nice. The beach is right behind the hotel about a 5 minute walk and there is a boardwalk with about 5 restaurants along the beach. Across the street there is a mall with a pretty good Chinese restaurant, tapas bar, ice cream stand, mexican and italian restaurants, sandwich shop, and a souvenir shop where we stocked up on soda and waters and a great chicken salad sandwich for $4.There is a Touriste bus stop about 2 minutes from the hotel that will take you to all the sites around the city and will take you to the city center and you can walk down Las Ramblas, the main drag. Definitely worth a stop is the Boqueria which is an open air market and has the freshest and best tasting fruit I've ever had in my life.In summary, the Ritz is a nice hotel, but you'll definitely overpay.
