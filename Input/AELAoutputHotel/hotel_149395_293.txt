{"text":"Very Nice Resort Just returned from a extended weekend stay at the Paradisus Punta Cana returning on October 30th. Overall I had a very positive experience at the resort with only a few minor issues. I've been to many Carribean resorts but this was only my second all-inclusive and I would recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a fun place at a good price. This was apparently an off week because occupancy was low so some of my comments may not apply during busier weeks.The grounds of the hotel are very well kept and the pool and beach are gorgous. The pool is very large and extends off in branches in many directions so it is easy to find a quiet spot or be in the middle of the crowd. It only exceeds four feet in a few spots so this is a hanging out pool as opposed to a lap pool. Of course there is the swim up bar and plenty of lounges at the pool and beach. The one issue is that the lobby reception including the theatre, tennis courts and two of the twelve resturants is located in the front of the resort and is separated from the rest of the resort which is located closer to the beach. The total distance from the beach to the lobby is no more than a half a mile and they have a tram that runs continuously through the resort so it was a minor inconvinence. However, those rides on that open tram sure cooled you off on a hot day and they are fun to go zipping around on. We had a Junior Suite which I assumed would be a smaller room but it was actually quite large with a separated bedroom and sitting area as well as a small balcony (We were on the second floor of a two story unit). TV left a bit to be desired being rather old and static ridden reception. The A\/C and fan left the room temp perfect throughout our visit. There was fridge with beverages provided in the room. Maid service was very good. I was happy with all of the meals during our stay. For dinner we eat in the Brazilian, Seafood and Italian resturants. We sat outside in a gazebo in the middle of a pond which was pretty cool our last night at the Italian resturant and although it was a hot night it was very comfortable. There were no waits for a table any of the nights we dined. The food wasn't the top standard you would find in a major city but it was quite good for where you were. My only complaint would be a desserts which looked good but didn't compare in taste. The hotel staff was great, very friendly and always willing to help. Even if their English was not so good they would do their best or get someone to help translate a phrase. The hotel maintains a small casino and spa which we visited and found to be again very nice with friendly staff. Be advised that the hotel's parent company runs a vacation club and you will be approached about a presentation in exchange for free gifts. We committed to a 60 minute presentation that we had to stop after over two hours and then they gave us a hard time about the gifts. My advice is to steer clear of these presentations unless you are seriously shopping for a vacation club.Overall this is a nice resort for the money. It is not the newest or largest but they have great grounds, facilities and staff. The twelve resturants create enough of a mix to keep you interested and it is a very fun place with plenty of activities.
