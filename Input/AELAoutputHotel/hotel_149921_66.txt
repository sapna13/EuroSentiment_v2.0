{"text":"Nice hotel We stayed at the Caribe Hilton from 5\/14-5\/18 and loved our time here. We usually take a nice vacation once a year, and since we let our passports expire, we thought we should try Puerto Rico. The location of the resort was ok, right in the middle of everything, and an easy cab ride to Old San Juan, and Isla Verde. I would have to say that is the only downside of the property, is that you have to take a bus or cab and can't really walk to anywhere that is close. I highly recommend the Condado Area.. lots of places to eat outside the hotel (Danny's Pizza was awesome) and it's close to a couple of casino's. We ate at Morton's one night, great food, nice atmosphere, what you would expect from a nice steakhouse. We did however eat at the Parrot Club in old San Juan two nights. It was one the best places I have ever eaten, hands down. I recommend getting only appetizers and ordering a few, they were all outstanding! Don't forget desert also, the banana spring rolls were amazing! OK, be sure to see the forts. Both are really awesome if you like history. As for the rest of the hotel, lobby, pool, restaraunts were all first class and we enjoyed the pool bar immensly. Hiram and Jose will take good care of you if you take care of them. The room was a little Dumpy for being a Hilton, but I know the place is old. All in all, I would defintely recommend the hotel. Everything people said about prices are true, but if you are prepared, it's no big deal. It's not Mexico. Enjoy!
