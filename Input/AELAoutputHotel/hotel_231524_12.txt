{"text":"location location location I received a decent special rate for this hotel. Compared to other hotels that I stayed at during my November 2007 trip to Spain, this was one of the more expensive, outdone by our hotel in Madrid (by 10 euro per night- for a 4 star). Barcelona is nice, it was cold and such, I missed out on the beach. I left feeling that the people of barcelona are as cold as the weather, and Im a native new yorker-but I think New Yorkers are the most friendly people in the world. Anyway, this is a decent hotel, great location 10 mins walk to the harbor, and Ramblas, 15 mins walk to L'Example and\/or 2 stops on the 2 metro. I did the bus tour for 20 euro buy at the hotel, walk to the colon monument, hop on hop off, it was nice. the hotel is basic, did not do the breakfast, cause there are many options outside. Eat at Pollo Rico in the Raval, very local and very cheap. This hotel has free internet service in rooms and one computer in lobby. Service was very nice, the rooms basic with a safe, ikea style furniture, clean bathroom and some rooms have patios. The only complaint was people smoke in the hallways, but this is Europe so keep in mind they blow smoke in your face everywhere you go. Beds comfortable, could use another pillow but just fold yours in half. Staff nice, cleaning crew nice, mini bar doubles as your fridge and everything you need is within walking distance and the metro 2 and 3 lines are 1 blk away. Get your goods at the Condi grocery 1\/2 blk away and you get water, snacks and wine there at better prices than the bodegas in the neighborhood. People complain about the neighborhood but I felt safe walking by myself at 2 am. It is totally fine. For the price great value and clean.
