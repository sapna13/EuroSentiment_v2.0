{"text":"Just Wonderfull!!!!! We stayed at the property for 5 glorius days and booked thru American express. We added the Royal Service as a last thought and it was truly remarkable. The staff couldn't do enough for us -- restaurant reservations, unexpected gifts in our room every couple of days, the Gabbi bar and restaurant (for Royal Service) was a great experience to talk with the locals and learn their customs but above all the food was exceptional. The pool with swim up bar for Royal Service was excellent -- can't say enough about our trip. We ate in the Japanese, French  American restaurants and our last night was spent at the Gabbi and everything was great. Again, thru the Royal Service you can make reservations whenever you want with the VIP staff. The casino is not what you know about them - don't play the slots...they don't pay off but my husband did well at Black Jack. And with the Royal Service you just hop on a cart, they take you to the beach that's roped off just for this service (and there is security on that private section), they have their own beach bar and when you are ready to leave, all you have to do is pick up a phone  there they are to transport you back. The room was very clean and loved the flowers in the bathroom everyday that were picked that very morning. Order room service just 1 afternoon and asked for a beer and white wine -- they brought a whole bottle of quality white wine! Yes, the drinks here are all top shelf . Would truly go back in a minute. Met some very nice people too!
