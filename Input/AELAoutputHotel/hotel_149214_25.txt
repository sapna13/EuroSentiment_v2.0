{"text":"Scam - OK hotel but management seems to want to run it down MARGIN SCAMThe hotel pulls a double charge scam that nets them at least 3-4% on every transaction. They start off by charging you in Dominican Pesos. Then they convert this to US dollars using a rate which is favorable to them. When it comes time to check out, they convert back to Pesos at another favorable rate - effectively taking a nice transaction spread for themselves twice. When you get your credit card bill, you'll see what I mean. What you are quoted as owing is much less than what you actually pay.We stayed at the hotel for several days and were really looking forward to everything that the hotel offered - beach, golfing, water sports, ecological reserve, etc. Unfortunately, the folks at the hotel would only give us a twin bedroom claiming that ALL the other rooms were sold out for everyday we were there - even though people arrived and left every day! I wondered where our correct room was in all this - we patiently asked several times and then gave up trying to switch to a different room. Management was awful. Some guy named Jose saw the checkin line get really long and decided to duck into the backroom and not help anyone out.Positives:* Many activities: beach, ecological reserve, golf (costs extra), non-motor water sports, etc.* Spacious resort* Relaxing* Lack of college kids partying* People oftentimes seem to keep babies in the baby pool rather than letting them run amok in the main poolNegatives:* Awful management* Some staff were really pleasant but majority were unhelpful* Golf staff was pretty bad all around - caddies, pro shop + hidden extra charges* Food not great* Bar staff* Outdated and unclean rooms* Nobody speaks english and their spanish ain't great either (the resort is owned by some Americans - funny how nobody can speak the language)The hotel was well laid out and really spacious. As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a lot of people here, but it never feels like that with the ample space on the beach and elsewhere.We wanted to find reasons to really like this hotel. But in the end, we had to be honest. Unless management\/staff changes occur, we probably will spend our money elsewhere.
