{"text":"Nice little hotel... We just returned from our 10 day trip to Spain and stayed at the Silver Aprthotel from April 2-5. After extensive research on trip advisor, I booked the hotel for my wife and I as well as another couple and we were not dissapointed. We chose the Silver based on price as well as location (conveniently near the metro). The Hotel: While a small hotel, it has a friendly atmosphere and all of the people who worked reception were kind and spoke excellent English. We stayed in a standard room (double bed for 92 euros). The room was small but this appears to be the trend in Europe (correctly advertised based on the pictures from the website). Not a big deal since we didn't spend much time there. It was clean and had a decent bathroom. Would recommend keeping your windows closed at night though to keep the noise down that comes from passer-bys on the street at 2am. Getting there: It cost us 35 euros to arrive by taxi from the airport (extra charge for 2 pieces of luggage and travel from the aiport itself). Keep in mind this was at 8am and during rush hour, otherwise I expect it would have cost ~25 euros as the hotel site indicated. You can also arrive by taking the aeroport bus (pay when you get on) from the Airport to Plaza Catalunya and then take the metro from Plaza Catalunya to Fontana (L3\/Green Line towards Zona Universitat) for ~4 euros + ~1 euro respectively. I would recommend buying the T10 pass (as per other reviews) for the metro which cost 7.5 euros (purchased at the entrance of every metro stop, provides a total of 10 rides per card, and can be used by multiple passengers). The hotel is only 50 yrds from the Fontana stop (which is 3 stops from Plaza Catalunya, the hub of the city). FYI- Our friends took the aeroport bus + metro to the hotel and said it was cumbersome carrying their luggage up the stairs\/escalators at the metro. Location: As above, the hotel is conveniently located near the Fontana metro stop and is a 20-25 min walk to las Ramblas (although we always took the metro). There are several restaurants near the hotel as well as small bakeries and such. Never ate breakfast at the hotel so I can't comment on that. It was nice to be away from the craziness of Las Ramblas as other reviewers have commented. Would defintely recommend this Hotel to other travelers based on price and location near the metro.
