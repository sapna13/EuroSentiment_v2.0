{"text":"Great Resort! To all Canadians. My fiance and I just stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach for one week and had a fantastic trip. The resort grounds are big.....but not too big, the food was good and offered a variety of dishes using their theme night procedure, the beach was beautiful and the drinks were great. You must check out: Le Cafe (their version of a Starbucks), the Italian a la carte restaurant, the Japanese a la carte restaurant. Avoid: the Jurassic Buggy excursion and the ham. We did the Marinarium excursion which was absolutely great and well worth the money spent. We also loved the Zipline Adventures excursion.....the trip to the mountains was a bit long and very bumpy....but worth every minute. I would not recommend the Jurassic Buggy excursion....we didn't drive the buggies much and kept stopping at local vending spots to be hounded into purchasing souvenirs.....we couldn't even have a bottle of water without spending close to $5 US. Save your money and don't do this excursion. There are 3 large pools on the resort grounds......each offering something different. The swim up bar was great and always offered quick service. It seemed as though there was a different bar every 30 feet which was great.....and the 24 hour snack bar offered a variety of pizzas, burgers, and hot dogs. You'll never go thirsty or hungry at this resort. Language barrier......I don't speak a lot of Spanish but I never really had a problem communicating with anyone at the resort. If you know French it would help a little.....I do.....and found I used it frequently. This is our second time going to Punta Cana......loved the resort and would recommend it to anyone. Trust BARCELO....you can't go wrong. Good luck and happy holidays.
