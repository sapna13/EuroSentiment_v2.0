{"text":"True Excellent at Excellence Resort My husband and I recently returned from an eight night stay at Excellence Punta Cana. This was our second time at the resort, having honeymooned there four years ago when it was called Secrets Excellence.Our stay this time was beyond our highest expectations. Our room was beautiful and meticulously clean. The choice of restaurants has increased and we ate at all of them MANY TIMES. Believe it or not, many nights we ate two dinners at two different restaurants. (Yes, we put on a little weight, but it was well worth it!). The food was incredibly fresh, creative and delicious at all of the restaurants. Our absolute favorite were the French and Mediterranean restaurants. I remember having the grilled portobello mushroom- perfectly cooked and finished off with the house wine. We also participated in a lot of activities and went to the shows every night. They were a lot of fun and you can tell that the staff puts their hearts and souls into every performance.Speaking of the staff, we found them all to be friendly, courteous and very helpful. I can't name them all, but I do want to single out Roberto Puello, Manager of Club Excellence. Roberto was the best, making our stay a truly memorable one. I would also like to thank a particular member of the entertainment crew, named Alexandra. She taught our Beach Yoga, aqua gym and step aerobics classes with so much energy and enthusiasm that it was contagious, and she helped me to burn off some of the many delicious calories.This was our best vacation yet!Wishing we could return every year,Pascalia Papadopoulos Mattioli ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1170,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1166}]}
