{"text":"Service with a smile ... For many people, Singapore is synonymous with Orchard Road, huge air-conditioned malls, immaculately dressed locals, sweating tourists and five star deluxe hotels. Say Orange Grove Road and Tanglin to many people and they will look at you with slight bemusement. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ unless they have stayed at the Shangri-La Singapore because that is where you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l find this luxury hotel tucked away just a few minutes off Orchard Road. The Shangri-La is slightly odd in one sense in that it gives you the feeling that you are in a destination resort and at the same time wrapped up in sophisticated opulence. Delightfully odd! True, the time before my most recent visit happened to coincide with a major international security conference whose attendees included the US Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates. Suffice it to say that security was tight! However that didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ affect my feelings about the hotel. Far from it! The ease with which this complex, high profile event was managed with only minor inconvenience for people like me speaks volumes. From the time you arrive at the hotel you will encounter some of the best hotel staff to be found anywhere in the world. The brightly costumed and incredibly polite guys who open your car door tend to rather be outshone by the graceful and beautifully dressed young ladies who will greet you with a smile and warmth that will melt any jet-lag. The front desk staff are the definition of efficiency and really make you feel like you are the only guest in the hotel. In my experience no request is too large and there is never that sense of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µlease don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ask me √à√\u2020\u2022?ask the other person √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ their job√à√\u2020\u2022?that one sometimes finds in large hotels.The lobby is a large expanse of cream colored marble with tall columns leading your eye to enormous crystal chandeliers. Off to one side you will find a lounge area with comfortable chairs and sofas and is a good place for coffee and meeting people for business discussions. Order a cappuccino and you will receive a terrific cup of coffee delivered with four choices of flavors that will be stirred into your drink before your very eyes. A very nice touch!From the lobby you will either be shown to your room in the Tower Wing or will be taken to the Garden Wing of the hotel. The Valley Wing has a separate entrance and as I have yet to stay in this part of the hotel, I will leave it to those lucky people to describe that part of the Shangri-La!The Garden Wing rooms are large and airy with a d√ã√\u2022√ñcor that is somewhat reminiscent of destination resort in style. Mine overlooked the large pool and had a flower festooned balcony on which I happily whiled away the odd free hour. The Tower rooms are not quite as spacious but have (I think) been relatively recently renovated. The bathrooms are excellent with both a walk in shower and bath tub and are separated from the living area by a wall of glass blocks that make the space feel light and spacious. Add to that the ubiquitous toiletries and soft fluffy towels and bathrobes and you may have found your bathroom heaven (well that may be over stating the case a bit!!).Many people will visit the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºine√à√\u2020\u2022?restaurant for breakfast, lunch or dinner. True, it isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ inexpensive but it is an unusual experience where one can select food from various √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºtations√à√\u2020\u2022?spread around the restaurant. It is difficult to explain, which I have clearly just demonstrated!! Anyway, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ worth a try. √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®lu√à√\u2020\u2022?is set atop of the Tower Wing and has wonderful food, a great bar with excellent cocktails and occasional live music. Whenever I have been there it has been quiet and relaxing and a haven from the crowds at Boat or Clarke Quay or the various Orchard Road √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢aunts√à√\u2020\u2022?Singapore for me is like a second home. I adore the people, the food and even the weather! I used to stay at the Hyatt but I really enjoy the Shangri-La. OK it may not have the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√údginess√à√\u2020\u2022?of newer hotels or the colonial grandeur of Raffles but it has everything I need on my trips with one added luxury; the smile that comes from staff who either really enjoy what they do or are unbelievably well trained √à√\u2020\u2022?or maybe it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ both.
