{"text":"great relaxing holiday we booked this holiday last min , travelled on 29 november 2007 for a 2 week stay.after a long flight and transfer, we were meeted with drinks and the check in was quickest in my holiday history.We found our way to the room were we found it to be as we expected with a bottle of chilled sparkling wine and fruit basket. (my boyfriend had emailed the hotel to inform them that the holiday was a special occasion for us, our first holiday) hahaha.overall, Food - was nice, always plenty of choice, but we did suffer from holiday tummy.we loved the chinese and ate there 3 times and also booked the special lobster and champgne night. (extra cost)Room - was clean and tidy, the maid could not speak english, had lots of fun and laughs trying to understand each other but she was pleasent and did a good job.Pool - didnt bother much as always got bit by insects but not to be missed.Drinks\/bar - bar staff were great and would give you any thing you wanted, had plenty of laughs and fun, especially when we got stuck in the sports bar for 24 hours due to the storm.i was not complaining hahaha (served 24 hours a day)Beach - was just as good as other carribean beachs if not better, the beach has in fact been rated as one of the top ten beaches in the world. (spent every day here)Activities - were limited in regards to the animation team, if your german or french you had plenty to do but to be honest i came to lie on the beach all day.Staff - friendly and helpful most of the time, especially the tea and coffee boys at breakfast time, ( please quote S O S )We also travelled all that way only to meet people we knew from work\/home which added to the fun.we had a great holiday with no major complaints and would return. infact just looking at the pics on the sight on writing this review is making me want to be there right now.dont take any notice of the bad reports on here, people must have such a perfect life or simply enjoy complaining and making peoples life hell.also the dom republic in a under developed country not like the UK, the hotel is probably like paradise\/palace compared to the shuddy natural conditions for the people that live there.All i can say is what do you expect from that type of country !!!!Just a little tip . if you run out of meal tickets for booking the resturants just ask at reception, no one qestions.Please run away from the blokes in t shirts that try to sell times shares hahaha.
