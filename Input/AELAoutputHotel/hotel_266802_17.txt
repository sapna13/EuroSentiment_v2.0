{"text":"A tranquil  This was my third stay in La Fortezza, indeed my third trip to Florence and I don't think that I'll ever stay anywhere else when I go there again.It's such a great hotel and although people do go on (here) about it being a bit of a walk to the centre of town it's really not that far and a bit of exercise is good for you. It's not as it it is uphill or involves walking through less desirable neighbourhoods. I would only say that the hotel's location would be a problem if you have trouble with your mobility, but then there is always the option of a taxi or the bus.As has already been described the decor is very up to date, with a typical Italian flair. The rooms are spotlessly clean and do contain everything you could need such as mini-bar, TV, phone, desk and safe and they now also include a laptop with webaccess (payable).The breakfast involves a decent selection of cereals, cakes, bread rolls, yoghurts, cheese, ham and fruit with juices, water and tea or coffee to drink. It is included in the room rate.The staff are very attentive without being overbearing which is pleasant and their English is excellent.I guess the only thing that this hotel is lacking is a bar. There is a lounge where they will get you a coffee if you request it, but no bar which would have been good for us on our last visit as we were over in Florence to get married and had a number of friends and family staying in the hotel with us and it would have been great to meet up over apertivo before we headed out.One last thing. I noticed that a previous reviewer quoted the taxi price to the main station (Santa Maria Novella) as being 13 Euros. Although I've not got a taxi to the station this seems a little steep to me as it's only about 1-2kms away and when I got a taxi from the hotel over to the other side of the Arno in heavy traffic it was only 7 Euros, so I think that they were ripped off (not that I think this happens often as taxis are metered there). It probably is an idea to get a taxi from the station to the hotel if you arrive with a lot of baggage, but if you bags are portable then the walk is only about 15 mins and is not that complicated.
