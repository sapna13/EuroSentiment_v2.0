{"text":"Decent hotel if your flight is not delayed\/cancelled I used Expedia to book my room at Hotel Piet Hein and prepaid the full amount for my 6-night stay. When my flight from Chicago to Amsterdam was delayed for 22 hours due to mechanical failure, I phoned the Hotel Piet Hein to inform them that I would be arriving a day late. Their immediate reaction was to advise me that they could not give me a refund because they were holding the room for me. They said I could take it up with Expedia when I returned to the U.S. Upon arrival at the hotel, the manager came out of her office to apologize for the fact that the room they were supposed to hold for me had been given to someone else the night before due to overbooking by the hotel. Consequently, I couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ check in until the person occupying the room had checked out.When I checked out of the hotel 5 days later, the desk clerk said there was a notation on my account indicating that I owed the hotel for an additional night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ stay because of my late arrival. She backed down, though, when I explained the circumstances of my late arrival. Upon returning to the U.S. I contacted Expedia to request a refund for my first night√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hotel accommodation. When Expedia contacted Hotel Piet Hein to inform them of my refund request, the hotel claimed that they had held my room for me the first night and had lost the income that would have resulted from renting out the room. As soon as I provided Expedia with the details of my interactions with hotel staff, Expedia understood what had happened and granted my refund request. I will definitely use Expedia in the future to book hotel reservations! ","annotations":[]}
