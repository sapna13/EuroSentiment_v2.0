{"text":"Our Perspective First off we found this very useful prior to our trip and are glad to leave our perspective. We will only touch the points in which we differ from the majority.Food; We are foodies so it takes alot to impress us, and we would give this a 7 out of 10. FYI: The property next door has better beach lunches\/parties. The gourmet was a 6 but the Cajun and Med were 8's. The Japenese was disorganized the service was slow, but the food rather good, but don't count on Sushi if you are a big fan.Drinks; Super Great Staff, but agree the blended drinks had a powdered taste, but that didn't slow us down.Rooms: The A\/C works fine and is adjustable in your room. Maintained a room temp of 69√ä√©?F during upper 80's. However, the power goes out at least once a day for 10-30 minutes. Very clean, well maintained, very very nice, Jr Suite with sitting area and patio. We were located in room 1115, which was perfect for dinner. First row from the main complex but several building off the main corridor to the beach. I say perfect for dinner becasue having to wear long pants even in the evening when it's 80 you don't want to take a long walk. However, the long walk to the beach is fine becasue you are dressed for it. Not that the sound of the waves and the breeze won't of been nice. If location is important, call the property the day or two before and request general location, becasue when you get there the rooms are pre-assigned and packets are assembled and even a $50 incentive was not considered by the staff.Grounds; Perfect! Peacocks could sleep later for my taste. They are pretty regular with a crowing noise at 6:45 am. I think it was mating season too!Beach; The best and very walkable for miles. The topless aspect is no big deal, and when in Rome!Construction next door was not an issues but heard of some who complained.Golf; We golfed at the Punta Cana Golf Club and really enjoyed oursevles. 30 minute drive and several holes along the beach. We would go back, but are not the type to re-visit the same hotel becasue we like to expereince differences. Our next trip to Punta Cana will be around the golf resorts.
