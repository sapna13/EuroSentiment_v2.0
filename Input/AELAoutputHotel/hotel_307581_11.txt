{"text":"Extremely disappointed - wish I had read the reviews first! We have just returned from staying 9 nights at this hotel. After a beautiful week spent in timeshare at Tanjung Benoa, we were looking forward to even more at Legian Beach, especially considering how much more this cost us. After the initial shock of driving past rooms to the very small lobby, we were distressed to find ourselves walking back that way to our room. This was on the second floor and we were asked to help carry our cases up the (very narrow) stairs. We stayed in a deluxe family room that was quite large but very dark. I can't really complain about the cleanliness or servicing of the room but the outlook was ordinary over the roadway and the TV selection was appalling. How can you not get Wimbledon or the Tour de France in a major hotel? Breakfast was OK; selection not bad once you had mananged to bag yourself a table - no help from the staff. They just told you where you couldn't sit but no effort or assistance, and trying to get a cup of tea - well someone else here said that pouring your own would have been a better option; I agree wholeheartedly. Pool bar service was non existent also - 20 mins sitting on a chair at the swim up bar, then when the attendant came he ignored us until we begged for a menu, and then another 10 mins to order. To their credit the food and drinks arrived quickly. Pool toilet was in poor condition; how hard is it to buy a new toilet seat? I could go on but our whole experience was probably made less satisfactory because we were comparing it to that of my sister and her family who stayed at the Padma for not much more cost, but a whole lot better surroundings. For most of the week she allowed the Legian scum to spend time around the Padma pool...at no cost. At Legian Beach they have a sign indicating that visitors were required to pay Rp 100000 to swim; who are they kidding? We swam and spent money at the Padma for a week and next time I'm in Bali that's where I will be staying as well!
