{"text":"excellent budget hotel - an outstanding value Hotel Europa is an outstanding value for a budget-conscious traveler. The room (we stayed in #36) was comparatively large, romantic, clean, and charming. The bathroom is quite large as well. It's a smaller family-run operation, and we didn't mind at all a lack of room service, 24 hour desk personnel, etc that larger properties charge for in their room costs.The hotel sits on a VERY busy  noisy street that takes about a 5 minute walk to get to the Duomo. The rooms on the rear of the hotel are totally quiet however. I would much rather have a short walk to the center of things than pay double at another property that is 3 minutes closer  on the other side of the Duomo Square.During our stay Florence had an unusual heat wave. It was in the mid-90s and sticky\/humid. If you dislike those kind of temperatures (I know some people love them), make sure your room air-conditioning is working well, and if need be left on after housekeeping comes through.Our biggest disappointment in Florence had nothing to do with the hotel. It was the restaurants. We live just outside San Francisco and think we have better Italian food here than at the restaurants we tried in Florence. Our favorite dining experiences involved little cafes with a more casual light food\/wine bar offering - as compared to the full sit-down restaurants. But.....each to his own I guess. We did not like Za-Zas at all. We really enjoyed Procacci  Gran Cafe San Marco.Miriam, Robert,  Gassim are all very nice hosts. The open air markets are fun  offer some good buys. Of course, the history  museums are fantastic. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1527,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1523}]}
