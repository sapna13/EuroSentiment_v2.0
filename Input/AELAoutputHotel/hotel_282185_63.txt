{"text":"Very Clean Well situated hotel just up from Opera area ( 10 min walk ) nearest metro is St Georges about a 3 min walk. Area is a safe and middle class one and there are plenty of places to eat and good local food shops in the area, selling fresh bread, meat, fruit etc. The Hotel...Firstly don't let the 2 star rating put you off, the rooms are not huge but perfectly adequate, they are cleaned every day and well kept. The bed linen is changed daily and is exceptionally clean, better than many 4 star hotels i have stayed in..Nice plump pillow on a decent fairly firm bed ensures a good night's sleep. The bathrooms are modern, clean and functional and towels, face cloths are changed daily. The road that the hotel is situated on is fairly quiet for a central area of Paris. The staff are friendly and helpful and all speak English, but best of all is the manager who went out of her way to assist me with many of my tourist type questions and terrible directional sense.If you are looking for a reasonably priced centrally located hotel with no frills BUT with high standards of cleanliness, then i would highly recommend this hotel. 2 recommendations, firstly get a buzzer entry phone system fitted on the door at night rather than allow anyone to walk in, secondly make sure the luggage room is kept locked at all times if guests are leaving their luggage there on the last day before picking up Julian ","annotations":[{"endOffset":251,"mention":"bread","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":246}]}
