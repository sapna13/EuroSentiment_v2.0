{"text":"Great Value Stayed at this hotel last October purely due to the reviews in here, and we were not at all disappointed. The hotel was well located with the train station right across the street. The hotel itself was very clean spacious and friendly. The manager let us have our room until 18.00hrs on the day of departure so we were able to get freshened up before our flights home.My husband and I very rarely use hotel facilities because we never stay in the hotel long enough to need them, but from what we saw and gathered from other guests they were extremely good. Due a slight mix up in checking in the hotel gave us some complimentary drinks which of course we didn't say no to.It was our first time in Hong Kong and although we are not big shoppers Nathan Road is a must, the bling on the markets and the haggling are 1st rate.We did a couple of excursions which we booked through the tourist information centre in Hong Kong and can definitely recommend the night cruise which takes in a trip over to the small fishing island, Victoria and the Harbour Light Show which was amazing, we also did the pink dolphin trip which was very good. Hong Kong is amazingly cheap and your √ä√£¬¢ will go a long way.We will definitely return to Hong Kong and probably stay on the main land next time, but Kowloon and the hotel in particular was very good, Love these reviews on trip advisor and never book anywhere until I have read the comments on here and I can safely say that the positive comments regarding this hotel are true ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1042,"mention":"Victoria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Victoria_Bitter"],"startOffset":1034}]}
