{"text":"Awesome week !! What an awesome vacation! I simply don't understand what all the petty reviewers have been complaining about ... if you are an easy going individual, have a great travel partner (a trip is really what you make of it anyways), and don't complain about absolutely everything that doesn't go right then you will have an amazing time. Some of the top complaints I read about before going on this trip which made me unncessarily nervous: the staff - all were very pleasant, i imagine some of the very pushy demanding guests were not happy with the service but they also probably don't tip or smile much ... the food - amazing selection... if you can only stomach burgers and fries, well, they have that for you as well, but if you want to try some amazing paella and have enormous selection at every meal then dont' worry about the food at all. Its true that you only receive 3 a la carte restaurant meals per week, but to be honest these were my least favorite meals they just serve you *so* much food that i feel terrible wasting it all, and much preferred the open selection of the buffet. If you are looking for gourmet fine dining then this resort is not for you. People also complained about having to walk too much .. you could stick to your own resort for the week and have nothing to worry about, or you could walk for 10-15 minutes and explore the other two, *or* you can catch the train that comes by and get escorted around. Why are people complaining about things being spread out? It makes it that much more interesting and exciting of a resort !! Exercise is good for you, people! I also read complaints about the european topless sunbathers. Anybody who complains about that needs a life. Considering the types of bathing suits most people were wearing, I think the topless sunbathers were least of your worries as far as the visuals go. I thought I would hate seeing topless women all over the place but if anything it made me even that much more comfortable on the beach knowing that nobody is looking, and nobody cares. It was actually refreshing seeing the female body not sexualized for once.Basically my boyfriend and I spent the week on the beach soaking up the sun, playing in the waves, and drinking from the never ending supply of booze at the beach. It was supposed to have rained all week but we didn't have more than 5 minutes of rain on one evening. The grounds are beautiful -- instead of staying in a typical massive hotel, its laid out in small villas spread widely over the grounds, its like walking through a small town every day, made things visually interesting as the grounds are filled with palm trees, flowers, shrubs, just gorgeous. Bars, pools, and restaurants are all spread about, nothing is more than a 5 minute walk from anything else. I can't say enough about how breathtaking the grounds were. My only complaints, if you want to call them that, are the pool and hte entertainment: the pool, as some said, is indeed dirty and mostly filled with kids who were likely peeing in there so I stayed away (the beach is far more beautiful anyways). The entertainment staff were far too pushy and used peer pressure too often to get people to unwillingly join the activities, and the contests\/games\/entertianment were really unentertaining so don't count on the nightly shows as anything more than something to do before bed\/the disco. Lastly, the one thing that really upset me was seeing the stray cats on the grounds ... they were sickly and skinny and hungry, it really broke my heart to see, as an animal lover, I wish something could be done about those!Aside from this, it was a week in paradise, I'm happy I went to this resort because it was just unbelievably gorgeous and perfect. Make sure to visit the Palladium Punta Cana and Palace resorts, they have gorgeous pools and different buffets to try out, the walk is worth it because its so lush and pretty. Also the couples massage on the beach for 100 dollars\/hour is worth it !! Enjoy !
