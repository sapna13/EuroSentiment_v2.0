{"text":"DONT GET THE HENNA All in all our stay was good. The grounds of the resort have already been described in numerous other reviews, and they have done a good job doing so.However, what I have to say is much more important, and can make a permanent difference in your life, so pay attention.While we were there, my daughter got a henna tattoo. Now it is scarring, and we found out that it was actually PPD, or 'black henna,' not real henna. There are numerous websites you can check out to see the awful effects of this substance. It scars your skin, and enters into your bloodstream, possibly causing liver or kidney damage, making you more prone to cancer in those areas.PLEASE DO NOT GET A HENNA TATTOO!The experience is awful. It normally takes up to three weeks to see the full effects of a reaction, which means that it won't be until after you get home that you notice there is a problem. An easy way to tell if it is real henna or not is to find out how long it takes for the dye to stain your skin, and how long the tattoo is expected to last. Real Henna takes in between 6 hours and 2 days to fully stain your skin, and it will be a brownish or a reddish color. Black Henna stains your skin in an hour or two, and lasts two weeks. So, when you ask the artist how long it is before you can wash the dye off, if he says an hour or two, get out of there quick! I have tried to contact the resort to let them know this sort of practice is not safe, or acceptable. It is unclear to me if the artist himself, a Yugoslavian man, knows it is unsafe or not. He seemed to think everything is fine.Please do not get a tattoo on this resort. I have checked online and found out that black henna is very very common in South and Central America, as well as throughout the Caribbean. Save yourself a massive amount of stress and worry and doctors appointments, and just avoid the tattoos altogether. Black Henna is actually banned in Canada, and vendors of it are able to be brought up on criminal charges. That is how serious the danger is.Please Please Please, stay safe in the caribbean. Most of the people we travelled with had ear aches, swimmer's ear, and we thought that was kind of unfortunate. Imagine our surprise when we found out my 11 year old daughter was going to have scars on her ankles that may never go away.Please be careful.
