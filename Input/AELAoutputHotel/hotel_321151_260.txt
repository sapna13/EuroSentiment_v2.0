{"text":"Count me as a regular! From the moment we pulled up in a cab our experience was top notch. Even though thier computers went down our check in was a breeze. At check in they said they were out of non smoking rooms but were able to find one for me.The room was sparkling clean. Beds turned down with music playing on the cd player and ice in the bucket. The Aveda bath products were a nice touch. The rooms are beautiful and comfortable.The room was very quiet. I was sure we were the only ones checked in except for an occasional Red Sox fan in the elevator.The bar Cuff's is quite a happening place with lines forming outside at night. This is my only negative. The night we checked in we went for a cold one and a late snack. The service was very good. The next night we met friends there and our waitress was non existent, at least at our table. She spent her whole time catering to a table full of young guys. I had to ask another waitress to order some appetizers, and I also went to the bar to get our beers. It was crowded but she serviced the guys table which was right next to ours three times.The next night we went to the lounge on the second floor. It's very comfortable with sofas and tables and quiet enough to catch up with old friends. The woman working the bar was outstanding. She appeared at our table every time a friend joined our group. Each had a cocktail within minutes of entering. She should give a customer service lesson to the waitress downstairs.Everyone of the staff (except as noted) was exceptional. Don't hesitate to book here. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":387,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":383}]}
