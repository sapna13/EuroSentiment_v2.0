{"text":"I am very cynical Yes, I was very skeptical after having read what seemed to be too many positive reviews of a little three star hotel in Amsterdam. I mean really, I thought, how great can this place REALLY be? Just so you know my experience and so this review can be placed in context, I have stayed in three star hotels all over europe, so I know exactly how three star quality and service can vary greatly. I will say that my experience at this hotel was excellent. A friend and I stayed in Room 8 December 13th through the 17th. The day I arrived there was some trouble connecting my computer to the wireless internet, so Erik ran up the stairs to correct the problem. After he left, it occurred again, so once again he cheerfully ran up the stairs and corrected the problem again. He then went downstairs, and 5 minutes later called up and asked if I would like some tea. He again cheerfully brought up an entire tea tray for me as I awaited the arrival of my colleague. (yes, the wireless internet ended up working for me quite satisfactorily) This is the way that guests are treated here. I found Gunter and Pierre to be similarly helpful with questions, and very kind and friendly in general. All in all these gentlemen are extremely professional in the way they run this hotel, and they clearly take a lot of personal pride in how they run the hotel. This is without a doubt one of the more pleasant experiences I have had in a three star hotel.
