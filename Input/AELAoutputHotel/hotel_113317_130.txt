{"text":"Perfect We stayed here for 6 nights and thought it the perfect base for exploring New York. Located right next to Times Square it is well placed for the point at which many subway lines intersect, and several other sights are within walking distance (e.g. Rockefeller Centre, Empire State Building, Trump Tower, departure pier for Circle Line cruises). The CitySights and Grayline bus tours also begin from here, which makes it good for getting a seat!All the staff were always very friendly and helpful, and Rick's cafe was lovely. The breakfast, drinks and snacks were of a high quality, even though they were free (the orange juice was freshly-squeezed). It was great to be able to get tea, coffee and iced-tea throughout the day, and the computer with free internet access and printer was very useful.After reading reviews we expected the room to be tiny but it was perfectly adequate in size......maybe small by American standards, but to us (English) it was fine! The bathroom was also an adequate size and was immaculately clean. Even the grouting around the shower was spotless, which I think indicates meticulous cleaning standards. The room was similarly spotless and the sheets and bed covers were even changed in the middle of our stay. There was free mineral water in the room on arrival, and once again a few days later. The bed was very comfortable and clean. The TV was large and there is a good selection of DVDs which you can borrow from the reception.For the price, the location, the excellent rooms and the friendly service, we felt this was an exceptional hotel and wouldn't dream of staying anywhere else if we return to New York. However, it may be useful for other travellers to be aware of the following:- even though our room was not right at the front of the hotel, we still got noise from outside (mainly sirens). I think this is because of the air-conditioning unit which was situated in the window, making it impossible to sound-proof. - the air-conditioning unit itself, whilst very efficient, made a noise like a small jet engine! It was impossible to sleep with it on, but the room became unbearably stuffy without it. There was a ceiling fan, but this was rather ineffectual, and also intermittently made clicking sounds on the maximum setting......again, making it difficult to sleep!- if you have inconsiderate fellow guests who make a noise in the corridors late at night, you will be disturbed as sound travels easily into the rooms. This fortunately was only a problem for the first night of our stay.- the rooms all have minibars, but unfortunately they operate by sensing the removal of any bottles and automatically adding it to your bill. We still removed things to put in our own drinks, but had to have everything taken off the bill when we left. They had no problem with this, but be aware it will lengthen the check-out process.- the only disappointment with regard to the advice we had from the staff was that when we left one of them tried to convince us to hire a car service to take us to the airport rather than have a taxi. This would have cost $88 instead of $50, and his reason was that the car would be more likely to get us there on time. I could not see how a car would have fewer problems with traffic than would a taxi, and taxis passed the door to the hotel all the time so getting one is unlikely to be a problem. To be fair, when we rejected the idea he did a great job of hailing a taxi for us, which actually got us there in good time despite heavy traffic.- some people have recommended the Brooklyn diner next door, however we did not particularly enjoy our meal there. It was a bizarre combination of pasta in a vanilla and cinnamon custard with beef casserole (in one dish), and the portions were less generous than other places. - Tony's (the Italian next door) was generally good and had a lovely atmosphere. However, avoid the spaghetti with meatballs, the meatballs were not good! We couldn't eat ours and noticed other diners also leaving them.- the staff recommended another Italian restaurant (I think it was called Tramonti) which was within walking distance and was excellent. The lasagne was superb!
