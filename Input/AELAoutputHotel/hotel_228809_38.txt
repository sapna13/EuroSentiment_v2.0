{"text":"Pretty Good, We were Happy. Our family of four; with one 15 year old daughter and one 11 year old daughter stayed for two nights. Of course rooms were small [Paris, city typical]. We had suite #411, 4th floor which consisted of two rooms and bathroom. The first living room was small and when couch folded out to bed it took up whole room, and bathroom was directly off this room, so noise could be heard from bathroom to people sleeping here. Also, hotel has hard wired LAN connection in room and wireless in lobby. So I could not get up early to surf internet\/ do work as small desk where LAN was located was on side of daughters bed. Had to go to lobby. Breakfast was 12 euros extra, but McDonalds 50 meters away... but McDonalds does not open until 7:30 AM which is really 7:45 AM as workers move slowly here. To sum up room, although not spacious, it was clean and modern. The bathroom was modern. This is what we really wanted and we got- clean and modern. Yes the elevator only fits one person, so use the stairs. The biggest bonus is location! We were very happy with location. When I booked, I thought I would have to take my family to Latin quarter to show off cafe's, patisseries, and French street character... but no, the neighborhoods around Magda are great. One block from Arc-de-Triumph and can catch Metro anywhere from here. But one block in the other direction are trendy streets with cafe's and shops. My 15 year old was in and out of all, looking for a certain type of gladiator sandal that she saw all the girls wearing.For two nights, avoiding the big brand name hotels, this boutique hotel was just fine. Again, clean and modernized which we think are most important. ","annotations":[]}
