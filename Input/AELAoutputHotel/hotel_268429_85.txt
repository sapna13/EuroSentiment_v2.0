{"text":"Pleasantly surprised After doing weeks and weeks of seaching for a hotel in San Juan, my girlfriend and I picked the Coral Princess Inn.Hotel: We stayed on the first floor. The hotel is very clean, and has a great atmosphere. We had a Queen sized bed in our room, and found that there was ample space for our 2 suitcases. You get a small wardrobe which was very handy. There's also a small fridge. The bathroom isn't large, but nor is it cramped. Breakfast was great, and we had many items to pick from. It was cheaper for us to book directly through the hotel.Staff: Very friendly and helpful. Customer service was excellent. Can't ask for much more.Location: About 2 blocks from the beach, and there are many great restaurants nearby. They aren't cheap, but perfect for a nice dinner. There is also a nearby Walgreens which was very convenient. We only took walks on the beach at night, so I have no idea how nice Condado beach is. The hotel property is also easily accessible from the highway. Watch out for rush-hour San Juan traffic. Here's a hint: Go to east (Fajardo, etc) during the weekday. Save going west for weekends. We found that to work very well for us.Parking: We had a rental car all 4 days of our trip. There are 3 spots infront of the hotel, and only 1 night we were lucky enough to get it. Otherwise, we parked at a nearby parking lot down the street for $10 a day. It's steep, but expected.Overall: It's great that this hotel isn't a large hotel with bustling with tourists. We loved how at home you feel once you've setteled in. Very unique, and I would definitely be a return visitor.
