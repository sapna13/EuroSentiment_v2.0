{"text":"Great location, great staff We stayed at the Hotel Rex for 4 nights at the beginning of July 2006. We had a Deluxe King room which was a decent size with an enourmous bed taking up most of it! There was plenty of room however and it was very comfortable - the bathroom as a good size and very clean and well equipped.The decor of the hotel is fairly old world and characterful, this is not a faceless chain hotel and is all the better for it. The decor is very dark however and the room itself had a very small window and could have done with better lighting in general. This wasn't a massive problem but worth noting. The room was very cosy and homely.The staff were excellent - very friendly and knowledgeable about their city, they helped us book all the tours we wished to go on - a word of warning: if you wish to go on the boat trip to Alcatraz (which you should do it's amazing!) book early as it gets full very quickly - the staff were very helpful with this matter. One of the best things about the hotel we found was the study room which contains several computer terminals with free internet access 24 hours a day. Totally invaluable for booking trips and tickets during our stay.Overall the Hotel Rex is an excellent hotel located perfectly for Union Square - right in the heart with easy access to everything you could want. My one disappointment was the cleanliness of the room was not quite up to scratch - it was adequate, but a bit dusty.We would probably return to Hotel Rex on a second visit to San Francisco.
