{"text":"Wonderful Stay I was very concerned about staying at Hilton Caribe after reading many of the posting on this site. Because of this our expectations were so low. We were there from Dec 19 - 24th and we had a wonderful time. The resort facilities were clean. The service was crisp and friendly. The staff we encountered was courteous and professional. The only glitch we had was with our initial room which was a handicapped equipped one with shower. I went back to the main desk and politely asked if we could be moved. We were immediately moved to an ocean front room in the Hilton Towers on the 13th floor with amazing views. The private beach was great and with plenty of chairs and umbrellas and towel services. The pools were very nice. The exercise room we used every day and was one of the better equipped hotel ones I have used. In terms of pricing, it is true the resort is pricey. Internet is $15 if you want it in your room, but free in the lobby. We also stayed away from the restaurants and bar by having breakfast at the Subway (which was much better than the ones in the US. The omeletes were made fresh in front of you.). We ordered carry out Cuban sandwiches and Medallia beers at the local liquor store. The Cuban sandwiches were amazingly good. The liquor store is right across the street and perhaps looks a little seedy on the outside, but it is a family run business. We saw many locals and police eating there. There were the best Cuban sandwiches we ever had. The beer was $1.50 a can and we stocked them in our refrigerator in our room. And, for dinner, we took the bus to Old San Juan. The bus stop is about 3 blocks away and costs 50 cent. We never waited more than 5 minutes for a bus. We took it both ways. We have lived in Chicago and this bus was clean and the people riding it were working class people, students, and locals. It was great. Old San Juan was a delight. We thought the location was terrific for us and my wife said she wanted to stay there again next year.
