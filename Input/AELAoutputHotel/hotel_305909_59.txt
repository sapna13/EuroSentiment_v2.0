{"text":"Good Spacious Hotel shame about the logistics I stated at the hotel over the christmas vacation 2007. It was what could be expected and nothing to add to what the other reviewers have commented upon. However, I have stayed in several hotels in Hong Kong\/ Kowloon and hasten to add i did not like the location\/logisitcs of the hotel. The hotel is almost located on top of a hill - to get to Mong Kok downtown you have to get out of the hotel you could either go through the main entrance, presumable take the escalator and take a 15 minute walk to the nearest metro or what i did and had no alternative to do was to go through one of the hotel's side doors which leads to a shopping mall full of people then you have to cross Mong Kok East Station, get on a covered walkway and then after 15 minutes ( with young children or elderly in tow) you find yourself on the main high street. I found this was not good practice when returning to the hotel at 2 or 3 in the morning after seeing friends as the walkway was very deserted and the thought of having to cross a deserted shopping mall at night to get to the hotel was a bore and chore in itself. Another thing, the side entrances are shut at 1am so you have to go on a hike to get to the main entrance which is a bit of a pain, some guests have strayed into the multi storey carpark as a result of the poor logistics. I will not be staying at the Royal Plaza again purely for this disadvantage otherwise if you do not mind the walk, do not mind returning to the hotel early, do not mind the treipze through a busy shopping mall to get downtown then this is your hotel!
