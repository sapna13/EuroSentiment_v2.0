{"text":"Fantastic Experience-don't let these bad reviews ruin your vacation! First of all, lets just say that San Juan is beautiful! My boyfriend and I just got back from a weeks stay at the Condado. I had been reading all of these reviews up unitl my trip and was becoming more and more concerned that this hotel was going to be just awful and dissapointing. This just goes to show that you can not believe everything you read. Yes, the Condado hotel along with the Condado area is all under construction-but you are very rarely affected by this. We had booked the bahia vista (lagoon view) room and right now they are doing construction on the Ocean tower so we did not hear any noise or get disturbed. When I entered my room, I wasn't exactly pleased-the room was small and not what I expected, but we called the front desk and they nicely upgraded us to a city vista sweet on the top floor for no extra charge. This was spacious andc loveley-no complaints.  We did eat once in the hotel and the food does suck-there are so many restaurants down the street and in old san juan that are much better and not at all inconvienent to get to. The pools at the Condado are wonderful and the grounds are breathtaking. The pool bar actually makes the best frozen drinks that I had In San Juan. They have a great fitnes room if you like to workout and a really nice steam and sauna room which is usually very private. The concierge was always helpful with answering our questions about buses, restaurants, and activities. Vacation is what you make of it-if you want to complain then you will surely find things about the Condado Hotel to complain about, but if you relax and enjoy what is offered I'm sure you will be pleased. If there is a problem just ask them nicely to fix it-i'm sure they will try to accomodate you! I would go back-the location is great! ","annotations":[]}
