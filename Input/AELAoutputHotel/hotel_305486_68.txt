{"text":"A nice surprise, good value for money Check in Experience - Excellent.We arrived at the hotel at about 7:30am after a sleepless flight from Australia. We were worried about not being able to access our booked room until 2:00pm; without us even asking, the very polite lady at check-in told us that a room was available to us immediately. Yay! She also said we could use the free breakfast facilities (see below) that I didn't expect would be available to us until the next morning (our first official morning).The room was also a pleasant surprise. We upgraded to the Executive floors when booking. This entitled us to a renovated room; access to the Executive Lounge on the 18th floor at any time, which included free Internet, free continental breakfast, and free cocktails from 6 - 8pm each evening.The service from the staff in the Executive Lounge has been excellent.The room itself is on the small side of hotel rooms, but is clean, and recently renovated. The bed is very comfortable, and HUGE. Curtains are thick and block out the sun. Room service each day has been excellent, including some free snacks they left one day in the middle of our stay.We were worried initially about the location of the hotel, as we drove through the old shophouses of Arab Street in the cab on the way from the airport. But in fact, the location has been excellent. Bugis MRT is one block (a hospital!) away, and the transport in Singapore has proved to be excellent as promised. There are several restaurants nearby. Arab Street and all of its silk shops are literally on the next block. Cabs are cheap. There is also a major shopping centre at Bugis.We have a midnight flight out of Singapore tomorrow, and the hotel has extended our checkout time to 2pm. If we want to stay until 6pm, it will cost us only $60. At 6pm, we can then come to the Executive Lounge and have free cocktails until we need to leave for the airport!We found that the Golden Landmark is great value for money (you sacrifice staying in one of the trendier locations, such as Orchard Road, for a nice room at a cheaper rate; however, the location and price of the MRT makes that all fine, and everywhere is accessible and close) and would stay there again.
