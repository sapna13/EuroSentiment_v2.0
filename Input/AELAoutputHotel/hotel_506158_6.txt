{"text":"Great find in Barcelona We stayed in this hotel prior to our tour of Spain based on the reviews it had received on multiple web sites and travel magazines. The building is the former headquarters of a import\/export (tobacco?) corporation and actually looks like a former bank that's been extensively renovated into a chic boutique hotel. It's location on the Ramblas is very convenient and is across the street from the Meridien. You can actually see the Meridien from the lobby which is decorated much like a gentlemen's private\/yacht club i.e., dark wood, model sailboats, black and white photos, and club furniture. Service is quite professional and efficient since many business persons use this place. The rooms are quite spacious, especially the corner units, and decorated with Pottery Barn\/Crate and Barrel type furniture. The bathrooms are very comfortable with granite\/stone tiles, large tubs and showers, and good quality soaps\/shampoo. Although we didn't have a chance to use it there is a spa and pool which appears to be quite nice on the web site of the hotel. If you want something light the tapas restaurant in the hotel is great--much less olive oily than the traditional fare found in many restaurants. And, for those who can't do without Starbucks, there is a branch in the hotel itself where you can get a reasonably priced coffee and baked goods for breakfast. This place is actually much nicer, larger, and cheaper than the Meridien where we also stayed during the trip--don't bother with the bigger name hotel, this is the place to stay!
