{"text":"Beautiful resort but... My wife  I just returned from a 1 week stay at the Bahia Principe from March 12-19\/2007 through Air Canada Vacations. We met up with 2 other couples that arrived earlier.I was told that about 5000 people were staying at the resort over the March break. Unfortunately, we had little option due to work constraints. However, the resort had about 2000 staff working. Suffice it to say, the resort was a little busier then I would have liked. But considering the number of guests I really don't have a complaint regarding the staff.Like many others before me, I read review upon review trying to get a grasp on what to expect during my vacation. On to the useful information....Airport - you will need a $10 tourist card upon arrival  have to pay $20(cash) upon departure- if you are over-weight upon return say you will be paying with a credit card  they will waive the charge- the porters are aggressive but avoidable so long as you quickly grab your own luggage for the 30 second walk to your shuttle bus- the food is VERY expensive, a small meal at Wendy's cost $18US- DO NOT wait to buy your alcohol at Duty Free, I found the prices to be at least 3 times the amount of the resort- if you are looking for real cigars, they sell them at the duty free (terminal 2) for a reasonable priceResort staff- the staff was GREAT, they are dramatically underpaid with most coming from Santa Domingo(over 300 miles away)- they work 12 days on, 3 days off, 14-16 hour days for $2US- bring lots of $1 bills as they really deserve  appreciate a little bit extra- we left our maid $2\/day as well as a little something daily that we purchased at home from Dollarama- special mention goes out to Kasandra(Animation Team), John(Beach Bar, etc), I love you 20 times!!!, Juan(Swim-up Pool Bar)  Juana(Cocktail Waitress in Lounge)- all of them made out trip very enjoyableFood- book your a la carte reservations ASAP- we booked at Mikado(Japanese), the Garden Grill(Steakhouse)  Le Gourmet(French)- all were excellent  highly recommended, however, the Japanese was a little rushed- we were able to slip in for 2 extra a la carte reservations just by showing up at the restaurant  requesting to be seating- we left $5 after each meal which seemed to be the norm during our stay- the buffet was fresh during our 2 visits- we ate breakfast at Los Olas  lunch at the Snack Bar- you will find that you get into a daily routineAlcohol- plentiful, be sure to ask if you do not want the bar selections- eg, if you like Gin order Tanqueray or Beefeater with your drink, Gordon's was considered a premium Gin down here with an up charge\/drink...confused- be sure to check the lists provided- bring an insulated mug for the beach, the 52oz BUBBA comes highly recommendedBeach\/Principe Village Vendors- they will start very high but eventually come down- a box of fake Monte Cristo's started at $175US  sold between $20-25US, real tobacco though!!!- necklaces started at around $25US  sold between $4-5US- bring stuff to barter with from home- the oil painting are not real, they are water\/acrylic based with a laquer on top, also they are mass produced so pay accordinglyRooms- we stayed in Villa 6 on the Punta Cana side- 3rd floor with a King sized bed- very clean- close to the beach  pool- purchased a safe rental upon arrival for valuables  would recommend the sameEntertainment- usually ended around 10:30pm- Michael Jackson show  Circus were mildly entertainingBeach\/Ocean\/Pools- breathtaking- unfortuantely, in order to get a prime Palapa(shade umbrella) we had to get up  reserve it around 6:00AM- unlike many others who were no where to be seen all day, we arrived shortly after breakfast  stayed until 5:00pmAll in all, it was a great vacation. I must say though, great for families, not a romantic getaway.
