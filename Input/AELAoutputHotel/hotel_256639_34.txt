{"text":"A little stuffy..... This is a very traditional hotel, with rather formal public rooms and a very stuffy bar, which really wasn't inviting at all. The decor was rather tired in places. Having said that, the bedrooms were very comfortable, with really large beds and it was all very clean.Although it is in a very central location, it isn't close enough or high enough to have decent views of the harbour or opera house, which is a great shame. However, it is only about 4 minutes walk to the opera house from the hotel, and only slightly longer to some great restaurants. They were extremely accommodating about an early check-in. We arrived at the hotel at around 08.00 from an overnight flight, and were offered access to the leisure facilities to shower and change, while they promised to prioritise our room. By the time we had finished, they came to tell us that our room was ready.Although we didn't use the gym facilities ourselves, we did see them first-hand, and thought they were very small and inadequate, both in terms of the equipment and the showers\/changing rooms. Two people would have been a crowd!Although tea and coffee making facilities are provided in-room, the milk was in the fridge and charged as being part of the mini-bar. We came across this elsewhere in our travels in Australia, and it seemed annoyingly penny-pinching. As it was also long-life milk and therefore not that nice, we simply asked housekeeping to provide a jug of fresh milk. This they did, but with some reluctance.The overall experience was fine, but it was far from the best hotel we stayed in along the way.
