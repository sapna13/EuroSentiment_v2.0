{"text":"Best hotel I have ever stayed in I have to say this is the only 5 star hotel I have stayed in so I don't exactly speak from a wealth of experience, but I found the hotel to be amazingly well-equipped and well presented without being ostentatious. The staff were very attentive but not overly-so.We stayed here for our honeymoon and because the staff knew this we were given a room with a better (i.e. harbour) view and a bottle of champagne on arrival, which was a nice touch. The rooms are just amazing, and they really do give you everything you can think of, right down to the shoe-shine kit and complementary umbrella! The bed was fantastic; enormous and wonderfully comfortable. I have never slept so well.I didn't use the spa, it sounded great but was very expensive. I also didn't use the gym, though it looked to be very well-equipped and you can go on the machines while watching the sun go down across the city! The rooftop pool was very nice, and there were never more than 3 people in there when we used it. The hot tub on the roof was far too hot in my opinion! The changing rooms were excellent, with a ready supply of towels and they provide lots of useful toiletries, even deodorant, hairspray and mouthwash! They also provide combs and brushes, with a steriliser machine to keep them clean, so you really don't need to bring anything down with you when you visit. There is a sauna and steam room in both the men's and women's changing areas.One of the best things about the hotel is the amazing location. Mong Kok is the 'real' Hong Kong, with street markest, little cafes and loads and loads of shops. We were so glad we stayed here rather than on HK Island which seemed to us to be very unreal and glossy. We didn't eat in the hotel at all, as it was expensive and far too western (i.e. the signature breakfast is a Full English!). We ate Dim Sum at The London Restaurant on Nathan Road (I will do a separate review of this - head out of the hotel at street level, left on Shanghai, right on Argyle and cross over Nathan Rd and turn right, it is a couple of hundred metres along here on the left hand side). This is the most fabulous dining experience and we had brunch here every day as it was so good. There are a million diner-style eateries in the vicinity of the hotel, as there is a big eating-out culture here. They are mainly un-licensed so no beer with your noodles, you pretty much have to head to hotel restaurants if you want alcohol. You can easily get main course, rice and soft drinks for two people for around √ä√£¬¢7 in these street-side cafes. The Langham Place mall also has a large number of restaurants which are a little more expensive, but also a bit more civilised!As the MTR station is downstairs in the mall basement, it is very convenient when the weather is very hot, or it is chucking it down with rain, as you don't have to go outdoors to get there (however it is probably quicker if you do go out of the hotel at ground level and use the Argyle Street entrance to Mong Kok station, as gettting into the station via the mall involves a lot of standing around on very slow escalators)I could go on all day! I am SO glad we picked this hotel for our honeymoon and would thoroughly recommend it to anyone.
