{"text":"The right attitude. Hmmmm, I have used trip Advisor for many, many trips with my family in the United States and abroad and we tend to agree with the opinions of fellow travelers. I quite honestly have never written in on our own opinions following a trip. But.... I was quite taken aback by a few recent entries on the Bravo Beach hotel in Vieques. We have stayed at the Bravo as well as several other inns on the island over the past few years. Let me begin by saying that although we are normally five star hotel patrons, we appreciate and love the atmosphere on Vieques.. If you are looking for five star service and 400 count sheets head to St. Barts, which we also appreciate and enjoy.. although for different reasons.Vieques is a very special island. We first visited about twelve years ago because we had read that it was the last bastion of the true carribbean;. that description still exists. It is the kind of place that your Inn, including The Bravo will pack you a picnic lunch, after a lovely breakfast overlooking the ocean, and send you on your way to one of the amazing beaches with towels, an umbrella, beach chairs and several bottles of wine. Where else can you be on a palm covered beach with crystal clear water, white sand and not a hotel in sight, not to mention a person. Bravo is a Miami beach, spare, modern, trendy and smart hotel. We found our room to be spare in a very current way with beautiful views of the ocean. Yes, the pool on the ocean is open to the restaurant, but we had wonderful cocktails in the pool at sunset. There is another pool in the garden that we have frequented later at night. The food has always been some of the best on the Island, and supprisingly there are many good restaurants on the island. It is an Ecotourism destination. If you want gambling, disco's, etc. this is the wrong place, On the other hand if you want bioluminescent bays, beautiful solitary beaches, warm people, and dancing with the natives by the carribbean in Esperanza this is the place for you.
