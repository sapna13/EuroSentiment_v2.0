{"text":"Great hotel for all travelers I arrived in honolulu after an 8 hour flight from sydney so i was a bit out of it. Me, my parents and my girlfriend wanted to go on a holiday to hawaii. we chose the outrigger because it looked good on the internet and seemed like that there would be plenty to do around. We got our transfer to the hotel and as soon as we walked in we were greeted, escorted to the table to check in. we had originally booked a city view room. Without even asking we were upgraded to a full ocean view room which was spectacular. The hotel was amazing, the beach was unbelievable. there were 3 restaurants located in the hotel and a coffee shop as well as boutiques, souvineers and clothing stores in the lower lobby. The people were friendly and made us feel welcome. Honolulu is a really busy place and very on the go so if you haven't been there before don't expect it to be too relaxing. THe outrigger was a fantastic stay. The rooms were rather small but we had expected. The bathroom had a seperate toilet which was good considering we had four people in the room which meant the bathroom wasn't always locked. there was also a big storage area for luggage which we needed with all the suitcases. for us as a family it was great and i would imagine a honeymoon would be even better keeping in mind that this didn't seem to be a resort more so a hotel.
