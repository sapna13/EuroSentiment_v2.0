{"text":"Superb hotel - great hospitality Just back from a 4 night stay in the Hotel Zandbergen. This is a superb hotel. We could not find fault with it. Our double room was of adequate size (bigger than some rooms we've stayed in in the UK) and spotlessly clean. It had a minibar \/ fridge and we requested tea making facilities which were supplied free of charge. The bathroom was also in immaculate condition.The continental breakfast was more than adequate. Cereals, rolls, croissants, ham, cheese and boiled eggs were all on offer, along with tea, coffee and toast.The staff were very hospitable and always willing to help. The manager, Henk, is a gentleman.The hotel also provides free internet access in the lobby, and free wireless internet access through out the hotel. We were on the 2nd floor at the back of the hotel and still got a decent signal.The stairs are steep, but this is the case with alot of hotels in Amsterdam given the architecture of the buildings.The hotel is located close to the Vonelpark which provides a beautiful walking route into the centre of the city. We walked to all the main attractions, e.g. Liedesplein - 20 mins, Central Station - 40 mins. There is also a tram stop 50m from the hotel for the no. 2 tram which goes to Central Station via the city centre.The hotel is also easily got to from Schipol airport being one of the hotels serviced by the Connexxion Airport Shuttle. Excellent value at 19.5 Euro return.This was our first visit to Amsterdam and we had spent alot of time searching for a hotel. We won't need to spend any time searching when we return again.I would wholeheartedly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Amsterdam. You will not be disappointed.
