{"text":"I will not be back... passed three nights in the Catalonia Aragon with my wife in the beggining of June. I sent an email for the hotel asking prices but not receive any answer.A day before leavong, I call directly to the hotel and receive the price of the stay. As soon as I arrive to the Hotel, I was informed that the value that me envoys by email (still expecting the answer..) was lower then the one gave by phone. The price was 93 √à√\u2020√ü?by night. In the check out the price was the double and if it wasn√à?√¨t the fact that I had written the correct price I would have to pay the double. The hotel in itself is nothing of special. Of early morning, we were awake with beaten fortresses in the doors in other levels and people walking in the correddors and there were many teenagers that at night did a lot noise. The elevators did not function correctly and the doorman that was on the door did not know to give any usefull information to you . The breakfast was the more razoavel of our stay. The hotel is not properly well located for who is going to be nearby the center. In the exit I asked the price of a taxi for the airport and informed myself that was more or less 40 √à√\u2020√ü?and called a taxi. I opted for go in a taxi that passed in the street and led myself only 20 √à√\u2020√ü? The persons of the staff are unpleasant and do not have a lot will in collaborate with . Finally, it is a hotel for which I am not going to come back. ","annotations":[]}
