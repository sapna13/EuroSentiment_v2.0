{"text":"Wouldn't Stay Here Again OK, I know I did not pay to stay at a Luxury hotel, but I thought at least I would get a friendly and clean hotel. I checked in minutes after walking in from the Powell St. BART station - I initially thought what a great location. But this hotel is literally on Skid Row. Bums on the corner, bums at the hotel entrance and bums surrounding the side entrance parking lot. I was staying by myself and did not feel safe.I was allowed to check in a little early, so that was nice. I went up to my room - it was small and a little musty smelling (no air conditioning or ventilation without opening the window, which I didn't want to do because it overlooked the streetside with bums. Here are the things I didn't like about the hotel:-didn't get a wake up call that I scheduled the night before.-no obvious bell service at the door - I'm a single traveler struggling with bags while two service people (front desk person and uniformed person) stand at the front desk watch me struggle-carpet stains-older boutique style hotel with not enough outlets to accommodate phone charger, laptop charger, etc.-magnetic keycards that don't work - I had to change these 3 times-printer in the business office that didn't work-iron was cheap, didn't work and water spilled out of the reservoir onto my clothes-I could smell cigarette smoke from outside my bathroom window-noisy (street noise, elevator noise, etc.)-wouldn't allow 1 hour late check out-they said they would call for a taxi but after 20 min of waiting and being approached by bums, I just walked up to a more busy street.On a good note:-pillows were nice (although outside bedding was somewhat skanky)-bathroom was functional (good shower pressure, hot water, etc.)-in-room refridgerator-flat screen TV on wall ","annotations":[]}
