{"text":"A Beautiful View of the arno River With a million euro view overlooking the Arno River the Hotel Lungarno is a not to be missed Boutique Hotel in Florence.With approximately 80 rooms the hotel has the charm of a small hotel but with the big hotel amenities....such as breakfast dining included.......a nice lounge for cocktails.......a small outside area to have a drink overlooking the arno river.Just footsteps from Ponte Vecchio and just a brisk walk to Duomo it is a hotel that is within walking distance to shopping and some very fine dining (where the locals eat)you can spend your day roaming the streets of Florence or take the local train to Pisa (about 45 minutes) and enjoy that wonderful leaning tower.We journeyed on to Lucca from Pisa but it was not worth the time or effort........skip Lucca ........go to Sienna instead.........Taking the local train back to Florence (Trenitalia) I suggest you do it before dark..the riders become a little dicey after the sun goes down.....you can get all your tickets at Santa Novella train Station but be sure you validate your tickets on the platform.........Ask the hotel they can explain it to you...........The euro being up and the dollar being so down it is hard to find any great bargins..........we did a lot of window shopping....as did most other tourists we noticed.........Driving anywhere in Italy is not recomended as it is like watching a race with cars going in all different directions........anyway it is safe to walk in the city ...........lots of great pictures to be taken so be sure to stock up on memory cards.
