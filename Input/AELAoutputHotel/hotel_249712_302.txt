{"text":"Fabulous Room I took my daughter to New York for her 18th birthday. We stayed at this hotel from 28th June to 1st July 2007 and upgraded to a club twin. The upgrade was well worth the extra as it included a lovely continental style breakfast and we were able to get drinks and snacks in a hurry after a busy day sightseeing and shopping and with little time to spare to find a restaurant before going to the theatre. The evening snacks were a perfectly adequate light meal. The upgrade also included free use of the gym but we ran out of time to make use of the facilities so can't comment about the gym. The room itself was very spacious - we had two double beds, which were the most confortable beds we have ever slept on, and plenty of space to move around. There was a wide screen television and a computer. The advertised free internet connection is only free if you take your own laptop - if you want to use the computer in the room to get on the internet there is a charge of $14.95 for 24 hours or $7.95 for 30 minutes. The bathroom was also spacious and despite what other reviewers say there was adequate room beside the basin for toiletries and there was also a 3 tier trolley on which you could put sponge bags, hairdrier etc. There was only one bathrobe but we called housekeeping and a second one was brought within about ten minutes. The bath was quite shallow but the double headed shower was lovely although not particularly powerful. Some guests must walk into their rooms looking for things to complain about, but I cannot honestly think of anything worth complaining about. We loved this hotel, it was spacious, comfortable and clean and ideally located for the theatres. We highly recommend it and would definately stay here again.
