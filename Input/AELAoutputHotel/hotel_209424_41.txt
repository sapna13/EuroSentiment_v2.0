{"text":"An older property, but still beautiful inside - great value! We had a short vacation in Hawaii and after researching many hotels via Expedia, we chose the Ilikai as it was the most reasonably priced for having great views and being a five minute walk to the beach.a) Property is old from the outside, the turquoise color can go, but it looks very 70's. At one time, this was Waikiki's very first high-rise, but sadly, there are many new hotels around that physically outshine the Ilikai with their modernity. But don't judge this hotel by the way it looks.b) Front desk staff was nice...nothing outstanding, but service was quick and they were accomodating. Only snafu was that we paid via Expedia and wanted to upgrade when we arrived to a full kitchen (Expedia doesn't give a choice for this). They wouldn't accept the credit card that we planned to use for these expenses because it was in my maiden name and I updated my ID. c) I highly suggest using the Expedia concierge desk. Michael H. was very helpful in letting us know about local attractions, restaurants, etc...and they book right there.d) Getting out of the cab ($35 cab ride from airport, about 30 mins), we were impressed. The staff greeted us, the waterfalls\/landscaping is quite nice, and there was an escalator to take us to the lobby. e) Elevators were slow and signs noted that they were being updated. I took the advice of a reviewer here and we used the bather's elevator most of the time - much faster. At times, the elevators were a bit ridiculous, many people waiting, stops on random floors, etc. But we just chuckled most of the time. We were on vacation and weren't going to stress about that.f) Thanksgiving night, the upscale restaurant on the top floor, Sarento's, had a lovely turkey\/dressing dinner which was fabulous. Lovely views. The elevator going to the 30th floor is all window, great views yet again. Crab cakes we had as appetizer were fabulous.g) Ground were beautiful. Each night, the lanterns were lit along the courtyard, seemingly, by shirtless\/shoeless young men in Hawaiian garb. It was cute. Friday nights, singers\/dancers perform in the courtyard. Not too much activity going on since the other restaurants were closed, but it's just beautiful to see the courtyard from our room or sit in chairs and overlook the marina\/ocean.h) Our room wasn't fancy, but just fine for what we needed. NIce showerhead, convenient kitchen, great view of the courtyard\/marina\/city\/ocean. Most nights, we left the sliding door to the balcony open and let the cool breezes in. Kitchen wasn't super clean - microwave was filthy. We didn't use it. i) Many people complained about the lack of the restaurants in the hotel being closed - we were disapointed, but there were a few shops in the hotel including a general store (prices marked WAY up, box of Wal Mart Raisin bran was $6.99, so only if you REALLY need something. But Walgreens was a $7 cab ride away, so evened out). The HiIlton Hawaiian Village was a two minute walk next door and they have MANY shops and restaurants. I was very satisfied with this...only downer was that there was no room service. We would have liked to have had breakfast delivered to our room to eat on the balcony, but that's what the raisin bran was for!Overall, we had a good time and are pretty laid back, so we were very satisfied with the Ilikai and I would stay there again. It's a great value for being so close to the beach. There is renovation going on next door - we didn't her anything, but that made our walk to the beach longer - we couldn't cut through the lagoon they are building w\/the Hilton - so instead of 2 minutes, five minutes to the main beach. No big deal.
