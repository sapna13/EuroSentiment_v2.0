{"text":"Things Changed a bit since last visit Hola ! Visited this resort for two weeks Feb. 24 to march 10 . This was our second visit to this resort , we were here feb 14 to 28 in 2005. Both time Club Diamond. I'm not going to drag this out, but will write pro's and Cons and differences. Pro's Resort Grounds-- Beautiful Food --- Very Good Sevice --- Wonderful Ocean -- Beautiful as ever Beach-- Great  Con's  differences in two years . Diamond club pool dirty , not cleaned the two weeks we were there, moss growing on tiles, many tiles missing. Two years ago beautiful. Shade sun Areas chairs and tables none exsistent or broken. Two years ago thiving area to sit and relax . Two less people at the bar. Have to get up before 7:30 AM to get shade on the beach , two years ago it was no problem. Better get your chairs at the pools before 9 AM or your S.O.L. Your Beach towels !! Keep your pants on, the camarera will knock on your door 8:30 to 10:30 PM. Nothing Special for being a repeat customer, in fact First timers got Rum , T - Shirts Etc. I don;t care about about little things like that, But some people make issues about it. We tipped many of hundreds of dollars  gifts  got to get some pretty good laughs , and sincere Thank You's Which means a lot to me. Me Espanola pequeno, but enough to get by. These are just little problems I have seen, and hope they don't pile up as the resort expands.  Met some retty nice people from Quebec, Canada.  USA. many were repeat customers and told me the same , they will not be back until some of the issues I mentioned above are looked at. Would we go back ? Probably not until things get starightened around. Any Questions ?
