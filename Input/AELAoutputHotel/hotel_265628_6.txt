{"text":"Avoid This Horror Hotel! Terrible Place I read the reviews and was not sure what to expect....Let me tell you some of our highlights..... We check into 2 rooms after spending the whole day traveling from NY to get there.....yes it took 1 1\/2 hours from airport to hotel on bumpy road.....ok so the roads not great but I wasnt going to complain about that.....check into the rooms..... in one room we see hundreds of small bugs climbing the wall.....look at bed, the bugs are in the bed.....back to front desk....instead of hearing how sorry they are...it was like we were bothering them with some petty problem like not having enough towels....HELLO BUGS... no way.... so after 2 hours they find us some other room.....now we are like 3 blocks walking distance from main lobby...what a pain...but at least no bugs.... FOOD... you will not starve....but believe me it sucks....the quality of the meat is sub par.... worse the standards that they cook it are even worse.... many people had food poisioning at the hotel...of course that did not shock me....PEOPLE... hotel staff does not work for tips...so they could care less..... The hotel is a mix like the UN, I actually enjoyed meeting people from all over the world....France, Germany, Canada etc... I would say very few from US...OTHER HOTELS... we visited several other hotels up and down the beach....many offered much better food, service, rooms, etc...SHOPPING....NOTHINGthe hotel gym is a joke, they advertise a shooting range and a golf practice tee, I walked over to this area.... it look like no one had used either of these in years.....SAVE YOUR MONEY..... BOOK A TRIP SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!Even leaving they made up phone charges of $17 for 3 calls from our room which we made to another hotel to see if we could switch hotels.... we could not leave the premise until we paid this fake charge...my happy moment....leaving this lame excuse of a hotel......DONT KNOW WHERE THEY CAME UP WITH 4 STARS.... I have stayed in the US at 2 Star hotels that offered better service, cleaner rooms, and better food!MAID SERVICE... oh I guess if they change your towel and make your bed you should be happy!ALL INCLUSIVE LIQUOR.... the low quality liquors were all watered down, hard to believe in this day and age but truePRICES FOR TOURS...like horseback riding, ATV, etc.... they make up different pricing for everyone.... We paid $20 for horseback riding.... other people who got pissed when we told em that told us they paid $50 for the same thing....ATV STORY...my wife at 7:30 pm on night was in the lobby trying to stop a woman from hysterics since her husband and small boy went out at 3pm.... they got back an hour and 3\/4 late since the group rode in complete darkness.... this man was scared out of his wits....BEACH.... unsafe, strangers selling drugs, etc.... water extremely rough....WEATHER.... VERY VERY WINDY..... we had a bad spell where it rained a bit each day...that I will not blame on the hotel....that was just unlucky on our partCASINO.... rigged, I watch as dealer cheated several times...this I kept to myself as I did want to start this type of issue... but stacking the deck and second dealing occured several times...AGAIN ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT I WILL NOT BE BACK TO THIS HOTEL!!!
