{"text":"Can't say enough BAD things about it I booked this hotel about 2 months ago for a one night stay while in Florence. I'm not usually one to write a review, and I usually don't complain about little nit-picky things, but this place was awful. My problems started more or less from the moment I walked into this place. The woman at the front desk had awful manners, very snooty, and unnecessary. I travel internationally frequently for work, and I usually don't bother with cultural differences in manners. It's usually not worth getting upset over, but this was something else. It got worse from there. The room I booked was a standard room. Being a resident of NYC I always book a room with the nicest view, most light, and airiest I can find. It's something I cafn't normally get in the city. I don't expect everything I want, every time...that's not how life works, but this room was ridiculous. The window faced a wall that was maybe 5 feet away, and was so small it may as well not even been there. When I requested a room change, I was told that there were none available, and anyway this was the standard room. When I pointed out that this is not remotly what was is advertised I was *screamed* at and told this was the standard room. After a few minutes of this I gave up, but you may want to take this under consideration when booking here. Aside from that the furnishings were outstanding. Some of the best that I've seen in a 4 star. For me these things aren't important. This place didn't even measure up to a holiday inn. It's not all about the show they put on. The whole thing may as well have been made of straw. ","annotations":[]}
