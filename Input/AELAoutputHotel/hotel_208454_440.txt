{"text":"Loved Sofitel After doing much research on Trip Advisor we decided to follow everybody else and book directly and managed to get the hotel within our budget. The hotel is just perfect - we arrived and were told we had been given a upgrade on our room to a higher floor which we were delighted about. The room itself was lovely and the bathroom was to die for! The bed, as everybody else has said, was fantastic - just wish we could have fitted it in the suitcase! The hotel's location is also excellent - when you come out of the door you turn right and you are a 5 minutes walk from Times Square, on the way passing The Red Flame which is also as good as all the other reviews say, and by turning left at the hotel and after 5 minutes you are at Grand Central Station. We would recommend the Circle Line boat trip, and Empire State Building as good points to view New York.As far as steaks go, we met up with a family member who works in Manhattan and he treated us to a meal at the Capital Grille. We had the most amazing food at this restaurant starting off with French Onion Soup which was layered with Gruyere cheese. The steaks are just to die for, washed down with excellent wine and just for more badness we finished off with cheesecake .... you have to be bad sometimes! We did use a cab twice but this was only on our first evening - after finding our bearings we walked everywhere apart from going to ground zero when we took the subway. Our top tip if you are going to Macys - go to the visitor centre and collect your 11% discount card. The prices are cheap compared to what we pay at home anyway, but this makes it evey better. We absolutely loved the Sofitel and would not hesitate to go back there, or to recommend it to anybody.
