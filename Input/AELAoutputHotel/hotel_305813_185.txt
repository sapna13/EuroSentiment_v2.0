{"text":"First Class in every way. We stayed 5 days at Langham Place in a beautiful Club room. As others have noted, if you can, DO pay a bit more for a truly first class experience. We had a spacious room on the 35th floor. The bed was SO comfortable  there's a pillow menu if you're not happy with the several types of pillows already provided. The bathroom is big and immaculately clean. We loved the huge showerhead directly above. The bathroom has a big window into the bedroom but there is a privacy blind. The separate bathtub was a good size. Toiletries included were of excellent quality and quantity. They even provided tootbrushes, combs,  razors.The view was of the high rise highly concentrated exciting city. Unfortunately the weather was dull with low hanging clouds the entire time we were there. We felt perfectly safe in the area and liked being close to various markets. To go to the harbour we just hopped in a taxi which is metered and reasonably priced. We also used the clean and effiecient undergound trains.Hong Kong was the last stop of a long and fanatstic journey. We decided to splurge and be spoilt by staying at Club level. It was really worth the money. The Club lounge had non stop food and drinks. We hardly ate out as the food provided was delicious and satisfying. The Lounge really was a relaxed and refined place to spend time. There are a couple of massage chairs (free) which were heavenly! We also used the computers in the Lounge area to check emails etc. We had breakfast downstairs and agree that the area is too cold. The buffet had a very good selection but we do regret not trying breakfast at the Club lounge - that will be for our next time there!The staff were friendly and professional at all times. Every part of the hotel gleamed. For Hong Kong we think think we got good value for our money. We highly recommend the Club rooms at this wonderful hotel for a first class experience.
