{"text":"OK, but not great My family of three spent 11 nights here. Ubud is a wonderful area to explore, but we felt the hotel didn't live up to its image on the website. First, we'd reserved the River Villa as it is described on the website as having a kitchen and we wanted to be able to cook. There was no cooking facility at all--just a double sink, a mini-fridge and an electric kettle, which are also available in the cheaper Emerald Rooms. The River Villa was dark and mildewy and we moved to an Emerald Room after just one night. The Emerald Room was much brighter and better, although to be honest, humidity was still a bit of an issue. If you have allergies, take some medication along to be comfortable. In all fairness, humidity\/mold problems are found to some degree elsewhere in Bali, even in the five-star hotels. We actually tried to find another hotel in the Ubud area after just a few days but everything was booked. There were some nicer and cheaper accomodations nearby. Second, if you are travelling with a small child, please note that the balconies on the upstairs rooms are low and some have big gaps in between the posts. Also, the hotel is located on a hillside near a river, so you have to keep a close eye on the kids and deal with mosquitoes. On the positive side, the staff are very helpful and friendly, and the grounds are beautiful. The free shuttle into Ubud was very useful. We found plenty to keep us busy during our time in Ubud. Room service is the same price as eating in the restaurant. ","annotations":[]}
