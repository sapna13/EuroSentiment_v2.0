{"text":"The BEST hotel in the WORLD!!!!!!!!!!! I thought I died and went to heaven when I stepped into Georges V. We stayed here for our wedding anniversary, and I was nearly brought to tears when I walked into our room and saw the chandelier above the bed with chilled champagne waiting for us. Our room faced out onto a beautiful little street, and the location of the hotel itself is steps away from the metro, and Champs Elysees. The hotel pool and gym were top notch - so incredibly clean. They brought me chilled towels and bottled water while I was there. The concerige could not have been more wonderful. We were in Paris during the Rugby World Cup, and although the France-Ireland game was sold out, the concierge managed to get tickets in the 2nd row of a stadium filled with 80,000 excited fans. The concierge also helped us secure reservations at certain restaurants where we were told it was completely full. If you want to truly dine like royalty, and don't mind spending quite a bit of money on dinner, try Alain Ducasse (not in the hotel). Georges V offered us the hotel's private car, which took us to dinner on our first night there. The hotel also coordinated a car and driver for us so we could take in all the sites of Paris at night. We also had a delicious breakfast in the gorgeous Le Cinq restaurant. Even just hanging out in the hotel lounge was delightful. We had a very chic high tea there, as well as several late night snacks\/drinks. I can't say enough wonderful things about this truly amazing hotel in the most gorgeous city on earth!
