{"text":"Wonderful and Restful Vacation We just returned from 10 glorious days at The Punta Cana Resort and Club. It was our fourth trip and perhaps our best yet. The property looked outstanding and the staff was terrific. They have some new faces in Guest Services (Carolina, Nicholas and Milca) along with Karina and Victor who seem to keep everything running quite smoothly. This year, we were even invited to join the chef, Rojalio and the director of Guest Service, Nicholas for an outstanding dinner to show off the new chef's talents. It was delicious and ran from lobster to filet mignon to a pecan tart for dessert.If you are looking for excitement, this is not the place for you. If you are looking forward to total rest and relaxation, it is an oasis. The beach is never crowded and is quite peaceful. The pool at the main hotel is perfect to float in on the wonderful rafts which are provided. The pool at the Golf Club is usually empty and directly abuts the beach. There is a lovely terrace right there for a perfect lunch or drink. The Six Senses Spa is also there at the Golf Club. The mostly-Asian masseuses give Thai massages that rival any spa to which my husband or I have ever been....anywhere.The food continues to be good, but I must say, we did miss the evening buffet at LaCana. LaCana continues to have a wonderful buffet breakfast every morning with everything from an omelette man to a smoothie maker and all things in between. We missed being able to go to the dinner buffet every few days, which we had done in years past...just to break it up and indulge in some of their wonderful salads and vegetables, which are grown right on the property. Perhaps next year, they will bring it back. The restaurants were consistently good and offered us varied menus. We enjoy everything from the fresh fish at the Marina restaurant, La Yola, to the delicious thin-crust pizza at Franco's.The golf course is outstanding and is maintained beautifully. I think the fee they charged for me to ride in the cart (I do not play)with my husband while he played seemed excessive at $40. By contrast, when my husband played at Cap Cana golf course, there was no charge for me to ride along with him. Cap Cana's golf course, Punta Espada, should not be missed. It is about 10 minutes away and well worth the trip.All in all, it was a very pleasant trip, as it has been every year for the past four years.We always rent a golf cart for our entire stay and find it quite enjoyable. It gives us the mobility to go from the hotel to the golf club to the marina without having to wait for the shuttle. There is a reason we choose The Punta Cana Resort and Club each January for post-Christmas relaxation and I hope the above review answers that question.
