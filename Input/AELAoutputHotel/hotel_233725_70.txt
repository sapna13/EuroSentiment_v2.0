{"text":"Great Room, Bath, Location and Views as promised Our party had rooms 312 looking out on the view and room 102 on the courtyard. Both rooms were junior suites. They were huge by any measure. Double sink baths were extremely nice with separate tub and shower and toilet in different closet. (In 312, the toilet was separate location from rest of bath) Great water pressure in the shower and nice large soaking tub, which can feel great after a long day of walking. The location was superb! The views just as you see on this site from candid photos. The couryard view was just looking out over the tops of some buildings below, but we really were not there that often, so it didn't matter for that room. They have two elevators - one tiny and one very suitable size. Only have two minor complaints: one is that there was no clock in the room, and the other is that the desk staff was not friendly or helpful to us. Unfortunately, Bernard, (who others have mentioned here and who was very helpful in my email communications prior to arrival) was on holiday during our stay. Despite my attempts at being very friendly and trying my best with my limited french, I was disappointed at how unhelpful they were. When we arrived, one of the rooms was not made up for the third person. I called down and the guy brought up sheets, but we had to make the bed ourselves. He explained that he was alone at the desk during that time. We also asked the location of the nearest bank and they couldn't tell us. Maybe we just caught them at an off time. I could certainly recommend this hotel for all the other positives as stated.
