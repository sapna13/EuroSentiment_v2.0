{"text":"Loved ALL of it...especially the service I booked a week at this beautiful resort for my birthday and was NOT disappointed. Everything about it was magical, romantic and incredible. I am looking very forward to staying here many more times in my lifetime. My favorite part of the entire trip was one of the staff, it was so hard to say goodbye and I felt as though I would truly be missed when I left. We had an amazing server whom we nicknamed 'Rayna The Beautiful'. She was ALWAYS smiling and ALWAYS making our day a fabulous one. If there was anything we wanted or needed, Rayna would find it for us and if she couldn't she always found someone who could. Rayna truly made my birthday trip a magical one. There are many many more people at this resort who go out of their way to make sure that you are enjoying your stay... Santos in the Excellence Lounge (he was the first person who served us upon our arrival-he was our first impression and it most assuredly was a good one!), there are so many I don't want to miss anyone so I will just say that overall... the staff-incredible.The grounds themselves were immaculate, the pools were always kept clean, the overall layout of the resort is something to be seen to be truly appreciated.The food! The food was incredible, our favorite restaraunt had to be The Grill, the steak was cooked to perfection...being from Alberta (home of the 'Alberta Beef'), I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious it was. I simply can not say enough about this resort, what I can say for sure though is that I will go back...again and again.I wish I could have thanked EVERY single employee at the Excellence Punta Cana, they made my birthday EXCELLENTAY !!!
