{"text":"horrible Don't stay here! Checked in on 4\/12\/07 and the air conditioning was leaking from the ceiling onto the tile floor, the ceiling tiles were falling down, the light in the shower did not work and the room smelled. I went to the reception desk three times and each time I was told a maintenance worker was on the way to fix the problems. This NEVER happened. I went to see the Apple Vacations representative and was told that weI could not have a new room until the next day and we would have to spend the night in this room. We had to leave the room by 10:00 in the morning and the new room was ready for until after 12:00. On 4\/12\/07 we made reservations with the concieger for dinner for two of the nights we were staying, when we went to the restaurant for dinner we were told that our reservation was for the following night and not that evening. The conceiger made us two dinners reservation for Saturday night and nothing for Friday night. The restaurant was full and could not seat us but suggested that we check with the other restaurants to see if any of them had a cancellation and might be able to fit us in. We were able to eat at the Italian Restaurant. One night there was a beach party and the food was horrible and the bugs were really that night. This is definetly not a 5 star resort. Don't waste your money at this place! ","annotations":[]}
