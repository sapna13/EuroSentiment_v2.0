{"text":"A really cozy place - Enjoyed my stay ! I just came back from a short stay at the Library Hotel. I had picked the hotel, because I remembered that we spent a lovely evening on their roof terrace a year ago. Reading the reviews made me curious about the rest of the hotel.Everybody at the front desk was very helpful and friendly and we did a swift check-in. The lobby is very understated and minimalist, but the book shelves made it look √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√≥osy√à√\u2020\u2022?I had booked a junior suit for a special discount price (499 $) and since this is even for New York a substantial amount of money, I expected a lot.I was not disappointed. The room looked exactly like the picture on their website. While a lot of room was wasted on a front room\/hallway, it was still spacious and airy, due to a lot of windows. All of them had nice wooden blinds, which gave the room a warm feeling, as did the room colours, mostly in beige and dark wood. There was a small sofa in one corner with two armchairs and a large flat screen TV. The bathroom was spacious and nicely decorated, with all the amenities one needs.Having lived in New York, I knew that this was not going to be the quietest of all streets in Mid-Town. It was definitely noisy, but the windows are very sound-proof.I did not see the reading room, but we spent some time upstairs in the winter garden and of course on the roof terrace. It would be nice, if the rooftop terrace had more comfortable furniture. The benches and little stools are quite uncomfortable and it is impossible to spent a leisure afternoon in the sun, without a major backache. Their free hotspot was available on the terrace and I was able to do my emails while sitting in the sun √à√\u2020\u2022?not too many hotels in NY offer that !As travellers before me have said: this is a great place and worth the money - I will return !
