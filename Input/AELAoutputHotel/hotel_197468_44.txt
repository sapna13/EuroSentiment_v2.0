{"text":"Great Location, Staff, and Room We just spent 6 nights at the Golden Tulip for our first visit to Paris and loved it! Our flight arrived at 7:30 am on a Sunday morning, so we showed up to the hotel much earlier than their 1pm check in time. They had been booked solid the night before, but held our luggage for us while we went and got breakfast, and let us check in at 10am once they had our room ready., for no extra charge. The room was beautiful. It had a large bathroom with tub and shower, large windows next to the bed from ceiling to floor that were great to open up in the morning, and was super clean and modern. Bed was very comfy and they provided 4 big, fluffy pillows in the room as well. The staff was always helpful, providing umbrellas on the one day it rained while we were there, recommending good places to eat, and always happy to see us when we arrived back from a long day. The location was amazing. We were able to walk everywhere, and if you don't like walking there is a metro stop around the corner. The Opera house is around the corner, and the Louvre is within a few blocks. There are a ton of great restaurants next door to the hotel, across the street, around the corner, basically everywhere. Also a little market and many patisserie's nearby too. It was hard to get lost or run out of things to do since the moment you check in, they had you a map with all the major tourist sights well-marked on it, and a stack of brochures with things to do. Also a nice book was left in the room for us with even more recommendations. Would definitely stay there again and again.
