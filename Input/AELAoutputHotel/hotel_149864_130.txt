{"text":"Disappointed I had just returned from the Punta Cana Club Med Resort and wanted to let any Americans that are considering booking a trip to this resort to learn French first.I will list the positives of the resort:We did relax and unwind which we desperately needed. Many activities for my 8 year old son.Had some great laughs, especially with the Club Clown.The weather was great. Very hot!!!Pool and beach beautiful. Needed to get up 7:30am to grab a hut by the pool. The negative:When we arrived to the village there wasn't a arrival crew welcoming us to the village. First time this happend since I was at two other locations. I do know when the French arrived there was a huge welcoming ceremony. I guess English was to hard for them. Our room was okay. Too small and had no dressers. The bathroom was a 2x4 and we had no balcony. Should of had the choice. There was also no couch to sit on, only a bed. All the bar activities were in french with no translation in English . So there was no way of participating. The drinks were something to be desired. Now lets talk about the food. Though there was an abundance, the variety is more geared toward the european clientele. The food was extremely bland. This cause a trip off the resort to Burger King. We were told that since the resort is at full capacity, that the food had to be mass produced which left the food tastless. The GO's were semi friendly and mostly talked and sat with the french, again coming from two other resorts, this was a first. When asking one of the GO's that was doing the exercise program to translate to English, she told us that french was easy to learn. Why would I want to learn french???? Was only there for 8 days. The music was horrible. Did the same routine every night, also in French. Though my 8 year old son enjoyed the kids club and wanted to go everyday, the night shows for the children were in French with no translation for the American children. The GO's were great with the kids and did put the Americans together. Not many of the American kids joined from what I learned. The one day the kids had off, my son wanted to play water polo with the other children who were French . They did not welcome him in the game, which left him upset and couldn't understand why they were mean and rude. I will definateley return to the DR, but not to Club Med. When talking with other peope at the airport and on the plane, they told us the other all-inclusive resorts were all American friendly. I will in fact return to the Sandpiper Resort in Florida.
