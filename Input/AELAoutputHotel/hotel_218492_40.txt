{"text":"worst vacation of my life this hotel was a nightmare. i went with friends and family and most of us got sick. the first day we got there we went to eat at Windows and there was no air conditioner they had the windows open and a big cockroach flew onto our table. then a couple of night later we were going to eat at the same restaurant and we saw a mouse by the entrance and the server asked us if we were not going in and when we said no she replied just because of that. there were also lots of flies all over he food. The best meal that i had all week was a taco salad form wendys at the airport. The service was horrible. we never had any clean towels (we always had to call for them to bring them up) and the maid would start cleaning the room at like 6 in the afternoon so we had to leave our room just to let her clean. and once we gave her a $10 tip and we told her to please make sure that we had at least 3 towels in the room and when we got back we didnt even have a hand towel. we called the front desk and it took them like 30 mins to bring them to us. there was also never any towels by the pool. our room was never clean. i have a baby who got sick witha fever and threw up all over the bed and the sheets had a red stain on them and i told the lady to please change the sheets and i went back to the room and i checked and it was the same sheet. also, one night my friend sat at the end of the bed it broke and it took maintenance like 2 hours to come up. so when we finally went to sleep the bed (that they had just fixed) broke again and my husband and i had to sleep in the bed like that. we never had any toilet paper. my friend called the fornt desk for toilet paper and it took them 30 min to come up while her daughter was sitting in the toilet waiting for it. also we booked our hotel through apple vacations and our room service was included but when we got there they told us they charged $6 for froom service and we did it many times and then we found out we were not supposed to pay for it. so when we told the manager they said there was nothing they could do about it because they didnt know which server it was. also there was never any umbrellas by the pool becuase people would put their towels on the chairs and never come back and when we told management they said they didnt have any rules for that. I've read some reviews that say not to forget that it's the south and people dont loive the same way and while that might be true, myself, being dominican (born and raised), i never had service like that anywhere else i went. I been to hotels in Puerto Plata and they're absolutely beautiful and the service is great. I had nevr been to punta cana before and going to the oasis made me not wanna go there again. Dominican Republic is beautiful but if you go make sure you dont stay at the Grand Oasis. Pay the extra money and stay at the RIU. believe me its worth it.
