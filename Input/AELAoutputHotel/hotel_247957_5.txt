{"text":"Fantastic getaway My husband and I have just returned from our 1-week stay at Occidental Grand in Punta Cana. We booked it through Transat and purchased a preferred membership package for two. It is a great place for a family getaway (couples and\/or with kids), honeymoons or vacations with friends. We were looking for the sun, ocean waves, pools, activities, great food and free drinks and we realized that this is THE place for us. We have found everything we were looking for and more. We have had a wonderful time and we would recommend this resort to anybody. Word of caution: If you plan on partying a lot, this resort is not the best choice. Even though there are drinks galore at all 7 bars there is not a lot of night life. There is excellent general entertainment at the main stage. You will love the ice breakers and great shows (Michael Jackson, Copa Cabana, Moulin Rouge) from 9 pm till 11 pm but then the hotel quiets down. If you are a party goer, there is a Mangu Club which gets crowded around 1 am and stays busy till about 5-6 am but that is about it.Below are just a few excellent things we noticed and enjoyed at Occidental Grand:√à√\u2020\u2022?Cleanliness and Maintenance: superb! Our rooms were cleaned\/kept up twice a day and we received towels\/new beach towels every day. The pools, fountains and paths were spotless and maintained several times a day. It looked as if nothing was ever touched! We also received a free bottle of Dominican Rum and a fruit platter.√à√\u2020\u2022?Friendliness and Promptness of staff: very friendly and helpful. We had a problem with our key card and once we asked a security guard of our building we got help within 5 minutes and got inside our room. √à√\u2020\u2022?Facilities: the pools are big (the main one is huge), clean and very inviting to go for a dip! There is a gym, archery, a basketball court, a spa, a gift shop and other facilities available at the resort.√à√\u2020\u2022?Food and Drinks: great variety of food and you will find something to eat\/munch on 24\/7. On top of the main restaurant, beach restaurant, pizza parlour, taco and snack bars, there are also four specialty restaurants: Italian, Brazilian, Mexican and Oriental. The food was delicious and there is something for every taste whether you are a vegetarian or a meat-eater. Just a hint: even though you have reservations made for you ahead of time, you can change the times and dates if you would like as well as go an extra time without a reservation. We had a chance to eat at the Oriental restaurant and enjoyed a special Christmas dinner as well as returned for a regular menu (the sushi and other oriental items were delicious). There are bars all over the place with a variety of different drinks. The bar tenders are wonderful and very quick. √à√\u2020\u2022?Beaches: clean, lots of lounge chairs (you will find one for each member of your party for sure!), white sand and the ocean! You will also find a variety of activities such as dancing lessons, volleyball, crazy freesbie, kayaks, sail boats, etc.A great place to stay at and enjoy!!!
