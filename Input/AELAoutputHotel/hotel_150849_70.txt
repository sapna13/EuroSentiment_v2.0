{"text":"Bambu was TERRIBLE The Bad:*The room* It was disgusting. We stayed on the first floor which was a bit of a hike from the lobby. The bathroom\/room was infested with little ants and had a bad odor. The beds are hard as rocks and the pillows are flat and equally as hard (kinda felt like resting your head on a notebook). The water smells that comes out of the showers\/faucet and they give you a gallon of bottled water to attempt to brush your teeth with. There was a liquor dispensor with thee CHEAPEST nastiest liquor in it and a few bottles of coke (which are the only bottled beverages you will be given throughout your entire stay...so savor them). There aren't any american outlets nor is there an iron or an ironing board. You can get an adapter (that is old and broken, and an iron that doesnt even steam and is 50 yrs old) from the front desk for $20.*The Food* It was absolutely disgusting and misleading. **There is NOT a steak house or an italian restaurant... i repeat... there is NOT a steak house or italian restaurant** There are two places to eat on the resort: The colonial restaurant and the Mama Juana.  The colonial is a buffett for breakfast lunch and dinner. It is nasty. The salad bar has no salad on it just nasty looking slops of mess and it smells by the salad bar the same way it smells in the bathroom. All of the fountain sodas are flat and room temperature.  The mama juana is a buffett during the day and then at night it TURNS INTO the italian restaurant ANDDDD the steak house!!! We went to the supposed steak house the second night and got the steak that came with the same veggies that we saw on the lunch buffett that no one ate and french fries. I then got food poisioning from it and was sick for the remainder of my trip. Needless to say we didn't bother making reservations at the supposed italian restaurant that was 2 tables over from the steak house.*The bars* They only serve bottom shelf liquor, ONE kind if domestic beer and you can ONLY get it on tap, flat\/warm soda, and one kind of white boxed wine and one kind of red boxed wine throughout the entire resort. The only way i lasted through the week was by visiting the little gift shop in the lobby and buying bottled waters and gatorades. One night, we found some corona bottles in the bottom back of the cooler in the gift shop and bought a few. It was worth it. *The service* Some people were cheerfull and helpful, but not most. I actually found them down right rude. I called and complained that the adapter and iron (that i just walked 6 blocks to the lobby to get) didnt work. They told me to walk BACK to the lobby and they would give me another one. I got upset and refused and then started going on about how unhappy i was with the room and everything and they ignored me. They finally sent some guy on a bike down to our room and he fixed it with his tool kit. The day before i was leaving no one would help me to find what time the bus was coming to get me and the other fellow apple vacationers to bring us to the airport. The guy at the front desks words were i dont know... goodluck man. Also the apple vacation rep that was supposed to be on the resort the whole time... was completely NOT helpful. She didn't speak english and didnt help me either. (Americans are definitly the visiting minority on the resort... you wont find many other fellow americans the whole time your there)*The Beach* The beach is BEAUTIFUL and the ocean is teal blue, warm, and clear. Overall the only good thing was the beach. However, i wouldnt return to another RIU resort if my life depended on it.
