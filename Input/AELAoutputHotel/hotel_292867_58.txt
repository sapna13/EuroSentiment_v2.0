{"text":"Caribe Club Princess is only a 3 star resort We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess the last week of Feb, 2008. There were 2 couples aged 30-34 travelling together at this resort.Overall - the resort itself was good. The beach is fabulous which can be expected at any resort in Punta Cana. The buffet and a la carte resaurants were all good (except for the Chinese resaurant). The resort ammenities (i.e pool, grounds etc) were well kept and clean.The major negative aspect about this resort would be our room. The room was clean, but definately a 3 star and not a 4 or 5 star room. The hotel is made up of several 3 level buildings. We were on the bottom floor and our room (and our friend's room) looked out onto an alleyway that was used regularly by staff members. Also, there were mosquitos in our room, and our light was broken when we arrived (however was fixed later in the week when we complained about it). There is a mini bar that is stocked every day.Also - there were not enough safety deposit keys for everyone who was staying at the hotel the week we were there. Our friends had to wait 2 days before they were able to get a safety deposit key.One of the best things about the resort was the La Creperie snack shop. You can get crepes (ham\/cheese, or fruit), ice cream etc from 1:00-6:00pm every day. Delicious!!Also, if you are looking for a shopping market on the beach - go to the one that is to the left of the resort it is only about a 5 min walk. There is another one to the right of the resort, but it is about a 45 min walk, and not as good as the other one.Overall, I would go back to this hotel, as long as I got a different room (I think the rooms on the upper floors are better).
