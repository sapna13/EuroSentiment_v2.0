{"text":"This is a gem! After weeks of looking online for hotels in Paris, I have to say I was rather dishartened. We wanted a good quality, three star hotel in a good location, but most hotels seemed either very expensive (in most cases overpriced, I'm sure) or just poor in quality. Because we were quite late with our booking as well, finding a good one (I was very careful to read reviews on all possible places) seemed pretty much impossible-- that is until my boyfriend stumbled upon Duquesne Eiffel. We both had a good feeling about the place, based on reviews in particular, and we were definitely not disappointed! First of all, the LOCATION IS GREAT. I cannot emphasize this enough. It is close to the Eiffel Tower and a stone's throw away from Napoleon's tomb (hotel des Invalides) right next to the military academy. 5 minutes away is the metro station and along the way a wonderful little bakery and a couple of restaurants. While it is so close to two of the main tourist attractions in Paris, its still a very quiet, nice and safe area. With the metro you can get anywhere in within minutes and even walking to the Louvre is possible! As we arrived we were greeted by a polite young receptionist and she quickly confirmed out booking, filled in the paperwork and gave us our key. The room was on the third floor (there's only 5, its very cosy and nice, clean and charming) and we were absolutely thrilled when we got in, saw the room and especially our view! Now, the room was small, but for a weekend trip this shouldnt be a problem unless you are fussy about space. It was nicely decorated (blue and yellow), everything was good quality and clean and the overall feeling was very charming and French! The bathroom was a very positive surprise because it had a big window and a bathtub, all very modern and tastefully done (nice bathtub and new showerhead). And now to the view- from both windows (room and bathroom) we had a view of the Eiffel Tower! This, I imagine even in Paris, is by no means standard and I'm sure many people pay a lot more than we did to have it! It was so gorgeous at night (although the cynical Parisians apparently disagree ;) and an incredible perk for an already positive experience. We stayed for 3 days and have no complaints at all. We didnt have the breakfast though (which seems expensive-- its much nicer to go to a local bakery, I think), but all and all service was excellent (cleaning and receptionists) and our check-out was very quick and professionally handled. We both loved Paris and a big part of this was thanks to our very positive experience at the Duquesne. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL for anyone looking for a charming, private and conveniently located medium-range hotel- in fact, I'm sure it beats many hotels with more stars and fancier addresses- that's how good I thought it was!
