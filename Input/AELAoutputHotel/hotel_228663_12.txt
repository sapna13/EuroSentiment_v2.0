{"text":"Good, clean, excellent location Hotel is alomst exactly what I want from a central major city hotel.Firstly, the hotel is in very good condition. It has a more business like feel to it, which generally means its clean and well kept, which was true. Not for those that like 'character'. Only odd downside was that one side of hotel had no direct lift access from reception (you had to climb 15 stairs with suitcase before a lift??). Very Odd. Also roadside was down 5 steps (not great place for handicapped people).Location was great. 25 mins walk to Puerto del Sol is no problem for me. But it means its in a nice neighbourhood, very quiet, but with local bars and restaurants (and Starbucks\/Steakhouse for those days when you want home!).Its very easy to get from here to anywhere, especially the sights like Prado. And metro right around the corner.Amenities in hotel aren't top for this price (hence only 4 stars). There is no late night bar (11pm) and its very small and smoky. Not sure there is a separate breakfast place either (personally never do hotel breakfasts). There are plenty of very close local late bars so not a major issue, but at this price\/level this should be included in my opinion. Room service food good, but strange menu (many main meals, few 'hotel' type snacks.Service at front desk good. One guy was not particularly helpful, but all the others were very nice. Booking restaurants for us no problem. AND the room had a Madrid 'Style' book listing many restaurants and sights which was excellent.Overall, very happy with experience and would use again if I went back.
