{"text":"Modern, Clean, New, Large Rooms and a PEFECT Location!! I stayed in a one bedroom apartment at the Citadines Paris Saint-Germain-des-Pr√ã√\u2022√ñs Apart√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√ºotel from Saturday September 1st through Wednesday September 5th. I had read the mixed reviews on here and was blown away by my Citadines experience. I was traveling with my parents and this was the perfect solution to not getting 2 small rooms in a small hotel! The hotel overlooks the Seine and is only √à√¥√ú block from Pont Neif. We walked to the Lourve in under 10 minutes as well as explored San Germain (located down the streets behind the hotels) for many of our meals. Notre Dame was less than a 10 minute walk as well\/The room was modern and spacious for Paris. There was a small flat screen TV in the main √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨iving√à√\u2020\u2022?area as well as one in the bedroom. There was a spacious desk with internet available free via modem (just plug in the Ethernet cord and you are on). The desk had a side table that pulled out into a table you could use to eat on. There were extra chairs in one of the closets as well. The couch pulled out into 2 single beds. I only needed one, so I left the other bed, a trundle or captain√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ bed, under the sofa. The bathroom was quite nice with a full shower with high shower head, heated towel rack and just enough towels for 4. There were no washcloths √à√\u2020\u2022?which I later learned is typical for Paris. The toilet was in a separate room down the hall by the kitchen √à√\u2020\u2022?which actually worked out well. There was a small kitchen with a small fridge, stove top, microwave and mini-dishwasher. This was the best feature for us as we could bring in beverages for night. There were 2 hanging closets and 1 linen closet that could be used for clothes as well as a small safe. I do not remember a clock in the room, although we did use the phone service for wake up calls. We did not get the room cleaned while we were there; I believe it is 5 days before that is included. When we needed more tissues or toilet paper, the front desk was happy to provide these items.The hotel staff could not have been nicer. We did not expect to use them as a concierge, although they were happy to point us in the right direction. Many times we saw the Assistant Manager sitting in the lobby with a map showing guests where to go. We did not expect them to carry our bags either, and carts were available in the lobby. They arranged taxi√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ for us to the airport and stored our bags for us the day we departed until it was time to leave. (Expect about 50 Euro via taxi from the airport to the hotel.)We only got coffee, tea and hot chocolate in the lobby each morning as we went into San Germain to the many bakeries to get fresh pastries and croissants each morning. It looked like a basic continental breakfast, but for 9 Euro a person, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think it was worth it.This hotel, as well as this chain, is a hidden gem in Paris! The location was fantastic and the quality of the accommodations was top notch √à√\u2020\u2022?4 stars at least. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel and will continue to return to this hotel on my future trips to Paris.Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.
