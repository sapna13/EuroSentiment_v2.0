{"text":"Great little Hotel This hotel is in an excellent location. The staff is extremely user friendly. They go out of their way to assist you in any way. We stayed in a deluxe room which is larger than the standard rooms. Hotels in Paris are generally small but we found the Deluxe room to be fine. It is in a very safe area, within walking distance of most major attractions, George V (designer shopping) ET, CE etc. It is even within walking distance to the metro that takes you to Versailles. We found this better than going there on a tour as you can stroll the wonderful gardens at your leisure and see the petite trianon. The tours generally don't allow for that much wandering on your own.I highly recommend that you check out the bicycles that are right outside the hotel steps about 30 feet to the left. Paris has this great bike rental system. You pick up a bike at one of the many bike stands and return it at ANY bike stand around the city. Be aware that you should return a bike to a stand if you plan to stop off at a place instead of locking it to a post. That way you won't incur usage fees. Simply return the bike, do your thing and return to the bike stand to rent another one. It was a great way to see Paris as a local as we went into neighborhoods that we would otherwise not have seen. Oh by the way, a French lady advised us that bikes are allowed to use the bus lane on the street.
