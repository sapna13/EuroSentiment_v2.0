{"text":"No real substance or value here Just returned from a weekend trip to the St. Regis. We got a reduced price by redeeming some Starwood points, but it was still expensive. Overpriced, to be more exact. We don't mind paying for true luxury, but this hotel doesn't even come close to that.The St. Regis is full of affectations (like the personal butler) but lacking in real amenities or value. We had a corner room on the 13th floor with a nice view of the Metreon and the Marriott (which looks like a better possibility for our next stay). The coolness factor of the touch screen bedside device soon grows tiresome. For example, the drapes can only be manipulated electronically and it is all or none. Either they are all open or none can be opened. Given the nature of the corner rooms that means that if you want a view of the city, your neighbors in the next room automatically get a view of you. The bathrooms are very small and poorly equipped. Hard to believe that a supposed 5-star establishment doesn't even provide a shower cap. (they will draw a $1500 bath for you though, in a tub that is barely big enough for one tall person and scratched up). Our room even had a small hole near the ceiling where the pocket door seals off the toilet and shower from the rest of the bathroom. The only mirror in the room was in the bathroom above the single sink. Again, not our definition of luxury. I had to go into the entry way to do my hair, where there was a mirror and console table.As others have noted, they did contact us by email about our stay. To honor our anniversary they sent up a nice bottle of $7.99 sparkling wine. While it was a nice touch, it is hard to know if we should have been flattered or insulted.:) We did appreciate having the wine bucket though. We walked a block down to Walgreens where we could actually acquire enough ice to chill a bottle, and consumed some very nice sparkling that we purchased outside of the hotel for a Real Person's Price. With no coffee faciilities in the room, or down in the lobby, we were grateful that Peets Coffee is just across the street. For $$$$ a night the hotel could really provide at least a single-serving pod machine in the rooms. It would be way more useful than the tiny stereo system, or even the DVD player. Those are redundant given that most people travel with their IPod and\/or buy movies on the TV if so inclined. (or in this case, walk across the street to the Metreon to see a movie). Finally, we came to the city to relax. Hard to do given that except for the bed there was no comfortable place to sit. The desk had two straight-back wooden chairs that were a testimony to form over function. I don't believe I have ever sat in anything more uncomfortable.I do believe that housekeeping does a nice job, and the staff is certainly trained to be friendly. We travel extensively here and abroad, and stay in a wide variety of establishments. The St. Regis would be at the very bottom of our list compared to other places in this price range. You can get a much better value at several other properties in the city. We chose the St. Regis because of the good reviews on Tripadvisor, and it was the only places that had availability. Now we know why the latter was true. SOMA is a great location and we will definitely make it our destination on every city trip. We will however not return to the St. Regis. They have a lot to learn about blending trend with function. I suggest their management visit some of the Starwood Le Meridians that are Art\/Tech style such as Vienna. They will come away with a true appreciation of how style can be enhanced by real amenities for the traveler.
