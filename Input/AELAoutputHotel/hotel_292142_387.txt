{"text":"Beautiful, classy, great location! You'll love it! We can't stop raving about our stay the the Affinia Dumont; we stayed for 3 nights in May 2007:SERVICEThe service was impeccable! From a quick check-in and extremely courteous and helpful bellmen and front counter people, we were recommended some nice restaurants and my husband even had a good conversation with one of the doormen about baseball! FUN STUFFThey have a pillow menu where you can choose from a variety of special pillows (buckwheat, magnetic, down, etc) free of charge. It was fun trying out different pillows although we often opted for the regular down pillows in the end!There's also exercise packages that you can borrow...they include pedometers, cd players, weights, etc that you can check out. We checked out pedometers to see how far we walked in the city. This service was also free of charge.There's also free fruit and yummy iced tea in the lobby.ROOMSThe rooms were extremely large- we had 2 queen size beds, a lounge chair and an executive size desk with all too much room for just two of us! We had a beautiful view of the city from our large, multiple windows-- it was great at night with all the lights!The bathroom was beautiful with marble, granite and brushed stainless steel fixtures.LOCATIONA great location for catching the subway or the bus...just a few blocks to any transportation. There's some small shops along the walk if you need to pick up anything. GOOD EATSPizza 33 was recommended by the concierge and we loved it! We tried almost each type of pizza (by slices or whole) while we were there. We even brought some with us for our plane ride home!There's a small cafe\/deli that's on the corner before you get to the hotel. I dont' remember the name, but they have special coffee drinks, a full deli (soups, sandwiches, salads), smoothie bar...and FREE INTERNET (the hotel charges a daily fee).Overall, we loved our stay at the Affinia. Great location, helpful staff and a very classy hotel overall.
