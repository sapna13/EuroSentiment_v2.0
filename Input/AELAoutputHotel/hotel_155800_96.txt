{"text":"Disappointing My husband and I (who travel extensively) were excited about visiting the El San Juan. Though our 7th trip to Puerto Rico, this was our first time in the Isla Verde area. The first 24 hours were pretty awful. The room (garden lanai -- and we paid mucho withtaxes and resort fees) was shabby with smudged walls and aging furniture. We found out later that these rooms had not yet been renovated. Our Hotel Directory binder was empty. When I enquired at the desk I was told that those rooms didn't get a directory. For $500+\/night that seemed rather atrocious. There are signs everywhere that say the hotel is a non-smoking facility yet we had an ashtray and matches with the ESJ logo on our desk. The front desk seemed unconcerned. A private party the first night subjected us to loud rock music until late in the evening. The wireless internet was unbearable slow even when it worked, which wasn't often. The front desk staff were not particularly friendly. I was ready to go home after the first day.After that I warmed up a little to the place. It is true that there was little service there -- the room didn't get done until afternoon, there was no turndown service, no bathrobes -- the things you associate with luxury hotels. The bottle of water supplied would cost $10 if you used it. I did not have problems with bedbugs at all. The bed was comfortable and changed daily. The public areas are lovely, etc. Would I stay there again? Not sure. A different or more recently renovated room would be better, though the service seemed slow and sometimes non-existent.Breakfast was good and not too pricy, we only ate at the Agave Ranch which wasn't bad but (again) had an utter lack of any kind of service. I am NOT a whiner -- I have been all over everywhere and have many bases of comparison and the ESJ certainly came up short. Since many reviews are favorable, perhaps they need more consistency in how things are run.
