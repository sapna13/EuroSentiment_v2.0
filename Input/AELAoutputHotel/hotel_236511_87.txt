{"text":"Small in Size - Big in Value My wife and i just came back from a trip to England, Scotland and Paris.We used Trip Advisor to find all of the places to stay after a friend recommended it and that is how we came across Hotel Monge.This Hotel was not the biggest in the world and the rooms were a little small, but who spends time in their room anyway in the middle of Paris.The hotel is located right in the heart of the Latin Quarter and literally one block from Notre Dame.The people that work at the Hotel all know english and were very helpful, not to mention that the crussonts we had for breakfast there were some of the best I have ever had in my life.The hotel was very clean and each room also has a bathroom with a small shower which is always a plus.Directly down the street from the hotel is probably the best pastry shop in all of Paris called Erik Kaiser. Along with that within waling distance is a great little street with all of the crepperies and little cafes Paris is best known for.As far as getting around the city goes the Hotel is situated right on top of the Place Monge rail station which makes it easy to get anywhere you want and is within walking distance to Notre Dame, the Pantheon, and even the Luve and Eifel Tower if you have your walking shoes wth you.I would recommend this hotel to anyone who would be going to Paris. You get the entire Paris experience for less money and staying here as opposed to the big old resort hotels really gives you the feeling that you are a resident of Paris and not just another tourist.
