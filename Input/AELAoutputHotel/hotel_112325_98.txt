{"text":"Very nice When i saw the outside of the hotel i instantly liked it- red carpet leading to the door from the street - how nice! The minute we went through the door we were greeted by Micheal the manager who is a very friendly guy and treat us as if we'd known him for years!! Quite eccentric too :) The lobby was pleasent and comfortable and the lift was fast. Our room was delightful- we were on our honeymoon and had previously stayed in New York and LA, but this was by far the nicest hotel. Michael had left us a a letter to congratulate us, along with complimentry fresh fruit and a bottle of wine (I don't know if we received fruit and wine because we were on our honeymoon or because it is standard). The room was nicely decorated, the bed was extremely comfortable and it was all nice and fresh. That is until my new husband ruined it by using the toilet and stinking the joint out! Michael told us the best places to go and eat at which we went to, and he was spot on (Jons Grill, about 5 blocks down). A continental breakfast was also served in the morning, which is the only thing i felt let this hotel down a little. The room in which we ate in was a bit bleak as there was no windows, and the breakfast was just average. Even so though, we had a fabulous time and the hotel complimented the beauty and uniqueness of San Francisco.
