{"text":"We found a winner! I was in despair when confronted by all the hotels available in Barcelona. Then I noticed the Claris and read that the owner has a collection of antiquities that he features in the hotel. I felt this set the Claris apart from the others and booked it. Right from the beginning I felt that I had made the right choice. I e-mailed the hotel before we left to request a quiet non-smoking room and they assured me this could be done. When we arrived our room wasn't quite ready, so we were shown into the very nice bar and offered free champagne, olives and crisps--an excellent way to start our weekend. There were wonderful fountains and sculptures in the open courtyard that could be seen from the glass elevators as we ascended to our floor. The room was beautifully decorated in various woods, it was just the right size, it overlooked the back so it was quiet and it was very comfortable. After sightseeing for a few hours, we returned to have a bath before dinner and someone was knocking on the door to offer a selection of bath salts and oils! I chose lavender and had a lovely bath with flowers floating in it. We went to the hotel's restaurant, East 47, which was offering a special mushroom tasting menu, which we selected. It proved to be one of the most memorable meals we'd ever had--every dish was exquisite and the service could not have been better. Our waiter helped us choose a very unusual bottle of local white wine which was delicious and went with all the dishes. Breakfast was massive, well presented and also very delicious with a wide variety of food to suit every taste. The location is excellent--close to the amazing Gaudi buildings, yet also not too far to walk to the Gothic district. Taxis are always available. All the staff were amazingly friendly and helpful, even going so far as to check us onto our flight and print out our boarding passes on the day we left. I can't think of a better place to stay and highly recommend this to everyone. By the way, there was a decent pool on the roof, but it was too cold to use it in November--a good reason to go back in warmer weather! Try this place and you'll not be sorry. It made our trip really special (especially the little museum of antiquities which you shouldn't miss).
