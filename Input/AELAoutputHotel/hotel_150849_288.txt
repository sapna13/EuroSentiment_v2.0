{"text":"Great time at the Bambu We stayed at the Bambu 11th - 25th September 2006;Flight details - around 8 hours from Manchester; We travelled with Thompson; flights generally OK, although found the planes cramped. Apparently due to be upgraded for 2007. Going through Punta - Cana airport was quick  efficient, there were no other arrivals, so no crowds to cause delays.Travel via coach to the Bambu - this was not as bad as others have suggested, relatively smooth  not hair raising! Travelling through the towns etc. though is an eye-opener, seeing how the Dominican really is  the people that live there!Hotel - impressive well maintained grounds, with the hotel in between the two Palace hotels. check -in is also quick.Rooms are bungalow style in blocks of 6-7 or so. They are clean, spacey  we had no problems with bad smells as others say. However they are basic  don't expect the same standard 5 star accomodation that you would usually expect back here! - there is a mini-bar, restocked every other day  a safe (recommend you use!!)Hotel facilities - 1 large pool with swim -up bar, which does get busy, jacuzzi also at the back of pool, which is great in the shade!1 x other smaller pool - which is quieter  more relaxed. both have plenty of loungers around.3 x main restaurants; a buffet style, which is ok although there appears to be large selections (which is excellently presented) avilable, by the end of the first week, it gets boring as it does not change! breakfast is in the same place  this is also much the same! there is an Italian style  Grill restaurant, which was dissapointing! - there is another available, part of the Palace hotel, which can be used; the quality is far superior!Beach - WOW!! Apparently this beach is one of the World's top ten! - Not difficult to see why! - 28kM of white powder sand  palm Trees - plenty of sunbeds available  different water-sports on offer. - an early morning walk across the beach is amazing! - We tried snorkelling at different points across the beach. some are better than others!daily entertainment - Animacion Team are teriffic  do not stop working! - Well done to all of them, especially Chocolate!Trips - 3 to recommend; first  most definatley, Saona island. A great day starting at 6.30am. involves an hour speed boat ride (about 60mph - not good if you have mobility problems) out to the island;Sstop of about half mile out into the sea on a reef  have cocktails in waist high water. Amazing! BBQ lunch is prepared for you. get about two hours here for sunbathing  snorkelling which is fantastic! - Travel back by Catamarran  get hammered on more cocktails, sunbathing,listening to Bob Marley.Monster Truck  for snorkelling fans, the Marinarium (swim with Sharks  Rays) are both enjoyable!!Overall - we both suffered slight stomache upsets, nothing major.We expected this! you are in an altoghether different climate.This region is not at all commercialised like Cancun for Example, outside the Hotel gates there is nothing except Jungle!There is only the nightly Hotel entertainment (Not brilliant!)  a small nightclub on Caribbean St. So if you prefer the big party scene, I certainly would not recomment ths area! It is also not great if you have small children, apart from Beach\/pool, there is not much else on-site to keep them occupied!if you like to relax  take it easy, this Hotel is laid back enough  you should have a great time!I would definately return here some time soon!
