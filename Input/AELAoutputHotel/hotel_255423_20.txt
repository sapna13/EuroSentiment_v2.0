{"text":"Fantastic Hotel and value for money My wife and I have just arrived home from a wonderful 4 week holiday in Australia. We researched our hole trip via the web and booked all flights and hotel via the web. Our highlight was Sydney and I must say we had 6 of the most memorable days of our life, We did a lot of research on hotels including Tripadvisor. We decided on The Quality Hotel Cambridge as it offered the price point we were looking for in what turned out to be a fantastic location. We were a little unsettled as their were so many varying reviews. I must say our concerns were unfounded. We walk in after a very long flight witch arrived early in the morning. We were greeted by a very bright modern lobby, with very friendly staff. We did have to wait a wile for our room as check-in was not until 2.00 PM( handy to know if you are arriving early), we were well looked after and the reception staff were very helpful. A young English gentleman was the front desk manager and during our stay went out of his way to accommodate us.In fact all staff on front desk were very knowledgeable and helpful.We were very pleasantly surprised when we arrived in our room (we booked a deluxe room 1307) it was very large and well appointed. It had a balcony with great views across the city. Had a small fridge and a very comfortable bathroom. The bed was the most comfortable that we have sleep in. In our four weeks of travel we stopped in many hotels and the Cambridge cleanliness of was top notch, actually the best I have ever experienced. The location while not being in the centre of the city was good and very easy to get to all site seeing attractions. We highly recommend this hotel and it truly was the best hotel we stopped in.
