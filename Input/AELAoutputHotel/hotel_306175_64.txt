{"text":"Fantastic Hotel I stayed at the GH Singapore in August and have to say it was one of the best hotel experiences I've had. Of the many positives, location very near Orchard Road and overall quality\/condition of the rooms are the most significant. Orchard Road is a 1\/2 block walk from the front door of the GH. There are numerous shops, restaurants, malls all within 5 minutes walking - fantastic location. The rooms appear to have been recently renovated - as the decor is very modern\/contemporary with fresh, clean, minimal design and such features as a flat panel plasma tv, wireless internet and plenty of room - large by comparison to other hotels.The fitness center and spa at the GH is also very nice by comparable hotel standards. All equipment is new, clean and would be appropriate for any fitness center. The spa facilities are also very nice with sauna, steam, whirlpool and roomy changing areas.Generally speaking, the service I experienced from the front desk staff upon check-in, to wait staff for room service, to fitness center attendees to my massage therapists was of upmost courteousness and professionalism. The staff really went out of their way to ensure my comfort.The only negatives to mention are the rather long taxi queue in the morning - at the front of the hotel. After a 20 minute wait on my first morning, I learned that hotel guests can prebook taxis the previous day - this information would have been nice to know. If you need a morning taxi then best to prebook with the bell staff. The second slightly less negative experience was with the checkout which was longer than usual - maybe 10 minutes due to a shortage of staff at the counter.The positives of my stay so far outweigh the 2 minor negatives that I will definitely stay at the GH Singapore on future visits.
