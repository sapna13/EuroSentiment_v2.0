{"text":"great for R  We just returned from the Punta Cana Club  Resort. The place is beautiful and kept very clean. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted with punch. The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our needs. We stayed in a junior suite which was more than enough room for 2 people. Each morning we had breakfast at the buffet which included smoothies, juices, and an assortment of breakfast foods. Dinners were at the various restaurants on the property. Reservations were needed, but all of them were available. La Yola is a beautiful restaurant on the marina. We also ate at Cocoloba, La Bamboo and others. The food was excellent, some more pricey than others. Drinks are expensive and are kept on a separate tab with tax and gratuity put on. All the restaurants are open with big fans and very comfortable. The beach is wonderful. There were times when we were the only ones in the ocean. The water is a gorgeous blue with fish swimming by. You can usually find shade if needed and have a drink. The pool is very nice as well. It has a swim up bar and many seats both in the sun and the shade.It is definitely a place for relaxation because there is no night life available. There is a lounge and a bar in the lobby with someone playing music. The Six Senses Spa is a must. It's beautiful and offers a lot of things. I had a very relaxing one hour facial. Great!!!The use of the internet is also available at a rate of $2 for 15 minutes. This came in very handy for us.It's easy to get around because the little shuttle cars always ready to take you to where you want to go. All in all, our stay was wonderful and would recommend the resort to anyone who wants to get away from it all!!
