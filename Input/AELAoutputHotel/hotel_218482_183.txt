{"text":"OK Resort We stayted at this resort from jan 6 to 13 .Let me start by saying that we are in our early 40s and travel 4 times a year last one being Rui Palace in punta cana , i have been to many resorts from 4 star to 5+ and have never wrote a review , but this one i felt that i should .Lets start with the joke of an airline AIR TRANSAT , my daughter had left 3 days prior to us with the same tour company Noli tours wich by the way is owned by air transat , they where to leave at 4.30 pm only to find out their flight was delayed till 1.30 am the next day , missing a whole day of their vacation , so i was worried that same thing would happen to us , but we where lucky only 1 hour late . Any one that has traveled with air transat knows how those seats are , oh yes we got mr wongs food box thrown at us , but the worse of this flight was these 3 people sitting behind us with the swearing out loud , with many kids aroud it was f this f that and not one flight att aprached them to quite it down , instead kept feeding them beer , so we get in to punta cana at 11.30 pm got our luggage and headed to the hotel .Hotel : we got there about 12.30 am to be greeded by someone that hardly spoke english , got our bracelett then they make you wait around to give your rooms keys cant figure this one out .After that wonderfull meal on air transat we where all hungry , but food nowhere to be found , then i got a rotten apple and a little sandwich provided by the fron desk . Ok now we have our keys but noone to take our luggage , no golf carts and this place is big , we take our lugggage we found our villa hapened to be on the third floor , no lights on the stairs but i made it up , its now 2am walk into the room musty smell but thats expected , get into bed and the pillows are like rocks , ok hope tomm gets better , go to turn on the tv to wacth the morning news remote does not work , then i go to use the plug to charge my camera plugs dont fit they are 110 v but the outlets are in a weird shape that it did not fit , so i asked for an extention wich they brought , make sure no small kids around as they have live wires exposed . One night we had no power in the room for 3 hours only then someone showed up .The best feature about his hotel are the grounds and the beach the pool was showing its age and the water was cold , and very loud , the food was ok in the buffet same thing everyday , the el la cart where ok we got sick with the losbter in the french , the bars where always very crowed and no premium drinks , the pizza is very good by the pool .The beach is very nice , some seaweed but not much and they do clean it , we always found a chair but we where at the beach by 9 am it get full quick , never spend time at the pool it was just to loud for my liking .The shows at night where ok , not your cruise nightly shows one of the dancers almost dropped his partner scary moment , and of course Milcheal Jackson show sames to be popular in punta cana from a scale of 1-10 i give it a 4 .conclussion you get what you pay for , not to be compared with the rui palace , the rooms horrible , the grounds are beautiful , the service not good , the beach is the jem of this resort , the food was ok , would i return to this resort NO , just because the negatives where to many , pay the extra 200 dollars you will thank yourself .
