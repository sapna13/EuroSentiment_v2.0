{"text":"Good hotel, with some problems The hotel itself is lovely, but we did have a few problems. There were four of us traveling so we booked 2 rooms. Both were supposed to have 2 twin beds but when we arrived we were told that they had us down for one room with 2 twin beds and one room with a king size bed. As a result, my mother and I were forced to share the room with the king size bed. Another problem was that the internet was not working and was never fixed throughout our 3 night stay. Also, there were no english speaking TV channels, not even CNN. All of the other hotels in other countries I have stayed at have at least had CNN. The positives were that the location of the hotel was good, the room was nice and the bathroom was large and modern. The breakfast was good - hard rolls, meats and cheeses, yogurt, cereal, baked goods, juices, etc. The staff was fine - I wouldn't say they were overly friendly or helpful, but they certainly were not rude or unaccomodating. One of the people at the desk did give us a good recommendation for a restaurant on our first night there. Florence itself was wonderful! Here's a tip - if you plan on going to the Academia to see the David, which is phemonenal, book your tickets ahead of time. We didn't and waited in line for 2 1\/2 hours. The same goes for the Uffizi, or any other big tourist destinations in Italy, such as the Vatican museum.
