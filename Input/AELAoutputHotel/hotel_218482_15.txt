{"text":"just got back Just got back after staying at Catalonia December 3-7 with the family (6 of us plus a toddler). I also did alot of research before booking this trip. I have to thank everyone that wrote reviews because they are pretty much right on about the resort. I pretty much knew what I was getting into. Here are a few of my observations:The hotel staff is very pleasant and cordial. We stayed in villa 6 which is a very close to the pool, good location! This was a very small issue, certainly didn't ruin our trip by any means, but we did have an issue with a non working remote control, we called the front desk and they said someone would be at our room in a few minutes. 45 min. later we called again to see what was up, they apologized and said that someone would be right over, in the end no one ever showed up and we couldn't watch tv that night. Not that big of a deal, but still annoying. The beach is fantastic! The sand is pure white and it doesn't get hot, so walking on it is pleasant, even mid-day.The buffet did have alot of variety, but it was not at all to my liking. I realize that food is very subjective but we did not really enjoy much. A few reviews mentioned that the food was not very good but that people managed to find 'favorites' I guess you could say that we each found 'favorites' ;that means that my sister ate cheese fries every night and my cousin ate rolls with butter and cheese, I ate similarly only because you have to eat something...none of the 'favorites' we found equalled a balanced dinner. I will say that the paella from the beach grill was wonderful so on the second day I ate alot of that to hold me over past dinner. I heard the burgers were good, too. The pizza at the pool is quite good as well, long story long, we didn't like the buffet but found the other food, like the beach grill, etc. good. There is a flea market a 10minute walk down the beach (go right) about 15 stalls all selling identical stuff. Worth a walk for coffee beans or a t-shirt. About the ethnic people mentioned in the previous review, (I think we were there at the same time) we saw lots of Europeans but didn't see obnoxious behavior by anyone. Overall: EXCELLENT bang for the buck, don't expect a 5 star resort but expect a clean, attractive facility, great pool, great beach, friendly staff, lots of fun for all ages from toddlers to grandparents!
