{"text":"Lenox Hotel - Almost Faultless! Stayed at the Lenox for 5 nights in December. Had a beautifully appointed room on the 9th floor with wonderful views over the city. Had to be one of the largest hotel bedrooms I have ever stayed in. Aveda toiletries in the bathroom were great - in fact the housekeeper had forgotten to leave shower-gel one of the days and I left her a little note the following morning. She left additional supplies each day thereafter which was very thoughtful. The bed (and more especially the pillows) were soooo comfy and it was great to snuggle down and look at the snow falling outside!Everything was spotless and clean. The concierge, reception and portering staff - not to mention the waiting staff at breakfast were all very friendly, courteous and helpful.We didn't try out the fitness room (we were on holidays after all...!). However we did use the business centre to check emails etc during the course of our stay. The City Bar is a great place to wind-down after a hectic day and seemed to attract a hip happening local crowd - which added to the ambience. I loved it (and especially the cocktail menu..!). We had lunch in Solas, the Irish bar twice during our stay - which was great. The only fault I would have is the lack of tea\/coffee making facilities in the room. I find it hard to adjust initially when I go to the States and have an irratic sleep pattern. I certainly would have welcomed the option of making a coffee at 3.30am some of the nights. Saying that, it would not deter me from staying at the Lenox again and am already looking forward to my next trip! For first-timers to Boston, the Lenox is in a great location in the city and you would be hard pressed to find a better gem than this hotel.
