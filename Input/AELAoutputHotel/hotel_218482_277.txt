{"text":"How to survive and maybe enjoy the Catalonia... Just a few tips I picked up my my trip ending April 3rd.1. Tip early and tip often...These people are very pushy for their tips so you will know when one is expected. We tipped the check in guy, got a room by the pool and beach, tip the waiters at the start of your meal and you will be amazed at how fast and friendly they are. Dont tip them and you will be one thirsty fella. Tip the maid a few bucks every day and you will have more water and soda and towels then you know what to do with. 5 dollar tip and you are a super star. Tip the guys that you want something from 5 bucks once or twice. Tip everyone else 2 or 3 dollars, USC.2. Eat and drink at your own risk...There are 4 restaurants there. Mikado and La Parisienne were pretty good for their standards, which are pretty low. Mariachi and the Rodeo Stakehouse need to be burned to the ground. My wife had to to hospitalized for 2 days for parasites after eating at Mariachi. The steak at the Rodea was comparable to road kill. Also book your meals the first day, they fill up fast. I hope I dont have to say this but, DONT DRINK THE WATER! Dont even brush your teeth with the water, use bottled water. I was hesitant to shower in that water, just tried to keep it out of my mouth.3. The pool rules... By 7am most chairs with the ubrellas are long gone. I noticed some people left there stuff from the night before. Would not recommend it. My wife had her pants stolen that she left to try to reserve our chair. Also keep an eye on your stuff by the pool. We had our float taken, asked the guard and he said people just take it and sometimes bring it back. I had to hunt it down and steal it back from 2 little kids. Another traveler had her shoes stolen, and yet another had her float stolen by two other kids, who parents thought it was fine they stole a float from a 4 year old girl. 4. Security, security, security....Being a police officer I was very concerned about security. Check your room to make sure the patio doors locks. Our neighbor and some guy try to sneak into their room from the patio door that did not lock correctly. Make sure you close your blinds when you leave so that people are not sure whether you are in the room or not, and leave a light on, you are not flipping the bill so who cares. They do however have plenty of security walking the grounds, not sure if they would really help you, but it made you feel safer.5. Entertainment...or lack there of...They seemed to have the same guy do the same routine every day. He works really hard because he starts from morning, and wraps around to the disco in the late night hours. I dont think that guy sleeps. We have a 2 year old and even he was bored and feel asleep on the guy. Get ready for Banana \/ Pina nightmares, If you have gone you know what I mean. If not, I dont want to ruin your fun...muhahaha They dont let kids in the Casino or Disco even with parents, and you must be on something to leave your kids with strangers in a thrid world country, so late night entertainment was a no go.All in all, would I go back, probably not. Nice place, beautiful grounds. I just needed real food. thats all for now!
