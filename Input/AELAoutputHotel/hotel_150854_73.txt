{"text":"Excellent Visit Being Canadians, we visited the hotel during the Canadian March break. We found it to be an excellent vacation time. The hotel was neat, clean, quiet and nicely decorated. The staff, from the reception desk to the room maid, though sometimes short on English, seemed genuinely eager to do all they could to make our stay enjoyable. There was a bit of a musty smell when we arrived but it aired out quickly. We liked the balcony with the rockers and the bar fridge was always well stocked.The food was plentiful, good tasting and offered a varied selection. We ate most nights at the buffet and had no problems getting reservations. You only have to designate an eating time (6:30 or 8:30) on check-in and you are good for the entire stay. Long pants are required but jeans seemed to qualify. We tried the steak house one night and the Japanese on another and had no problems making a reservation without lining up. The pool was nice but small and we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use it because the ocean was much better. The water was warm and clear with a steady breeze to keep any bugs away. Beach loungers were plentiful but about half the loungers would be empty with towels draped over them to reserve them, contrary to hotel policy. And for those of you that came back to find your loungers gone and your towels in the sand, that was me.It was generally an older crowd but entertainment is available at the adjoining resorts. We took the monster truck tour and the reef snorkeling tours and they were well worth the money. I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ recommend wandering off the complex property by yourself though.The only problems we had were a squeaking toilet that took 4 maintenance visits over 4 days to finally fix and no running water in the rooms on our last day there. Bit of a ripe plane ride home.Things to watch out for:-baggage handlers at the airport are very aggressive.-charges for phantom phone calls on the hotel bill (could be the maids)-tap water undrinkable-rooms that face out on the sides generally get a lot of metal cart noises during the day.-adequate signage is a rarity. Be careful which bus you get on when coming or going. - whiney Brits explaining how they USE TO run the world (See a previous entry).Suggestions:-bring sunscreen from home. It is very expensive there.-bring a laptop as there is free wireless internet in the lobby (close to many bars...but then what isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ)and it is much cheaper to use Skype than the phone.-If you want snacks (chips, candy bars etc)...bring them with you.-bring Pepto bismal tablets, Tylenol etc from home-Ignore whiney Brits.All in all an excellent trip that I would do again next year.
