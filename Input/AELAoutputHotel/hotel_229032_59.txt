{"text":"Loved it!!  I traveled to Florence in hopes to find the fountain where my Dad stood in front of 67 years ago during WWII. I traveled with a small picture of my Dad that my Mom had told me was taken in Florence. I asked EVERYONE, taxi drivers, locals, tour guides and of course the staff at the Hotel Lucchesi, if they perhaps recognized the fountain. As the days went on with no luck, I had almost given up hope, when my hotel room phone rang with a voice that said I have good news and bad news. The good news is we have found the location of the fountain, the bad news is, it is in Rome. The voice was none other than the Concierge Michele. When I arrived downstairs at the desk, he provided me with the exact address and location and proceeded to make train reservations for me the following morning to Rome. I later found out that he had worked overtime on this project (at home) and with the help of Barbara, found what I came to Italy to see. Words will never express my thanks to Michele, Barbara and the Hotel Lucchesi. Besides all of that, we were upgraded to a beautiful balcony room overlooking the Arno, breakfast was great, perfect location...overall, fantastic! By the way, I have pictures of myself posing in front of the exact location that my Dad did 67 years ago. We are now both side by side in a frame on a wall in my home, and everytime I look at it, I relive my experience all over again when I first laid my eyes on the fountain. The trees have grown a bit and the cars are of course different, but I know that he was looking down at me and saying I knew you would find it, and you did! ","annotations":[]}
