{"text":"Beautiful  Me and my Boyfriend went for one week all inclusive at this resort and loved it! I honestly don't understand how people can pick this place apart. We came off a direct flight from Calgary, everything went smoothly baggage and the transportation to the hotel was awesome. We had about 60 people from our plane coming to the Occidental it was a bus full. Check in was amazing, even with this many people no one waited over 25 minutes, they are fast and the English at this resort is phenomenal, of course they still have some difficulty but compared to any other resort I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe been to (Mexico, Cuba, Mayan) this was the best for speaking English. The Buffet was amazing; they had a different selection each breakfast, lunch and dinner. The variety of the food is also good, lots of meats but also pasta and vegetarian items also. There was also 4 a la carte' The Italian and the Steakhouse are both delicious, try to book these ahead of time, or you get really late times like 9:15. We are both 20 years old and overly enjoyed this resort and i can also be quite picky but i had nothing to complain about. The rooms are a bit outdated but that was the least of my concerns on this vacation. There are a lot of couples at this resort, and people from all ages! The disco Mangu is actually on the Occidental Resort so if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a place with night life this is a good one. Everyone meets in the Lobby Bar right after night time entertainment. The Lobby is beautiful! There are plenty of bars, including a swim up bar. The beach is gorgeous, one of the nicest ones along the strip. Barely no sea weed! The entertainment nightly is incredible, it is a popular attraction basically everyone from the resort goes, they have wonderful choreography. i just thought i would share this with everyone curious, because there is a lot of mixed reviews out there, and if your heading on an all inclusive vacation, complaining should be the last thing you do! Relax, this is the place for it the resort is just beautiful!! The weather was good also just don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be upset if you wake up to a rain shower they last maybe 20 minutes, and its still warm outside ,the weather there changes constantly. Hope this helped any one who wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ quite sure of this resort! √à¬£¬∂?\/p> ","annotations":[]}
