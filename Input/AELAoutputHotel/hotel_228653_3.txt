{"text":"Nice, convenient I stayed at the America for 5 days on a business trip. I booked a superior room with wifi included; unfortunately, the wifi wasn't working when I arrived. But they had it working the next day and for the rest of the stay, and offered to knock of the cost of breakfast for two days to make up for it.I thought the breakfast was very good, very typical for a Mediterranean\/European hotel. (Note that breakfast isn't necessarily included in the price.) The room was nicely minimalist, the bathroom was very nice and included a bidet; overall the room was great. Other reviews have complained about noise, but didn't have any problems in that regard. The bed was the firmest bed I think I've ever slept on, but I liked it.A problem I had, which hopefully is not a chronic problem for the hotel, is that a small but noticeable amount of sewer gas was seeping in through the drains in the bathroom. The management was aware of it and was working on how to resolve it. Barcelona had been going through a pretty severe drought, and I suspect that inadequate water flow in the sewers may have accounted for it. As it was, I was able to solve it by simply opening the windows for a few minutes (I do like hotels that allow you to open the windows).Despite that problem, and the one day outage on the wifi, I'd gladly stay at the America again. It's not absolutely top drawer, but it's a good value. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0}]}
