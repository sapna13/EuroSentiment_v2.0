{"text":"Great service and accommodations First of all the location is fabulous. It is a 5 minute walk to the beach with many great restaurants, 10 minutes to the city business section and about a 30 minute walk to the end of La Rambla. The Bus Touristic has a stop right around the corner from the hotel.When making our reservations with Travelocity I had a triple room. For some reason I thought it was 2 rooms with a bathroom. I was wrong. Instead, I was given a one room with a king size bed and a small twin and the bath. I went to the front desk and they pulled my order. I told them what I thought I had ordered and they said, You have 2 adults and a child. I explained that the child was 17. They immediately checked and upgraded me, at no cost, to a business suite that had a room with a king bed and an office equipped with computer, desk, recliner chair, and coffee table, with plenty of room for a single bed. It was perfect. The bathroom was awesome.We were staying there for 3 days and traveling elsewhere for 2 weeks and returning at the end of our trip. The front desk reserved that same room for us on our return trip at no additional cost.The all-you-can-eat breakfast was great with all varieties of breakfasts from around the world. It was definitely enough to hold us over until Tapas time, with a gelato and espresso lunch in between.The staff was wonderful and accommodating. I give it 5 stars and will tell everyone to go there.By the way, the taxi from the airport was only 18 Euros, plus 1 Euro for each piece of luggage. I am not sure what the other person is talking about when they paid 38 Euros. Also, there is a train from the BCN airport to Estacio de Francia, and the cab from that station to the hotel is only 6 Euros plus 1 Euro for each piece of luggage.This hotel and it's staff is a real winner.
