{"text":"Good choice, from a parent's perspective Spent five days at Copamarina the week after Thanksgiving, with a two year old and a four year old. Property was only 1\/3rd full, so if you go during the busy season (Christmas-Easter, and then again June and July), you may have a different experience. The resort is a 2 1\/2 hour drive from the San Juan airport - all highway (toll roads) with plenty of places to stop along the way for pitstops, snacks. Unlike the US you dont get much notice about upcoming exits\/food\/fuel, so be ready to get off the highway at a moments notice. From the town of Guanica, the resort is 10 minutes on a narrow road that follows the coast. Guanica has a McDonalds, Burger King, mid sized grocery store, health clinical\/pharmacy, but not much else - if you run out of diapers etc, you can easily get it there.Food - we were on the all inclusive plan, but you ordered off the same menu as the non AI guests. Breakfast service started at 7am...dinner at the out-door cafe started at 630, and the more formal indoor restaurant at 6pm. Menus were varied and large enough that you wouldnt have to re-order if you stayed less than a week. Children's menu was available - pizza, hot dogs, grilled cheese, smaller portions of other entries as well. The staff was very flexible on allowing substitutes - could take french fries off and add brocoli, fruit etc to any menu item. Activities - five pools, two of which were knee deep and just for little kids, and a 3rd pool (main) that had a shallow area\/section. Jungle gym\/play area was located right off the outdoor cafe. Beach area wasnt very big, but water was very calm. As others mention, water was grassy and not that clear, but very child friendly in terms of access and safety. They had a tennis court but didnt see anybody using it, a spa and an indoor workout facility, plus a game room.TV - roughly 20 channels, most in English, including multiple HBO and Disney options, but strangely enough no ABC, CBS or NBC. Evening activity - not much. Aside from the solo-guitarist who played each night in the cafe, this was a very quiet hotel. If you are looking for dancing, gambling etc, you are in the wrong spot. If you are looking for a calm quiet family place - go for it.Computer - only downside to the hotel was that it offered wireless in the room, but we werent able to connect - we were in building 5, the furthest from the main building. There was one desktop with internet acess (free) and we never had a problem getting on...but again, the hotel was lightly booked.Overall a good place to go with small children as long as you want a laid back vacation.
