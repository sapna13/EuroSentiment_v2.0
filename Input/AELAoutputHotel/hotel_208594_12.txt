{"text":"perfect location budget hotel A perfect location for visiting Barcelona. Our room was pretty small, the bathroom was almost as large as the room but there was also a cute little balcony for viewing the street life below.I'd searched the web and using Trip Advisor had seen lots of good reviews for this hotel -- and I agree with other reviewers on the very good points of this hotel.The Hotel Urquinaona offered just what we wanted for a 3 night stay... we were out all day and just dropped into bed each night after tapas and tapas and sightseeing.There was a free wifi connection in the room and a free interenet computer just outside our door as well, plus a free bottle of red wine in the fridge. I've rarely seen a bottle of wine offered in 4 or 5 star hotels and often the more stars a hotel has the more it costs for Internet. Kudos to Hotel Urquinaona for a wonderful stay.Don't be put off by the 'just' one star listing for this hotel.Hotels in Barcelona are pricey and parking even more so. We drove down from Paris so the car needed to be in a parking lot... well, there was a public car park 50 meters from the hotel that cost nearly as much as our room for our stay. This hotel does not have its own parking, but it is a minor point.The hotel staff - on duty 24\/24 were very helpful and mutlilingual and the cafe just next door was perfect for breakfast or an afternoon drink though this street side cafe was a bit noisy perhaps, or just a nice city sound. It'll depend on your mood.This is a modest hotel in a big city at a fair price. Yes, I have stayed in bigger rooms for less in France and other countries, but they were way out in the middle of nada, nulle part, nowhere.If you're looking for value for money and don't need a huge room to spread out in, and\/or you are not planning on being in the hotel for much more than a siesta or short nights (you'll be in the tapas bars, restaurants, museums, wandering about almost all day in any case, won't you?)... then I do recommend this hotel.
