{"text":"Why? but tell me .....Why?????? Didn't we book for at least 2 or 3 weeks!!!!!!When you want to leave home to get somewhere down south, you're searching for a Paradise......The Bavaro Princess All suites resort is THE PARADISE. Nice gardens, a tram to help you get from the lobby to the beach , the beach to the room , the room to the Casino..... JUST PERFECT!Thank you so much to Veronique (Sears travel, St-Jean-sur-Richelieu) . Tes bons conseils et ton extr√à√Æ√∂me gentillesse n'ont d'√ã√\u2022√ñgal que ta grande comp√ã√\u2022√ñtence et ton beau sourire. Thanks to Enrique (Front desk) to make our check-in so easy go and smooth......Room: Beautiful room near the pool and the beach..........Clean (Spotless) room, udge, beautiful, AC working very well, even had to close it at a certain point because it was getting chilly), nice bathroom area, private toilet zone with closing swivel doors. Shower worked properly, no pressure problems nor hot water ones.Beach: The most beautiful place I ever ever saw. And I am a great traveller. Almost went everywhere around the world. And this beach is absolutely out of sight!!!!! Nice palapas, a lot of shadow areas not to burn under the sun which was present every single day.Bars: Thank you Maximo (Minimo) and Ruben (RRRRRRRRR)(pool bar); you did everything you could to give my husband a very memorable birthday.Thank you , Rrrrrrrraoul, for your delicious Coco Loco (hmmmm)and your smile.....The Buffets: Just excellent.... So many choices .... Every night is different at the Hispanola and at morning, 2 buffets are opened for the breakfast. I just can't understand why it looks like someones have problems to eat something good . If you are looking forward to eat Canadian or U.S. type of food, then , stay home.... You travel to find something new ..... to try new plates, and not to feel at home, but on holidays! Give them a chance and try some of the plates you don't know... you'll be surprise!Restaurants: All √ã√ë√∏ la carte Restaurants are fantastics. Bella Pasta: excellent. El Gaucho: Delicious with an Argentian Steak you could die for. El Pescador: Thank you Darling, his charming girlfriend and his fantastic team and also to Alberto, we will never forget what you did to make us really enjoy our meal. Sakura: wonderful, very , very good. Didn t try Chopin or Licey's.Massage: Don't leave without having the combo massage (80 minutes) . WOW!!!!!! Those girls at the pool Massage huts are the best !!! Thanks to all of you !!!!Jose. P. : Since we left and we are not getting our breakfast with you, life has changed dramaticaly. We are missing your Que Lo Que and OLA Amigo .....Language: No language barrier....where words are not enough, a us dollar make a very long way and a big difference.Well , now ....... Will somone tell us why...... why didn't we book for at least 2-3 weeks?Thank you all!!! We will be seeing you again next year !!!A la ProximaDave  Dyanna ","annotations":[{"endOffset":231,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":227},{"endOffset":824,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":820},{"endOffset":1120,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1116},{"endOffset":1715,"mention":"Canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":1707},{"endOffset":2014,"mention":"Pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":2009},{"endOffset":2014,"mention":"Pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":2009},{"endOffset":2014,"mention":"Pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":2009},{"endOffset":2313,"mention":"Chopin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chopin_vodka"],"startOffset":2307}]}
