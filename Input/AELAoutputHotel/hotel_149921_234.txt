{"text":"Screaming Kids, High Prices, Poor Service  I spent two nights in the Caribe Hilton and was quite disappointed. I booked an executive level room and expected to stay on the executive level. Upon check in, I was put on a standard floor (6th floor) instead of the executive level floors 9th and 10th. When I asked why they said that the hotel was fully booked. I later found out that they will sell an executive level room to anyone that is willing to pay an extra $100 dollars and then stick you in a normal room with access to the executive level lounge. The room that I was given on the 6th floor was noisy, dirty and quite old looking. The bathroom had rust stains all over the bath tub, walls and plaster falling from the ceiling. The carpet is well worn and needs to be replaced. When I got into the bed I discovered someone else√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hair on the sheets (Disgusting). When I tried to fall asleep I was kept awake by noise coming from the room above me. After I complained twice to the desk the hotel security finally took care of the problem. The next morning when I went to the executive level lounge for breakfast I was greeted with utter chaos. There must have been 150 people in an executive level lounge made to hold 25 people at the most. In addition to that there were plenty of screaming kids running around making lots of noise (I thought this was supposed to be an executive level lounge not a day care center). The breakfast selection was lacking. I also later found out that the complimentary beverages during happy hour are no longer complimentary (Cash Bar). This is the first executive level lounge that I have ever been in that charges you for a beer.The pool area is probably the high light of this hotel. Nice large pools and a beach area. The only downside is a million screaming kids. Service at this hotel is definitely lacking. The staff is very slow and makes no effort to help you. Just to get a waiter to take your order can take upwards of 1 hour in one of the hotels restaurants.The bottom line:OverpricedPoor ServiceDirty Rooms that are falling apartScreaming kids Executive Lounge is a ripe-offThe next time I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ in San Juan I will stay at the Ritz Carlton ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1737,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1733}]}
