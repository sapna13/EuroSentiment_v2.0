{"text":"Please don't make me go back! Our family just returned from one week at the Melia Caribe and Tropical. I won't go back. The service is completely nonexistent. We spent one week trying to get a blanket for my daughter's bed. We have three children so we upgraded to a family suite. My husband and I each had single beds (quite a surprise!). There was a trundle bed with linen for my boys. My daughter was supposed to have the couch but there wasn't any linens for her. We arrived in very late at night and had to wait over an hour with four phone calls just to get her sheets. However, we were never to get a blanket. We didn't have a do not disturb sign so we were often woken up by the housekeeper. Any special requests, such a late check out can take hours. It is extremely difficult to get reservations at the restaurants. They had a rule that if you were in a big group, you could only eat at 6:45 or 9:00 P.M. However, the restaurants were always half empty at 7:30 or 8:00 P.M. Once, we asked the waiter if he could turn down the air conditioning as it was freezing and he told us that it wasn't possible. It was impossible to change rooms. You could easily hear all your neighbors, the insulation was a joke. The food was decent, the beach was awesome, the weather fabulous. The staff was so unhelpful, it was ridiculous. Even on check out, they didn't even thank us for coming. No one, asked us the entire time, if we liked our stay. The activities never took place on time or at all. After this week, I am afraid to return to the Dominican Republic. A trip advsior member, Bloomfield Hills, Michigan ","annotations":[]}
