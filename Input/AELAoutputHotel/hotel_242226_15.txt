{"text":"Beloved jewel beginning to tarnish My family has stayed at Rincon Beach Resort for vacation over several years (7+ yrs). We have found the Junior Suites rooms that are poolside to be quite nice (or at least nicer) and have generally enjoyed the out of the way, quiet location.However, this time we booked a 2 room suite in the tower. The room was quite large, but the furnishings are VERY worn out. The room smelled very musty (it was mold in the furnishings) and they had to spray the room daily to keep the odor down.From the different rooms that I've stayed in, I don't sense that furnishings have been updated at all in any rooms that I have stayed in over the years since the hotel opened (significant scratches on wood furniture, subtle tears in curtains, worn fabrics on seating,...). THis was a radical difference from the quality of the San Juan Marriott (very high quality) that we stayed at this time as well - not what I expect from a Rincon Beach Resort that touts it's acclaimed amenities. (also, can't compare western style service to this. You've gone native here - service can be indifferent - very uneven standards - it's a boutique!)On the outside, the setting is very pretty and grounds and exterior are generally well maintained. The pool is the largest and deepest that we've found on the west coast of Puerto Rico. My son likes the small deep end (~5-6 ft). Most pools around the area are small and have no deep end.BUT:  * The pool STILL has EXTENSIVE black algae problems - they DO NOT maintain the pool well. * One day we were there, the jacuzzi was deep green! THey didn't bother closing it. Another algae problem that they reduced by the next day, but SHEESH!Also, if you book when there is a major event occurring, events are held in the open courtyard. The week we were there they had a film festival (nice) and a wedding. The wedding party had EXTREMELY LOUD music that ran past 11PM and reverberated throughout the rooms (most rooms face the courtyard). Definitely disturbing - typical - it's happened on at least 2 of our stays.The two bedroom suite was NOT worth the money.Bottom Line - * Stick with Jr Suite, * avoid school vacation times, * expect local crush on wkends, * expect low key, quiet surroundings, * pray for no special events because the noise is stifling* hope they fix the pool problems\/maintenance* hope they upgrade the worn out furnishings (don't count on it)* lunch menu at the cafe is good and reasonably priced* dinner is nice but overpriced. head out.* not too exciting for teens (nothing really to do), unless you take them up the road to surf ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1836,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1832}]}
