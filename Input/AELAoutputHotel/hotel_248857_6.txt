{"text":"Promised so much but failed to deliver The Mandala aspires to excellence but disappoints in service.With well-appointed rooms, beautiful interiors, a newly renovated spa and a smiling staff you'd think this hotel had it all.Unfortunatley that wasn't the case during our stay.To begin with they couldn't find our reservation.Three people at the front desk spent 15 minutes not finding it.I was then directed to their customer computer to find the reservation myself. Too bad their computer was out of order.I suggested that they call the site we used to book the roomThis came as an unexpected idea. At first they were reluctant...the lines might be busy (?!) but eventually the manager decided to give it a go.We were then sent to the bar for a complimentary coffee while they sorted things out.At this point approx. 45 minutes had passed since our arrival.15 minutes later someone arrived to tell us that they had located out reservation: it had been lost in the system but the manager with his special computer had been able to retrieve it.Sigh.She tells us that the room is made up for one but that they'll immediately send someone up to prep it for two.Four hours later no one has arrived.We call reception and they send someone up.However, for the rest of our stay there is still only one bathrobe and one set of slippers.In the beautiful newly renovated spa I'm hoping to get a massage so I go up to look at the different treatments available.A week after their new opening they have no brochures or any other printed material about which treatments they offer.They seem puzzled by me (all 7 of them staring at me when I ask for some information) and the spa manager promises to send something to my room.3 hours later (and too late for me to book a treatment) a thick manilla folder arrives full of information.Lastly, the bar. Which I love! Wonderful drinks and a nice ambience!We order the After Work special which they've advertised and receive champagne cocktails. After another drink and dinner (excellent kitchent) we receive our bill. The price for the After Work special is 11 euros whereas it was advertised at 5 euros. When I ask the waitress she looks confused and goes to speak with the bartender.She returns and informs us that there is no After Work special, only a Special drink of the day (full price).So while the hotel is lovely and the staff is very polite and helpful, the actual service level falls far short of what the hotel aspires to and promises.Not a tragedy, but it certainly detracts from the overall experience.
