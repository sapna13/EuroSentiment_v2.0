{"text":"If you do the math .. Not a bad hotel at all.We got the Amsterdam at 6am in the morning so I asked for an early check in. The man at the front desk told me that they can check me in early for 20 euro.I agreed to have it added to my bill so we could get to our room and sleep a couple hours.Well,he sent us to a room that was not cleaned from the previous guest yet,so I brought all the bags back down to the desk and they did provide a room that was clean finally.A least I was not charged at the end.They were good about that.I ordered a room with 1 bed( Queen ? )for 2 people( my wife and I ) and I was kind of disappointed to find that it was two twin mattresses pushed together , so there was this annoying gap down middle of the bed which made it impossible for us to sleep close.So,yes the bed sucked.The location of the hotel is a bit far from Central but I didn't mind the walk to the tram stop . Its is about a 10 min walk to the Tram and about a 20-25 min tram ride to Central Station . My main complaint with the hotel came on the morning we checked out . The night before , I had paid for the hotels Airport Shuttle  to take my wife and I to the Airport the next morning at 10:15 . The next morning I checked out at 10 am and the guy who checked us out says to me The airport shuttle is waiting for you right outside . So I check out and walk out front . No shuttle in sight. I walk back to the desk and ask where the shuttle is? He looks outside and says Oh no , It looks like they left.He said another shuttle would be along soon .No shuttle after an hour wait. I had to take a cab and almost missed my flight! I did the math and the few hundred I spent on Transportation ( 2 cab rides and 7 day Tram pass = about $340 ) , I could have paid a little more for a room in Central A-dam and not had to take a cab or tram at all . Next time I will . ","annotations":[]}
