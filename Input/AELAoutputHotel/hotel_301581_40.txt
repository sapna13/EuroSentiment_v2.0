{"text":"Sick of the North Tower... This is a huge hotel, linked to the Swissotel next door. The lobby has just been refurbed and is impressive. Unfortunately, it is effectively two hotels in one, the North tower and the South tower. The North tower (I am there now) is depressing and faded, with stained acrylic carpets, chipped sanitary ware and drab decor. The bed is really hard and uncomortable. I made mine bearable by using the bedlinen from the other bed in the room as an extra mattress pad. I mentioned this to the receptionist, and she said housekeeping would come to help. No-one came. The airconditioning cannot be controlled by temperature - only fan speed. It was really stuffy in the room and I woke up on my snooker table like bed bathed in perspiration. I have stayed here many times and the AC problem is immensely irritating as it is NEVER effective. There were hairs in the bathtub, and the satin coverlets were dirty. Room service was prompt, but the dish I ordered was not what I was expecting. I think this was my fault rather than theirs, but the items were not charged and there was no fuss either - so kudos for that. All rooms have balconies, but the sliding door doesn't fit well, resulting in traffic noise that requires earplugs. In summary;Rooms: Depressing, grubby, stuffy, beds like pool tables, noisy. Why bother? Better at a youth hostel. I bet the ones in Singapore are clean and well run.The South tower however, is superb, lovely beds, icy air-con, sparking bathrooms, Bose sound systems, flat screen TV, effective sound insulation - I loved staying there. On the Fairmont website there is no way of telling which tower you are in. Honestly, to stay in the North Tower is to waste your money. My company put me up here and I have had enough of it.
