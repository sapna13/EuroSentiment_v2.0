{"text":"Fantastic Hotel for Children My husband and I along with our two children (aged 7,9) stayed at the Dreams Hotel from 13\/3\/09 for 2 weeks. We all had a fantastic time and I would definately return to the hotel and recommend it to others visiting the Dominican Republic. The hotel was very busy during the two weeks, especially over the Easter Weekend, with the majority of guests being from Canada and America.ROOMWe had two double beds, which made the room feel quite small, but we had everything we needed, and it was fine for the amount of time we spent inside. The maid did a great job, and left us a variety of interesting towel sculptures.POOLThe pool was fantastic, and kept very clean. The towel situation is something you just have to accept. Whilst we were there the hotel instigated a new procedure, whereby you could reserve beds in the morning before 9am, but only if you were there as well. Lucky for our family, I am a natural early riser and got up most mornings at 7.30am to secure our position!! Pool Volley Ball and Water polo, along with Crazy Water games were all a great success.BEACHBeach was lovely. It was closed for four days during our stay due to the size of the waves and undercurrent. On the other days it was lovely and the kayaks were fun. The area in front of the hotel does have some sharp rocks, (there are signs indicating this), but to the left, it is fine. Just a quick reminder, the beach has a lovely cool breeze and the sea is cool, so you don't realise how burnt you are getting, Sun Factor 70 was required for our children.FOODWe all thought the food was very good. The breakfasts in World cafe were lovely. During the day a lady near Block 6, prepared fruit for you - the pineapples were wonderful. The Beach Barbie was popular and food tasty. In the evenings we tried the Sea Grill - lovely, Bordeaux - fantastic, and the Chinese - great, but most evening we were at the World Cafe, as it was so easy with the kids just selecting what they wanted.The bar service was very good, and drinks were always on hand.Ice Cream was available in the afternoons at the two bars in the pool area.KIDS CLUBMy 7 year old adored the kids club. The staff were very happy and friendly and the club was very secure and spacious with its own pool. He chose to go there in the morning and stayed often until 5pm, and wanted to go back in the evenings until 9pm. We registered him with the option of him coming and going as he pleased, but he chose to stay and was really upset to leave. On a couple of nights both boys went to the club at 6pm and went to dinner with the staff, so allowing us to have a quiet dinner by ourselves.ENTERTAINMENTThe Entertainment staff were very good and worked very hard. The days were packed with activities starting every half hour for Under 12's, Teenagers and Adults.Everytime you involve yourself in an activity \/ win a competition etc, you gain Dreams Dollars, At the end of the holiday, you can go to the Auction and bid your Dreams dollars for T-shirts, hats, horse riding etc, my kids got really into this and loved the auction, where we gained a T-shirt for $17000!Overall we had a fantastic holiday, and we hope to return to he hotel next year.
