{"text":"excellent place to stay The hotel it says it is rated a 3.5 star well. I think it is a little better than that. I have stayed at this hotel for 6 different years throughout my stay in Punta Cana. The restraunte are great they have plenty to choose from. The brazilian restraunte is great they bring out screws to you with different meat and vegtables on it to try. You will have plenty of food to eat because they keep comeing out to serve you. The Mexican restraunte is a sit down order of the menu for your main coarse and they have a buffet for your salad and side dishes. The asian is a sit sit down order off the menu for a coarse type meal, order the tuna it was great. They have a taco joints and a pizza joint you can sit and eat on a balcony, and enjoy there show if you eat later at night. The shows they perform at night are excellent. The buffet is great also there is many different things to eat there that will please your taste buds. The people that perform them have been there for years and are one of the best shows that I have ever seen at any other resort any where.
