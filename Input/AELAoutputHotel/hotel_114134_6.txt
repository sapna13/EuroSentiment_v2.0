{"text":"Quality hotel!!! We stayed at The Lenox for the second last weekend of November 2008 and left just before Thanksgiving -- we went to Boston as a shopping and site seeing trip.Loved it!Flew with BA out of T5 at Thiefrow, which was okay, but not as impressive as imagined it would be. On arriving at Logan Airport cabs were easy to come by and we paid $30.00 to get to the hotel which took about 20 minutes.The hotel had just been dec'd out for the holiday season and it was very classy -- we got a very friendly and proffessional welcome and our room was very impressive in terms of comfort. Not the biggest room in USA terms but had a big walk in wardrobe (which became handy!) and a 42 flat screen HD TV at the end of a huge King size bed. The bathroom was adequate.The Lenox staff are superb and nothing is too much for them - they get 10 out 10 for this.The location is top notch being just off of Newbry Street and around 15 to 30 minute walk (dependant on route) to the furthest shopping area of Quincy \/ Faniuel Market. The Prudential Centre and other shops are right on the doorstep.There's also plenty of sightseeing within 5 minutes walk and the Duck and Trolley Site Seeing tours can be picked up just around the corner.Also loads of eating establishments to suit every taste are on your doorstep and an Irish pub which does good food and lovely Baileys coffee is attached to the hotel.The hotel lobby offers The City Bar which is quite a trendy spot by all accounts (locals queuing to get in on the Saturday night) but is far from being rowdy at all.The hotel resteraunt served up two very nice breakfasts (not that cheap but worth it) and the menu seemed nice for lunch \/ evenings but we didn't sample. Again the service was impecable.The hotel is also a pick up point for the bus going to Wrentham Village which is a must if you are visiting Boston for some shopping --- that large wardrobe DID come in handy! The bus costs about $35.00 each and Wrentham will take you a solid day to do (we caught 8.00pm bus back). There's a coule of grills etc there so no problem for eating.I'd recommend doing the Old Town Trolley Tour (tickets sold at Lenox) which takes about 2 hours and one of those hop on hop off jobs. This shows you what a nice city Boston is and gives you some good history information.We touched lucky with the weather -- it was COLD but lovely and sunny and most importantly dry.As a final bonus we got the use of the hotel car to get us and our overflowing bags back to the airport. this cost slightly more than a cab at $35.00 but door to door service in an A\/C four wheeler with leather seats and complimentary drinks was worth it.We'll be going back to Boston once the credit cards recover and will DEFINETELY be looking to stay at Th Lenox again when we go.
