{"text":"Great if you are on a budget After reading reviews we decided to go for it and booked a 10 night stay at the Harbour Ville. For the money we thought it was very good. Because of the earlier reviews we did not expect too much from the breakfasts but did find something we could eat even if its was just toast and jam, the green jam was very interesting. We found local shops in the flats(apartments) at the back of the hotel where food could be bought, there is also a 7-11 store.We had a room at the back of the hotel and apart from some wholesome singing from the church next door it was mostly quiet.There is definitely some sex trade activity though there was never anyone hanging around outside the hotel.All the staff we dealt with were helpful and courteous we did ask for our room to be changed twice, the first one was on the 9th floor we did not look at that one.(We had taken note of problems with noise from Air con plant) Room 2 was on the 6th floor at the front we agreed to stay in it one night because of road noise. Room 3 was at the back, showing its age a bit but very clean, clean sheets, white fluffy towels and cleaned daily.We used the airport shuttle at a cost of S$35 to get from the airport to the hotel, we flagged a taxi down for the return journey this cost S$14.50.We have added this hotel to our list of will do again hotels ","annotations":[{"endOffset":307,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":302},{"endOffset":315,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":312},{"endOffset":330,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":327},{"endOffset":330,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":327},{"endOffset":330,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":327},{"endOffset":330,"mention":"jam","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fruit_preserves"],"startOffset":327},{"endOffset":1113,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1108},{"endOffset":1113,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1108},{"endOffset":1113,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1108},{"endOffset":1113,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1108}]}
