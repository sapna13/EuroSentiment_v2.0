{"text":"Best experience ever, so far I read the negative reviews and wonder if I stayed at the same resort, we stayed a week and had one waiter that was not up to standard, outside of that we had not one bad experience. There were always good food choices and the servers were great. I am an American so good food and resturants are plenty so I do not go to these resorts for the food. However the food here is as good as I have eaten in any resort in the Caribbean, Mexico to Jamaica. The room was always clean and the Excellenc Club was a well worth it upgrade, the food there was a nice mid morning or afternoon snack.The bus ride from the hotel was not great but a good time to see the country and the coulture of the people. All the rides we took were an experience in itself.I have been to several resorts and can assure you that if you have even half the time we did you will not regret the time spent at this resort or this country. The romantic atmosphere is fantastic and being able to see just couples and not kids running around added to the overall oppertunity to have a romantic experience and a great week.Any review I read with negatives is just not a picture of our week or experience. I would love to return and have exacatly the same experience I had the first time. I would love to warn you about something but the only thing I can say is, go to this place and set your standards as high as you like and you will not be disappointed.If a wait for a resturant or a towel not being in a certain place or some food not being available or a rough ride from the airport is not the end of the world for you then you can expect and will not be disappointed in your stay and a 5 star, first class place ","annotations":[{"endOffset":526,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":522},{"endOffset":581,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":577}]}
