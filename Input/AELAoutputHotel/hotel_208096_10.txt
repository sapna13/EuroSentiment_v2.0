{"text":"Excellent Location, Excellent Neighborhood! Chose this hotel after reading the many positive reviews. I wasn't disappointed and would stay again in a heartbeat. You can't beat the location--one block from RER\/Train  Metro stations, and right in the middle of the St. Germain des Pres neighborhood which is fun and lively! The hotel lobby is bright  contemporary. Celine at the front desk was fabulous and friendly. Everyone speaks English and they were all kind and very accomodating. I booked a Studio which was small, but all European hotels are small. I found the room to be very clean and very modern. We had a wonderful view of the Seine river. The pull-out bed was more comfortable than I thought and the kitchen was definitely a great amenity. Only snafu was there were no outlets in the bathroom. They supply their own hairdryer but the cord was less than 12 long and it hardly reached in front of the mirror. There was an outlet for an electric razor though. Bring your own converter plugs if you're like me and need to plug in a curling iron\/hot rollers. But bring along another mirror to glance in if you do. Also, I brought extra towels and toilet paper like one traveler recommended as they don't clean or visit your room daily. We were a 5min walk from the Lourve, Notre Dame, D'Orsay Museum and I'le de Louis, Concierge  the Fab neighborhood of St. Germain. I loved Rue di Buci which is the lively street behind the hotel with tons of famous cafes and shops. All in all, I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. It was a great choice for us and I thank all the previous travelers before me who encouraged me with all their positive reviews. ","annotations":[]}
