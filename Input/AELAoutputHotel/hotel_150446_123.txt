{"text":"My Ocean View ROCKS! Disclaimer: i'm 25 and a newlywed, so half the thrill of my vacation is being away with my husband of seven months, and I would be happy if I were to arrive at a much less classy hotel, as long as I have my bikini, a book, and the beach. I'm traveling with my husband and his parents and his brother and wife, so I didn't book the trip and I'm not paying for anything. So I won't talk about the prices much. I do know that it is expensive, though. My in-laws are, well, wealthy, and this is their 5th time here. They come for Christmas every year (the place is filled with Jews from Long Island and New Jersey this time of year, which is funny. We flew all this way, and it's like being back home. They spotted a friend from Temple at the pool!)That said, this place is gorgeous! They upgraded us to an ocean view, and I love it; the view is breathtaking. The room is really clean and modern, and they have JUST put in brand-new flat screen TVs. They participate in a water saving program, so the sheets are not washed every day, which I appreciate as a green-thinking person. The food is excellent at the poolside bar, but crappy at the restaurant closer to the beach. They're about 50 feet away from each other, but the difference in quality is astounding. The staff is super friendly and the pool-side service is great. They have a cozy jacuzzi and the pool is nice although once the sun goes behind the hotel (around 3 pm) it is unbearably cold! The beach access is convenient, and such a treat. I prefer to go sunbathe all the way to the left, where the locals are hanging out. (To get there, you have to wade through the el San Juan hotel guests... and they are snobby).The wi-fi is spotty, which is making us crazy as both me and the hubby are laptop toting people. there is NO drawer space in here, just three measly drawers that I took, and a closet. Hubbs is living out of his suitcase. Other than that, no complaints! ","annotations":[]}
