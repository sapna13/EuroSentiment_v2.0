{"text":"Great Location, Very Safe, and Modern-Clean My grandaughter (age 17) and I stayed at thisCitadines for over a week. Even though there were a few negatives,like having to ask four days in a row to have the room cleaned up and the towels re-freshed, it was a great stay. The staff is helpful, friendly, but not tooo friendly. The hotel feels and seems very safe; for us, two women travelling alone, this factor is significant. The rooms are quiet, also a plus. But the greatest element is the location. We were in walking distance of the Louvre, Notre Dame, Hotel de Ville, Shakespeare's bookshop, and the Pompidou. A Champion's grocery store is about two blocks away--convenient. We ate several times at Mamalina's--a hole in the wall Italian--very near the hotel. Our favorite is a great little bistro, Les Augustins, just a bit further down the street toward Notre Dame. My beautiful granddaughter who is a really foodie thinks that this is the best. She recommends the gratin du jambon. Finally, we ate in a not-touristy French restaurant, Ze Kitchen Gallerie. right around the corner from the Citadines. Walk a few feet past the sign for the Citadines Parking Garage on the side street. Even a blase French puppy dog resting under one of the tables communicated that this restaurant is the place to be! The restaurant deserves its good review in the Michelin Red Guide. There are many, many tourists in the neighborhood, but I hope to stay at this Citadines again and again. ","annotations":[]}
