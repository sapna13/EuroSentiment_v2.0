{"text":"Location is the draw I stayed here for 5 days last week. This isn't a place you stay for luxury. You stay because of the central location. In fact, the location couldn't be better. It's so close to Passeig de Gracia, and the metro stations. The other travelers at this hotel complained of street noise- what do you expect, you're in a major city! I had a single room facing the courtyard, so I wasn't subject to too much noise. The only noise I encountered was the sound of people slamming their doors and the loud American family staying next door (I'm an American and this is a plea to other American travelers- PLEASE do not embarass the rest of us, who are respectful, sophisticated travelers. I thought it was an entire group of students traveling. Much to my shock, it was one family of four making all that obnoxious noise. Unbelievable!) Anyway, there's a great market virtually next door (Mercat de la Conceptio) and a few coffee bars, and a lovely bakery. Skip breakfast at the hotel and go to the bakery or a coffee shop nearby. I agree with other travelers- La Rita restaurant (2 blocks away) is an absolute MUST. My only regret is that I went there my last night and didn't have an opportunity to go back multiple times; but, it was a great meal to end my great trip. The prices were shockingly low- I couldn't believe the quality of the food you got for such low prices. I've been to many 4 star restaurants that cost far, far more and I haven't enjoyed many of the meals as much as this little gem of a restaurant. Don't bother asking the front desk anything. They act like you ask for their kidney when you're only asking them a simple question. The front desk is cold, rude and utterly unhelpful. I may stay here again, just because of the central location, but the rooms are very small, and my experience with the front desk sort of tainted my experience.
