{"text":"Wonderful Water View  It was well worth it to book months in advance to get one of the few two bedroom, two bathroom suites (Suite 500). My husband and I were quite comfortable in the king size bed and our son found his queen size bed to be perfect for him. Both bedrooms had decent size private bathrooms.The view from the master bedroom was wonderful! We looked out at the water and at night we could see the Boston skyline beautifully illuminated. From the living room we also had a water view and could see the masts of the Constitution.We stayed at the Inn for a week and we would agree with other reviewer's comments about the breakfast buffet becoming uninteresting after a few mornings. Even though it lacked variety, it was a perfectly adequate buffet.The location was good for visiting Bunker Hill, the Constitution and for taking the water ferry to the Aquarium and the areas of the Freedom Trail near Long Wharf. In order to go to a game or a tour at Fenway Park, you should plan to leave adequate time to cross the bridge and walk to the T.We recommend dinner on the roof deck at the Tavern on the Water Restaurant (1\/2 mile from the Inn) for both the seafood and the water views. We also recommend the Cape Anne Whale Watching tours out of Gloucester rather than the tours out of Boston. We hung out with the humpbacks for an amazing and magical hour and a half! It was the highlight of our trip.
