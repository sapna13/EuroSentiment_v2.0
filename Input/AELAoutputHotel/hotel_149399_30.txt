{"text":"Roach Motel We choose the Melia Tropical a 4 star resort. The resort grounds were beatifully manicured, it was a host to may different types of wild life. There were Flamingos, Peacocks, and white Egrets all over the property. The food and service was very good, the themed restuarants Japanese and Mediterranean were the best. The resort staff were very friendly. I was a little irritated at the guys that stop you through out the resort no matter where you are to try to sell you time share. It got better, by the 4 day there they left you alone. I almost wish there was not going to be a  BUT but there is. This would be a perfect vacation in paradise if you liked sharing your room with roaches yes roaches (cockaroachus Disgusstus). Not the 1\/4 ones the 2 giant ones that run fast and fly OMG!!. After a long flight you want your first night to be relaxing. Unfortunately it was the first night that my wife discovered roaches were in the room. I killed them but did not sleep much that night worring about my 1 year old son. We changed our room first thing the next morning the resort staff were more than happy to accomodate. They told us it was probably because we were close to the beach. Not only will we not return to this resort we will not be traveling to Dom. Rep. ever again. Its one thing to see roaches on the property but in the rooms is unacceptable. At least by my standards.
