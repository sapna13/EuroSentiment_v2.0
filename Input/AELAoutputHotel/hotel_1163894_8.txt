{"text":"GOOD - BUT NOT A 5 STAR AS ADVERTISED Punta Cana: Gran Bahia Principe (Punta Cana section)Date: Dec. 12, 2008Reviewer: Cambridge, ONJust returned from a 2-week vacation at the Gran Bahia, Punta Cana. FLIGHT: Air transat\/economy class (Nolitours) - dep. delayed 3 hours. Packed like sardines, in-flight food out of a box. Nothing to brag about with Air Transat. We paid $35\/ea for the bulkhead seats (not worth it), yes you have the leg room, but the isle seat has been added to the row, and you are constantly being banged on, as people pass your seat in the isle. CHECK-IN: Done on the bus on the way to the hotel, great idea. Beer available in the bus for 3usd (if wanted). Upon arrival at the hotel, you identify your luggage, and right of way, you are driven to your room w\/your luggagge, no waiting, great.HOTEL: This resort is comprised of 3 hotels (Punta Cana, Bavaro and Ambar), and within each hotel there are several types of accommodations\/privileges, which are identified by sections(Golden, Premier, Ambar, Diamond, etc). The resort is massive, and for the first day, a liitle confusing. If you are not prepared to do alot of walking, and spend some of your holiday time doing so, there are buses that will take you around the resort, usually with very little waiting time. Your package will designate your priviliges and which restaurants\/pools, etc. you are allowed to go to.GROUNDS: Very nice, and well manicured, green and lush. No bugs.ROOM: Spacious w\/sitting area and balcony. Bathroom again very spacious and both very clean. AC a little noizy. Our room never did get cleaned until after 5pm. BEACH: Very nice, clean, ample chairs, however, you must be at the beach before 10am or so, after that, it may be a challenge to find a chair...and by the way, watch your stuff. We had our magazines (and chairs) taken on a couple of occasions. BARS\/DRINKS: We found the alcohol drinks to be watered down, we could drink margaritas all day\/night and not feel nor taste the alcohol. Mostly local brands, even though they advertise international brands, they are very very selective, I asked for a grand marnier and was told it was not included (had to pay $6usd) when it was visibly placed on the bar shelf. Something we have not experienced at any other all inclusive resort. If it's not included its not available. We were not impressed by this. One person in our group liked a certain brand of gin, which was included, however, we noticed that many times they would give you a local brand instead. Only after you asked did they change it to the international brand. We felt ripped-off. The wine, the worst we have ever had. ENTERTAIMENT: At the lobbie, some times live music, a solo pianist, etc. other times a DJ. The theme shows - typical. The disco, we never did go. FOOD: Buffet, not the best, most certainly not a 5 star (as proclaimed). More like a 3 star. A La Carte restaurants, we found to be good. We use our entire privileges on the A La Carte. However, Xmas eve dinner was a great one (huge selection of food choices, and special deserts). The wine is not good, and is the same at all the restaurants.STAFF: The best, always friendly and with a smile on, eager to help, and make your vacation a pleasant one. Knowing a little Spanish helps alot.VACATIONERS: Eastern Europeans (Russians, Polish), Canadians, Italians, Portuguese. Majority extremely polite, friendly and considerate of other guests, others extremely arrogant and plain rude. Even towards the staff we notice some rude remarks from guests, that were not called for at all. OVERALL: We had a great vacation, made the best of it. Howerver, we didn't find this resor to live up to the 5 star as proclaimed, or at the least not in the section we were in. Perhaps the Ambar or the Premier are a 5 star? but if that is the case they should advertise it as such, and not be misleading. This was our fourth time in Punta Cana, first time at this resort. We would not return to it, nor reccommend it.MOTHER NATURE: Some raining days, which would clear up quickly. Only one day, we were not able to make it to the beach, due to weather.
