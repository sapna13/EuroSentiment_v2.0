{"text":"Loved the Melia Benoa Scoured the web for a hotel in Bali. We wanted one in the quiet, sheltered Nusa Dua area but didn't want to pay a lot for a 5 star. Stumbled on the Agoda website offering the Melia Benoa for a lot less than any other company. Reviews of this hotel seemed good so we took a chance and booked. We were not disappointed! The hotel is comfortable, clean, and pretty. The beach and pool were always clean and had plenty of loungers available. The breakfast buffet included in our price, had a terrrifc variety. The dinner buffet was disappointing and we were glad we didn't buy the all-inclusive. The grounds are beautiful studded with palms and plumeria trees. There's a serene fountain area in front of the patio restaurant featuring water lillies, bromeliads and orchids. Pink bouganvillas drape around the room balconies. The sunrises are spectacular. You can take a cab to Kuta or Jimbaran about 45 minutes away to watch the sunsets or surf. There's too many hawkers there however. We enjoyed the quiet beach at Melia Benoa and those in front of the other beaches in the Nusa Dua area. There's a really nice beach walkway\/path which connects all the hotels. Visit the blowhole on one of the promontories; it's spectacular.You don't have to be an all-inclusiver to participate in the fun activities at the Melia Benoa. Our teenagers enjoyed archery, shooting, chess, beach volleyball, darts and pingpong.Do eat at Bumbu Bali or Seafood Warung (same owner). They're really close to Melia Benoa and you can call them for a ride.A friend recommended us an excellent and economical taxi service. Our driver, Mardi picked us up from the airport for free. He brought his laptop to the hotel the next day to show us pictures of all the sites we could choose to see. Together we planned a fun day of sightseeing: touring the greenest paddy fields, visiting local artisans, viewing a spectacular volcano and lake, lunching Bali style on a rooftop restaurant - sitting on cushy pillows round a low table. We ended the trip at a black sand beach where our teens played soccer with the locals. Mardi waited patiently till they were exhausted just wanting us to have a good time. He even invited us to his own home for dinner the next day. His young son performed a beautiful dance in full costume and the food was deliciously Balinese. Call Mardi at 081 2391 2108 (cell) or 0361-775550. You may want to take the white water rafting trip. We almost did but were so relaxed at the Melia Benoa, we scrapped the idea.We tried snorkeling in the calm water of our hotel at high tide. We didn't see any fish. At low tide you can walk on the reed and examine critters like sea urchins and crabs. Wear beach shoes. We took a taxi to the Benoa harbor to catch a boat out to turtle island and to try some offshore snorkeling. There were a lot more fish but too many waves. Turtle island was a small reserve for turles and a handful of other creatures like stingrays and snakes and a falcon. It was just OK! The water sports like snorkeling, parasailing, jet skiing and banana boat rides are probably the cheapest anywhere in the world. You can even do that outside the Melia Benoa. Our son learnt to ski and hired a surfboard for half a day at Kuta (where the waves are high) for a steal (after bargaining ofcourse)!If you like a good massage, Bali's the place for you. The hotel spas charge a lot. Just outside the Melia Benoa are some local women who will let you bargain for an equally relaxing massage. We enjoyed talking with them and getting to know them.The only thing I hated about our room (8182) is that the bathroom smelled bad, possibly because of a bad drain vent. We had rented 2 rooms and the one next door did not have that problem. I should have moved but didn't want the trouble of moving us all. The staff brought us some aerosol spray to keep the bathroom smelling nice but each time we flushed we had to spray!The best thing about the Melia Benoa is their service. We arrived late at night and needed extra pillows and drinking water. We got them in about 5 minutes. The waiters in the restaurant, the towel guy at the pool, and the activity crew were always so helpful and amiable.There's only one show at the Melia Benoa and there's Karaoke most nights. So if you like the night life, you may want to go to Jimbaran. The Melia Benoa is rather laid back - just the way we wanted!
