{"text":"Good hotel in an affordable price We checked in at Hotel Miramar at around 1am. The receptionist were accomodating. When booking for a hotel, always note that you want the room IN THE NEW BUILDING. Those who hate the Miramar Hotel prolly stayed at the old building. I read here in trip advisor to request for a room in the new building. I did and we stayed in this clean and good room. It was being cleaned everyday. Here is what I like about the Hotel:1. Clean room and complete amenities.2. The pool was great. Not much people so it was ok and we enjoyed the good view.3. We had a free breakfast. The breakfast buffet was awesome and complete. 4. The people who works at Miramar ARE EXCELLENT AND ACCOMODATING.5. They have a free shuttle service to Orchard Road and Chinatown. 6. All the cab drivers know Miramar Hotel.7. You can ask for the adapator (plugs) at the receptionist.8. We missed this one, but they have a bar downstairs. 9. The hotel is right next to a gasoline station and they have a convenience store.10. The Hotel is situated in a peaceful and beautiful area.11. You can walk to Chinatown and Clarke Quay (long walk).12. There is a bus stop in front of the hotel and many taxis are waiting outside the hotel.13. There is also a souvenir shop near the staircase. The shirts and biscuits are way cheaper than those at Sentosa. The price of the souvenirs are excellent!
