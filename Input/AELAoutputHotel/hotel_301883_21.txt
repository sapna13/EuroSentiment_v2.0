{"text":"A really Amazing Hotel... When we arrived in Bali is was quite late in the evening and therefore the drive from the airport to FS Sayan is quite daunting as the small villages you pass through are dimly lit and you don't quite know what to expect. When we arrived at the hotel, we were greeted with a welcome drink and flowers (it was our honeymoon) and the staff were so friendly and really could not do enough for you. Our suite was beautiful, it was on 2 floors and was huge. As it was night time when we checked in we really did not appreciate how beautiful our surroundings were until the morning - it is absolutely amazing! You really feel as though you are in the middle of the rain-forest! The 2nd night we stayed we tried the in-room romantic meal- WOW! The food was fantastic and the in-room waiter we had was so attentive but not over the top! After a few days we moved down to the FS Jimbaran Bay and the transfer by the FS private car was really good to. The driver on the way down stopped at the rice fields for us and then again at a small temple. The FS Sayan staff really are a credit to the hotel and they helped make the first few days of our honeymoon excellent. PS. I was a bit concerned that I was going to get eaten alive by Mosquitoes at this hotel due to its location - however, they gave you spray to put on and constantly light mosquito coils in your room - and we never got bitten once! PPS. the frogs are really noisy at night time! :) ","annotations":[]}
