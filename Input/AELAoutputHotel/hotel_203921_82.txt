{"text":"Top service at this small and friendly hotel! I stayed here with my husband and a friend last weekend. What a fantastic choice! Urged on by the Trip Advisor recommendations of good service we chose this hotel for our final weekend in Tuscany and it did not disappoint. From the second we pulled up in our hire car we were made to feel welcome and at home. The front of house staff are simply fantastic. They recommended great restaurants - and before we ventured out each day they checked our arrangements as there was a festival going on and not all activities and exhibitions were open as advertised. The staff phoned ahead, booked taxis, arranged tickets and did simply everything to make sure our days went exactly as planned. The hotel itself is in a cool, quiet part of Florence away from the hustle and bustle of the city centre which is a 15 \/ 20 minute stroll away along the banks of the Arno. If it's too hot to walk there are 2 bus stops just over the road and taxis arrive within minutes of being called. Our rooms were nice enough with window shutters and good air conditioning (essential!!) and all the amenities you'd expect in a 3\/4 star hotel including king sized beds, mini bar and satellite TV. Breakfast is a cold buffet and the happy hour provides free wine \/ soft drinks and nibbles on the terrace between 6.30pm and 8pm. But it is the staff who make this hotel - I can't praise them enough - they were superb! ","annotations":[]}
