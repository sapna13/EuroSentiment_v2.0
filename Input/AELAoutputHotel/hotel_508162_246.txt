{"text":"A Nightmare at Dreams - Please take this advice...terrible hotel! I'm a traveler. I've traveled all over the world and stayed at many, many hotels. Dreams is a 2+ star hotel masquerading as a 5-star. Please beware when booking a trip here. I'll tell you why...The only good thing about this hotel is the grounds...they are beautiful. But immediately upon your arrival you will be greeted, or not greeted, by only the beginning of the most unfriendly staff you will ever have the displeasure of meeting. No one speaks English except for the management, who stay hidden and unapproachable. The hotel advertises top shelf liquor included under its all inclusive umbrella, but if you watch, the bartenders all go into a room behind the bar to pour that top shelf liquor. If you don't specify, you get the NORMANDY brand, which is awful. Also, wine is not included, other than the rotgut house wine that no one with any taste would drink. My family and I ended up spending money to buy wine every night with dinner. Speaking of dinner, the food is verging on rotten. Out of all the restaurants, only one (Bordeaux, the French Restaurant) is edible. The World Cafe presents a huge buffet complete with flies all over the food and NO AIR CONDITIONING.I'm suprised more don't get sick due to the lack of cooling under fruit, fish, etc. The Seaside Grill has a funky taste to its meat and the servers are the worst I have every experienced. The Mexican is Mediocre at best, and the Japanese is awful, other than the show your chef will put on at the hibachi.Upon first glance, the rooms look nice...four poster bed, mini bar, etc. The mini bar is NOT stocked with alcohol other than Dominican beer. There is no air conditioning in the bathrooms and the air conditioning in the rooms is subpar. The rooms are NOT cleaned well and the hotel is virtually falling apart. On our third day at this resort, I fell in my room because the ceiling was leaking and the floor had become slippery. I hit my head rather hard on the cement wall, and when my mother called the front desk to report a MEDICAL EMERGENCY it took them 25 minutes to get to my room at which point I was sent 1 1\/2 hours to the nearest hospital in a cab through some of the sketchiest and prostitute ridden shanty villages I have ever seen to spend six hours at a hospital with blood spattered on the wall and vomit on the floor. What if this medical emergency had been life threatening?Because this hotel is in the middle of nowhere on the edge of the jungle, it takes too long to reach anything including the hospital and airport. The roads are terrible, marked with potholes that don't allow any vehicle to go over five miles an hour. On our way from the airport, I watched two people vomit on our bus due to the bumpy ride that no one warns you about before your road trip begins.My family and I paid a little extra to be club level which would allow extra perks, such as not having to run around the hotel trying to find someone to provide towels, and free internet access. The staff in the club was helpful, but not up to par with that of other hotels claiming five star status. After much complaining we were sent a bottle of wine on the house, but it was not one we drank or had ordered any of the other nights. No one thought to check, they just picked the cheapest one. They talk a good talk but just can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ deliver - not worth the extra money.The pool is always dirty, as are the restaurants, rooms, spa, etc. The cushions at the pool are filthy. The entertainment is laughable. The service is abhorable. The morning of our departure we actually had a toast to leaving. Dreams Punta Cana has only been in existence for six months, prior to that is was another resort. They want to be a five star luxury resort, but fall very, very short. If you are a member of the Dreams Punta Cana management reading this, my advice would be to rethink your management and top level staff and downgrade your star status to three to avoid anymore reviews like this one.If you are a traveler considering this resort, please, please, please heed my advice or suffer a vacation from hell as my family and I did.
