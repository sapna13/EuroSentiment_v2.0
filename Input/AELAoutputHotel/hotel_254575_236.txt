{"text":"Great stay at the Luna  We stayed in the Luna  Simone hotel (Simone side) March 24th through the 29th. The hotel is just as all the reviews state. The rooms are absolutely spotless. We saw a housekeeper vigorously scrubbing down the shower in another room like it where her own bathroom. The room is somewhat small but gives you a feeling of staying at a friend's house (just as another had posted). The hotel is comfortable and met all our expectations.Luckily, we had a room with a balcony that gave us a nice view of Belgrave road. The French doors to the patio were helpful in cooling the room during late afternoon. (Note: to lock the balcony door, pull the handle up.) We did not notice road noise however; we live within a mile of a major interstate in Texas and may be use to the noise.The breakfast was great (one fried egg, two slices of bacon, beans, toast, hot tea, and orange juice). We heard many people asking for more items and the owners were very accommodating with the request. There were other options but we stuck with the plate above. The owners are on site and quite friendly (actually fun to chat with). The owners are two brothers that look quite similar. They actually serve breakfast to the guests.There is a bus stop literally outside the front door. Also, there is a Sainsbury store about two blocks away that can be used for a low cost dinner. In addition, there is a small convenience store not even a minute's walk away that stays open late.A computer with internet access is available to all guests.Overall, we highly recommend the hotel. The location and service are great. Cleanliness can not be beat.
