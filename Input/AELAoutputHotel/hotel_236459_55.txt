{"text":"rude staff I am shocked to read other reviews saying how helpful the staff was. The front desk was anything but helpful. I spent 3 nights there and upon check in the room's air conditioning did not work. When we returned later that evening it still was not working. When I went back to the front desk the man working the desk came up to the room with me. The fact that the unit was blowing (hot air) meant to him that the air conditioning was working. When I asked about another room, none was available. I called my tour operator for suggestions and they spoke to the hotel, suddenly there was another room available. Air conditioning worked occassionally in the second room. When asking for bus number information we were told there was no buses to the Eifel Tower. Of course there are buses to the Eifel Tower. We were helped only when we questioned him and at that point we were a large inconvenience to him even though no one else was waiting at the desk. He was also rude about use of computer which is in very poor condition. Monitor is extremely difficult to read. Rooms were clean and hotel is in a good location but the staff at the reception desk were far from helpful. I would not stay here again nor would I suggest it to anyone. It might be a good hotel if you are part of a tour group and do not need any information or suggestions from the front desk (no concierge). Also small animals are allowed so a dog barking from the courtyard was not unusual early in the morning. ","annotations":[]}
