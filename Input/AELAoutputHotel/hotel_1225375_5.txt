{"text":"Enjoyed my stay! I was a little worried after I booked my room at this hotel and read some of the reviews on Tripadvisor. I guess that just goes to show that you can't (and shouldn't) believe everything you read.My stay was very good. I was lucky enough to reserve a king suite, which was actually two seperate rooms, a living room area and a seperate bedroom. Both rooms were quite spacious and both had a large LCD tv. I stayed at this hotel for 4 days and each day my room was cleaned to near perfection. My only suggestions would be to add a clock radio in the bedroom of the two-room suites and have maintenance change the HVAC filters. I did notice the front desk staff lacked uniforms and name tags and many of them seemed to be new employees, lacking some guest relation skills one would expect in the hospitality industry.The area is a mix of Latino and Korean cultures, but I found it to be quite interesting. There are many native restaurants in the area that served very good food. I did not see the adult porn businesses others have described and I felt quite safe walking around the area during the day and early afternoons. The hotel is only .8 tenths of a mile from the LA convention center and downtown LA. My rate was extremely lower than most of my friends rates staying in downtown at the high rise hotels. As a matter of fact I had a MUCH larger room than a friend had at the Marriott and my rate was over $100 less than his. In other words, I saved over $400 by staying a little up the road from the excitement of downtown. If I ever return to the LA area, I would not think twice about staying at the Clarion Downtown LA hotel. Thanks for making my first trip to LA a fun time. ","annotations":[]}
