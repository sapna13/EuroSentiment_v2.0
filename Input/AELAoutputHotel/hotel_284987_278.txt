{"text":"Nice place to stay - but not 5 star Checkin was quick and politeWe were brought to our room in a small golfcart kind of car which was very cool. The bell boy was pleasant and nice.We were famished because we hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ had anything for the entire flight, so headed straight to Mirador grill for snacks. Good enough snacks to fill your stomach till dinner.We had a few cocktails there which were very good.We then went to make our dinner reservations. The reservation desk has a lot to improve on. First thing, they have to learn to smile, that goes a long way in making customers want to come back to the hotel. Sadly, that was missing. We got reservations for 10:00 pm that day and the next in Toscano and Avocado respectively. Both the restaurants are very nice √à√\u2020\u2022?great service. Oh and we had to wait in line for 15 minutes and even after the last person before us left, the person in the reservation desk was acting busy entering something on the computer, and acknowledged us after we said about 3 √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢i√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂√à√\u2020\u2022?and √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√úxcuse mes√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?terrible.The other thing is their tour desk. You are better off booking tours privately. There are many tours that pick up from Paradisus, and they are a lot cheaper too.I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know about this and I booked it through them. I called them before leaving home and confirmed that they received my credit card details for the snorkeling trip. They said they did (they lied). When I went that morning all ready for my trip they say that they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ receive any payment. I was fuming but then what could I do? and they looked at me as if I was over reacting. Luckily the snorkeling trip was not full that day, so we could goThe next day, the bio bay trip that I booked through them was canceled for some reason. They didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even bother trying through other tours. Again no apology either. She simply refused to help. I called 12 other tour operators and finally could go (after spending 30$ on phone calls).No efficiency at all and they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother to make up for any of the screwups they do. We almost missed the bio bay trip which is a must do if you go to PR because of their inefficiency. The tour desk is a joke.The good things:Wait staff - They are amazing. We were always greeted by genuine polite smiles. They are efficient and always ready to please.Lobby bar - very beautifully furnished place, nice to relax and have a conversation or enjoy the evening showersRoom √à√\u2020\u2022?Marble floored, with an oversized bathroom. Very comfortable and cozyProperty √à√\u2020\u2022?beautifully done and maintained. The pool is beautiful, but was always crowded so we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go there much, we did other trips outside, and so we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really miss the water. We took a walk along the sea shore. Even though the beach is nothing much, the view of the water, coconut trees and the calmness was very appealing. Bring bug spray! Kayaking and peddle boats are free, we did that and it was fun!The restaurants were ok. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like the food that much, but that might just be me. The teppanyaki in Bamboo is worth seeing. The display of cooking was great! Taste was ok. I liked Toscano the best (I generally like Italian food more). My husband said he liked avocado. Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go to Romantico. Went to Caribeno for lunch and breakfast, it was good. Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like the Mirador Grill because there were birds and insects around. Not a big deal for most people, but I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like it √à√\u2020\u2022?no complaints though, there were other options for breakfast and lunch. Only for snacks we went there.Overall a nice place to go to, but it did not live up to the 5 star expectations.
