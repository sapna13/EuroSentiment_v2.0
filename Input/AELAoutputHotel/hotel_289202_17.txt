{"text":"Glorious Hotel What a glorious hotel!! My new wife and I had been to Italy on our honeymoon. We had just come from Milan where we had a disappointing hotel stay (I booked without consulting Trip Advisor). Furthermore, I had heard rooms (and particularly bathrooms) in Venice were tiny. So my expectations were lowered.When we arrived at the Venice train station, we took a short walk over a nearby bridge and viola, the hotel was just a few doors down right on the Grand Canal. Francesca greated us with warmth and ebulience (noting that it was our honeymoon). The lobby\/bar area was charming and cozy. She personally escorted us to our room (312). It was beautiful and surpringly spacious. The was a desk, a separate sitting area with a table and two chairs. The bathroom was also spacious and nicely appointed with murano (sp?) style glass fixtures. Everything was also spotless! The bed was large and comfortable. There was a tasteful work of art, and the room had a very elegant, gilded element to it. But the best part was the windows. Another reviewer noted that he did not think a deluxe view room was worth the extra money unless it was on the second floor, which have small balconies. While I would agree balconies are even better, I would respectfully disagree. We had a nearly panoramic view of the activities all along the upper part of the Grand Canal. It is true that the hotel does face the main train station, and the bus station is visable. But it was easy for me to let my eyes wander down at the canal level, I loved the sights and sounds of the waterway. However, once we clossed the windows we were pleased to discover the soundproofingwas quite satisfactory; we slept well at night, It was a deluxe room, and came with a supply of complimentary coffee and teas. Internet is free of charge in the rooms. When we mentioned that we had a laptop, but no connecting cable, she had one brought up for us to use. There was a nice coninental brekfast every morning that I would recommend for 7 Euros. Since anywhere in Venice is theoretically no more than about a 30 minute walk, or a comparable vaparotto (water bus) ride, its location works quite well. The front desk, whether it be Francesca or the very helpful and humorous man whose name I cannot recall that splits time with her, is alway there to help with a restaurant recommendation or a suggestion about what to do.Overall a complete treat to stay there!
