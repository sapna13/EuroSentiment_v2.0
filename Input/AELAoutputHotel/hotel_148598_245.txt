{"text":"Fun in the Sun We stayed at the Rio Mar for 6 days and 5 nights and had a great time. The moment that we checked in we were upgraded to an ocean suite. The beach was alot of fun because it had waves but it was never rough. There were always plenty of beach chairs and it was never crowded. You have beach side service where we ordered numerous drinks and lunch each day. The pool was also very nice with a small slide and a volleyball net for the kids and kids at heart. The golf course also looked very inviting although we didnt play. The entire staff at the hotel were friendly - we never experienced any rudeness as some of the reviewers mentioned. Each time we asked for suggestions on local eateries they were always very helpful. We found that almost EVERYONE spoke english to the point where it was a bit disappointing because we wanted to feel like we were very far away from home. The Food at the Grille Restaurant in the hotel was our favorite - Best Prime RIb Ever and we are from New York which makes us big critics when it comes to food and service. If you are from a large city in the US like we are, prices will be more or less the same at all the restaurants. We thought all the restaurants in the hotel were very good. But renting a car is a must so you can go to the local eatieries and get a taste of real Puerto Rican Fare at inexpensive prices. The Yunque Rain Forest trip is a must do and it will give you a sense of accomplishment after hiking a mile up or down to the waterfalls and help rid some of the guilt from the thousands of calories that you have taken in so far with the Pina Coladas and Puerto Rican empanadas. The casino is closed until October and there wasnt any nightlife except the lobby bar which had live music. Dont bother going to the casino that they shuttle you to. Take a drive to El San Juan Hotel in San Juan..it is well worth the trip. The drive is about 30 minutes on rt 66 to 26 and it is a great place to go for gambling, lounging and dancing...all right in the lobby! It was action packed and a great place to visit and win some money but we were glad to return to our hotel at 430 am to serenity and relaxation. I dont recommend this resort for kids unless you plan on spending every waking moment with them! We chose not to take our kids and that was the best decision. I would recommend the Club Med in Punta Cana for that which have many more organized activities. But if you want a relaxing vacation with your significant other and enjoy a resort with all the comfort that you need, the Rio Mar is a great place to visit. My only complaint is that the drive to the resort when you enter the compound is a bit confusing. They have two signs, one that says turn left to the country club\/condos and one that tells you to turn left to the resort when you should actually drive straight forward. We turned left towards some other area under construction and wasted time trying to figure out where we needed to go. But once we got there, the view to the rainforest in the front of the registration entrance was breathtaking. We loved it!
