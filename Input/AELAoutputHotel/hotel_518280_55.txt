{"text":"Consistently friendly staff Hotel Grace Exceeded our expectations in so many ways.1. From the beginning the hotel was very accomodating with our early check-in. 2. Very quiet hallways and rooms.3. Loved the bathroom - a big shower, nice fridge to keep cold drinks and lots of counter space. We also really appreciated the fluffy towels and large mirrors too.4. The beds and pillows were super comfortable and the linens were nice.5. The continental breakfast was delicious. It was the perfect place to get some real food while on vacation (yogurt, great fruit, bagels, bread, croissants, real orange juice (not Sunny D), and a fantastic choice of coffee. The breakfast made our day and we really appreciated the long availability of it. 6. What we noticed and appreciated the most was the consistency of the competant staff working at the hotel. From the front desk (24 hours) to someone to hail a cab early one morning, to the guy serving breakfast and the cleaning staff. All were very personable, knowledgeable and professional.7. For the price, coupled with the location and quality of the hotel this hotel was the best of the three hotels we stayed in while on vacation in NYC.8. We liked the idea of staying at a hotel with a pool. Late at night the pool turns into a bit of a pick up place by the looks of it. We didn't use the pool for this reason, but again - really loved that it could be used 24 hours a day.9. We would recommend this hotel to anyone wanting to stay steps from many NY attractions, with all the comforts of home.While the rooms were well sized the platform that the bed was on took up much of the space of the floor. This is not for someone who has any physical limitations - climbing up on and getting off the bed can be tricky - even for this fit twenty-something aged person.Definately, this hotel knows what it is doing. We happily recommend this to everyone.
