{"text":"Lovley Trip I took my mom to Rui Naiboa as a Mother's Day gift. I liked the fact that they took your picture upon arrival at the airport. From the time we stepped in the hotel we were treated like royalty. We were greated by Juliana who is the most professional person I have ever met, and she has the prettiest smile very welcoming. I travel alot to different Islands, and I think the service here was better than any other place I' ve been in the caribbean (Costa Rica, Jamaica, Panama, VI., etc.) We were put in a room facing the pool, which was a nice view. The whole room was spotless, I have read others reviews about the rooms having mold and being dirty, no towels( We didnot face this problem). Our bar was completely stocked which my mom loved. After about 30 minutes Juliana called to make sure that our room was acceptable and asked did we need anything( I like service like that). We had fresh towels everyday, the room was cleaned everyday, and the bar was restocked everyt wo days. One complaint that I do have is the food, it was not good and I got sick the second day there( Mom did'nt get sick). I think they leave the food out to long and it goes bad. Overall it was a good trip that my Mom will never forget. We went on the glass bottom boat, went swimming with the dolphins, went parasailing, and just laid on the beach. We didnt leave the resort but overall it was a wonderful experience and I would recommend that people give this all inclusive resort a chance.
