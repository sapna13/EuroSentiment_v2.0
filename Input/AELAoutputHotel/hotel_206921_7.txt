{"text":"Surprisingly Dissapointed Just came back from a 4 night trip. Incredibly disappointed and shocked to find good reviews about the same hotel I had stayed in. The only positive about the hotel is its location. It is a few blocks from Las Ramblas and close to other popular spots. We were able to walk to the Sagrada familia, the Cathedral and Museu Picasso from there, approximately 20 minutes. Also close to the metro. There is a bus for about 3.75 from the airport that stops in front of the hotel; one of my coworkers took it, approximately 30 minutes by taxi. Taxi is about 30 bucks each and that includes an airport surcharge. Hotel room is very small, two twin beds make up a double room. I was a literally a few inches from my coworker. There wasn't much room to walk around. We were on the third floor. Our other coworkers were on the 6th, and that room was much larger(same twin beds) Room was extremely hot during the day even after someone looked at it. When we complained at the desk we were told that we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ in America and the air conditioning isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the same, even though the lobby√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ temperature was acceptable. Almost every person at the front desk was rude and unfriendly. They never looked up, never smiled, and never greeted you. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe never experienced anything like it, was very surprised. When the front desk clerk heard me speak Spanish after a short conversation we had in English, I was admonished because I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak my pathetic Spanish first. This type of behavior does effect your mood even if you are trying to make the best out of it. Phone message system does not work. They left us a written message underneath our door, hours after the phone call. WORST OF ALL, THE HOTEL√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©? COFFEE WAS TERRIBLE, YUK. Breakfast selections were decent. Walk to any coffee shop\/restaurant in the area and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be extremely satisfied with the coffee. Barcelona is very beautiful and defiantly worth a visit. Good customer service will not be found here, there has to be better hotels.
