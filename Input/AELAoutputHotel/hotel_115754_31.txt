{"text":"Good Deal 1) The rooms are clean, good size, and very reasonably priced2) The complimentary breakfast is very satisfactory- and its included in your stay! Even better! They have make your own waffles, really good!, hot eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage, bagels and toast, pastries, fruit, cereal, etc. AWESOME BUFFET FOR FREE...oh, and I need to mention that 24 hrs a day they have hot water and assorted teas, Seattles Best coffee and decaf for free in the lobby.THE ONE DOWNFALL THAT NO ONE WARNED ME ABOUT:The location is only so so. You are right next to a freeway entrance basically - we had a lovely view of the 5...or the 405...whatever it was. One thing the hotel does provide is a shuttle (that runs until 9pm) that goes downtown, to the Space Needle and the Seattle Convention Center on the hour and will pick you up as well about a quarter past the hour. (Downtown is about a 3 minute drive, or about 6 blocks from the hotel - not bad... a cab ride is about $5). Last but not least, there is complimentary internet which is always convenient - and its not hard to connect to, which is a plus as sometimes hotels make it really difficult to access their internet system...Definitely Recommend this hotel b\/c the price is so reasonable for all the amenities - I would just recommend possibly looking into other options more centrally located so you can walk out your door and into the heart of downtown- rather than looking out your window at rush hour traffic.
