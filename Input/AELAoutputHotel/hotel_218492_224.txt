{"text":"Neither Grand nor an Oasis We (3kids  wife) rented 2 rooms over Christmas\/New Years Break. Wife and I stayed in the Suites for $50 extra per day. We had no AC the entire week and they would not give us a different room even if we took a downgrade. Kept telling us it was going to be fixed then on the 3rd day told us it was a hotel wide problem but our kid√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room had AC the entire time. Frig didn't work (warm beer - yeah) and when we went to get ice - no ice machines, had to walk all the way down to the bar (200 yds away). Couldn't get a beach towel or seat at the beach for the 1st 2 days sorry we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e really busy√à√\u2020\u2022?that was the standard reply anytime you ask for something from staff. They allow merchants to set up INSIDE the hotel grounds so every time you walked to a meal or the pools someone was trying to sell you a timeshare or carved coconut, very annoying. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e like me and need the shade, it was very limited unless you wanted to get up at 6:30 and do the towel save move and they had no umbrella√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ to use or rent. Hotel was understaffed, not doubt. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see staff sitting around, those who we saw were running and hustling, just did not have nearly enough. Most breakfast meals you had to find someone to get you coffee only to get blown off and had to get it your self. All-inclusive was weak. No bottled water, no bottle or cans of beer √à√\u2020\u2022?everything was served in small 10oz plastic cups, didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ matter what you ordered. Couple of stations were you could get self-serve water or soda√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ rarely had cups (understaffed problem) so you had to go to one of only 3 bars for the entire hotel and wait in line.We used Apple Vacations who were of no help with our room situation, beach towels and other problems, they were only interested in booking our excursions which it turns out we could have done on our own for less. The weather and beach were awesome; we went on 2 excursions that were great, saw some nice spots and had a good time once I let go of the poor choice we made with the Hotel. We talked to other folks during our excursions and they had much better experiences with their hotels, wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ give up on Punta Cana just the weaky-joe Hotel improperly call Grand Oasis, should have been called the Grand Mirage√à√\u2020\u2022?.
