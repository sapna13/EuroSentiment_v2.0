{"text":"Long review but worth reading! This hotel is FANTASTIC! I recently stayed here with my boyfriend and had read reviews that had put me off, however after being here i would definitely stay again.On arrival we was presented with a cocktail!a nice welcome after a long flight. Throughout our stay the staff could not do enough for you, any problems then just go to the recpetion and they are very helpful.The rooms are lovely, with the maids visiting every day. The hotel itself is very clean and well maintained since i had seen some photos with lights hanging off the walls etc but there was nothing like this at all! (a good thing though)The food in the restaurant is probably the only bad mention (and depending what you like it wasnt too bad) i will give, but i can be a bit of a funny eater. They always do pizza and chips and there is a selection of seafood tapas on mexican night and a selection of vegetables\/rice\/meat and cereal for breakfast eg: nesquik and cornflakes. The steakhouse is really nice so if you get the chance make sure you book in there, it is well worth it! And no me and my boyfriend never got any tummy upsets or anything whilst out there and i did not hear on the grapevine that anyone got ill.Whilst on holiday also went on the outback safari WELL WORTH THE MONEY this is a real insight to the way that they live and is a real eye opener definitely recommend this trip but make sure you take some money with you to buy real coco powder and real coffee *yum yum*The hotel entertainers work really hard and there is always something going on during the day and night. The evening entertainment was ok but not brill, however make sure that you get a good seat for the michael jackson night this night was really good. During the day there is football\/volleyball\/horse shoes\/aerobics\/polo and loads more its a really fun atmosphere. But if you want to just chill out and have some quiet then make sure that you go onto the beach and here it is really peaceful.Overall i really enjoyed my holiday and would not have done anything differently i loved every minute of it and hope that anyone going here does to!
