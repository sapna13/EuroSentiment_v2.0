{"text":"Nice Hotel, Relaxing Environment but still Overpriced Our three day visit started Oct. 22. The Intercontinental San Juan Spa and Resort is probably one of the nicer hotels along the Isla Verde beach front. However, compared to hotel spa and resorts found on the mainland particularly in Las Vegas it would only rank as average. The pool was being remodeled therefore it was unavailable to guests. This didn't present a problem for me because I enjoyed the beach and ocean which had easy access from the hotel. We reserved a city view room but we told we had been upgraded to a deluxe city view. The difference was simply that the deluxe city view was on a higher floor (5 and above) instead of (2 - 4). Our view was actually very nice. We could see the airplanes as they landed and when there were no planes you actually had a distance (very distance) ocean view. The hotel is only 10 minutes from the airport but the noise of the planes didn't bother us. Others have written that the walls of the hotel rooms are thin, that is correct. The noise didn't really bother me as much as it bothered by roommate. One thing that annoyed us both was the television speaker in the bathroom. It was loud and intrusive. We actually had the maintenance staff cut it off. Instructions should have been left for the guests so we could have cut it off ourselves.The Intercontinental was nice but I think very much overpriced. San Juan for tourists probably has seen better days. I think passing through San Juan before going on a cruise is fine but as a final destination you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e better off going to St. Thomas or Aruba.
