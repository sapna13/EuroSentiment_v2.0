{"text":"Never again - very dissappointed. When we arrived at the Ramayana they didn't find our reservation. We booked online via an internet travel agency. Later it became clear they booked me under my front name. When we got to our deluxe room - we were really dissappointed again. The room was quite dark and outdated. The bathroom is worn and shabby. The worse however were the beds. It is just a simple wooden plate with a very old and worn matrass. Sitting on the bed we hit the wood underneat the old and worn matrass immediately. We were sure we couldn't sleep on that.Therefore we asked to change the matrass - answer: no can do!We wanted to change rooms - okay - matrasses just as bed! We decided to agree, since it was only one night before we left.The complimentary water in the room was already opened en half empty, so we had to call reception for a new fresh bottle.The towels were not clean, and after taking a bath, the whole bathroomfloor became soaked, since the water came up from a hole in the floor (draining system).We asked for a wake up call since we had an early flight out of Bali - never got the call.We asked for a breakfast box - we got it - but it was ridiculous - for a 4 star hotel you won't expect 2 very small sweets, 1 boiled egg, butter and jam, and a small apple (no napkin, no plastic knife, no drink). How do I put butter on this small sweets? Do I eat my boiled egg with the apple or with the sweet? Not worth the 4 star rating. The pool is very small and has very little chairs around it.We had to pay 15.000 rps for a short local phonecall, where the other hotels in Kuta only charged us 3000.They reception people we found not friendly. I have stayed in the Lokha Legian for much less money and we enjoyed it much better. It was not a good experience for us. I wouldn't recommend this place.
