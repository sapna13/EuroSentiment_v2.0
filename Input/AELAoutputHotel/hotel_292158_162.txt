{"text":"Fantastic Resort My boyfriend and I stayed at the Grand Palladium Punta Cana with one other couple and we all had a great time. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms are a nice size and kept clean.The swim-up bar and pool at the Punta Cana is the best. For pre-dinner cocktails, I recommend the lobby bar at the Bavaro. The Mexican a la carte was our favourite. You don't make reservations for the a la cartes...just show up and hope there's not a wait. If there is a wait, it generally isn't long and you can take your buzzer to a lobby bar for a cocktail beforehand.To secure a spot at the beach or pool, you will need to be up by 8:30am. I recommend getting up at that time, reserving your chairs with towels, grabbing some breakfast and then heading back to your reserved spots. Chairs fill up quite fast. We would spend mornings\/early afternoon on the beach, grab a late lunch and then sit by the pool until 5 or 6:00.You will constantly be heckled by locals on the beach to purchase excursion packages, cigars, jewellery, etc. It's easy to barter prices on souvenirs. Best to book excursions through reps at the hotel rather than on the beach. Saona Island is a lovely day trip. The island is picturesque, bbq lunch is great and swimming with the starfish is a lot of fun. Be prepared for a long day. The bus picked us up at 6:50am and we didn't return home until dark.It was a great week and we've already said we'll return.
