{"text":"Just perfect This is the first time that I write a review for an Hotel, but I want to share with other travellers my nice experience at The Lenox Hotel. I have spent only two nights at Boston in this hotel with my wife during our trip in the U.S.A at the end of April 2008.I live in Italy, and even if in last months you have probably read bad news about Italian garbage near Naples (grrr!!!), you know that Italians love living in clean houses. √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??he Lenox√à√\u2020\u2022?is not only a really clean hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√®f you enter the lobby you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l enjoy a really pleasant smell that is there in the air. But this has only been the beginning of our enjoyable experience.After booking the two nights I had sent an e-mail at Lenox internet site informing them that we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° spend √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ö sort of second honeymoon√à√\u2020\u2022?in the U.S.A.At the reception when we arrived at the Hotel (in the early morning!) they gave us an upgraded room at the same price. What a lovely and big room, with a fireplace!After the surprise of the nice room we experienced a fantastic extra. After a few minutes we entered the room a waiter knocked the door with a delicious cheeseboard, some delicious biscuits and a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon on the tray. We loved it and, before tasting everything, we read the wonderful hand-written message that the assistant of the front office manager have sent us. We have carried this beautiful envelope back in Italy to have a good memory of that nice hotel. We used the wireless internet connection that is a complementary service (that is free of charge) to contact, with my laptop and webcam, our relatives in Italy using internet.The Hotel offers also many other free services that you could see directly at its internet site.The Hotel is placed in a perfect place. You can reach Copley place in 2 minutes, or see the magnificent London-like buildings (with lovely shops at their ground floor) in all streets near the Lenox. The metro is at 50 m. from the Hotel.I definitely recommend √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??he Lenox√à√\u2020\u2022?hotel in Boston. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ really a valuable Historic American Hotel.P.S.: In Boston we have also tasted two delicious dinners at sLegal Sea Food Restaurant. If you like sea-food, shell-sea-food and good white wines then this is the right place for you. I recommend it. Its unique limit is that you can't find it in many USA cities!!!
