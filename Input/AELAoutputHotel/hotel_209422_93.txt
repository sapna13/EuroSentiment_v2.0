{"text":"Why would you go to Waikiki ??? Why would anyone ever go to Waikiki ?There are so many beautiful places to visit and stay on the islands. Waikiki is just a big city with a beach attached. Imagine Manhattan with a beach.That said, my wife had a business conference in Waikiki so we stayed at the Hilton Prince Kuhio. For a business stay it was an excellent value. I booked it net diredt and paid 3 nights upfront to get a rate close to $200\/night. I even made a mistake and double-booked within the three day no-cancellation period, I contacted the hotel directly and the night manager quickly took care of my problem quickly and graciously.The hotel is still undergoing renovations, but little of the work was visible and did not detract from our stay.The new rooms are immaculate, large enough for us and the 2 double beds were very comfortable. The bathroom is very spacious and well appointed. The water pressure in the shower was fine.The wall-mounted flat screen televison was a big hit with our 20 year old daughter.We were on the 30th floor with an oceanview - very pretty. Since the hotel is a long block away from the beach, 30% of the view is blocked by other high rises, but this is Waikiki what do you expect? No chairs on the balcony, but it is very windy out there... The pool area is also nice enough, again very windy.The beach was only 3-4 minutes and was easily acessible.We had access to the executive lounge which has been temporarily located in a smallish room on the 2nd floor. The staff there was most gracious and we found there to be plenty of food availble whenever we went down there. In fact, the continental breakfast buffet had many delicious choices.Would I stay there again? Absolutely! But I will only go to Waikiki on business. For a family vacation or fantastic honeymoon, go to any of the other islands. Just make sure that you aren't staying on the wet part of any island unless you have a specific reason.
