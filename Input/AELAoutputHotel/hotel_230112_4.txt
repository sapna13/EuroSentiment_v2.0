{"text":"Can't be more central than that If you fancy being in the heart of Amsterdam and without breaking the bank, then this is the place for you. If this place were in London, it would be a few metres away from Piccadilly Circus, I mean you just can't be more central. The hotel has a small reception area (virtually no lobby to speak of) and a commercial restaurant which appears to be quite busy, but then it's in the one of the busiest streets in Amsterdam. My experience of the reception staff was very positive, they were friendly and very polite and made you feel immediately welcome. I was only staying one night and I had booked a single room, so I wasn't surprised to be given a room with a single bed. The room was small, but 'perfectly formed', as they say. For such short stay I had no qualms whatsoever, there was everything I wanted, TV, minibar, a well appointed (but very small) bathroom with shower and the single bed was very comfortable. The room and bathroom were clean, though one of the towels had a hole in it and one of the light fittings in the bathrooms was hanging from the wires. Small details which didn't spoil my stay, but perhaps not up to 4* standards. Overall, the room had a cozy feel to it. No views from the window, but I was immensely glad to be given an inside room which was incredibly quiet - a real bonus when you are in a city centre.I had a quick breakfast the following morning and again I found the staff very obliging. The choice of breakfast was OK, I can't really criticise it, all I can say though is that I have been to hotels of similar standards where much more variety was offered and I guess that at 13 Euros extras for breakfast this was probably not as good a value as the room.I would definitely stay here again, friendly staff, comfortable room, perfect location, but if you look for a place with more amenities such large lobby areas, bar(s) etc then you would obviously need to look elsewhere.
