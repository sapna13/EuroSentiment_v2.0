{"text":"Wonderful Hotel We stayed at the Hotel Elysees Regencia for our honeymoon in March. We stayed in the junior suite, on the 6th floor. We were both really impressed with our stay. All the staff were incredibly friendly and polite √à√\u2020\u2022?I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel guilty at all for my appalling lack of French vocabulary. The suite itself was lovely, airy, well decorated and very clean. The bathroom was ace with a great bath for 2, lovely l'occitane toiletries and a shower with side nozzles as well. You could even just see the top of the Eiffel tower from the window. The price, although not cheap, seemed very reasonable given the location in Paris. As far as we were concerned it was slap bang in the middle of everything. A very short walk to some lovely restaurants √à√\u2020\u2022?just ask at reception. As it was our honeymoon the hotel had arranged for a bottle of champagne to be in the room for our first night with a hand written message congratulating us. There were a couple of negatives but they were mostly minor. The sound insulation of the room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ great, and unfortunately on the first night there was a group of lads in the next room who woke us up at 1am. However, a quick phone to reception and all was blissfully quiet. After they moved out, we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bothered by next door noise at all. Although the bed was comfortable and large, I think it a shame that it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ 2 mattresses pushed into one. Although it was very well put together, and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ actually bother us much, I would still prefer a large single one √à√\u2020\u2022?especially on honeymoon. Final niggle was the shower. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ great but, unfortunately, the drains can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ quite keep up with the water flow if you have the side nozzles on as well. All this means is you have to keep a careful eye on water level in the shower and turn off the side nozzles before water cascades over the edge.I must stress that the above problem really were minor compared to how lovely the hotel and the staff were. Wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hesitate to recommend it. ","annotations":[]}
