{"text":"Not a five-star hotel; think transitional business hotel The hotel is beautifully located adjacent to the Museum District and in a very tasteful residential neighborhood. However, this is not the five-star hotel they claim. We had numerous problems booking with two children; they did not understand how to place us. We ended up with two adjoining rooms. Furnishings were old and generic -- nothing indicated we were in Amsterdam and not a soulless business hotel in the US some 20 years ago. The second bedroom with the children had no window that could open to bring in fresh air and inadequate ventilation for three out of the four nights we stayed there. They did not correct it until the weekend ended on Monday. Then they claimed it was about air temperature and they could not understand the concept of ventilation. We had a long polite conversation with the general manager that has changed my mind about international traveling -- next time we will be the loud obnoxious Americans demanding to receive services that we paid for. I just don't think they got the concept of five-star. For example, the toiletries did not offer hair conditioner. We mentioned this to the hotel but they said five-star hotels don't offer hair conditioner. This is untrue as most travelers have a stash in their bathrooms at home from hotels in Europe and the U. S. which offer hair conditioner. The general manager kept us waiting 15 minutes before he permitted us to talk to him. We had to threaten to leave before he showed up and then there was no apology. I'm sure he already has a new position. ","annotations":[]}
