{"text":"Best Hotel in Waikiki We stayed at the Outrigger Waikiki the week of July 25-31. We checked in pretty early and our room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ready yet, so the staff put a rush on it. We grabbed some coffee and snacks from Seattle√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Best located at the entrance of the hotel and within 20 minutes our room was ready. When making our reservations, we requested a room on the Diamond Head side and on a high floor. They honored all our requests and gave us a complimentary room upgrade from a city view to a partial ocean view. We were on the 15th floor, which gave us access to the express elevators that only service floors 14, 15  PH. There are some rooms located right it next to the express elevators and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ sure it can get pretty noisy right there. Luckily for us, we were a good distance from any of the elevators, so we had no problems. We did hear the sounds of toilets flushing a few times, but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ only because the toilets pack a powerful flush, which in my opinion is a good thing. The noise from the toilets never bothered us or woke us up. Other than that, we never heard any noise coming from any of the other rooms, so the walls aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ as thin as others described. The room itself is nicely furnished. The bathroom has granite countertops and there is plenty of closet space and drawers. The lani fit me, my husband and our 10 year old daughter comfortably for breakfast, although we did leave our sliding door open for a little extra space. One of the best things about this hotel is that it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ located right smack in the middle of everything. The International Marketplace is across the street and the Royal Hawaiian Shopping center is just around the corner. Not to mention it houses one of the best restaurants in all of Waikiki√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√∂\u201AÑ¢ukes. Dukes is reasonably priced, has great food  drinks, and has one of the best views of Waikiki. Try the Lava Flow, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l be addicted! Make sure you make reservations in advance as this place is busy every night. We made reservations a few weeks in advance and got a great table on the lani. Their breakfast buffet was great! We also ate at Hula Grill for dinner, which also has great views of Waikiki. Room service is provided by Hula Grill. The chocolate chip pancakes were delicious!The beach right outside the hotel is beautiful. There is always something to do on the beach. Whether it be a catamaran sail, canoe ride, surfing lessons, or just floating in the ocean, the Outrigger has everything within arms reach. The on-site restaurants and some of the activities allow you to charge the costs to your room, which came in very handy as we hardly ever had to carry cash on us. You can rent 2 beach chairs  an umbrella for $30-$50 a day, depending on what type of chair you want. Rent your chairs early so you can get a good spot on the beach. Make sure to buy inflatable rafts or intertubes at the ABC store across the street. This will make for a wonderful time in the ocean.The pool was a bit small for such a big resort, but we were always able to find a spot. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ illegal to drink alcohol on the beach, but since this hotel is right on the beach, you could drink by the pool overlooking the ocean and still have the same feel. I cannot say enough about the great staff. They were all so friendly and attentive. We needed towels before the towel desk opened and housekeeping quickly brought them up to our room. If you renting a car, getting into the hotel can be a little bit of a wait at times, but very too bad. The valets are really good about getting everyone in  out as quickly as possible. Everyday housekeeping leaves a newsletter in your room listing the activities the hotel offers such as lei making.The Outrigger was one of the best hotels I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever stayed at and if and when we return to Oahu, we will definitely return to the Outrigger Waikiki on the Beach. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a nice quiet vacation, then this hotel is not for you, but if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e looking for a beautiful hotel in the middle of all the action, then this is definitely the place for you.Aloha!
