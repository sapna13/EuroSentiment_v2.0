{"text":"Pretty nice but not paradise. My wife and I, both 40-ish, recently stayed 3 nights at the Rio Mar, as part of a multi venue tour of PR. We targeted Rio Mar because of it's proximity to the Carribean National Forest (El Yunque).Positives: Beautiful grounds surrounding the hotel. Nice pools, one for adults only. Very nice common areas in hotel with pretty views out the huge beach-side windows. The in-hotel restaurants, Shimas and one Italian place (cannot remember name, but starts with a P, Palia?), were surprisingly very good. Great location for El Yunque exploration! All staff we encountered were wonderfully friendly and helpful, eager to assist and please.Negatives: The food at the tiki bar is terrible! This opinion was unanimous among all the guests we befriended, actually a humourous bonding topic. The tiki bar drinks are very week and over priced. The terrible tiki phenomenon is particularly bothersome to folks who would like to take full advantage of the outdoors, day and night. We fealt like we were forced in doors for good food and drink. The rooms are pretty small, but are nice enough, many having ocean views. For those expecting a postcard tropical beach, you'll be disapointed that the sand is brown and the water is not the carribean ocean turqouis that you fantasize about, it's variable but often green-brown, much like the east coast of the US above Florida (I grew up in Virginia Beach). Finally, and this may be the case with all large hotels, this place seems to cater to conventions (there were three professional groups there during our stay, in large numbers).
