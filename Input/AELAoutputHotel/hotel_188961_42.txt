{"text":"AMAZING service and location! I arrived at this hotel based on the reviews of Trip Advisor, and it surpassed my expectations.First of all, it is a tiny hotel that is hard to find. The taxi driver went up and down the street until he decided to call and find out where it was. So, if you go, tell the driver it's next to The Rubens (The Rubens at the Palace) and you will avoid him a lot of turns :-)The hotel is located on the second floor, so when you come in, the concierge (young and very knowledgeable) greets you and calls somebody to accompany you to the reception. This was incredible. The attention to detail, the politeness of the staff, the courtesy....In the hall they have a container with apples, so if you are EVER hungry at night (like I was) and feel like having a snack, you can always go out and help yourself. In the evening they also have drinks and snacks at the library, but I can't comment on that since I didn't attend.The hotel is *very* cozy. The decoration is classic in the library, but the rooms have a nice contemporary style. Everything they do is to make you feel very comfortable. The registration process was painless, they brought me juice while I was filling out some papers, and then they showed me to my room.The room was a surprise. Beautiful, and full of wonderful details that made my stay extremely enjoyable. First, a little blanket that seemed to decorate the bed, but that I could also use to cover while I took a nap. At night, when they went to turn down the bed, they would light a candle that looked very romantic and showed that they cared about my well being (it gave a sensation of peace). There was also a small spray bottle that I could use on my pillow to help me relax and sleep better. Wow....! Breakfast was excellent. There was variety and the food was fresh. The staff was sooooo friendly, you never felt at a hotel! It was like being at a friend's house, almost with family.Internet was also provided above the library (the place where everything happened), and they had games and books you could borrow if you felt like enjoying your afternoon at home.Now, what I liked the MOST (besides the service that beat the hotel in Dubai).... the button on the phone that read: WHATEVER WHENEVER. This was for ANYTHING you might need. Absolutely incredible. They got me tickets to the theater (great seats!), directed me to the stores I wanted to visit, a casino.... WHATEVER, whenever. They said it and they meant it.You can't go wrong with this hotel. I've been to London several times and NOTHING compares to this service. In addition, the location is great and the room is very very comfortable.If you have any questions, ask! But I'll tell you that WHENEVER I go to London, this is the place where I'll stay!!!!!!Congratulations and THANK YOU to the staff!!!!!!!!!!!!!
