{"text":"Great Value for the Money We booked this vacation through Apple Vacations. I would highly recommend booking through them, as they took very good care of us, and their package prices were very good. The Riu Naiboa is part of the 5 hotel Riu Complex, which is one of the nicest ones in Punta Cana. The other 4 hotels have a beach, but the Naiboa has the nicest pool, which is where we spent most our time anyway. The beach was the most beautiful that I have ever seen -- the Riu definately put some money into the planning and layout of it.The first room they gave us had a broken sliding door and smelt bad, but when we complained, they were very prompt in moving us to a lovely room overlooking the pool in perfect working order. The food looked very good, but was seasoned with something that I could not identify and that did not appeal much to our tastes, especially items with a tomato sauce. The ice cream sucked -- I have never had bad ice cream before in my life. The fruits, however, were delicious. The staff was very friendly, and the pool was wonderful. There were mainly Europeons there. My husband enjoyed descretely checking out the bare breasts at the pool and beach. I must admit that I was checking out the guys in the Speedos, but I think that some of them were cheating and were stuffing tube socks and bottles caps.All in all, we had a wonderful trip and will definately go back again. If we have the money, I would like to stay at the Riu Palace, but we would still use the pool at the Riu Naiboa.
