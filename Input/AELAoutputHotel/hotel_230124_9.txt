{"text":"Everything fine until they kicked us out... 24 hours after we learned that our daughter was in the ICU my husband and I were en route to Amsterdam. Her husband was flying in from Tokyo. We didn't have time to book a hotel before traveling to the Netherlands. After checking on our daughter's status, we walked in to the NH-Tropen Hotel which was close to the hospital. We were told we could have two rooms (one for my husband and me and one for my son-in-law), for 4 nights, June 10, 11, 12, 13. We said we would take them. Twice we asked about extending the stay but were told that they might only be able to give us one room. We should check in the morning to be sure. It didn't sound like they were going to have room so we made other arrangements for the nights of the 14th and 15th. When we returned to the hotel the night of the 13th we were told that we were supposed to have checked out that morning. What was our reservation verification number? We explained that we had walked in on Sunday and didn't have an advance reservation. At 11pm we were handed our bags which had been packed by the hotel staff. The young woman at the desk was obviously annoyed that her manager had placed her in such a difficult position but she never offered to help us find another hotel. Fortunately, we were able to contact the hotel we had planned to move to the next day. They took us in. The taxi driver said we were the second people who had been kicked out of the hotel that day. Obviously the hotel was over-booked. What a shabby way to treat clients. They also charged us more for the rooms than we had been told when we checked in. Unfortunately, we didn't have anything in writing to show them what we had been told. Next time we'll know! ","annotations":[]}
