{"text":"A little gem! I used the feed back on this site to choose a place to stay in Amsterdam, and was not disappointed. My husband and I stayed at Misc for two nights, mid Feb.'08. What a little gem this place is. We arrived very early in the morning, and our room was not ready, so they put us in another one (Design) so we could rest up a bit. This is at the front of the building overlooking the canal. Was very impressed.The breakfast was excellent. Yes, you get fresh juice, eggs, cheeses, meats, coffee, bread, but Rachel's homemade spiced rhubarb jam was simply...heaven! While we were out exploring, they kindly moved our things to the room we had booked(Wonders) which is at the back, overlooking a really sweet garden courtyard. It was a very comfortable room, had all the amenities of a small hotel, and a good sized bathroom to boot! Misc definitley has location, location. It's about a 10 min. walk from the train station, and we did not need to take public transport at all. We walked every where. While we took the train in from the airport and walked to Misc on our arrival, we choose to take a taxi back to the airport for our departure because it was really, really, early. When it didn't arrive as planned we simply called Pepijn, and it was there in 10 mins.Rachel and Pepijn are excellent hosts and do their very best to make sure you enjoy your time at their place. Amsterdam is a wonderful city, and Misc is just the place to stay and enjoy it!
