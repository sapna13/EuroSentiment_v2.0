{"text":"Huge Bathroom We stayed at the Alexis hotel which is in the center of downtown Seattle. We booked a spa suite which was nice but weird. From what we gathered speaking to the other visitors all of the rooms were a bit strange. For instance the bathroom was HUGE, at least 40% of the sq room footage. It had a large bathtub with spa jets and a separate shower way across the bathroom.Our windows looked directly into the next building which were offices. There was a door which lead down a flight of stairs to a closet and another locked door presumably to the suite below. It was scary to think the people below us could walk up the stairs and try to open the door to our room(which was right next to the bed). That being said you could tell the hotel had recently been renovated and was tastefully appointed and beautifully decorated. The staff accommodated our every need incl when we asked for a DVD player(there wasn't one in our room) they brought another TV with a DVD player. The hotel is down the street from the Market, next to the waterfront and across the street from a major Seattle museum. Everything a tourist would want or need is right there within walking distance or short taxi ride. We actually rented a car which was totally unnecessary and very expensive to park in downtown Seattle however the staff had it waiting for us by the time we got to the lobby. They have a great daytime restaurant and a chic little bar and restaurant also in the lobby. Be prepared to spend bucks. My suggestion is to get a room facing the waterfront if you can afford it. Ours had a partial view only. An interesting stay in Seattle. ","annotations":[]}
