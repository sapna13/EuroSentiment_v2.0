{"text":"Breathtaking Infinity Pool. Great Palomino Trip. Bring Mop I stayed in a guest room. I was lucky to get the ocean view. It was awesome. I think it is the best placed I have stayed. They gave you slippers which made it nice. The infinity pool was awesome. Very relaxing even when there are lots of peoples the view is so breath taking that you forget about annoying people around you. Is great that you can enjoy the Conquistador Hotel facilities, restaurants and pools. There are also two other pools at las casitas village and a few more in the conquistador. The golf cart ride from las casitas to el conquistador is fun. Palomino was great. The food at palomino was good. Is something like chili's quality. You can snorkel .. not great snorkeling but very entertaining and safe. The beach has lots of algae so bring beach slippers. There are nice beach umbrellas at Palomino if you want to stay away from the sun. The trip to Palomino Island is 7 minutes. They don't allow outside beverages or food but you can always pack a few in your back pack if you want to save a few bucks. The beach at Palomino is not that great but just knowing that you are in a small island makes it very interesting and fun. There are beach sports like Kayak rental and I think you can Kayak to palominito island which is another cute small little island half a mile from palomino. Beach sports are not free.Had Sushi at Blossoms one night and it was New York grade sushi and not too expensive considering that you are at a hotel. The conquistador lobby is nice and big overlooking the ocean and the pools. Service was Ok . The rooms were not super clean but enough for me. Tiles are harder to clean I guess. The balcony was huge and nice. If you can get a room with ocean view go for it .. is gorgeous. All rooms seem to be close to the parking but there are always stairs that will make you think twice to ask for help. The personal butler never showed and never heard of such a thing. Had no problem getting towels anywhere at the hotel. People were very friendly. This was definitely a great stay. They only minor flaw was the room floor which was a little bit dirty especially after moving the beds they don't clean under the beds. If you want ice you have to call room service. Cannot just grab it yourself. I don't know if there was a charge for that but heard that they charge for every call you make. I had no problems with my bill. Everything was in place and payed nothing extra for parking. Maybe they forgot to charge that? or parking is free ?I paid everything with my credit card cause I was warned about overcharges if using the cards they give you. I guess you should never mention your room number. I got to the hotel at 3:30 but the room was not ready. Had to wait for 2 hours but you can start using the facilities. Used all coffee the first day but never got refills. But at least someone came to asked if we needed anything and they gave us more towels and two little tasty chocolates. I paid $267 per night and it was definetly worth it with all the ammenities included. No kitchen in the guest rooms. This room is great for two people and one child. I am not sure that paying $ 400 per night is worth it but at least you get 2+ bedrooms and a kitchen.El conquistador is a few bucks cheaper but I rather pay 50 to 100 bucks more per night at las casitas for the guest room. They don't give you toothbrush\/tooth paste so bring your own.My Wife did a room service check. She marked the glasses of te bathrooms slightly + the disposable coasters and they were not changed after room service. Don't expect great service but if you want to enjoy a nice and very relaxing place with a cute little island which is free to visit in a big resort with a breath taking infinity pool Las Casitas village is one of the best in puerto rico maybe in the Caribbean.
