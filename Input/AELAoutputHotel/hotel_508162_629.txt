{"text":"Good Affordable Resort My wife and I were looking for a new place and an affordable price to celebrate our 10th anniversary and Punta Cana seemed to be the place. We have done the all-inclusive route in Mexico 3 times and have had mixed results, but none being bad. I would say Sunset the Beach (Dreams) would rate favorable to all but Ibero Star in Riviera Maya. That has been our high watermark, Anyway,positives:-ridiculously nice staff...read that they were luke warm but found that they all seemed to be excited to serve, smiles everywhere but the casino-beautiful layout...a very cool pool concept with its long snaking river-like tiled pool we were always able to find a spot to relax and have a few drinks-good, not great food...breakfast leaves something to be desired (though I love the made-to-order omelets) and lunch needed more variety, dinner was the exception...we tried the Italian place and were not that impressed,but were blown away by the beach-side seafood joint, very good, again wait staff was exceptionally helpful and eager to please *loved that while you ate dinner they turned your sheets down in your room and left romantic music on*-great bars with top shelf booze...many all-inclusives stock crummy rail alcohal, I was drinking Stoli's all weekend...NICE! Again, the bartenders understood double shot drinks-very nice beach with waitresses taking drinks as you sunned yourself, plenty of seating and beautiful scenery-the room cleaning service was spectacular...as you got back from the beach, pool, bar for your midday nap, you were greeted with a spotless room, clothes folded, fresh towels, restocked fridge and coffee...not normally a slob, but we didn't pick up a thing...no problem, the cleaning staff took care of everything...wow!negatives:-the pool got no deeper than 3 feet...kind of a bummer but not something to worry too much about-the bars closed too early...the outdoor one in the middle of the walkway\/courtyard closed at 11 or 12??? The others closed at different times on different nights...this was a major bummer as one bartender, Jose Louis, was so good that I hated to leave so early-the ocean was rough...we like waves but the waves often brushed off the sand and left jagged rocks...no warning before you stepped on something sharp...made swimming impossible-the casino was tiny...not a gambler so we stayed 15 minutes in there, but it felt like a sardine can, probably lost themselves some of my money had I not felt so clostrephopic-again, the food was not that great...you know with the all-inclusive deal that the food will not blow you away, but the breakfast was NOT good and the lunch lacked variety ","annotations":[{"endOffset":433,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":429},{"endOffset":1348,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1344},{"endOffset":1652,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1646},{"endOffset":1652,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1646}]}
