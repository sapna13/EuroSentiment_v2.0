{"text":"Here's the Dirt on the Park Hotel Was there last week and must say it is a very nice. Just keep in mindif you don't get a corner or a premium room you will be in a shoe sized room. I had a corner twin and it was very good sized but we didpeek in the other rooms so and they seemed very small. I found the info on this site to be very accurate regarding this hotel.You will be dealing with 4 levels when you stay at the Park.1. Lobby level which is on the 25th floor2. Overpass level that connect the hotel to surrounding builds and is a raised walkway over the street.3. Street level, there is a little construction going on there.4. Subway\/underground.Between all these levels you will find at least 50 or so places to eat for high and low budget meals. I suggest you take an hour or two to look around all the levels. If you don't find that many eateries keep looking cause they are definitely there and wil save you abunch of $$$ with infinite food choices.Also the view is stunning from the lobby and if you have a premium or corner room it is just as good. But after you seen that view for a few days I suggest you walk over to the Conrad hotel right across the street, go to the lounge which is first calss all the way and the water view is stunning definitely worth the walk.The fastest way there is to take the NEX (Narita Express) from the airport to Tokyo station 54 minutes then a ten minute cab ride from the station to the hotel. wait and take the hotel bus and you will get there almost an hour later or maybe longer.Most important tip is to print out the map from the hotel website with street names and hotel info in Japanese. Everytime I wanted to go to the Hotel I just showed it to the cab driver would get there without any problems whatsoever. Used that map at least ten times to get back problem free.
