{"text":"This is the One! I booked this resort through a getaway from Interval International.I booked a 2-bedroom unit for my husband and me and my sister-in-law and her husband. We arrived early and the clerk was very nice. The unit was a 2-bedroom lock-out so the studio unit was not cleaned but we were able to leave our luggage in the one-bedroom until the studio unit was available. The grocery store and mall was no more than a mile away and easy to access. The resort also have a shuttle bus that will take you the mall (no charge) and to JW Marriott. The Marriott Canyon Villas resort is very clean! The weight room and exercise room are nice but sort of small, which is fine because it was never crowded. Also it is open 24 hours. There are 2 pools at the Marriott Canyon Villas, these are nice but the real treat was the lazy pool at the JW Marriott! We were able to relax to the fullest in the lazy river pool and I really enjoyed the sliding board! All residents at the Marriott Canyon has access to the pools at the JW Marriott Resort. The JW Marriott resort is beautiful! The green grass, tall shady trees and decor is marvelously. The JW Marriott has 4 pools including a nice sprinkler for the little ones. The front desk clerks were exceptionally kind at the Marriott Canyon Villas. They offered to Mapquest anywhere we wanted to visit and made some very good suggestions of activities off the resort. The front desk clerks even offered to print our boarding passes for our return back to Cleveland, Ohio. The Marriott Canyon Villa also had a scheduled sheet for all the activitites on the resort for each day.I would recommend this resort for everyone! I hope to return soon. What a good time we all had! I don't think you could go wrong at this resort even if you are picky! :-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1181,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1177}]}
