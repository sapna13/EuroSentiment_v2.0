{"text":"Not the romantic night we had hoped for I have not read previous reviews as I wanted to post an unbiased account of our experience. Apologies if I repeat what others have said.My partner booked this as a surprise and we stayed just the one night following some time in a nearby coastal resort. We are well travelled and so I now know that she had rang ahead to check the reservation.Our disappointment started when on arrival they had still managed to misplace our booking. We therefore were 'upgraded' to the pieso royale or royal floor. The rooms on this floor (on further inspection) seem to be newly rennovated compared to the higher floors. They are very contemporary in style and although small, seemed very comfortable with excellent double glazing virtually blocking all noise from las ramblas. One thing we did note was although we ordered a double, the beds were actually two singles pushed together. That said, they were extremely clean and comfortable.The main issue with this hotel is the noise at night. The pieso royale is (as it turned out) directly over the restaurant and we were kept awake until gone 2am by the constant scraping of chairs across the lower floor, people talking loudly etc. They should be more aware of their guests, especially claiming to be a 4 star (which it falls far short of being by the way). The noise starts again early in the morning (presumably for breakfast, which we then missed on account of being so tired). We did ask for a room change but the hotel was apparently full.Next, the 'bar' is nothing of the sort as the sliding door through to the cafe next door will reveal. So even a quiet drink whilst the noise subsided was out of the question, as it meant mixing with everyone from the street.Next time in Barcelona, we would choose a hotel where you can actually get some sleep, important if you intend doing any sightseeing the following day!
