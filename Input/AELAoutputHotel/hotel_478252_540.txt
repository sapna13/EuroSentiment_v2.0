{"text":"perfect holiday i have been to the DR previously and love the country. I travelled in August with my daughter, son-in-law and granddaughter to Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana and was a bit apprehensive prior to travel as the hotel seemed so big. On arrival I began to feel my apprehension was justified but after just 24 hours I fell in love with the place. I never thought I could enjoy a holiday by doing nothing but sitting by the pool all day but this is just what I did and I thoroughly enjoyed every single second.The whole place is simply beautiful - the grounds are immaculate and well maintained, the staff are always happy and friendly and rooms kept lovely and clean.The only day we were unable to use the facilities was on the Saturday when Hurricane Dean paid us a visit but in the end this event only added to the extraordinary experience that we had.My only complaint really was the entertainment. At 8pm each evening there was childrens entertainment in the theatre and my granddaughter looked forward to this each day. On one occasion there was a fashion parade and the children involved seemed to have put a lot of work into it. However when they started parading in their swimwear my daughter and I left in disgust. This should not be allowed in todays society.There was also a lack of vegetarian food options and most of the a la carte restaurants had none so we were not able to use them. Despite the high quality of food in the buffet it got a bit repetitive after 2 weeks. The first meal I had on my return home was a good old plate of beans on toast!!On arrival back in the UK (where the temperature was 12 degrees, wet and grey) I just cried - I just wanted to be back in the DR!Our holiday for next year is booked already although we are going to try another resort on the south coast. However I will return to Gran Bahai at some point as I had the most fantastic holiday - thanks to all concerned.
