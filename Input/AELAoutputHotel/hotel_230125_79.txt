{"text":"Very Impressive This would have to be one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in....I spent 5 days at the hotel and was very impressed.My travelling companion and I received a very impressive welcome from reception, upon our check-in. The experience was swift and memorable.My room was extremely comfortable, the beds comfy and the pillows adequate. I would like to say that for Europe, the room was very big. I had been travelling through Europe for 4 weeks, staying at a variety of hotels which consisted of small spaces. So, a large room was very welcomed.The bathrooms are excellent with well stocked linen and lotions and gels. We had breakfast for 5 mornings and the food was excellent. Always well stocked and an adequate selection. I also found the staff on the morning shift to be very friendly and welcoming. As everybody knows, the morning shift can be a drag....but this did not show with this crew. I was impressed.Security at the hotel was good, except I do recommend that the hotel develop a more secure way of accessing the lifts and floors. Unlike other international hotels, The Victoria does not allow guests to swipe their cards to access floors. Therefore, unsavoury characters may get to access guest areas.The hotel also has a small business centre. However, the cost of accessing the Internet is costly and I recommend local Internet cafes nearby.The hotel's location is another major appeal. It is right across the road from the central railway station and with easy access to sights, such as Anne Frank's House, The Red Light District, Royal Palace, Canals and excursions, etc,I will certainly return to The Victoria and my stay was very memorable.
