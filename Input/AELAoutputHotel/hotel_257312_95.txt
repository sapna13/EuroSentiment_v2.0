{"text":"Lovely Experience! We always look at Trip Advisor when choosing our hotels. Having seen the reviews already posted we had high expectations of this hotel and were not disappointed in any way whatsoever. It was important to us that the hotel met our expectations as it was the start of a very special 3 wk holiday in Australia and we have booked to stay with them for 4 nights. We arrived very early in the morning after a long flight from Hong Kong and were given a very personal welcome by John, the Hotel Manager. As it was so early, our room was not available, but we were given facilities to shower, change and leave our luggage until later in the day. Turning to the accommodation, we usually look to stay in 4*+ large hotels, and had chosen a boutique hotel for the first time. We booked the Cloud Suite as we were travelling with our 15 yr old daughter and needed the extra space. We felt that the Cloud Suite was very reasonably priced and it also included sparkliing wine and chocolates which was appreciated by my wife! The room itself was large, beautifully decorated in an individual style, and also comprised a huge bathroom with a large circular jacuzzi bath and walk-in shower. The room was fresh, immaculately clean, and the bed was extremely comfortable. Having peeked in and seen other rooms in the hotel whilst they were being cleaned, it is apparent that all the rooms are decorated individually and are of a very high standard throughout. We loved the whole feel of the hotel and our daughter appreciated the free internet access in the downstairs drawing room! We were treated as if we were personal guests in a English Country House and nothing was too much trouble. Breakfast was served in a gloriously light room with glass ceilings which allowed the sun to stream through. Both Keith and Marie were on hand at this time in the day to provide advice and ideas when planning the day's itinerary. With respect to the location, do not be concerned that this hotel is not in the city centre. We felt it was better that it is not , because you have the benefit of a delightful 20 min walk to central locations through the Botanical Gardens including great views of the Opera House and Harbour Bridge (the Opera House can be seen from the end of the road that Simpsons is in). In the evenings it is a quick taxi ride back (10 AUD) to the hotel from most central points. A lovely stay, a great start to our holiday and we will always stay at Simpsons Hotel when we return to Australia in the future.
