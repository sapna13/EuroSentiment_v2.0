{"text":"It Was Fine, But A Little Out of the Way I had seen the reviews on this site, and figured, if I'd stayed at the #1 hotel (Tokyo Park Hotel) and loved it, why not stay at the #2?I have to say that between the two, I liked the Tokyo Park Hotel more. That hotel's rooms were modern and thoughtfully designed. The Royal Park's rooms were clean and also well thought out, but I had thought, nothing that special. More than adequate, but less than awesome.Chuo-ku is a vast district, which includes Ginza. The hotel however, is right on the fringe of the district. It is, as many other guests have mentioned, very close to the Tokyo City Air Terminal, which does help to minimize the pain of coming in from Narita. However, you're not exactly in a happening area either by staying here.I will say this - my wife is expecting in a few months, and I was delighted to find that there is a nearby temple that is dedicated to easy childbirths. I walked over there and threw in a few coins as an offering. I had evidently gone on a big day (maybe it's always that busy)!Service was good. I had taken the advice of others, as I didn't have any free meals, and ate elsewhere. As mentioned, there's a good ramen place just beyond the temple on the main road. But I think if you want to stay in a nifty district of Tokyo, one can probably be closer. On the other hand, you are right on top of a subway station so the connections are good during the day.
