{"text":"I recommend the Buena Vista Motor Inn, great for sightseer's Difficult to know what to say, I must say I had read the reviews from earlier in the year before travelling, although they were written after I had booked 7 nights here, so I was a bit unsure as to what to expectWe knew it wasn't going to be 5 star accommodation, but our rooms were faultless. Cleaned everyday, great job by the maids. The breakfasts were rather basic, croissants and cold\/hot drinks etc. Yes, the carpets and other furniture items are beginning to show there age, but not an issue. Only in the hotel to sleep!You might get to your room and be disappointed to find that you don't have any sort of view from your window, but that is a good thing. I slept with no problems during my stay, I did not hear any traffic noise whatsoever during the night except a fire truck or police car siren, which only happened onceThe reception staff were really helpful and friendly, no complaints thereGood location to get to Fisherman's Wharf (either on foot or by cable car. It's a 10 minute walk up the hill to get to the Cable Car, which can also take you Union Square. A large Safeways store is also a 5-10 minute walk awayIf you want somewhere good near to the hotel to have dinner, you must go to Cafe Lombard which is just a block or two up the street on the other side, they do mostly Italian dishes, but we went there twice! I can't comment on their breakfast menu sadlyI would definitely go back to this hotel ","annotations":[{"endOffset":441,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":431}]}
