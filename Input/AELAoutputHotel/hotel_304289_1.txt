{"text":"Outstanding Value and very Modern! I have been coming to Tokyo two to three times a year for the last 17 years and always stayed at the Hyatt across the street because it was a little more convenient for my trade shows. I loved the Hyatt because the service was always outstanding, and it is a beautiful hotel with very nice rooms. But I finally tried the Hilton for my trade show from Dec. 5 - Dec. 15th because the Hyatt has kept creeping its prices up, even with the deflationary economy and the weak dollar, and I wanted to save a little money this time. Boy was I pleasantly surprised! The new modern deluxe rooms with the very ergonomic chair, glass work desk and a supercool swing-arm light are outstanding! The bed is fabulous and more comfortable than the Hyatt's, and is better than at any Hilton where I have stayed in the US. Also, the aircon unit is powerful (I like a very cool room), and I always slept very comfortably because of the cool temp. All the years that I have been at the Hyatt, I have never been able to make my room cool enough to where I was comfortable. I have complained at the Hyatt for years about what I jokingly called their Arctic Blast Air Conditioning System,and for all of their efforts over the years, the maintenance people could never get any room I have ever stayed in, from Regency Club down to the Gold Passport floors, to stay consistently cool--it could be a hotel design problem, I just don't know. But to be able to make my room the perfect temperature was a delightful bonus at the Hilton. The very best thing about the Hilton is the Japanese style onsen (i.e. HOT) bath with adjoining cool dip, kosen. It is like a giant jacuzzi with an ice bath next to it. You could make the hot bath as hot as you wanted by adjusting the temp control on the spigot at the left side of the bath (I have never seen this anywhere else in the world) and literally cook yourself, and then, hop into the icy cool dip pool--it was truly wonderful. I have been swimming in the Sky Pool at the Hyatt for 17 years and it was always too warm for me, but the pool at the Hilton was nice and cool and never as crowded as the Hyatt's for swimming laps. The gym is very large by Japanese standards and is three times the size of the Hyatt's, so fitness buffs should prefer the Hilton. They also have two full size tennis courts. Hilton Honors Silver and up have free access to the Fitness Center and I consider this a much more valuable perk than executive floor and lounge access. My attitude is that the lounge is really only good for the free booze because Japan has the most wonderful variety of high quality restaurants available, why tie yourself to the obligation of eating in the lounge just because it's free? Go out and have a great time. My favorite noodle place nearby the Hilton is Tenka-Ippen. It is near the post office over by the Keio Plaza and has the best noodles and Gyoza that I have found so far in Tokyo. It also has great Kimchi (the spicy Korean Cabbage dish) and a sliced pork plate with a delicious sauce that is literally covered with onions (leeks)--truly wonderful! Sorry to diverge off of the Hilton, I just don't think that lounge access is that important!The service at the Hilton was always outstanding and, as is typical almost everywhere in Japan, their standards of cleanliness and maintenance where very high. I needed a replacement bulb for my desk work light at 2 AM one night, and two staff showed-up at my door in less than 5 minutes to fix it. Honestly, the Hyatt is the same, and it may be the case all over Japan because Japanese almost universally take great pride in their work,and want to do the very best job, whether it is mopping the floor, stocking the drinks at the mini-mart or serving you in a restaurant. The Hilton was outstanding, and I will be staying there again in May!
