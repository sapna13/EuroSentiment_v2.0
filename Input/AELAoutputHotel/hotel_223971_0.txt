{"text":"Best family hotel experience My husband and I stayed here for 5 days with our three children on a recent visit to Miami for a family reunion. We picked the Villas because my mother had a time share here and we wanted to stay near her. We got an amazing deal through my mother's time share. Paying such a low amount, $440 for the five nights, I wasn't expecting much. However, the suite was perfect. We had a master bedroom with a king-sized bed, a second bedroom with a queen bed and pull-out couch, and the living room had a large pull out couch as well. The pools were great, jacuzzi nice and hot and the kitchen in the suite was great for the family to eat breakfast in each day and a few meals we got take out and brought back to the room.The suite was perfectly clean, the staff at the desk and pool couldn't have been nicer, and a complimentary shuttle brought us to the Doral Spa accross the street where I enjoyed a yoga class, my husband and I both had great massages, and the kids loved the pool there with the giant slide.My only complaint was that the bath tub in the room was so large that it couldn't fill with hot water, and got luke warm part way through, so I couldn't enjoy a bath in the room. Otherwise the stay was perfect.You should know this is not near the beach, but that was fine for us as our family gatherings were near the hotel. It was an easy drive to the everglades where we took the kids on an airboat ride.  One of the best family trips we've ever taken, thanks to the Villas at Doral. Way to go!
