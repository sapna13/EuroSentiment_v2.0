{"text":"Almost perfect! I just came back from a stay at the Millenium Hilton and everything was almost perfect. I booked our stay through Hotwire. I booked a room for myself and one for my parents. We each got our rooms at 149$ and 153$ respectively. You cannot beat that price for the Millenium Hilton. We arrived by car and were really well received by the valet parking agent. A doorman helped us immediately with our luggage.I was anxious to see how the staff would act with us because our stay was booked through hotwire and that we had such a low price. There was nothing under 230$ if we booked through their website. The person at the front desk was professional and courteous and did not give us any attitude about the fact that we had not booked through them. We arrived at noon and we each got our rooms immediately.The rooms are spotless! We were located on the 31st and 33rd floors and had a view of Ground zero. Even my mother who is afraid of heights enjoyed the view! The rooms were always made up and bath products were replenished immediately.The only glitch I can find is that I had turn down service, with chocolates on the pillow and bottles of water, but my parents did not get it. The toilet made a dripping noise sometimes, but I just had to close the door and I did not hear it.I would recommand this hotel to everyone because with the subway and the buses, and walking also, you can get to anywhere in a short period of time. Book through Hotwire and you will save lots of money!
