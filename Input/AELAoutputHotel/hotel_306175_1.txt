{"text":"Great location, fabulous Spa! Stayed at Grand Hyatt Singapore Nov 6-12. Liked:1. The newly-built Damai Spa with serene treatment rooms, each with granite-floored\/walled ensuite bathrooms, and surrounded by a bubbling stream and overlooking Japanese-style gardens.2. Room ready for my early morning arrival3. Helpful, courteous and professional staff all round4. Spacious Grand Deluxe rooms in the Grand Wing; the standard rooms are situated in the adjacent Terrace Wing, expect to pay S$80-$100 more per night for Grand Wing accommodation, whose rooms are actually suites of approximately 600 square feet.5. Central location, within 10 minutes walk of all major shopping and transportation, dining of Scotts and Orchard Roads. Orchard MRT station (underground train system) is less than 5 minutes walk.6. Well-equipped gym Disliked:1. Bathroom toiletries which felt and smelt like dishwashing detergent - certainly not becoming of a 5-star Hyatt2. Very limited breakfast spread in the Club lounge, which is strictly continental, and a far cry from the expansive offerings of sister Hyatt properties, particularly those in Asia, and certainly far short of the Club\/Executive lounge breakfast buffets at Mandarin Oriental and Ritz-Carlton and Shangri-la properties. 3. Shabby stained carpet in both rooms in which I stayed (see point 5 below)4. Poor sound from the TV, which was esp. surprising given that it was a Bang  Olufsen unit.5. Construction noise from adjacent building site (the Ascott Apartments and Scotts Plaza have been demolished to make way for a new high-end residential tower) - I requested, and was given, an alternative room facing the far quieter hotel gardens and pool. Beware! Noisy room was 1305.I do not believe that it is worth paying extra for the Club floor, given the lousy breakfast spread. Far better to go buy yourself some breakfast provisions from the nearby food courts or supermarkets on Orchard Road. Afternoon tea and evening drinks were also very limited. Ate dinner at Straits Kitchen on one occasion, and its actually high-end hawker food at high-end prices. You need to be pretty darn hungry to do the buffet justice. Would prefer to visit a food court and eat all that I want and only spend a fraction of the bSK buffet price.Overall, I highly recommend the Grand Hyatt, mainly for its location and its design.
