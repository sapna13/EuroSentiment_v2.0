{"text":"perfect This is my first review on-line and if you keep on reading you'll find out why. After booking the hotel through a travel website, we contacted the hotel directly and asked if we could be upgraded because we were celebrating our anniversary. When we arrived we were greeted as if we were old friends. We were told that we had the option of picking from 3 different rooms. When we entered the first room, on the bed was a porcelain figurine of a dutch boy and girl puckering up to kiss and a note stating  Welcome to the Banks Mansion. We are so pleased that you chose us to celebrate your anniversary. The room was beautiful, facing the front of the hotel on the corner with views of the canal in either direction. The room was large even by american standards. The room had double beds pushed together, a large armchair wth footstool, a desk with a mirror, a tall closet and plenty of space to walk around. The bathroom had a shower stall with a refreshing rain showerhead, a bathtub which could also be used for showering and the sink was higher than ordinary making for easier use. The room had AC which we could control which we found to be unusual in european hotels and which we were very grateful for because we hit a hot spell in Europe. Needless to say, we never viewed the other two rooms.  The  living and the mini in roombar along with the three decanters of gin, whiskey and cognac were as advertised and included in the room price, plentiful and useable 24 hours. I shouldn't forget to mention free internet use. The breakfast was varied and plentiful. There was an egg, etc. station where you could order what you wanted. The cook remembered and asked us if we wanted the same order as we ordered the day before. The only drawback is that the kitchen has no AC which on some days, because of the hot spell, made it uncomfortable.  If that were not enough, the staff was extra-ordinary. They were always pleasant, smiling and very helpful. Nothing that is asked is too much for them. Don't miss this place. It is an unique experience.
