{"text":"The Only Place I Will Stay Fram Now On!! We could not ask for more!! Greeted by warm cookies and an even warmer staff, my fianc√ã√\u2022√ñ and I were very pleased. Upon check-in we recieved a map and coupons for Macy's!! The lobby has a very inviting atmosphere, with a sitting area and large picture windows looking out onto the street. There is a cozy bar and restaraunt, both of which have excellent service. We ate breakfast at the restaraunt and the food was delicious!! Our server was very friendly and offered suggestions and help with any of our questions. When we got to our room we were thrilled. It had been updated in a beautiful green and chocolate brown scheme , but still retained all the important vintage touches to remind us it was a classic. Our room looked out to union square park, and at night it was so beautiful. My favorite part of our room was the HUGE closet. We could easily tuck away all of our luggage along with our purchases, allowing us to relax in a clutter free room. We were provided with nice pillows and bed linens, but there were several option available if we weren't pleased with what they provided. The bathroom was a good size with a nice deep bathtub to soak away a day of shopping. The hotel is located right off of union square, so you don't have to deal withquote as heavy foot traffic, but you are literally steps from anywhere you could want to be. Borders Books is right next door and open late if you might want something to read. All in all our experience here was an 11 out of 10, and I am so thankful our friend recommended us!!
