{"text":"Already Planning ournext trip to Excellence!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I just returned from our trip to the Excellence Resort. We went with one other couple and had the best experience we could ever had imagined! The beach was the most beautiful beach i had ever seen, not a pebble in sight. I heard the ocean was rough but i was able to have a great time swimming in the ocean, and i am not an ocean person. The pool was wonderful and the swim up bar was right outside our room which was a huge plus. It was very relaxing and the atmosphere was wonderful. The staff are some of the nicest people i have ever met. Even after working 12 hours straight they are still smiling and full of energy. They always kept you entertained. The food was WONDERFUL! No complaints. We ate at all the restaurants except mexican (ran out of time) and loved every meal. There is something for everyone there....because i am a very picky eater. Cant forget the animals...they are so cute. i loved the parrots and all the beautiful birds wondering the resort. The club\/disco was a lot of fun. they have entertainment and dancing every night and there is always something to do b\/w the disco and the entertainment shows. We expected an older crowd but the majority was in the 20-30's. Granted most were on their honeymoon but none the less there to have a good time. It is def a couples resort and a great place for a relaxing and fun vacation. Be prepared to be pampered and taken care of. Take advantage of the spa (so beautiful) We loved it so much we are planning a vacation there in November of this year b\/c we miss it already! One suggestion...dont drink the water. We are not sure if it was the water or not but we all were sick from something. None the less it did not ruin the wonderful time we had!!!!!!!!!!! Nothing could have! ","annotations":[]}
