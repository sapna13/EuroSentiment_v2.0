{"text":"Punta Cana Heaven My husband and I traveled the 3rd week in August. I located the sister hotel\/Palma Real on the internet and after many phone calls to the reservations for both hotels..... Punta Cana was our destination. From the first phone call until checking out the hospitality was outstanding. I read the reviews very frequently and I think that many of the people must have been staying at another hotel! Here we go: Flight on American..arrive at the airport which is lovely... my husband's dive bag along w\/many other passengers bags didn't make the trip... the baggage claim did the best they could and assured us that the bag will be on the next flight. the taxi ride was not too grueling.... $30 dollars and a tip. We arrive to the lobby and what a beautiful sight. We chose the Royal Service package so we were shuttled to the private check -in . A sign outside of the door welcoming the two of us. Nice way to start 7 long days. We then were driven in the tram to our room. We chose the beachfront romance suite. Second floor of bldg#20. The room looked just like the pictures on the website. The beach is breathtaking.... the only view I wanted to see! The RS lounge serves breakfast and lunch along w\/hot and cold snacks in the evening.The concierge, Miguelina , was like a member of our family. If she hadn't heard from my husband on a daily basis, she was on the phone checking to see if all was good. She made dinner reservations for us without hesitation and was also a great help translating to room service. The majority of the staff speaks some english and if they don't someone is located to assist you. the RS beach is lovely and we sat one day. Our beach was right next to the dive shop and just as beautiful. Less crowded and right out the front door. The staff at the watersports and dive center are a bunch of the funniest people. while observing for 7 days, this resort is very safety conscious. All employees and guests wear life jackets for all water activities.During a rescue of an overturned sailboat the staff member ran down the beach,grabbed his life jacket and off he went. Very impressive. Not like that at the other hotels. We went deep sea fishing and caught nothing. The boat trolled in the ocean for 4 hours.... saw dolphins and little bird fish . The captain Miguel and his mate Leo were great!Scuba diving is nothing to write home about,,, very little life to be seen. Our stay was unforgettable and the service top notch! Oh, we took a few hundred dollars in 1's and 5's for tipping. Remember, just because traveling all-inclusive  shouldn't stop from tipping for great service. Enjoy!
