{"text":"Very nice It was a bit pricey - 275 Euro per night. But I got upgraded to a suite, and it was beautiful. It was a corner room that had two big windows. The southern facing window overlooked a canal. the bathroom was very nice too. there's a lot of automation in the room. You can control the curtains, the lights, the alarm clock all from a touch screen console. When it works, it's great. When it doesn't work, it's a pain - like the lights coming on in the middle of the night. I had to unscrew the light bulbs so that I could get some sleep.I like the location. It was in a very quiet part of town, away from all the hustle and bustle. But Amsterdam is a small city, and it doesn't take long to get to where the action is. There is a tram stop very close to the hotel. There's a tram every 15 minutes that takes you to the Dam and the Centraal Station. The Van Gogh museum and the Rijkmuseum are just a leisurely 20 minute walk from the hotel, and a good part of the walk is along a canal on the Hobbemakade Street, so it's very scenic.Be prepared to spend a little extra money in this hotel. Nothing's free. Wireless internet was 25 Euro per day. Local calls 3 Euro. The restaurants in the hotel are very expensive. I paid 75 Euro for a Japanese dinner. Good quality food, but overpriced. Another guest told me that you even had to pay to use the swimming pool. ","annotations":[]}
