{"text":"Love this Hotel We stayed here for two nights after a less than stellar stay at the Westin down the street. We got a good rate that included breakfast, and I signed up for the privilege card which gives you late checkout, and a free drink upon arrival. I didn't take advantage of either of those things, but they were nice if you had the opportunity to use them. All of the staff that we encountered were very helpful. I had reserved a queen bed for myself and my teenage daughter. We arrived before check in time. The front desk clerk said she could give us that room then, or if we could wait until 3 pm, she could give us a room with 2 twin beds. We jumped at that, so they held our bags, and we returned in the afternoon, wiped out from a day of walking and walking to the most comfortable beds we've ever slept in. It was like sleeping in a cloud. The bathroom was large, with huge soft white fluffy towels, and lots of fun extras, such as a candle, and teeth whitening mints. The tub was deep, and nice to soak in before going out for the night. We had so much fun sleeping in on the comfy beds, we didn't partake of the included breakfast. The Red Flame Diner a couple of doors down was great for carryout when returning back to the room from a show. This was my first time staying at a Sofitel, and hopefully not the last.
