{"text":"As good as the New York Algonquin at a third of the price! We spent three nights at the Chancellor during March break and not only did it meet our expectations but went beyond. Upon arrival in the bright elegant lobby, the very pleasant and efficient check-in clerk welcomed us an assigned us a room on the seventh floor. Unfortunately when we arrived the door was open displaying electrical tools on the floor and cables whichmeant that someone was working on something in the room. We returned to the front desk where apologies flowed from the clerk and a new room was immediately assigned to us at the back of the building (blissfully quiet!) on the 2nd floor. The beds were very comfortable (single twins),l the room small but elegantly furnished and the bathroom also small spotless with a jet-flushtoilet and a shower with superb water pressure. My friend immediately remarked the similarity of the Chancellor to the Algonquin Hotel in New York without the exorbitant cost (our rate was $92.75 a night) or the pretentious attitude. Little luxurytouches abounded such as the free Wi-Fi for your laptop (there is also a terminal in the lobby for guests with a printer that's free to use) the jar of candies on the table, the excellent first rate bathroom toiletries,the safe in the closet,the ceiling fan, pay for play movies that literally were still on at the theatres when we were there(Dreamgirls,Children Of Men..etc), the pillow menu,the free coffee and tea and cookies and muffins (all wonderful if you are not a big breakfast person as we are not first thing in the a.m.) and a choice of free newspapers. All ofthe staff without exception were courteous,professional and knowledgeable.In fact the sign of a good hotel in my estimation, is one where you actually look forward to returning to at day's end earlier rather than later. The little bar in the lobby is a good place for an aperitif before going out for the evening and just as nice for one's morning coffee while poring over that day's paper.The location of the hotel is unbeatable. On Powell Street at Union Square, it is a five minute downhill walk to the Powell St Bart and Muni transit systems and to the terminus of the cable cars that everyone should travel at least once on. As we were there for three days we bought Muni Passports for $18.00 each and good for three days. Seeing that a single ride on a cable caris $5.00, we saved a bundle as we travelled the very user friendly transit system constantly. Also at Union Square is the half-price theatre ticket booth where we got tickets for Beach Blanket Babylon, the hysterically funny musical revue that is an institution in San Francisco. It is not to be missed! Restaurants abound in the area, however a lot of them seemed to be designed for tourists. We avoided them and had some wonderful meals off the beaten path but never more than a ten or twelve minute cable car or bus ride away.May I wholeheartedly suggest the laid back and casual North Beach Lobster Shack (532 Green St) where we had delectable Maine lobsters (two 1  1\/4lb lobster dinners for $50.00), the amazing Swan Oyster Depot on Polk and California for lunch (not open for dinner) where the cracked crab, shrimp and oysters are the freshest anywhere and scrumptious (be prepared to line up as it only seats about twenty people at a counter but it is worth every minute of the wait), Brandy Ho's on Columbus for excellent and inexpensive Hunan style chinese cuisine (their dumplings are wonderful!) and The Zuni Cafe(another San Francisco gourmet institution) on Market and Gough for a high end smart casual lunch or dinner. They are famous for chicken for two which is roasted chicken with a bread salad dressing and which is jaw droppingly delectable.. A dinner for two with appetizers, main course and drinksand coffee (no dessert, as we were full) came to under $100.00.. Within an eight minute walk from the hotel, we also discovered a wonderful Indonesian restaurant on Post St, aptly named The Indonesia where everything we had was very delicious.We had a wonderful experience in one of our favorite cities and it was in no small part to the charm and comfort of the Chancellor.
