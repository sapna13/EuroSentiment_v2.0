{"text":"Clean hotel, central location My husband  I have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Principal in Barcelona. It is a clean hotel that's situated a few minutes walk from Las Ramblas  a metro station  offers free internet access. Our room was cleaned  towels changed daily  the bed linen also got changed once during our stay. The room was not very big, had a small balcony  a decent sized bathroom but the shower cubicle was tiny (though since being home I've seen a review by someone who said there's was massive!). I'd emailed ahead to ask for a balcony room  got a reply saying I'd to enquire on arrival at the hotel  it would be 10 Euros per night extra, we never enquired  just got it at no extra cost. There is an ample sized sun terrace on top of the hotel from which you can view the neighbours sleeping in a morning outside on their mattresses (ha ha). The hot  cold buffet breakfast was 7 Euros extra, we only went once, it was handy and filled a hole. The only real downsides were the fact that the cleaners started (too) early and the bottle bins were emptied even earlier, so if you're thinking of having a late night  a lie in, forget it! All in all, we paid √ä√£¬¢200 for 3 nights at a city hotel that was clean  centrally located, apart from the lack of lie in I guess we can't really grumble at that! ","annotations":[]}
