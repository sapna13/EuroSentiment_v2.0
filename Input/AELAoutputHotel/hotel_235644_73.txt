{"text":"Fantastic!!! A Fairytale Come True We have just come back from a 6 night 7 day stay from the fab pink Disneyland Hotel. We stayed in the Castle Club which is well worth the extra cost. We had views over the gardens towards Disney village. On arrival we had a very pleasant welcome then whisk upstairs to the private check in desk of the Castle Club, where you are allocated a room and given all information about Disney including your VIP FASTPASSES a definate plus. When arriving in our room there was Champagne on ice, 15th anniversary mugs filled with sweets, photo album, gift and VIP invitation to la vallee shops, and on the bed was two toys for the kids all available to purchase from the downstairs shop. Approx total of √ä√£¬¢65 worth. Great little touch! Also we could have soft drinks and tea\/coffee all day for no cost in restaurant overlooking the park which also laid on great cakes and fruit salad everyday at 4pm - 5pm. Every breakfast characters came round your table playing with the kids and at 4pm everyday there is a show with all the characters on the grand staircase where they dance with the kids and spend at least half an hour signing autographs and photo sessions. Your room key also takes you down to the park entrance at the turnstiles which is great after a very tiring day just pop in the lift which takes you right to your floor very little walking. Room service was pricey but the portions are hugh so can easily be split and save money also better quality than Disney park food! Each night the beds would be turned down and golden coins on the bed and all the toys placed on pillows etc our kids said Mickey Mouse had been in. All in all a fantastic experience and will be back every year at the Castle Club. Can't book for next year until Nov but already have prices and all set to do the same all over again. Must be good! Forgot to mention our kids loved the facility of the Minnie Club next to the Spa where they played on computers and made lots of things and enjoyed time out from the hussle and bussle of the parks just a couple of hours also gave us time to relax on our own to have a drink or go on the bigger rides all of this is included in your stay at the hotel. Our kids would go round after seeing the characters at 4pm then after that we would all go and have food and cocktails etc!!
