{"text":"What a Wonderful Vacation!!! We just returned from a week @ the Punta Cana Princess (from July 25 - Aug.1). It was everything we hoped for - nice accomodations, beautiful beaches, a wonderful pool and terrific service.The room was exactly as pictured - we were in building 5 (room 5105). The building is the closest to the beach and to the pool - it was a little noisy in the late afternoon when the Animacion Team was at the pool, but not a problem. Our room was made up by early afternoon every day, and was turned down each evening, with clean beach towels left for the next day. The minibar was restocked every day, as well.The food was okay - not gourmet, but we didn't expect that. Breakfast and lunch are buffets, either at Casabe or at Mare Nostrum (this was a smaller buffet). There certainly was enough to choose from, even for picky eaters. Dinners can either be at Casabe (if you want buffet) or at the a la carte restaurants. We enjoyed the Tex-Mex place (the filet mignon was wonderful!) the most. The fondue place was very enjoyable, as was the Italian restaurant (food was a little salty for me, but I don't use any salt on my food!). We didn't like the seafood restaurant too much because everything was cooked in lots of butter. The grounds are beautiful - and looked after every day - the beach is cleaned, and there never was any trouble finding a lounge chair at either the beach or the pool. The resort is very quiet, without much of a nightlife.We went on two excursions - to Saona Island and the Truck Safari. Saona is beautiful, but the bus ride to get there is very long (2 hours each way!) The truck safari was great - very informative about the Dominican and the people.All in all, this was a perfect vacation - restful and relaxing, and very hard to come home and go back to real life!!!
