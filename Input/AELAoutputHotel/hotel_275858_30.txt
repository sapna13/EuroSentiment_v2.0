{"text":"Hotel on the edge (of fashion and the city). Hope the a\/c works... I stayed here in June 2007. Having driven there, I found it quite easy to find (GPS), although you could drive straight past it without knowing there's a hotel there, as the entrance is a driveway between other buildings. The outside of the hotel strikes a grand impression and is completely incongruent with the interior, which is ultramodern. The floor I stayed on reminded me of what gothic teenagers would probably think of as heaven - black-painted winding passageways. The room was comfortable enough. There's a control by the bed which handles everything from the tv, the fairy lights embedded in the walls and the air-conditioning. Speaking of a\/c, ours did not work at all. We asked for it to be looked at but needed to forcibly remind them again when they had not looked at it while we were out. The maintenance guy fiddled around with it for a while to no avail. We were promptly given a new room with functioning a\/c (n.b. it won't work if the door to the balcony is ajar). The new room was twice as good as the first. It was much roomier and obviously the a\/c worked. The showers were indeed bizarre. A previous reviewer had a problem with transparent glass. It was translucent , but hey, it's Europe, and without the glass I reckon some people might get claustrophobia in there. This was only present in one out of the two rooms we stayed in.  I found the staff to be variable. Some were very friendly and respectful, others were languid and almost derogatory. There was a parking garage at a fee. The breakfast was excellent.There are two internet terminals available at a cost.There's a bar with funky chairs.It takes about 10 minutes walk to get anywhere of note, and probably about 15 to 20 minutes to reach the Ponte Vecchio.
