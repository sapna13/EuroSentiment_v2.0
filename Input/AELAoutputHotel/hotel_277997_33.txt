{"text":"~ Back Again! My wife and I spent a week at the Pointe Hilton Tapatio Cliffs over New Year's break, 2008. We have been to the Phoenix\/Scottsdale area many times, and have stayed at the Pointe a number of times before: winter and summer seasons.Needless to say, if we didn't like it, I wouldn't have booked this stay. However, I must say that having returned to the Pointe so often ~ probably 7 or 8 times, dating back 12 years ~ that we'll book someplace else, for our next visit.Remembering back to my first stay ~ a business trip ~ I was really impressed with the resort: unique grounds, great facilities, a nice selection of restaurants, fantastic pool area, comfortable and spacious rooms. I can tell you this: if you're a first-time visitor, you will probably love the place. After a couple business trips, I returned there a few times on my own, and actually got engaged at A Different Pointe of View, the upscale restaurant on the property. So, all things considered, the Pointe will always be special to me\/us.On this most-recent visit, we used the Pointe as an home base. Aside from breakfast, we drove to other restaurants in the Phoenix\/Scottsdale area to go the local route. As you know, it's always fun to try new restaurants, and go back to some local-area favorites. And there are plenty of great restaurants, not more than a 30-minute drive from the Pointe.If there was a negative Pointe on this trip, it would be the breakfast. We got the Hilton's Bounce Back Breakfast Deal. For a discounted price, you get to select from the breakfast menu every day. However, be careful here and read the fine print. To be fair, just about everything is included in the deal option; you can get a very inclusive breakfast everyday, including juice and coffee. But, read the menu closely. For example: one morning, my wife elected to order a breakfast entree that actually cost less than what I paid for the daily breakfast meal deal ~ you get coupons to use at the restaurant every day. Along with the entree, she ordered juice. Well, the entree she ordered did not include juice, so we got billed an extra $4.00. That rubbed me the wrong way. But those are the rules\/terms, folks. So, read the fine print, or ask the waiter\/waitress, before you order. Also, on this trip, a couple of the breakfasts came to us cool, not hot. Cool eggs. Hashed browns. Sausage\/Bacon. It was just OK. I don't usually complain about minor things like this. However, it was sub-par, when expecting a nice, hot breakfast. Other than that . . .If you've never been to the Pointe, by all means, give it a try. If you're a young couple, it's a romantic place. If you have kids, the pool area is special, and there's a place to keep your kids, too. (Do everybody a favor, though. Keep them away from that young couple looking for a little romance!) There's something here for everybody to enjoy. Singles. Families. Young marrieds. Business travelers. Active older folks, too. First trip? You'll probably want to come back again. Like I said above, I did. We did. Now, for the time being . . .We'll leave the Pointe to you, . . . for a while.
