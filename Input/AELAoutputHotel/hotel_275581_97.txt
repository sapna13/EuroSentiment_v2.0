{"text":"Modern  I stayed at the City Inn Westminster as part of a world trip in January 2008. This hotel is modern and comfortable, but the rooms are quite compact. The beds are very soft, which I found a little uncomfortable, but it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ give me a backache. The rooms were very clean and even had one opening window, which was nice. The bathrooms were immaculately clean. The reception staff were friendly and helpful. The buffet breakfasts were wonderful, with bacon and eggs made to order, every morning. As I was travelling with a large group, most mornings we were given a private area to dine in (when it was available, which was really nice). On one occasion we encountered a rude waiter who asked us to hurry up at breakfast, and they were busy, so it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ the request that bothered me, more the mode it was delivered in. But he turned out to be quite friendly the next day, so maybe he was just stressed by the volume of people in for breakfast. I dined at the restaurant and the bar, and I actually thought the bar food was better √à√\u2020\u2022?better priced and better tasting (but the breakfast was the best food). Overall, I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel and the location was great for sightseeing (close to Westminster Abbey) √à√\u2020\u2022?well, it was great for the sights we were seeing anyway! The only real downside is the cost, but London is a very expensive city, so I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not sure that anywhere else would be any cheaper. I would stay here again without hesitation and would recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to London. ","annotations":[]}
