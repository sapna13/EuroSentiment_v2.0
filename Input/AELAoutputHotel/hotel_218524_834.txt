{"text":"We had a great time! The hotel was amazing! We were on our honeymoon and couldn't have asked for a better experience... The hotel pool was wonderful and the beach was beautiful. The food was amazing (and I'm a very picky eater). Our hotel room was very nice - and the view from the balcony was even better. The hotel staff does their best to make sure that you get whatever you need and\/or want. A suggestion... there is the option to upgrade to the Excellence Club - because we were on our honeymoon, we thought this would be great... well, we found out that for the extra $170 USD a day, it really wasn't worth it. All we received was access to their club which did have snacks throughout the day --- but, there is food everywhere at the resort and so this wasn't such a big deal for us. The other options that we were told went with the upgrade were also part of the normal rooms at the hotel --- so, for us, it was a lot of money spent on nothing. The only great part of the upgrade was the view of the ocean from the balcony in our room.The other disappointing part is the drive from the airport to the hotel ---- it was about an hour and the road conditions aren't the best --- take some medication if you suffer from car sickness. But --- the drive is really worth it. The hotel is secluded and there aren't any vendors on the beach hounding you to purchase anything. It really is heaven... total relaxation and seclusion. It's perfect for a honeymoon --- or to get away with that special someone! We loved it.
