{"text":"If You Like Service With A Smile...Skip TRhis Hotel! Like many of the reviews say, this hotel has a wonderful location in the heart of Barcelona right on the Passeig de Gracia and near the many Gaudi attractions and high-end shops. The rooms are small and a bit drab; yet, this could still be a good choice, except for the TERRIBLE SERVICE.Service at this hotel is totally lacking! Before we traveled, I tried on numerous occasions to enlist the help of the conceirge to make advance dinner reservations for the nights that we were meeting business friends. Well, there does not seem to be a concierge, leaving such tasks to the front desk personnel. I tried emailing the hotel directly from its Web site, but received no response. Eventually, I tried faxing the hotel, and finally received a response by email. However, my replies back usually went unanswered.Upon arriving at the hotel and throughout our 5 night stay, it just didn't seem possible to get a smile or a positive reaction from anyone at the front desk. Inquiries were curt and matter of fact, at best. Calls to the front desk from our room often went unanswered. Twice I needed to go downstairs to the front desk, only to find one of the two clerks tying up the phone line with a personal call that she chose not to end until I interrupted her.Further, our room was never cleaned before 3:30 PM and in two days of bsuiness meetings in the hotel, the meeting rooms were never cleaned during breaks nor were water and sodas replenished.I have travelled to many fine hotels, and I'm sorry to say that this just isn't close to that class. For whatever reason (perhaps is training), they just don't seem to care at all.It's too bad! ","annotations":[]}
