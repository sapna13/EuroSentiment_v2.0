{"text":"Loved Le Jardin De Cluny Hotel Le Jardin De Cluny was the perfect launching place for our first trip to Paris. We relied heavily on reviews found on TripAdvisor and elsewhere in making our plans. We finally chose the Hotel based on relative convenience to the Metro, room size (two twin beds in a 15sq metre room), a more reasonable rate, and good comments about the staff. From the first e-mail, the staff was prompt and helpful. They provided directions from the airport and Metro; they agreed to a rate found elsewhere on the web including breakfast for two, and also provided a sounding board for Ballet tickets. (Thank you to Morgan, Medjid and Andrea!)We reconfirmed a week or two before arrival, and received a cheery reassurance and welcome. And, when we arrived, Andrea greeted us with early check-in to our room, and even helped to load us into the lift with our luggage. She also provided extensive information on transit and sights, between other front desk business. The information was very useful to us, given our √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªookie√à√\u2020\u2022?status, and we changed our first day itinerary as a result.The chambermaids, breakfast staff and other staff were all extremely polite and helpful. As requested, we turned our key in when we left the Hotel, and each day when we returned the room was spotless. I would say that we were a pretty low-maintenance pair of guests. We have traveled to other countries, so our expectations were set accordingly. Having read that rooms are sometimes switched on guests at other Hotels, we were a bit nervous at arrival, however, our room was exactly what we anticipated from the description we had received. The Hotel is on a quiet residential side street, so other than some noise from the TV in the room above, typical for a small hotel such as this, we found the location very quiet. Our room looked out over both a street and the bathroom window opened to the courtyard. We were very comfortable, and had enough room to leave our two suitcases out in the room through out our stay. Our understanding is that the Hotel was fully booked during most of our stay, however, there was always a sense of quiet and peace at the Hotel. We saw a mix of business and pleasure travelers, most of shorter stays than ours, and very few younger children.We chose to eat on-site, thanks to a good inclusive rate, and really enjoyed simply rolling downstairs to the breakfast room in the cellar (shades of Orwell). The coffee was delicious and strong, and the other offerings were extensive enough to give us 7 days of varying choices: chopped fresh fruit, various breads and croissants, multiple flavors of yogurts, meats and cheeses, cereals, eggs, etc. While this is not the Ritz, it was wonderfully welcoming and comfortable. The Hotel is small, but well-kept, and the staff really made us feel at home. They assisted with locating a pharmacy when a cold took hold, and also helped locate an internet caf√ã√\u2022√ñ for us when the Hotel computer√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hard drive fried and we needed to access e-mail. We never felt unsafe in the Hotel or the area, which is filled with students, business people, tourists and residents. (And their dogs - watch where you step in Paris!)There are 3 Metro stations in the area of the Hotel, The Cluny stop being the closest at only a couple of blocks away. We enjoyed the walk to the St. Michel station, where there were more options for various lines. While we bought the books of 10 tickets, we were on the cusp of wishing we had purchased the Carte Orange. We did buy the Museum Pass (6 day) which clearly saved time and money for us -- we covered a lot of territory and this put us right at the head of the line! We did not try taking the bus, although the Hotel recommended this highly. There is a small store selling staples, drinks, wine very close to the Hotel, and multiple bistros, brasseries, cafes and restaurants to choose from. We highly recommend this Hotel as excellent value, great staff, accessibility to transportation, and peace and quiet ","annotations":[{"endOffset":637,"mention":"Morgan","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Captain_Morgan"],"startOffset":631},{"endOffset":637,"mention":"Morgan","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Captain_Morgan"],"startOffset":631},{"endOffset":2454,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2448},{"endOffset":2454,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2448},{"endOffset":2454,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2448},{"endOffset":2454,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2448},{"endOffset":2454,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2448},{"endOffset":2454,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2448},{"endOffset":2600,"mention":"breads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":2594},{"endOffset":2615,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":2605}]}
