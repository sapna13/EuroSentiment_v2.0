{"text":"Worthwhile if they hold the prices My room was almost absurdly large, particularly for this (or any other) area of Manhattan. Nothing was absolutely top-notch, but everything about the property was at least decent; cleanliness, bed quality, etc.One problem that wasn't handled as well as I would have liked. Around 8:15 one morning, I headed for the shower before a 9 o'clock meeting. No hot water; none. I called the front desk, and they sounded puzzled; said they would check with engineering. 15 minutes later, no response, and still no hot water. I called the front desk again, and they seemed even more shocked; said they would send engineering up to my room. 15 or 20 minutes later, still nothing, and still no hot water. I called again, and the manager told me it was a mechanical problem and the whole hotel had no hot water, and beyond that they really didn't know what to tell me. I was pretty steamed (ha!); took a bracing cold shower, got dressed, and then the manager called to tell me the hot water was back!Part of me thinks this could happen anywhere, but the fact of the matter is it generally doesn't, and that makes me wonder if their overall physical plant is as well maintained as it ought to be. The manager was pretty nice, and it was nice of him to call me back when the hot water returned (although it was too late for me), but the overall confusion and non-responsiveness through my first couple phone calls were aggravating. He took a big chunk off my bill, but I'd have rather had the hot shower!Business center on the 2d floor has a couple computers and a printer, which is handy, although the computer (which you pay for with a credit card swipe) was not the most user friendly system, and the printer (a Brother inkjet) just sucked.Still, for rooms this big, in this location, and particularly if the prices stay modest, this place is definitely worth consideration.
