{"text":"Perfect hotel for tourists...or even for a wedding reception As mentioned before, this hotel is excellent for tourists as it is well located in the middle of DC.....However, our experience is a little different as we live in DC and decided to have our wedding reception at the Sofitel. Our wedding was relatively small with 60 people and we knew about 80% of our guest would be coming from out of town so we wanted a good location and excellent service - we were not disappointed.We did stay two nights in the Bridal Suite so our room was absolutely amazing, a den, a huge bedroom, giant bathroom, a hallway, etc. More importantly, our guests reported that their rooms and experiences were also excellent. From the friendly bellman, helpful concierge and service oriented front desk reception, all of our guests reported that the hotel staff could not have been friendlier or more service oriented.With a combined 40 nights booked at the hotel, and numerous meals at Le Bar, meals at Cafe 15 (chosen one of the best 50 restaurants in DC) we can report that 99.9% of the time the experience was wonderful for us and our guest. Like any hotel, occasionally there is a hiccup, but it was always quickly resolved and not worth detailing out.  This is a hotel that is not flashy, nor overly extravagant - it is a hotel that prides itself on incredible friendly service, well-appointed and luxurious appointments with a slight European\/hip feel and food that is excellent. I highly recommend this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
