{"text":"Great location, so so service The hotel is located very conveniently near Columbus Avenue (North Beach restaurants), Union Square (shopping), and the Ferry Building. There is also easy access to the BART system and cable cars. The hotel is clean and comfortable with free internet and free bottled water which was great. They are, however, slightly light on the amenities as we only received two towels and a fairly horrible 2 in 1 shampoo. The bathroom is very small and there is also a lack of face cloths and hand towels. On the second night, the cleaning staff forgot to clean our room entirely which we noticed upon returning to the room at about 6 PM. When we inquired at the front desk, the night manager became quite uptight and tried to blame us essentially accusing us of forgetting to remove the do not disturb sign which was not the case at all. We did not get so much as an apology and he was rather rude. Individuals like this should not work in the service industry or should be confined to 1 star hotels next to the highway. Upon returning to our room again at 11 PM we noticed that he had dumped a couple of fresh hotels on the bed but did not bother to even remove the used ones from the floor of the bathroom. This individual gets a rating of terrible, and knocks the rating of the entire hotel to a neutral \/ average.Still the rates are quite good for a downtown hotel and if they actually remember to clean your room it is almost like staying in a nicer place.
