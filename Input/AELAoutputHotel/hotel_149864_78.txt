{"text":"Fun, Fun, Fun! Okay, so now we're club med groupies...We just got back yesterday, June 23 from a week stay with myself, my husband, and two kids, 3 and 6. Also my mother in law and other in laws. This was our second trip to club med, the first one was in Ixtapa. Basically, we love it. It's just simple, easy fun for families. Everything you and your kids need is right there at all times. I think we like it because of the feeling the resort gives off. By the end of the week, you know the GO's, they know your kids, you know the routine and how and where to have fun, what sport you tried and liked and what you stayed away from and when you want to relax. It really becomes sort of like a village.Resort: The grounds are beautiful and well layed out. It could use an update as some things are starting to show their age. Great view from the Hispaniola restaurant. Room: Good for families. Two daybeds on one side with a king on the other with pocket doors in between. Drawbacks are that the TV is on the kids side, so after they fall asleep you can't really watch. Also (I was very surprised about this), they don't have or offer bedrails for the beds. We tried to fashion some out of the pillows, but my kids fell out of the bed twice on the first day onto the hard tile floor. The beds are narrower than regular twin beds, so difficult to do with pillows. Huge closet was great. We were able to store all our junk and our beach stuff out of the way. IMPORTANT--NO SELF-LAUNDRY FACILITIES. We did not know this, because Ixtapa had machines in the buildings, so this made things a bit harder. Bring lots of clothes or easy to clean items. Basically for your kids during the day all you need is a bathing suit and a UV protected bathing shirt. You will need more appropriate clothes for the evening.Food: GREAT! Especially loved the gala buffet. They greet you with caviar and then smoked salmon, lobster, terrines, duck with orange sauce, etc. Yummy.Shows: Very nice. There is a mini-club show every night which are very silly but my kids thought they were hilarious. The family shows are pretty good too. The circus show was great as was the Dominican show.I especially like the aerobics\/dance routine that gets everyone reared up each night!Weather: REALLY HOT, I mean really hot, by 8:00 am. The pool is no relief, it's hotter than my shower. Go for the ocean! Better later in the afternoon.Kid's clubs: It is somewhat like summer camp, except a very high class summer camp, where the kids go to circus school, archery, skating, snorkeling, etc. The facilites of the mini club are also very updated and probably the best kept on the resort. My 6 year old an his cousin were together and they really liked the GO's and the activities. They are extremely energetic and get to know your kids and really try to make it fun. Without their energy and fondness of the kids, it would just be daycare.My younger son was not happy about being separated from his brother, but made friends with one of the GO'sin the petite club and we truly appreciated the attention he payed to him. He only went for half the day.We took salsa lessons which were very fun, kayaked, skated and played tennis, lied on the beach and played with our kids all day until 11:00. We were pretty tired by the end of the week. But we couldn't say we were bored.
