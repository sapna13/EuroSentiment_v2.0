{"text":"Hilton misses the mark I have to say that Hilton missed the mark again. I was actually excited to come to this resort after reading the reviews here because I really don't have any confidence in the Hilton brand. I believe they are masters at puffing the goods. It seems that many of the Hilton properties are touted as being the best and when you arrive, you are always short changed. This property didn't differ.I came to this property for a business function. Prior to arrival, I was concerned that I receive a quality room due to the many comments about the rooms being dated. I was assured I would receive a great room and upon arrival, I recieved a room with a view of the adjacent highway. HINT: When a customer takes the time to call prior to arrival, you have a small idea they might be a tad bit high maintenance. A note in the file and a proper room assignment might have been a good idea on their part, but this is absolutely typical of the Hilton brand. Of course I requested a move and only when pushed did the staff offer me a pool view for an upcharge of $50. The staff assumed that because there was an upcharge, I wouldn't pay it. How ridiculous! I accepted the upcharge and was happy to have a better view. The room was spacious and fairly well appointed. I would agree it was dated, but according to the staff it IS remodeled. They did a remodel about 4 years ago on the entire property, so what you see is what you get.During my stay, we ran out of toilet paper. We had to request this from the staff FOUR times. This was ridiculous given that we had put the empty roll out for the housekeeping staff to see. There were other occasions where I needed to call the front desk (usually to request toilet paper) and found they did not answer the phone. I needed to know what time my event started and was quoted a wrong time which caused me to arrive late. I needed to know what time check out was an had to call three times before someone answered. The pool was lovely, the staff were friendly and helpful and provided great service. The property is full of hills (it sits on the side of a cliff) but I didn't mind that. I found a very private pool w\/ hot tub called the Hidden Valley pool that was very enjoyable and I never saw another soul there.The property needs maintenance and again I feel they missed the mark in using red, green, yellow and blue lighting all over the property which gives you a sense you might have been transported to the Circus. The Cabannas are a joke - don't waste your time or money. There are small touches everywhere that reflect Hilton's lack of attention to detail which will cause this this frequent traveler to continue to AVOID the Hilton Brand.
