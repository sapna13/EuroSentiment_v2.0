{"text":"Outstanding!! Ok, Yes the road to the Resort is long and bumpy, however that has nothing to do with the resort itself. We booked the Excellence Club and check in was very easy. We pulled up to the breath taking resort and was greeted with a big smile. Our bags were taken for us and we were taken the Excellence Club. At that point we were given a tour of the club and the manager explained to us everything about the resort. We were then lead to out room in building 7 and were surpised to see we were upgraded for free to a swim up room. The honeymoon banner was on the door, and the room was clean and had fresh flowers. We were well stocked up with drinks and there was fresh fruit on the table. Our housekeeper kept the room spotless the whole week and we had turn down serive in the evening. We spent most our time at the pool, for the water is not that clear in the ocean. It was worth paying for the Excellence Club, for us since we used the free internet to keep contact with our children. It was also nice just to grab a snack or sit out on the balcony to have your morning coffee. The service that we received was wonderful. The food was good, we loved The Grill. The shows were entertainging, and the staff was so helpful and friendly. The customer service at the resort is the best!! Yes, it is all exclusive however after I saw the great service that I was getting I wanted to tip!!! Bring a stack of ones. We ended up giving out about $150 worth of tips during our stay, not because we need to , we wanted to. We took a excursion, The Outback Safari and it was a good time. The others on our trip that were staying at other hotels were saying they didn't like Dreams, I was thinking to myself glad I didn't stay there. We were sad to leave but will return!! Bottom line Excellence was everything I wished for and more!! We loved it!!!!
