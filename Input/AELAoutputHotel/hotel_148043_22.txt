{"text":"Loved El Convento My sister and I spent two nights at El Convento on a trip to celebrate her birthday. The hotel is old-fashioned and elegant, but not glitzy, which is what I like. It reminded me of European hotels. Because we were there in the off season, we found a rate of $125\/night on the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ website, a bargain compared to the high season rates. The hotel is in walking distance of all the major sites of the city. I recommend this hotel for travelers who want total immersion into the charms of Old San Juan. I do not recommend it for anyone who wants a new building on the beach with big rooms, Jacuzzi tubs, a casino, dancing, etc.The hotel is built around an open courtyard, featuring a restaurant surrounding a large old Nispero tree. Instead of hallways, rooms open on to galleries overlooking the courtyard. Outside each room is a small table and chairs overlooking the courtyard. Our room was small, but had old-fashioned charm√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√∂rought-iron headboards for the beds and antique furniture. A full√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√™√°ength window at one end offered a view of a small street below and in the distance, the Atlantic Ocean.A plus was an area with a refrigerator, stocked with free bottled water, and complimentary terry-cloth robes. An honor bar with drinks and snacks was on a terrace downstairs. Tea and coffee were complimentary. At 6 pm, a free reception offered a number of kinds of wine, plus cheeses and fruit. We enjoyed talking to fellow guests at the reception.The pool is small, but the view of the cathedral from the upper terrace is spectacular. There is also a hot tub. We ate at El Picateo, the El Convento restaurant that specializes in tapas. Our server recommended empanadillas filled with lobster to go with the pina coladas we had been craving. They were scrumptious and started us off on a week in which everything we ate was delicious.My only complaint was the $20 resort fee charged on top of the room rates. We arrived after 10 pm the first night so I asked that it be waived since we did not take advantage of any resort features, such as the option to get a pass to a sister hotel on the beach. However, we still had to pay it.
