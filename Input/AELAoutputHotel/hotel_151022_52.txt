{"text":"Amazing time at the Natura Park resort! -Well, my family and I just got back from the Natura Park in the Dominican Republic and we found it very beautiful! The grounds were very well kept and the wild life was great. - The rooms are very nicely done and the maids are very out going. If you have a problem in your room you can call the front desk or go down to talk to them in person. But be patient, it seems the hotel staff are more fluent in French then they are English.- The service at the eateries are a little slow....but heck your on a vacation! No need to hurry. We tried the Seafood and Stakehouse eateries and they were absolutly fabulous! The service in those two were exceptional. But be sure to book a couple of days ahead if you want to eat in them because they fill up quickly.- YOu can find huge conch shells. Just walk 30-40 min down the strech of beach to where no resorts are. Don;t worry it is safe, there is security all along there. The kids had a lot of fun, and the pool was oh so refreshing when you went in. There is a little patern to the night shows that play. One night it is a little more goofy like Mr\/Mrs Natura park and sometimes the shows are fabulous like M Jackson show or the Dominican night show.All in all this resort was very nice,clean and funIf you want to get a palapa or chairs by the pool, you have to get up around 6 30ish that way you have the most selection I would deffinatly go back for a second time.
