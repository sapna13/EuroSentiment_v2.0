{"text":"It was lovely ! My friends and I stayed here from 1st - 15th May 2006. As it was a last minute booking, I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews on here. I had said to my friends that if it really was as bad as people said, I was going to change hotels !! We had abolsultely NO reason to do so, the place is really good. We arrived at the reception via taxi from Punta Cana airport (as we didn't want to wait for the coach with other drop off's before us, it only cost $25 for the 3 of us). We asked for a beach view room but were told that it was near to the disco and would be quite noisy at night - we didn't really believe them as we thought that they we just fobbing us off. Our rooms (we had 1 each) were in the village section and were fantastic, 1 had a view of the gardens and the other a view of the lake with ducks and other birds. They were very clean, with remote controlled tv, mini fridge (stocked daily with water) and a nice bathroom with plenty of towels provided. Our maid arrived around 9am each day, just when we were leaving for breakfast. One friend really didn't believe the guy on reception regarding the beach view rooms and opted to have one - glad I didn't !! We went back to her room one night for a night cap and the noise from the disco was really loud and made the patio window vibrate, nice and loud when we were in there mind ! but when I need sleep I like it to be quiet !The food was good in both the buffet restaurants but the one nearest the reception was the best. At breakfast there was an vast selction of food from toast and pastries to a separate grill chef cooking every which way with eggs. Lunch we either spent at the restaurant on the beach which served burgers, fries and chicken each day but we got a bit feb up with that as the week went on, then we started to get the shuttle bus (to hot and lazy for the 10min walk!) to go to the main restaurants. We went for dinner each evening at around 8pm and had no trouble at all getting a table. We tried the other restaurants too and they were also good, we usually booked them with customer services after breakfast about 2 days in advance and they had no trouble at all meeting our requests.The entertainment was not to my taste but the animation team did their best to arrange something for everyone. The disco was ok but they tended to play alot of salsa music but hey I'm on holiday!! They had numerous activities daily on the beach from dancing lessions, aqua aerobics to vollyball. Something for everyone (but try and get us girls off of our sunloungers).The beach was gorgeous, beautiful white sand and clear warm water, needless to say we spent all of our time there. The people were friendly and couldn't do enough for us, they always had a smile on their faces and made us feel very welcome. We made some great friends and had great times.There is only one thing I didn't like about this place and that was the photographers on the beach with animals, I wish people wouldn't let them take their pictures with them - but that is only my opinion.This place is well worth the price we paid, so much so, we are thinking about going again later this year. A holiday is what you make it, so relax and enjoy !!
