{"text":"Average place to stay, good location I stayed at this hotel for 2 weeks for a business trip. Was booked into an executive suite which was quite comfortable. First was given a room on the 7th floor which was immaculate and very quiet. (excluding the little outside noise that you can hear and live with). Was told the internet connection was included in the room rate unfortunately it wasn't working so they moved me to the 13th floor. This room absolutely stank and was very dusty. Made me wish i didn't complain about the internet connection. Once i logged in I realised they were charging extortionate rate for internet access. Forget it! Even the IT support staff think it should be included. Think the lower floors are kept for business travelers and the upper floor for holiday makers. The upper floors are definitely more used and a little more run down. You get loud groups staying up there who want to party hard at the weekends. The room service menu is very basic and fairly limited, but the location is superb. Only a couple of blocks to circular key (opera house and bridge) and The Rocks. Darling habour takes about 10-15 mins walk. Got the Oz flu whilst I was out there and was really bad one night. No doctors were open so the hotel arranged for a hotel doctor to visit who charged AUD$300 for coming out. Ouch!!!!Did the Blue Mountains tour with FJ tours. Too much time is spent at other places and only an hour at the blue mountains which has 3 rides to do. You don't really get time to appreciate where you are coz you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e so rushed. I wouldn't recommend these organised tours. If possible take the train out and do it at your own pace. Think there is trolley service that links the mountains and the rail station. Also went out to Manly and climbed the pylon rather than doing the bridge climb. The sydney tower also has fab views but the bridge and opera house are obscured by the high rise buildings.
