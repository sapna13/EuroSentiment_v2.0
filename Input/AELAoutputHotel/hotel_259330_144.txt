{"text":"Great Resort with Problems March 21-29. First of all I will say the resort itself is wonderful. The ground are immaculate, beautiful pools, clean beach, and there is noting to complain about the food. (although the 2 a la carte's we did were nothing to write home about - Dominican and Sea Food) Our vacation would have been perfect except for a few problems. We were in building # 8 (select section). First 2 days the hot water was barely a warm trickle-not enough pressure to keep the shower on , 3rd day a cold trickle, then 3 days of good showers and the last day a cold trickle again. No air conditioning for over 24 hrs.. No towels one day, but they were delivered within 15min of calling reception. The bed sheets were too short for the beds resulting in a dirty mattress pad at your feet. When we arrived the bar fridge was stocked with water, pop, juices, chips, candy etc. Knowing that only 4 bottles of pop and the gallon of water are all-inclusive, I emptied out the fridge (into a drawer) and stocked it with our own stuff. The next day, my stuff was emptied and the fridge got re-stalked. We went to the reception and explained that we now had double bar fridge contents. We were told to put everything on the dresser and it would be taken care of and that there would be no charge since we did not use it. The next day one set of contents was removed. BUT... when we went to check out at the end of our stay.... we were dinged with a $71 US bar bill. I guess someone forgot to document the fact they removed the second re-stocking. (PS they charge $3.00 for a bottle of water) They were very rude and ignorant about it at the reception. We were not the only ones fighting bogus bar bills. (I guess this is how they make extra money..... or they have a theft problem with staff, since anyone could have entered our room and taken the second set.... we definitely did not use it) This incident did leave a sour taste in my mouth. Also note, the bar fridge does not function without the room key inserted. (all power in the room shuts off when you leave....if you have meds that need the fridge, make sure you ask for an extra room key so the fridge will run all day, and then tape it in the slot so the maid does not remove it like she did the first day to us)The other problem this resort has is it has expanded (with the club and select sections) beyond its beach capacity. We found the beach too crowed with not enough umbrellas or chairs. Shade was hard to find without encroaching on someone else's personal space. Forget getting up at 6am.... all the umbrellas are taken by 3am on the beach. You might get one by the pool at that time, but by 6:30, they are also taken. (PS. Take off your wrist band and go to the resort next door.... they have plenty of space)All that being said, we had a great time, and as long as you don't run into any problems like we did, you will have a fabulous holiday.PS. I have been to the Dominican 5 times and to Cuba 5 times and this is the first time I have had any real problems. I guess it was just my turn. I am still hoping to resolve the bar issue and get a refund.If anyone wants more info. contact me at beertoal@gmail.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":870,"mention":"chips","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":877,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":872},{"endOffset":870,"mention":"chips","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":877,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":872},{"endOffset":870,"mention":"chips","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Potato_chip","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":865},{"endOffset":877,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":872},{"endOffset":2340,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2336},{"endOffset":2340,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2336}]}
