{"text":"Perfect hotel! My boyfriend treated me to a weekend in London for my birthday and we stayed here at the convert garden hotel. On arrival we were warmly greeted. Then got wished a happy birthday from simon on check in (my boyfriend must had mentioned this when he booked) which i thought was really nice that they remembered.They also told us as this was our first visit to the hotel, we both would recieve a completmentary back and shoulder massage consisting of 15minutes for free! What a lovely suprise - just was soo gutted as we just never got the time to take it! Busy weekend planed! Got shown to our room which was lovely! It was room 317 which was a junior suite. Very spacious, had a flat screen satilite tv, a living space with table and a massive bath with seperate shower. Very lovely room indeed! Room comes with bath robes, slippers, hairdryer and radio. Nice touches were everytime we went out\/came back they remembered our names and asked us about our day ect. Then When we returned from our day out, we found a lovely box of chocolates wrapped in a bow with a card saying that the hotel hoped we had seatled in ok and wishing us a lovely evening! What a nice thing to do!!Then when we returned after dinner and a night on the town, all our curtains had been pulled, radio turned on low and some lavender spray for a peacefull nights sleep. The breakfast was lovely! We had a full english included which we could have had in our room if we wished. The fruit juice was perfectly squeezed, and they had a buffet of toast, bagels, cold meat, crumpets, cereal and fruit which we could help ourselfs to aswell. Overal - the hotel was wonderful. Really attentive and personal and i would love to come back here! Really made my birthday. Just perfect.The desk staff even gave us a map and pin pointed a few really good bars to go to! Very friendly indeed. Dining tip - my boyfriend booked up the stunning resturant 'clos maggoires' which was a 4minute walk from this hotel. What a resturant!! Beautful french food in a wonderful decor! Really the most romantic resturant i have ever been in, especailly in the conservatory with a burning log fire (defo ask to be seated in there!) Our bill was √ä√£¬¢130 but you get what you pay for! Would recomend this resturant to anybody, and this was the place who recomended the hotel to my boyfriend.
