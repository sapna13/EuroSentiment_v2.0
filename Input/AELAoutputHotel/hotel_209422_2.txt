{"text":"A Fine Hotel, But Some Ups and Downs. My wife and I spent 2 nights here before heading to Maui for the 'real' vacation. Honolulu is just too crowded, busy and industrialized for our tastes, but we did want to see Pearl Harbor, so we started in Honolulu and chose the Prince Kuhio because of my Hilton Diamond status and a great rate (only about $120\/night).The room was FANTASTIC. We booked a standard room and were upgraded to an ocean view, which had a small lanai with two chairs. The bathroom was huge, the large flat-panel TV was nice, and the king bed was super comfy. Good sized room for Honolulu, and appears to have been recently refurbished. Nice decor and very modern.If you're driving, you must valet your car ($25 a day)...Pretty standard for Honolulu or any 'downtown' hotel. Just be prepared for that. The valet guys were really friendly and helpful. Check-in desk was the same.The down side was the 'executive lounge'...As a gold or diamond member, you generally get free access to these at Hiltons. If you are gold\/diamond, you know that they can vary from property to property...It was nowhere near one of the better ones. It's located in the basement. Breakfast was strictly continental--bagels, muffins and fruit. The 'evening' spread was pitiful, cheap and the hotel seemed to 'mail it in'--since they have to provide something, they do the minimum, and they make no qualms about it. There were veggies with dip, crackers, and one hot item--one night it was egg rolls, the next night was jalapeno poppers. A mini fridge housed the 'complimentary' soft drinks, with the tackiest sign I've ever seen in an executive lounge. It read, Limit One Soft Drink Per Person. WOW. So, needless to say, no complimentary cocktails...A sign in the lounge said you could buy a bottle of beer or glass of wine for $5-$8. A far cry from many Hiltons which not only don't limit your Diet Cokes to ONE, but also freely flow booze\/wine\/beer without charge...Yes, I'm spoiled by other Hiltons around the world. But their limitations seemed pretty tacky and left a bad taste in my mouth, but not enough to spoil what is otherwise a fine hotel. Close to Waikiki beach--about a 7 minute walk to the beach, and great views with the oceanview rooms. Many nearby shops and eateries. We'd probably stay here again if we ever go back to HNL, but probably won't, as it doesn't even compare to Maui--we're already planning next year's trip back to the Islands, and are avoiding Oahu.
