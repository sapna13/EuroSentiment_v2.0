{"text":"Great Trip Overall the resort gets high marks. As with any resort there is always something negative that can be said if you dig deep enough. But I wont worry anyone with any here since they would be minor and trivial. This is the review of 2 couples in the 26 - 31 age group.The food was good; buffet had a good selection and there are so many a la carte restaurants to choose from if that's your cup of tee.The rooms were clean, no bugs, and the bathrooms had everything you need. What else could you ask for? Your on vacation people so hopefully your spending more time out of your room than in it.The beach? This is Punta Cana, it's great! Although I will say that I rate the Bavaro Beach (about 20 mins away) higher. Bavaro Beach is where you will find the majority of hotels in the Punta Cana area. Our beach was nice, and if you like secluded, this is your place as this Cocotal (and it's sister hotel attached, Tropical) are the only hotels here.The Animacion (activities) are extremely friendly and they'll get you participating in a bunch of activities whether you are young or old. Most of the staff (wait and bar) and young and friendly.This hotel has visitors from across the globe and 2 great places to meet them are the lobby bar and the pool bar. We met people from England, France, Germany and from our native Canada (BC and Quebec). I would rate meeting all these different people as one of the best parts of the trip.The best advice I can offer anyone using this site for advice on a hotel; remember that these are individual opinions and everyone has a different one. I think that a positive or negative review can be either or simply on how much you paid for your trip. If I had paid $1200 for 1 week here I would probably be a bit disappointed (comparing it to the Bavaro Princess where I stayed previously), but since I Paid $680 then my review dramatically different.Hopefully this review will help you.
