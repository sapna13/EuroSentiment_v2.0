{"text":"Economical and nice location I was at this hotel from May 20-28th. The hotel is in an area of Barcelona called Vallcarca. The hotel is walking distance to great restaurants, supermarkets, shops, cafe's ect. The hotel is also walking distance to Parc Guell which is very beautiful and a must see. I enjoyed staying at this hotel as the area of the city was very pretty and full of culture. The metro is a short walking distance (3 minutes) from the hotel which will take you anywhere you want to go in Barcelona. I would take a taxi at night back to the hotel which only cost me about 10-12 euros from the Olympic Port area. Is the hotel rooms small? yes the room is small, but you really only go there to lay your head down at night so for me it didnt matter and I was quite comfortable. The room was always clean and for me it was great and the price was right with my budget. The bed was not as good as home but I never had a problem sleeping in everyday. If you are a super light sleeper and a very cranky person who gets bothered by other people and noise, I would stay somewhere that has soundproof walls since the hotel can be a bit noisey at times but it did not bother me nor did I let that ruin the wonderful experience of staying in Barcelona and Vallcarca. I would definately return back to this hotel in the future. ","annotations":[]}
