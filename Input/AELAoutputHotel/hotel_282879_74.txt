{"text":"Great location The hotel is in an excellent location. Nice and quiet and much more calm than the Latin quarter we usually stay in. It does take some transferring on the Metro and RER to get almost anywhere if that is your means of transit. This could be a problem if you are coming from the airport with bags as many stations only have stairs.The staff is friendly and helpful although do not expect a concierge who can make suggestions and book dining and site seeing. They do speak English and will call for you if you do the research first. There are many restaurants and cafes in the area so we never opted for breakfast in the hotel. It is also located walking distance from Rue du Bac where there is an excellent up-scale modern food store. Also there is Ryst Dupeyron, the best Armagnac shop in Paris where you can taste many old vintages and ports. The rooms do have small refrigerators which was nice especially for keeping that cheese and water cold. There is a small courtyard with chairs and tables at the hotel entry which we used to have our wine and cheese.Be prepared that each room has a heating\/cooling unit mounted high on the wall in a corner. They mounted the controls under the unit so you have to get on a chair to make adjustments - which is problematic especially in the dark if you want to change the settings. There are also no instructions as to how to use the controls so you may want to ask.All in all I would stay there again.
