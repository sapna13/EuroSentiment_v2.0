{"text":"Great Time This was a family vacation for my husband, 13 year and 6 year old girls, and I. It was a nice trip and the hotel was nice. If you are not a picky person then I would recommend this to you. The beach, pool, room service and rooms were nice. We didn't splurge on the room because we never planned on being there very much. If you get a room with a city view, don't plan on sitting on the balcony. You will be lucky to get one person out there. We were so tired everynight that we never noticed the planes. They did come clean our room everyday and we were there for 5 days. Very nice towels. The staff is helpful but don't count on getting an upgrade to a room. You have to be very lucky and it does not matter how much you tip. The food is high and so so. Your best bet is to walk across the street and chose something from there. Make sure you learn spanish. 4 places that we ate they couldn't understand us, because they didn't know english. MUST DO's El Morro Castle, great history and very cheap trip, Old San Juan was great and lots of great shops. Be prepared to do alot of walking. TAKE A CAB!!!. We went to El Morro  Old San Juan on the same day and we took a cab there and back. Yes it cost $19.00 each way. It only took us 15 minutes to get there and back. There was a nice place to eat at in Old San Juan and great view. It was called Cafe Amapola. Great beans and rice! If you like to really shop then go to the Plaza Del Americus shopping mall. Again it will cost you $19.00 each way and it took us 10-15 minutes to get there. It is worth it unless you have alot of time and patience for a 45minute or longer bus ride. Be prepared to walk. It is 3 levels and I love to shop, but I never seen the 3rd level because I was sick of shopping. You will get lost there. MORE MUST DO'S ---scubba diving, my husband loves it and has been several times. He booked it with CoQui Dive and it was well worth the money and he got 2 dives at 2 different places in the same trip\/day. He said it was the best he had ever done or seen. If you want to see the most breathtaking beach you must do the snorkling trip that you can book through the hotel. It is $105.00 per person. REALLY WORTH IT!
