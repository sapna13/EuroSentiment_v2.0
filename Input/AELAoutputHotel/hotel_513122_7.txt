{"text":"It is a decent stay with the price and location This is my first time coming to San Francisco and I choose to stay at Spaudling Hotel with my boyfriend as we think the price and location is very attractive. We took the airport shuttle to the hotel and it only took us about 20 mins for the transportation. It is very convenient.Not as what we read from the previous preview, the front desk agent actually gave us a friendly welcome and we have a newly renovated room. I like the bathroom as it was very new and clean. The room is ok. I like it very bright with sunlight. The hotel provided free internet access which is good for my boyfriend as he can check his stock from time to time. There is not much TV channels but we actually don't really care as we spend most of our time site seeing and shopping. The lift is a little old but I think it is classic as I have never ride this kind of lift before. Location is the best!!I really like the location of the hotel as it is very close to most of the places that we wanted to go. Union Square, Chinatown, San Francisco shopping mall are minutes away. We took the cable car to Fisherman's Walf which the cable car station is just at the corner. I love the ice-cream sundae at Ghirardelli Square**The overall stay at Spaulding Hotel is ok and comfortable and I recommanded to couples like us who loves shopping and site seeing. We met some business travelers going to the convention staying at Spaulding Hotel as well. I believe it is good for business travelers also.** ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1214,"mention":"ice-cream","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream"],"startOffset":1205},{"endOffset":1221,"mention":"sundae","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sundae"],"startOffset":1215}]}
