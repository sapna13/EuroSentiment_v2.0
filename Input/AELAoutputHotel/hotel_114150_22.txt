{"text":"Great location, great room, excellent customer service One has to take into account that Boston hotel rooms are typically smaller than most American hotel rooms. Pretend you're in Europe and you'll be fine. I was traveling solo so it wasn't too difficult. I stayed in room #536. My room was small but by far one of the most interesting I have stayed in--upon entering the room, there is a mini-bar with numerous snacks and beverages (I didn't use them). A couple of steps down you enter the main area--to the left was a small hallway with a safe, an ironing board and two fluffy bathrobes. There was also a separate sink\/vanity and then the bathroom. I was rather disappointed that I didn't get one of the hotel's mini-round tubs, (like I have before) but the bathroom was excellently stocked with plenty of useful toiletries and fluffy, fresh, clean towels. I had a fabulous view of Faneuil Hall at night. Interesting skylight windows. I felt I was in a loft. By far, the best thing about my stay was how accommodating and professional the staff was. I had no car, and arrived at the hotel at 10am, expecting to drop off my baggage and check back later to see if there was a room available. I was really surprised when the front desk person told me that she had a room available for both me and my friend, on the same floor, just down the hall. It was nice to be able to drop my stuff off, clean up a bit and get going for the day. The only complaint was the ridiculous amount I had to pay for a phone call that lasted less than three minutes. (I had misplaced my cell phone). But I don't think the price was any different than any other hotel. The hotel is in the middle of renovating and I'm expecting great things. While I'm looking forward to the construction upgrades, I appreciate the great customer service always get when I stay here!!
