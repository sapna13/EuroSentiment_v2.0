{"text":"Above our expecations.. We decided to choose this hotel after we had read so many good comments about it from the Internet. We stayed there for three nights. Hotel Principal is above our expectation. Our sleeping room is very clean and bright. The bath room is big. The shower cabin inside the bath room is cool, but the glass door of the shower cabin is a little bit broken...WIFi internet at the room works very well. The hotel is only 5 minuters away from Liceu Metro station. Do not recommend taking the taxi that called by the hotel staff!! The hotel staff told us its very cheap to take the taxi to the north station. But the taxi driver actually charged us 14EUR for driving us there. 8EUR+2EUR (2xbaggage fee)+4EUR(additional fee to the north station) We were going to catch the early flight shuttle bus to the Girona airport at 8:00 this morning. According to the taxi driver that it is not possible to buy the ticket on the bus during weekend, and all the ticket offices open at 9:00 only. He 'kindly' offered his help for driving us to the airport instead so that we would not miss our flight. We felt its suspicious about what he said and turned down his suggestion. Later on, it was not difficult for us to find the ticket office which was already open in the north station. Imagine if we believed what the taxi driver said..we would spend at least 120EUR on this trip! ","annotations":[]}
