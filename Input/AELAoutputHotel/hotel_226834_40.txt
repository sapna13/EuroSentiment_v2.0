{"text":"Good but could be better I stayed with my partner for 7 nights, and during all that time we came and went as if nothing mattered. Our arrival was greeted quite curtly, and my Spanish-speaking partner could not understand a single word of the [Thai?] registration and questions. Except for a friendly receptionist that worked on the weekend, we never were greeted - or greeted back - by reception after checkin. Doesn''t make a very favorable impression for tourists.Fortunately I have been to the city before and dind't need to ask for assistance; when in the lobby I did answer a few questions and guided a few foreign tourists who weren't getting help from the desk. (sigh) Besides that, the hotel was an incredible bargain, a package that we found online at [--]. More than the room rates, the package included the San Francisco CityPass - don't overlook that this Passport includes a 7-day, all-you-can-eat bus  cable car transportation. At $5\/ride on the cable cars at the corner, this would have been prohibitive without this book - and a lot less fun, too.Our room was clean and orderly - well-made bed with fresh linens, renovated bathroom, modern conveniences of courtesy soaps  such - yet a musty smell lingers - just a normal aspect of most old hotels in the city, and no less hygienic than elsewhere. Consider it old-world, seaside charm if you must. Since we weren't in the room very much, this wasn't a problem but it is notable.I'll definitely return to San Francisco and check the rates of this hotel! ","annotations":[]}
