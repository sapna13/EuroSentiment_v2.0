{"text":"What a great hotel....! This hotel was one of those rare things...a perfect fit. Not a big chain so it had a personal touch, but very well appointed. The location was excellent in one of the inner canal rings on Singel. There was great dining and shopping nearby. We stayed at a chain hotel for one night before Estherea and it was more expensive and much less pleasant. Our Estherea room was just configured great, the bathroom had 2 sinks, plenty of room and a great shower (the actual bath faucet has to be turned the the left to get the shower to work-it was a bit tricky). The rooms were updated with great linens and very clean. The common areas were very cozy. I didn't eat at the hotel restaurant. Breakfast is very pricey and we didn't want to eat that much so we went a few doors down to get a baguette for breakfast-1 Euro. One thing I loved about the hotel was the free coffee\/tee bar they have in the lobby. It's a beautiful bit of custom-built carpenty that has all sorts of teas, sweeteners, and an awesome coffee maker where you just press a button. This is a great perk in a hotel when you just want to get going in the morning and don't want to have to sit down and order a simple cup of coffee. We couldn't stop saying how great we thought the hotel was. We paid a bit more for a canal view (our room was 314 and great) but it really made our stay nicer being able to look out onto the canal. I totally recommend this.
