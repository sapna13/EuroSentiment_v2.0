{"text":"Eurostar Gaudi Dec. 2007 We stayed here for three nights beginning Dec.2nd. following a nine day cruise. We took a taxi that had room for four and cruise luggage. The taxis charge by the piece and for a larger minivan. We paid about 30 Euros with tip. While checking in, a member of our party had two carryons stolen by thieves in the lobby at around 9am in the morning. The girl at the desk let two men in the lobby while we were checking in. These men were not guests of the hotel and casually walked in, hung around the area and casually walked out with the carryon luggage before our friend knew what happened. I was involved with checking in and providing passports along with my friend. His wife went to the bathroom and our other friends were looking at the lobby internet and reading maps so stay vigilant even in the small lobby of a small hotel. The rooms were clean and modern and we had a good view of the circle and the towers of Segrada Familia a few blocks away. There is shower gel, soap, but no shampoo. They have fancy showers but only half partition of glass so flooding is common. The drainage is very slow. The towels smell like vinegar. The flat screen worked but not too many offerings in English. There are no good places to eat around the hotel. We don't like the cafe bars. The food is horrible and expensive. The good restaurants are down toward the Port and La Ramblas. The restaurants and cafes are smoke filled so those allergic, don't go to Barcelona. It seems like most people smoke. We saw many young teenagers smoking like chimneys. We used a two day hop on hop off bus at $23 Euros per person and caught it at the Segrada Familia. The metro was really close by the hotel- Monument station was less than a block away, 1.5 Euros each way. The Segrada Familia station was near the tourist site about 4 blocks away. Food is expensive, look for menu of the day offerings for value. Our US dollars don't go far in Europe.We enjoyed the Gothic Quarter and Park Guell. We visited some of the other stops and shopped in local districts on the tour bus route. We noticed that the general population and the non-tourist trade shop keepers have different hours from Americans. We get the impression that they don't work many hours a day. There is plenty to see and it will take more than three days to see many of the main sites. We paid 40 Euros for a taxi to the airport for 4 with 8 pieces of luggage. Other than the robbery, our friends enjoyed the Egyptian museum and Picasso Museum. It was an experience-good and bad.
