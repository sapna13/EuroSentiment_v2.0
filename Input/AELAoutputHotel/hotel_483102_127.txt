{"text":"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Value Me and my girlfriend travelled to the H10 Universitat Hotel for 4 days in mid-July 2006. The previous reviews that we had read of the hotel were great. The hotel did not dissapoint. Upon arrival the friendly and helpful staff were quick to offer us a glass of cava and make us feel very welcome. We arrived before the room check in time which was not a problem as our cases were stored away until we came back. The hotel reception area was modern and spacious. The restaurant area at the back, while we did not use it, looked nice, very clean, modern and exactly what you would expect from a 4* hotel. The room itself was fantastic. The bed was perhaps the biggest bed I have ever seen in any hotel I have stayed in. It must have been 2 double beds put together. But it did not impede on the space in the room. The room was light, airy, well air-conditioned (which is important in the steamy heat of barca!) and our room also had a walk-in shower which was huge. the hotel public areas were well maintained and the cleaners were always to be found around the hotel keeping the place immaculate. Our room had a safe, which was free of charge. The location of the hotel was AMAZING!! couldn't have asked for a better location. its about a 30 second walk to the plaza de catalunya (the main square in barcelona) and 20 seconds to the plaza universitat (which has a starbucks conveniantly located on one side of it to keep me happy). There is also a metro station here. The tourist bus also stopped directly outside our hotel so there was no need to walk around and join huge queues for the buses. Overall, the holiday was fantastic and the hotel made it a very enjoyable stay. I have never written a review on a hotel before but we were so pleased with this one we thought it deserved some credit!! ","annotations":[]}
