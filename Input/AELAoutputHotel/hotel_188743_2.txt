{"text":"Great Hotel but very expensive My wife and I stayed here for 5 nights in late October using Hyatt Gold Passport points to pay for our room. Good thing too, for this hotel was expensive, but then everything in Paris is expensive.Check-in was flawless and the staff speaks good English. The room was large and well appointed, with a comfortable bed, very high quality Duvet, and lots of big fluffy pillows. Lots of light fixtures with nice bright reading lights. Good writing desk, though the desk chair was a little uncomfortable. There was a nice stuffed chair in the room which was good for reading.Big bathroom with good shower and large fluffy towels. Two telephones and a fancy clock\/radio\/CD player unit. Bottles of water were provided. There was a large Phillips flat screen TV. The room was very quiet and no outside noise could be heard.Any complaints? A couple minor ones. I took a 300 ml plastic water bottle from the minibar so I could get the bottle to use when we walked around town and after being charged 9 euros for this little bottle of water (outrageous) the housekeeping staff took the bottle and I could never get it replaced. Also as is typical at Hyatts worldwide, the Internet charges were exorbitant at 18 euros for 24 hours. Free service was available in the Business Center, but it only had one terminal and a non-standard European Keyboard that was very difficult to use.Breakfast was very expensive in the hotel at 22 euros for a continental breakfast of coffee and four pieces of bread, or 32 euros for one including some meats and cheeses. We only did this once, and afterward opted to go out to one of the many fine eating places only a block or two away. The cost of breakfast frightened us away from trying dinner there.But overall this was a great hotel, located conveniently to both the Madeline and St. Augustine metro stations. The staff was excellent and very attentive, and service was impeccable. If you can afford it this is a great hotel.
