{"text":"A great hotel... and the food! The Shangri-La is an excellent hotel. This was my wife√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ and my third stay here in the last year. Set in a treed residential area only a 1km shuttle bus ride from Orchard Road shops, the Shangri-La offers near-resort ambience and facilities for business and leisure travellers. Entering the vast lobby, the mature tropical trees and pool around which the hotel is built on three sides are already on view through ceiling-height windows. Unless you are economising on an overnight stay, forgo the rather bland Tower rooms and take a spacious Garden Wing Pool-View room with balcony to make the most of the palm tree and rainforest surroundings and to have more direct access to the outdoor areas. Our room was meticulously equipped and maintained. The large lagoon pool, popular in the Singapore heat, includes a good area for children, and there are tennis courts and a gym. A memorable aspect was the seriously good cooking in the three hotel restaurants we tried. The two-course Peking Duck in the Shang Palace Chinese restaurant was as good as we have had anywhere. The small lunch buffet in the Rose Veranda, easily missed in its mezzanine location overlooking the garden, had a great range of taste treats being constantly refreshed. But the showstopper is the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??he Line√à√\u2020\u2022?restaurant, an ultra-modern design tour de force on the pool level that is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. A la carte is available for the weary, but take the buffet option and stroll around the sixteen √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢heatre kitchens√à√\u2020\u2022? marvelling at and sampling the staggering variety of top quality eastern and western dishes on offer. The whole experience is fun for diners of all ages. We sat on after dinner, just enjoying the buzz of the place.Staff throughout were friendly and efficient. We really felt at home throughout our stay. Drinks of all kinds are expensive, as are business centre charges. Nevertheless we would recommend this hotel absolutely without hesitation.
