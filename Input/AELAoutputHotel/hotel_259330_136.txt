{"text":"We had no Problems! My boyfriend and I stayed at the Select Club portion of the Grand Paradise, and we book thorugh Sunquest. We were there from March 31st - April 7th, 2008.Both of us have never been anywhere in the Caribbean before, so we dont have anything to compare it to, however, our trip was great!We did hear that a lot of people had issues with thier rooms, but our room in building #7 was great. We did request a king sized bed, and got 2 doubles, but not a big deal. the room was huge, clean, maid service was great, no bugs, great AC and a fan as well. The only thing that could have been better was that there was no phone or alarm clock in the room.Our pool at the Club was great because it was never too busy, and the swim up bar was fantastic. All the other pools were always nice and clean as well, and it goes without saying, that the beach was fantastic. Obviously it was crowded and yes, you do need to put towels on chairs early, but I'd imagine that you need to do that at every resort.The food was great, the buffets were great. The hours kinda sucked at the Club's buffet (closed between 10-12:30 and 2:30- 5:00), but if you were hungry, you could always go to the buffet at the Beach portion, which was always open. As for the A La Carte's, we ate at the Seafood one and the Asian one, and they were good. Just a warning though, you cannot wear flip flops to the a la carts, you must wear nice shoes. My shoes were open toed, but they were nice. The Seafood restaurant turned away a lot of people for wearing flip flops.My boyfriend and I didnt find it a big deal taking the little train to the Beach resort, it really wasnt a long walk there, and it was a nice walk. You could always just start walking and if you see it come, you can hop on in the middle.Just outside of the resort was a little market to buy some things at. I wouldnt recommend going there by yourself, and get ready for pushy pushy people, but if you hold your own and bargan strong, you will be ok. It's an interesting experience.Really, the only 2 issues that I would complain about would be that the Reception Staff should be a bit more competent. Going to the reception for whatever reason was never a pleasant experince, for most people there.Also, it would be good if the resort had more things to do when it rained.Other than that, great experience. I would stay there again, I would recommend it to others, and I am definatly going back to Punta Cana another time.
