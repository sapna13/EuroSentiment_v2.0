{"text":"Wonderful and Decadent My wife and I just returned from a five-night stay at the Riu Palace Macao. We had a wonderful visit, enjoying all aspects of the resort. It is about a one-hour nonscenic trip (32 bumpy miles) from the airport in a rather cramped small bus. The resort is truly beautiful and perfectly-maintained. It upgraded us to a very nice room facing the pool and the ocean. (It is difficult to see the ocean from almost all rooms because of all the trees.) The resort is truly all-inclusive -- with all food and drink free. One need not provide gratuities. The room is constantly supplied all types of beverages, including plenty of distilled water. (The tap water is not potable.) There is a good size private balcony with a table and chairs, that was a plus. The beds, bathroom, etc., were great. The food was fine and plentiful. The room's airconditioning was virtually silent. The staff was always friendly and well trained. The four tennis courts, which served the five-hotel Riu complex, were hard clay and just fair. A pro and his assistant were usually in attendance. One can make reservations, which are needed early in the day, for a court. There are nightly shows by different troupes, that are mostly just fair. The Folklorico Show was excellent. There are many athletic and other activities during the day. The one problem with the resort is at the pool area. People rush there early in the morning to stake out chaises with their towels, holding the chaises for the entire day, even when they are away doing other things. The resort should somehow prohibit this. The beach is great, and one can walk endlessly on it, passing other hotels. The island is sad and scrubby, and probably not very safe. We took a day-long tour to Oana Island, which cost $90 (USA) per person. It was not worth the money. It was difficult to understand the guide, and one was beseiged by vendors on the island. Its beach is not better than that of the resort. The boat rides to and from the beach were fun, with dancing and drinking on the cat return trip.
