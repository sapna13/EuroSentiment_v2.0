{"text":"Not as good as the rating would suggest Despite the title of this review let me say one thing first, it is outstanding value. 10 minutes walk from Victoria station in one direction and 10 minutes walk to the Thames in the other direction. I paid just √ä√£¬¢65 ($130) for a stay on a Monday night after booking through a link from Tripadvisor.The hotel is located in the City of Westminster and as such there is nothing rough in the area. The front facade reminded me of a row of Embassies or Consulates.Now for the main problem I encountered. Both my partner and I are disabled although ambulant. This was indicated when we booked the room the previous week. On arrival we had been allocated a double room on the third floor (US 4th). With two flights of stairs between each floor. My partner asked if there was a lift available or a room on a lower floor - unfortunately there was neither. However, I think that the young gentleman on reception took pity on us both when he saw the difficulty we were having walking and swapped us to a triple room on the first floor (US 1st) and offered to carry our bags up the stairs. An outstanding bit of customer service on the one part but also it was nearly 10pm and probably unlikely that the larger room would be needed for the one night we were staying.The room itself can be best described as compact. A double bed and a single bed. It was clean and tidy but the walls were marked with what appeared to be plastic scuffs from shoes, bags and cases. The storage was sufficient and there was the usual hairdryer, kettle, television and telephone. Wireless internet is available at √ä√£¬¢5($10) for each 24 hour period.The bathroom was very compact. A WC, sink and shower - the only way to get into the shower is to enter the bathroom, turn around, shut the door and then walk into the shower. There were plenty of good quality towels. Two criticisms of the bathroom were that it probably needed a deep clean and there is nothing at all to aid disabled guests needing help with balance, just a couple of grab rails would have helped.Breakfast the next morning was fine - my partner just wanted a couple of well cooked eggs on toast instead of the bacon egg and beans and the two brothers that own the hotel were only too happy to oblige. Extra toast and tea\/coffee were offered although not needed.On balance, if you're not disabled then it's a nice little place. However if you can't manage stairs or have particularly heavy bags then you may struggle with the stairs. Counter this with a maximum rate of √ä√£¬¢130 ($260) for a room that sleeps 4 and you get breakfast thrown in.
