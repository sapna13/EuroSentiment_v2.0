{"text":"Wonderful Family Christmas Vacation Trip Our entire family stayed at the Paradisus resort for 6 days over the Christmas Holiday week. We stayed in the Reserve Family Conciege and were very pleased with the accomodations, food and overall service. The Kids Club was perfect for our 3 girls ages 2, 7 and 11 and allowed us some time to ourselves while the girls went Horseback riding, played games and swam in the Kids Pool. Our concierge Silvio was very helpful with setting dinner reservations, helping with activities for the children and keeping us up with activities around the resort. The kids were truly pampered with robes, backpacks, t-shrits and stuffed animals for Christmas presents. The resort was beautifully kept with amazing plants and vegatation. If you are going expecting American Food, you will be disappointed. Not to say that there wasn't burgers, fries and pankcakes but the resort definitely presents traditional Dominican Food along with traditional American and other countries food dishes. If you like trying different types of food you will pleased although 6 days of eating at buffets was more than enough. We had special reservations at the Reserve for Christmas Eve dinner at a seafood buffet which was the best seafood I have ever had. My husband and I were very pleased and the Kids Club had a special Christmas dinner for the kids in their own restaurant with food just for children. The rooms at the Reserve were very nice. I am very picky as I travel a lot on business and have stayed at some very nice hotels. We had the One Bedroom Family Conceirge Suite which was very nice although not perfect but pretty close. Our biggest complaint was the noise in the hallways from the slamming doors as visitors left their rooms in the mornings. Unless you are a hard sleeper don't expect to be able to sleep in with the noise in the mornings. Also, any type of room service and special request (i.e pillows) took forever, so you definitely need some patience.I would recommend paying the extra to stay at the Reserve. It seems like you get a whole different level of service and accomodations.
