{"text":"Overrated but satisfactory I booked this hotel because I like modern design hotels and I need wifi access. This one had good ratings on this website. But apart from the design, the amenities, and the reasonable price, I would have preferred to stay closer to the center. I'm only giving it a 4 rather than 3 because the wifi really worked in the rooms and it often doesn't.the hotel has a nice big bed, even for a single, a deluxe bathroom with bath tub, and an incomprehensible hi-tech lighting system that works to satisfaction after you have pushed all the buttons a few times, using all possible combinations, on the three sets of controls scattered around the room. but I found myself asking why i didn't like this hotel better. I decided that the brown and grey color scheme wasn't too cheerful and everything combined made the hotel feel to sterile. Also, the location sucks for tourists. It is close to a metro but not within an easy walk to any noteworthy tourist destination, restaurants or nightlife. It is at least a 40 minute walk to place de catalunya and nothing that interesting along the way. 20 minutes will get you to Eixample. After the metro closes you have to count on 7euros cabfare to go pretty much anywhere in the center. Many people complain about the breakfast, but hotel breakfasts are one of my pet peeves. I don't want to pay 12√à√\u2020√ü?for something i could get for 4√à√\u2020√ü?by walking 2 minutes down the street, so i always ask if it is continental breakfast, buffet, or omelettes, etc. The front desk manager said you can choose. But when actually went down to the breakfast the next morning, i just saw a big spread of cold cuts, lots of nice croissants, rolls, bread, etc and a big selection of drinks, yougurt and cereal including a diet breakfast section. So I asked the waitress if there were omelettes and she said scrambled or omelette? So that was quite alright -- but you have to ask in spanish, they don't speak english!
