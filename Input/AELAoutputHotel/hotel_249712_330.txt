{"text":"great location, but service was ok i stayed at Westin because i had to fly out early next morning and the hotel was in good location (right in front of Port Authority).i went to the hotel in the morning just to leave luggage. i went up to front desk and told them i'm not checking in now but just wanna leave luggage, a guy at front desk checked my reservation, confirmed, and told me i should go down to belldesk to leave luggage there. so i did.when i came back to the hotel at 10pm, i was told i already checked in, which i didn't know but ok. my luggage, though, was still in the belldesk and i had to go down to get it myself. i was a bit surprised that the hotel didn't put my luggage in my room.i went out to eat with frineds and came back around 11:30. i wanted to know the transportation option to JFK for next morning so asked a guy at front desk.(concerge was already closed.)he was rude enough telling me he cannot book, recoomend or help me with any airport transportation because no NY hotel do that!!! i tried to ask if he could give me just some info or a phone number of super shuttle, but he said no. he just told me i could take a train or ask for concerge for car-service next morning. luckly nice man at belldesk helped me by calling super shuttle and making reservation for me.(and then next morning i found out there's airport shuttle leaving every 30minutes from Port Authority right across the street!! why can't the front desk guy just told me that!?)the room was clean, not large but ok size, nice view.i'm a SPG gold member so usualy get room upgrade and nice amenities but not at this hotel. their ameinties were quite poor, i had to say. no shower cap, no cotton, no bath salt, no slippers,,, i stayed at four point by sheraton next day and got better amenities!
