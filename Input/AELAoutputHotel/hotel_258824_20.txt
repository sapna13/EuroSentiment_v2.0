{"text":"Great location, great hotel My college-student daughter and I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn for six days from late July to early August, 2008. The hotel has a great location, with a bus stop out front to take visitors to downtown Seattle (like the waterfront, Pike Place Market, etc), and other stops within walking distance. We actually walked to Pike Place and to the Victoria Clipper pier. We did a lot of sightseeing and didn't need a car. There are a dozen restaurants within a few blocks: Indian, Irish, Thai, Greek, Mexican, a Melting Pot (fondue), and of course, several coffee shops. Yes, there's a Starbucks in the lobby, but the Uptown Espresso in the next block has both coffee varieties and pastries that you won't find at home--and isn't that why you travel? There is a Safeway across the street, and an upscale Metropolitan Market two blocks away.The room was very clean and well maintained. As others have noted, there was a kitchenette, with a fridge, microwave, coffeemaker, and sink. Free local calls, TV with a good selection of cable channels, iron and ironing board in the closet. Spacious bathroom with good shelves, which is always important when two women share a bathroom.Our room didn't have air conditioning, but even in August, Seattle was comfortable. We slept with the window open, and on our last night, we could hear someone snoring from a room nearby, but it was distant enough that it struck us as funny rather than annoying, The front counter staff was very helpful. They knew the prices of shuttles to the airport, and were also very accomodating about leaving our luggage in a secure room for an entire day after we checked out. The computers in the lobby were helpful for printing out flight confirmations, and the self-service laundry was reasonably priced at $1.50 to wash and dry a load. The view from the rooftop deck is postcard perfect, so if you have a clear evening, go up and watch Mount Rainier turn pink as the sun sets. On the whole, a wonderful location and a well-run hotel.
