{"text":"The Name is Not Just a Clever Title!!!! What an amazing place!!! From the moment you are welcomed into the lobby until the day you leave you are treated like the rich and famous. We stayed for 6 days and we loved it so much we booked an extra day!! The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained. There were people constantly cleaning and bustling about to enhance it's beauty. We had a 3d floor room in the excellence club and we loved it The a\/c did work fine but as an energy saving measure, when the sliding door to the balcony was opened, it would automatically shut off It was not difficult to keep that door closed when we were in the room. We brought bug spray after reading reviews and we never used it once or needed to!. We liked having a private concicierage(sp?) and access to the internet. Our room overlooked the pool and the ocean. The food was delicious and plentiful. We never had a problem with stomach upset. Bottled water was plentiful. It was a luxury to sit by the pool and have people serve you lunch(pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, or nachos) if you chose not to go to inside to eat. My husband and I found it to be a bit more upscale than Grand Lido Braco especially during the evening. It was fun to dress up each night!!! (Many of the places require men to wear long pants for dinning). The shows each evening were spectacular to say the least. We felt like we were on a cruise ship!!!!. The ride from the airport is about an hour 15 minutes and we rode on an air conditioned bus, but we did find out you can arrange helicopter transfers with the hotel for about $140 per person. It is only a 15 minute flight from the airport. If you have the means and your time is precious, this might be a good option.The pools were really nice and never did we feel we were crowded. Towels and rafts were easily obtained. We were also provided a pool bag to carry books etc.. to the pool and an umbrella was also in the room if you needed it. However, because of the well appointed lay out, you could walk through out the main areas of the hotel and be under cover. It rained twice in the evenings(Friday 8\/9 there was a terrible thunder storm and never once did we get wet!)I have to say this was the most beautiful place my husband and I have ever visited and I would love to return!!!
