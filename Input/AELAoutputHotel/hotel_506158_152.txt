{"text":"Fantastic Hotel This hotel is fabulous , we arrived in Barcelona to learn that the city was celebrating it's largest festival. The city was mainc and the hotel was just a haven of peace and tranquility.It's location was superb, right in the heart of the city and just of Las Rambals. The hotel decor is stylish and beautiful. We arrived early and were lucky that our room was ready. The room itself was there standard room. It wasn't large but beautifully decorated and well equipt for everything you would need. The bathroom was well stocked with toiletries, and included bathrobes and slippers. The hotel offer a special pillow service so that you can change your pillow if you have a particular preference. I particularly liked the light controls located next to the bed, at the touch of a button you can change the lighting to relax mode, reading mode etc. The facilities were excellent , the roof pool and terrace was spectacular, and lovely just to sit and have a drink . The basement pool was equally impressive and very relaxing. I even used the gym which was adequate for a quick workout.Breakfast is served on the first floor and there was a wide choice of food available from cakes to cerals,and juice to cooked sausages, bacon and scrambled eggs. All the staff were polite and very helpful, I would not hesitate to come back again it really deserves a five star rating, and I have already started to recommend it to all my friends.
