{"text":"Great All-inclusive Very Good All-inclusive Resort - you get use of 3 resorts for the price of one. Good value for the money. I give it a 3.0 rating.***********************************************************************The Really Good: Extremely well groomed Resort and Beach, very clean rooms, friendly staff, good food with abundant choices, great atmosphere, the staff at all of the Buffet restaurants treat you like it's A-La-Carte dining. Grand Palladium Staff are outstandingly nice and helpful in every way possible. The passenger train rides through the Resorts are very entertaining and a great way to cool off on hot  humid evenings and meet people, and it comes by every 15 to 20 minutes from 10am to 2am.The Palace pool is stunningly beautiful, relaxing and has a buffet restaurant immediately beside it. The Bavaro pool is lots of fun from 3 to 6 pm. The Bavaro open-air Lobby is a very nice meeting place for evening cocktails.The Hemingways Bar at the Bavaro is air conditionned and is a great place to relax. Has top-box International drinks and is a great place to enjoy hanging-out.Overall, the Grand Palladium is a great place for people of all ages - from little kids to seniors. ********************************************************************The Not-So-Good: Entertainment starts too late - starts at 10pm for Amphitheatre shows and 11pm for Discotheque. After spending all day at the Beach and swimming pools, you're likely going to be too tired to try the shows and Disco. Entertainment should start at 9pm instead of 10pm.The Grand Palladium Beach and swimming pools lack shaded huts compared to the abundance of them at the neighboring Resorts. The beach huts at the beach and around the pools are nearly always pre-reserved at night or early morning with blue hotel towels and most have NO ONE using them nearly all-day long. Note to Fiesta Hotels Management - this Beach and Pool hut reserving practice should be BANNED!!! One guy told me that he was tempted to go after 11pm some night and yank all the towels off the chairs and pile them up. I hope someone actually does this. Maybe then you'll get enough screaming\/pissed-off customers to convince you to put a stop to this insane hut-holding practice. Casino is cute but very small, I read somewhere that there were 80 slots, I only saw about 40. Many penny and nickel slots and about 4 quarter slots - some were broken. The machines were fairly loose. Overall the casino is fun and could use more slot machines.The 24hr Sports Bar needs repairs - pool table is trashed, cloth torn , 8 ball missing, only 1 pool cue. Only 2 of the 4 internet computers work and are nearly always busy. Very frustrating waiting to get-on when only 2 of 4 work!Junior Suites are beautifl and very roomy but the hotel room mattresses are the worst...economy at best, extremely low quality spring mattresses...you'll likely hate the beds!!!All in all, good and bad taken into consideration, this a really nice resort for Punta Cana. It has the potentail of a 5 star resort if Fiesta Hotels would put some thought and effort into it.
