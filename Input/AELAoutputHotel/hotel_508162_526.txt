{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous! My husband and 3 children (9,6,  4) stayed at Dreams Feb 6 √à√\u2020\u2022?Feb 12th. We booked the Deluxe Family Suite but upon arrival we were upgraded to the Preferred Family Suite in Building 6. A very nice surprise. As noted in previous reviews, I do think your perspective on the resort depends on where your room is located. Along with our upgraded rooms we were given access to a Private Lounge Area. Vanessa, who manages the Lounge and Bernie the bartender were very welcoming and helpful in addressing our queries. The twice daily maid service was very nice and my children loved coming back to the room to see what arrangement the towels were in (swans, wedding cakes, bears, lizards √à√\u2020\u2022?amazing). Room Service was also very quick √à√\u2020\u2022?you will have to request a menu as they still did not have their new Guest Directories printed. The menu was very kid friendly, nachos, pizza, burgers, spaghetti etc.. A few times we ordered room service for the kids and then checked them into the Explorer√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Club for the evening. We would then have a nice relaxing meal knowing the kids were well looked after and having a terrific time.My children loved the Explorer√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Club. All the construction to the Explorer√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Club seemed to be complete and the kids had access to everything. The staff will give you a cell phone in case your child wants to be picked up. After I dropped off my children I would head to the beach or pool. It was bliss to be able to read, nap, stare at the sea and just relax. The ice-cream machine by the Barracuda Bar was a big hit with my children. It was self-serve and they usually put the cones out around 1pm. We ate most of the time in the World Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ. It suited our family as usually everyone could find something they liked and there was no wait. Bordeaux was also nice in large part to our waiter Rudy √à√\u2020\u2022?you were fabulous, our wine glasses were never empty! The ride to the resort is as noted √à√\u2020\u2022?very bumpy. It does make you appreciate your home and how we take smooth roads for granted. The towel situation is an adventure. You just have to go with the flow as there isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ anything you can do about it. My husband and I took turns getting up early each morning staking our claim! (besides the towel, you should leave a book, t-shirt or some personal item).We also booked a full-day excursion with Outback Safari. We found it very educational and my children can still remember facts about the country that we learned from our guide. The resort was spread out and there was a fair amount of walking, but it was good exercise and who can complain when you have sunshine, warm breezes, and all the staff saying √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥ola√à√\u2020\u2022?as you stroll along.The only area I felt could use some improvement was the evening front desk\/reception staff. I really didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get the impression that they enjoyed their job and I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even at the desk to complain! I suppose they are the front line for all complaints and irritated guests. My moment with the night-time reception staff did not impact my view of the resort. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ only mentioning in the hopes that management will read and hopefully address the morale. The staff that I encountered in all other areas seem to truly enjoy their job. Overall our time at Dreams was a great break from the winter and a fabulous place to take my family.
