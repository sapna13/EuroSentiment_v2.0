{"text":"More than you could ask for For our honeymoon, we decided on Paris and Tuscany. For our hotel in Paris, we went through about 250 reviews on this website and decided for the value, location and based on past reviews, the Residence Foch was our best bet. We were not disappointed. We walked from the bus stop to the hotel in a few minutes and were immediately impressed. The front desk staff greeted us in English (does it show?) and while we tried our best to stumble along in French, we were soon both flitting back and forth in two languages. We had a terrific room and the washroom was the biggest we'd seen in Europe! The breakfast alone is worth the price of admission. It rained the first day of our journey, so we took the opportunity to battle jet lag. One of the nicest sleeps I've had. Loved the lift. It fit me and my outsized suitcase. Loved the bar. They make a mean martini if you ask them. Loved the location. You can walk to the Eiffel tower, Arc de Triomphe and the Bois de Boulogne. As has been said many times on this forum, the staff are what makes this a special little hotel. They are wonderfully helpful and can recommend the finest restaurants and the best way to see the city. They also arranged a great trip to Versailles and Giverny that was outstanding.We booked through Otel.com, as we always do, and got a far better rate than any of the other websites or my travel agent could give me.
