{"text":"Excellent Experience with Hotel Balcony My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Balcony recently. This was my first visit to Italy and we stayed 7 days. I used Trip Advisor to find an economical hotel but was worried about what we would find. Francesco and Hotel Balcony went way beyond my expectation. The service was superb! Francesco, who speaks impeccable English, booked reservations to the museums for us, gave us directions, reserved taxicabs, and in the evening, when we would have a glass of wine before dinner, he would chat with us. He is a native Florentine so we heard many stories and insights. Our double room was spacious and clean. The room contained a mini bar that was restocked daily. The bathroom was clean, user friendly and had soaps, shampoos and other amenities. The towels were replaced daily if we left them on the floor. The hotel has satellite TV, an Internet pod in the hallway that cost 5 euro per hour, a small library, and an outstanding breakfast! We had breads, meat, cheeses, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereal, granola, 3 kinds of coffee, tea and juices. It was chilly when we visited Florence, but the very large balcony was awesome and in the warmer months would be an excellent asset to enjoyment of the hotel.The location of Hotel Balcony can't be beat. It is central to everything. Another asset is the restaurant next door and the ATM right outside the front entry. There is a wine shop and a bistro that serves ramen noodles as well as Italian foods at the end of the block. We had a wonderful adventure in Florence and will always revisit Hotel Balcony in the future. Viva Italia! Viva Francesco!
