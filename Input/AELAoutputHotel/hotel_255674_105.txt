{"text":"Just something missing..... Our night here was booked as part of my 30th birthday and although there is nothing to fault it wasn't quite what we expected from a 5 star.The rooms in the hotel are strangely shaped (we had 2 rooms and one was more oddly shaped than the other) and I assume this is to take in the fantasic views of the harbour that the harbour view rooms have. The rooms at the back are like many city centre in that the look over rooftops and alleys. One of the rooms we had, had a seperate shower and bath while the other was combined. One of the rooms had bathrobes and the other the slippers! The rooms are not as large as the other Sydney hotels we stayed in on our trip and neither were the bathrooms. The rooms although recently refurbished didn't feel like 5 star.The breakfast was extensive although would have been expensive if it was not included in the nightly rate, there are however an abundance of cafes locally offering excellent value breakfasts. The hotel is located almost opposite circular quay and has onsite parking although it is $35 per night.One word of warning would be to make sure you are not in the rooms that are opposite the lifts. We were thankful we weren't in these rooms as they were the first we have ever seen facing the lifts which I imagine could have made them slightly noisy.We would probably stay here again but at A$100 per night more than the Grace Hotel it would need to be on offer!
