{"text":"Vacation in paradise We stayed at the Ocean Bavaro from July 15 - 29, 2006 and it was our second stay at this resort after our first visit in January 2006. The hotel is located at the wonderful long beach of Bavaro and we can only recommend this place.Hotel rooms: We had booked a superior SPA suite and the room was spacious and located next to the beach. We never experienced any problems in our room. Food: The buffet in the main restaurant offered a variety of international and local dishes and to our mind had something for everyone. Bars: The hotel has several bars (lobby bar, pool bar, sportsbar, etc.) and the barkeepers there are great - especially Santiago, Bernando and Edison. They will remember your drink after the first day and will mix your drink immediately when you sit down at the bar. All of them speak English, some also German and also Italian. Nevertheless you should remember that the Dom. Republic is a Spanish speaking country and if you try to speak at least some Spanish words, people there will appreciate it.Overall: after our visit in January we decided that we definitely have to go back to this beautiful place, because it means vacation in paradise. If you are looking for luxury and want to spend your time with only English or German speaking people it is better to stay at home - but if you want to feel the flavour of the Caribbean and enjoy the extraordinary way of life of a beautiful Caribbean island, the Dominican republic is the right place to go.
