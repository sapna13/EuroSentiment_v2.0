{"text":"Imperial it is The Imperial Hotel was selected for me by my colleagues in Japan, because it was within walking distance of their offices. I was completely impressed with the hotel in every respect. The service was consistently excellent. I read in my guide book not to tip people, but I tried anyway, and the bellman absolutely refused. As an aside, the hotel is very sensitive to the needs of a novice like myself. The bellman always asked me where I was going, and told the cab driver in Japanese for me. That was immensely helpful. My room was on the tenth floor. It was large, modern and comfortable. The bathroom was particularly nice, with a shower with excellent water pressure, and a modern tub with jets. The toilet had a heated seat and bidet, the soaps smelled lovely, and the hairdryer was strong and hot. The room is equipped with sensors that detect your presence, and light up when you approach (for example, a panel next to the bed that controls opening the curtains, the sound in the room, etc.). My PDA was not working in Japan, so I could not use my phone or email. The hotel phone charges were very modest, and the business center has free internet access. They actually opened early for me one day (usually opens at 8). I ordered room service for breakfast, and it was prompt and very good. On my departure day, I went down to the cafe (which opens at 6am) and asked if I could possibly have a quick breakfast in 15 minutes. I had my food within 3 minutes, and had time to spare! Every person I encountered was professional, friendly and fluent in English. My feable attempts at Japanese were warmly acknowledged. I will absolutely stay here again the next time I am in Tokyo.
