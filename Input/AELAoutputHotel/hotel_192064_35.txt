{"text":"Great location in Mayfair I stayed at this hotel twice with a two week break inbetween. The first time, I was alone and was given a small room, I did not know where to put my luggage. When I checked in again two weeks later, having booked a romantic weekend package for me and my partner, I asked if we could receive a larger room and mentioned my earlier experience with the suitcase. The receptionist gave me the option to stay at a larger suite for an extra 40 GBP per night. I felt this was too much but then she offered another room for 20 GBP extra. Wonderful, I thought, until we got to the room. The Jungle suite was a quaint little smoking room. A strange smell put me off but I openend the window and did not think about this any further. At night, we shut the window due to the noise of the traffic. At 4 a.m. I just could not stand the smell any longer and detected a 'very strong and smelly' room freshener pluged in the socket. I unplugged it but a few hours later the poignant smell of old smoke in the curtains, wallpaper and carpet came out.We were lucky they could give us another room. Having stayed in 3 different rooms, I don't think I want to book that hotel again. The staff was very friendly and helpful at all times. We also thought that the afternoon tea was a highlight.P.S. back home I had to air everything I had along ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1280,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1277}]}
