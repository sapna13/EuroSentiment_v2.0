{"text":"What a wonderful place! My family and I live somewhat locally. We were scheduled to fly out early in the morning and decided that staying in a near by hotel would be easier than driving the extra hour to the airport in the morning. We have always had good stays at embassy suites, no matter what the location. We decided to stay at this embassy despite the fact it is not right at the airport. I was pleased to find that they beds and bedding were upgraded from the last time we stayed here, making them extra comfy. The room (as usual) was very clean and large. The staff was extra helpful. Knowing that we would need to have a 4am wake up, we knew that we needed to try and get a good night sleep. We saw right after check in that there were many groups. (often this hotel is booked for birthday parties) I went to the front desk and explained that we would need to not be next to a group and asked how close were were. The front desk person noted that although there is no one right near us, she would rather just move us all the way to the top floor where there would be no one above us and only a single person to one side of us. Then she suggested to us that we take advantage of their shuttle to the airport. We had not even considered this. Our plan was to drive early to a lot we normally park in when we fly and then take their shuttle. This would have taken more time plus we would have had the cost of parking for the week. The shuttle in the morning from embassy was excellent as was the return from the airport. I must admit I was a bit hesitant, given that their parking lot is not secure and the location may not be the most friendly at night. I was pleased to find that our car was fine when we returned. With our large family, embassy suites is always our first choice for hotels!!! ","annotations":[]}
