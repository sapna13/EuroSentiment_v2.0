{"text":"Great Hotel for our First Anniversary My husband and I visited New Orleans for our first anniversary. The hotel is very clean, bright and airy when you walk into the lobby. Fresh cookies in the lobby too! We found the staff to be very friendly and courteous. We paid for a standard room and they upgraded us to a one bedroom suite. However, this was an interior room with a window to the hallway. (there are skylights in the hall so it is not as dark as you would think). Unfortunately, this room felt a little bit like a cave to me so we asked if we could have just a regular room with a window. To our surprise they immediately switched us to one of the front rooms with floor to ceiling windows. The room was enormous and just lovely. We saw about everything you could possibly see and ate about everything one can eat. Don't leave without trying some gumbo. We found the best at Cafe Pontalba's ( I think this is the name), on the corner right next to the Louisiana Museum in Jackson Square. We were both pleasantly surprised by the tourist areas. We commented that if you don't take a drive outside of the French Quarter and downtown you wouldn't really know they experienced such devastation. The swamp tour with Cajun Encouters was great, be prepared though it did last about 5 hours. Overall the trip was great, the weather was fantastic and everyone we ran into was friendly and welcomed us. They definitely want people to come back!
