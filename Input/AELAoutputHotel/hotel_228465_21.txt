{"text":"Lovely hotel very quiet Only back from 3 nights here we had our daughter with us too so had booked a triple room with brekkie.Hotel very central the nearest metro station is the diagonal which is a great base to start journeys from so easy to get around.Make sure to book a hotel with a window  a spacious room we got a very small room really tiny and the window had no natural light - anyway straight away I asked to move the receptionist gave me a key to another room but told me it was smaller with not a great view ......... am.. hello... it was MUCH bigger with NATURAL LIGHT and a fine view over a laneway and the back of the hotel - what a relief so after the initail shock things just got better.The room was spotless with lovely decor , flatscreen telly and a cd player with a nice relaxing cd.Bathroom was lovely all marble and spotlessly clean bathroom  slippers (only one bathrobe though I rang down for another but no!)Real bonus in this hotel and more so after other reviews of hotels in noisy barcelona - YOU HEAR NOTHING - rooms sound-proofed no noisy neighbours to hear and dont mind other reviews about hearing the metro its hardly worth noticing and I am a senstive sleeper - also the best bed so comfie.Got chocolates on pillow first night.Breakfast was nice not as great as I was led to believe but nice salads, cheese salami , etc; never ate in the restaurant no english menu and pretty expensive.Loads of restaurants near by anyway isnt that what its all about!?The bar was very small and quiet but cosy not expensive either.I would stay here again but maybe would prefer something livelier with a pool but I would recommend this place you wont be sorry.
