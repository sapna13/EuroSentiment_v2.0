{"text":"Excellent Resort This is s a wonderful resort property on the oceanfront, about 1 hour drive from San Juan Airport, and just a short drive to the El Yunque rainforest. The service is excellent and the staff friendly. There is great golf, tennis, two pools (one with a kiddie slide, and the other long enough to swim laps), spa, casino, in room internet and cable, beach and watersport activities. The restaurants are all top quality, although a bit pricey. They do nickel and dime you on fees (ie daily parking fee, resort fee, housekeeping fee), but if you get an offseason or mid week room rate you still get terrific value. There is an airport shuttle, and day tours available, but it helps to have a car to get out and explore the island.I liked the proximity to smaller towns outside of the traffic and congestion of San Juan. There are less expensive dining options in nearby Luquillo and Fajardo, and you must visit the famous kiosks near the Luquillo Beach exit (only 10 minutes away) for inexpensive home cooked foods. It may look a little intimidating to the nervous traveler hoping to eat at a gleaming US eatery, but I found them friendly, inviting and very casual. If you are travelling with children, you will want to visit the famous Luquillo beach . For the $3 parking fee, there are restrooms , shady picnic areas, and one of the best beaches on the island. If you are single, you can venture to the same beach by parking behind the kiosks for free, then walk 30 yards over to the kiosks for a cold beer and snacks when you need them. I was there mid week: there were no crowds and it was very relaxing. I hear weekends get crowded and busy. ","annotations":[]}
