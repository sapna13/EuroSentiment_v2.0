{"text":"Nice experience Monopol hotel is centrally located, just opposite the train station and at 30 seconds from Bhor Bus Stop (which takes you to Hahn airport). From there you can easily reach the city centre (Zeil) and if you spend too much time in the pubs of the centre, you can walk back to the hotel on foot without any need to spend extra money for taxis (mind it's about a 25 minute walk, but you can still do it).Structure: the hotel is an ancient building with a very nice hall. Rooms are wide and clean. The bathroom is large and it's equipped with a large bath and shower. The furniture in the rooms is not very modern (it looks like those pieces of furniture from the 60ies), but there is a nice mini bar, which is completely free of charge and is refilled every day.Breakfast: breakfast is huge, there's a wide selection of everything, from Engish style breakfast (with German nuances) to the usual continental breakfast, including salmon (which is not very continental, but it's delicious).Services and Facilities: tea, coffee and a selection of cakes are always available at the hall free of charge.This hotel is connected from the inside to another hotel and they have a common PC room, which is free of charge (super, considering that I needed to check my email on a daily basis).Price is low: 64 euros per night (single room+breakfast), but I got to know that prices increase a lot during trade fair periods.My friend Daniel (who's German) visited me and he did not like it that much because of the furniture, however, I think the services and facilities provided made it a worth hotel where to stay (I think the price is lower compared to most same quality Italian hotels) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":476,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":472},{"endOffset":702,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":698},{"endOffset":1027,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1024},{"endOffset":1035,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1029},{"endOffset":1060,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1055},{"endOffset":1060,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1055},{"endOffset":1060,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1055},{"endOffset":1060,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1055}]}
