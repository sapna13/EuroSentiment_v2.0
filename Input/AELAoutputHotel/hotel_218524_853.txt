{"text":"Excellente!! OK.....This is the official review of the Excellence Resort - Punta Cana. MY WIFE AND I WILL BE GOING BACK!! Everything was Excellente....the food, the room, the service etc. etc. etc. NO...the lobster is not as good as in New England. NO...the steaks are not as good as they are in Texas. If you want to complain about little nit picky things and not enjoy paradise....then stay home!! I would recommend a couple of things and people to make your experience a truly wonderful vacation. First, I would recommend the Excellence Club. We enjoyed having the private bartender (Juan), private consierge (Maria), a private buffet, free DVD rentals for rainy days, and the fully stocked bar with premium alcohol in your room. We would definitely do the Club again. There are many things to do during the day besides tanning and drinking including horseback riding, learning merengue y salsa, volleyball, tennis etc. The staff is very attentive and really want you to have a great time during your stay. I want to send a special thanks to three people that made our stay the most memorable 1 year anniversary we could have ever dreamed of.....Rey, Mariel and Francisco. Rey met us every day with a smile on his face and was like a brother to us. He looked after us and made sure we were always having a good time. Mariel was also Excellente!! WAKEY WAKEY!! She made sure my wife had a good time at the pool and at the club at nights. Francisco was a super guy and an awesome spanish teacher. MY BROTHER!! Without these 5 people (Juan, Maria, Rey, Mariel and Francisco), we would have had a pretty average vacation. If you are planning a trip to the D.R., make sure you ask for these people....and tell them Marco y Lindsey sent ya!! I would definitely recommend one particular excursion...the Catamaran Tour. Loads of fun...and I hope you get Tito as your guide. TITO FAMILY....ARRIBA!!! Other than that...go and relax at the pool and bars and meet other couples and enjoy your many dinners. We tried all restaurants and did not have 1 single bad meal and all the bars and not a bad drink in sight!!What to bring:Bring plenty of sun screen (various SPF's)Aloe (Yes, even if it is cloudy...you can burn)Bug spray (we didn't need...but bring it anyway)Plenty of pool lounging outfitsSome dinner (Men - long pants) and club wearA smile on your faceWhat not to do:If you don't want to lose money at the casino...don't go. Quit complaining!!If you want Maine lobster or a porterhouse steak....go to New England or Texas. Once again...quit complaining!!Don't complain about nonsense like no decaf coffee.....they don't have it so don't let that ruin your vacation!!What to do:Enjoy all the drinks, restaurants, people and culture. Embrace them with a smile and they will embrace you with open arms.http:\/\/s127.photobucket.com\/albums\/p128\/MarkandLinds\/Dominican%20Republic%202007%20Pics\/ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":544,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":540},{"endOffset":618,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":613},{"endOffset":710,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":703},{"endOffset":764,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":760},{"endOffset":764,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":760},{"endOffset":889,"mention":"merengue","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Meringue"],"startOffset":881},{"endOffset":1428,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1424},{"endOffset":1546,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":1541},{"endOffset":2326,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2322},{"endOffset":2326,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2322}]}
