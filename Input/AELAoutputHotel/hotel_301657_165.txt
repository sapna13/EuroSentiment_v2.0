{"text":"Intrusive train noise, and that hamster feeling The rooms here are beautiful, and the bathroom alone was half the size of many Japanese apartments. Add in the free internet service, free Herald Tribune under the door each morning, complementary coffee and tea, and the hotel deserves 4 stars. Now for the bad news. Our room faced the Shimbashi train station, and the noise was persistent and loud between 5 a.m. and midnight. A noise generating air purifier was cleverly left running to mask the noise, but did not help. Most frustrating for us was the location of the hotel, attached to the complex of buildings known as the Shiodome. This complex is reminiscent of one of those large hamster habitats, with a bewildering 5 level array of overhead and subterranean walkways. A planned stroll to the Palace gardens turned in to a 3 hour fitness program of stair climbing and many wrong turns. We seemed to always be on the wrong level and the numerous orientation maps placed at corners each have north pointing in different directions. Bono would love Tokyo, because it is a place where the streets have no names. Your first challenge is to exit the building. You cannot simply hop in the elevator and go out the front door. You must first descend to the lobby level on floor 25 and parade across the lobby to the elevators on the other side of the room. Mercifully, this hotel does not employ a legion of service workers bowing and chanting pleasantries as you pass in front of them. Once at the next bank of elevators, you must choose between the ones on the left that take you to the overhead walkway and main entrance or the ones to your right that also go to the subway levels. Even at the subway level you will be descending and climbing stairs in order to get through the bottleneck of the Shimbashi station. Whatever you do, do not try to leave the hotel from the main door entrance. The surface roads are all but impassible to pedestrians. You will spend your day climbing and descending long staircases. And Heaven forbid you should try to enter the nearby Dentsu building to use the escalator. You will cause a great deal of stress to the security guard whose job it is to keep people like you out of there. Like caged rodents it will take you several days to learn the best pathway to food and entertainment from your room. Perhaps some people thrive on this sort of complexity, but if your knees and brain are aging you may prefer simpler surroundings.Some advantages to the location include:Fantastic Miyazaki designed mechanical clock on the pedestrian walkway level. Plays an enchanting tune several times per day. Arrive several minutes before the scheduled performance time. Some people have posted the performances on Youtube.comMany low cost, high quality restaurants in the surrounding buildings. The Shimbashi station is on the JR Yamonote line. Day pass for the JR Yamonote line is only 730 yen. It circles Tokyo and takes you to most of the interesting neighborhoods.
