{"text":"One caution... Three of us stayed 7 nights (2 rooms) in mid-October, 2006 at the Londra in Florence. My husband and I have different views on this hotel and I admit my less positive opinion stems from one bad experience. When I missed a step and went flying across the floor on the first afternoon of our stay, I was appalled that the hotel management admitted (with a shrug) that that last step of the main staircase really needs to be marked. Obviously I wasn't the first to create a spectacle there in the middle of the lobby. As we left I noticed that the problem was still there - a dangerously bad joke for unsuspecting guests.That aside, the hotel is conveniently located near the train station, restaurants, shopping, and several major tour attractions. It caters to tour groups as well as independent and business travelers. Not all the room's outlets worked and our toilet made an odd really loud noise when flushed. Internet was available sometimes in the lobby but not in the rooms. The maid for our room was particularly helpful and the breakfast staff maintained the tables quietly and efficiently. The Londra provides a good breakfast spread, but the menu never varies. Within a 10 minute walking distance, you can reach a large, well maintained self-service laundy. The restaurant had good food, slow service and high prices - by far, the most expensive of our trip without anything special to account for it.Before leaving home we had reserved tickets to museums (strongly recommended) and we had arranged a morning walking tour of Florence. Midweek, we had a tour with Giovanni Sirabella (Sunshine Tours) to see towns in Umbria (Perugia, Assisi and Cortona), and that was followed by 2 great days with Angela's Personal Tours going through the Chianti region and visiting Sienna and Volterra. I can recommend staying at Florence's Hotel Londra. Just watch that last step - it's a doozy! ","annotations":[]}
