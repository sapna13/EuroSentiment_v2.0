{"text":"Smashing place Cannot recommend the Affinia 50 highly enough. Once again, Tripadvisor's reviewers are bang on with the ratings. Three of us stayed at the Affinia from 30 Nov to 4 Dec 2006. I booked back in May; knowing December was peak season, and reserved a junior suite, but on arrival we were upgraded to an enormous suite on the 14th floor because one of us was celebrating a birthday. You'd easily have slept six people in it. There were two large double beds in the bedroom and the living area had two sofas, one of which folded out into a double bed. It also had a dining table to seat 4. The rooms were spotlessly clean and well-equipped; two large TVs, separate kitchen with dishwasher and large fridge-freezer, and bathroom with (an admittedly small, but we didn't mind) bath and lovely fixtures and Aveda cosmetics. Hairdryer, iron and ironing board also provided. Staff were incredibly helpful; the doormen and receptionists were obliging and pleasant, and the concierge in the second floor club lounge, Tanya, was brilliant - organised tickets for sightseeing tours and also managed to get tickets to a sold-out show for us. Location great - less than 10 minutes' leisurely walk to the Rockefeller center, and very close to Saks, Bloomingdales, and Fifth and Madison Avenues. We walked everywhere - didn't need to use the subway and only got taxis when going to the Port Authority or airport.The Affinia doesn't have a restaurant (it serves breakfast in the club room, but we didn't indulge), but there are plenty of dining options nearby. The New York Luncheonette two doors up does great breakfasts (you might have to queue to get in for a few minutes at weekends but it's worth it), and Ferro's Italian restaurant further up in the Kimberly hotel wasn't bad. I gather Smith and Wollensky's steakhouse down the street is great but we didn't make it there. If I had to find a negative it would be that there was a bit of noise from aircon units outside the windows, but it didn't bother us at all after the first night. Also, you might have to wait a few minutes for the lifts at check-in\/check-out times. All in all, a great stay. I would book it again without hesitation.
