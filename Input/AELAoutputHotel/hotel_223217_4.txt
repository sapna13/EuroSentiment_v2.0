{"text":"Cigarette smoke everywhere We booked this hotel as it was reasonably priced, and the hotel we were staying at was booked. We stay exclusively in Holiday Inn hotels, so we figured this would be ok, despite the reports of the location on Trip Advisor. Even though this hotel is a little north of a very commercial part of Seattle, we really didn't have any problems with the location, as most of our site seeing was away from this area. This appeared to be a newer hotel, but had the oldest beds out of any HI Express we have ever stayed in. They were so worn out you could hear the springs every time you moved.The biggest disappointment for us was that this hotel is not smoke free. If we would have known this we most likely would not have booked there. Even though we were in the room farthest from the smoking wing we could still smell smoke in our room (as I'm sure any non-smoker could) which was quite unpleasant. Not to mention we weren't thrilled about having our children exposed to the smoke. We have nothing against smokers, but the hotel would probably be better off to have complete floors smoking or non-smoking, so the smell doesn't travel down the hallway.Two other minor inconveniences were the fact that there is only one washer and dryer for laundry and no business office (just a computer by the front desk). They do have a good size dining room for breakfast in the morning which was nice.Overall, it wasn't the worst hotel we've stayed in but we most likely would never stay here again due to the cigarette smoke and uncomfortable beds.
