{"text":"Great resort, Good food, Perfect beaches This will be one of many, many reviews about the Grand Paradise Bavaro, all I can say is read many reviews as you can, weigh out the pros\/cons, take it with a grain of salt and decide for yourself.Unlike some of these reviews, I had no issues with my room, it was clean, and had no smell, and the bathroom was fine. We did not have a problem with the cleanliness of it. The maids were good, always left us extra towels.The food, it has been said before, this is not FINE dining, however, having said that, the food was WAY better then what some of the reviews had said before I left. I was PLEASANTLY surprised at the food. It was tasty, and there was variety..and when you got tired of the buffet, there was always the a la carts that were avaiable. The snack bar at lunch where they served pizza, hot dogs, burgers etc was also available. Again, not FINE dining, but the kids enjoyed it. We were a group of over 20 people...and sorry to those that were there the same time we were ( Dec 29-Jan 12) but I believe we finished all the HOT DOGS the first week !!! They were excellent !!Things to do: You MUST go to Saona Island, its the picture in the post card that you see all the time...the place does exist !! Water is spectacular, and swimming with the STAR fish was an absolute treat for the kids !! The other tour we did was the  Monster Truck tour. We went to a Haitian village ( if there is one thing I wish I had known was to bring stuff..). The poverty is shocking. We were able to stop off at a little gift store before we went, and bought some hair clips, pencils, pencil crayons etc...these people need EVERYTHING. So my advice, please bring any little hotel room shampoo bottles, soaps, tooth brushes, if you can, bring down any old summer clothes that you are done with...they need it all...The shows at night time were very entertaining ( for those of you who complained, MY LORD, THIS IS NOT BROADWAY !!) but the animation team put their best efforts into it !! Hi DARIO ( the MC)..HI DAVIDE (the dancer\/aerobics instructor )).....Was very friendly, they all were....the kids enjoyed themselves.Overall, this was a great trip for us and the kids and the rest of our party....For those of you setting your expectations of being on FANTASY Island,and being served like a king.. I would say WAKE UP....The hotel is clean, the food is good, the people are friendly, what more can you ask for??? Get back to the simplicity of when vacation was FUN, and ADVENTUROUS....you make or break your trip...its all in the attitude and your EXPECTATIONS...Remember, you are going to a 3rd world country, where there are children that run around without any shoes !!! The people are honest, and do their best to please us..but let us not forget, they are not our servants...HOLA to the staff at Grand Paradise Bavaro, keep up the good work ( there is always room for a little improvement...but you are headed in the right direction )!!P.S For anyone out there that does not travel well (weak stomach)..BRING GRAVOL..the roads are CRAZY...the POT HOLES are Unbelieveable...my children were sick on the drive to our tours ...as well as on the drive back to the airport...
