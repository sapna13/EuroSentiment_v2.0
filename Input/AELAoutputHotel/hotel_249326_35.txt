{"text":"Oh dear ................ Oh dear, booked the Hotel Arena without checking out the hotel reviews first - bad move! We paid another √ä√£¬¢40 to book a 'deluxe' double room - if our room was deluxe, I dread to think what the other rooms were like!However, despite immense disappointment on seeing the room, we deciced to try and make the best of it. The room was a decent enough size but very sparsely furnished - a large double bed, two old-looking cafe style plastic seats, a grotty table and an equally grotty coffee table. That was it. But the bed was clean and comfortable and the bathroom was perfectly okay. The maids gave us clean towels every day and the soap, shampoo, etc was replaced most days. Plenty hot water. The room was quiet, we weren't bothered with noise. Didn't eat at the hotel, decided to eat out instead. Tram into Dam Square was a five minute walk to catch the No 9 or 14 tram, so not exactly central as the website (lastminute.com) stated. Rooms are more like what you'd expect if you stayed in a hostel.No coffee or tea facilites - had to ask for the hairdryer. NO ROOM SERVICE!!! Would have paid just about anything for a cuppa.In our minds, hotel doesn't deserve a 3 star rating on the basis of the quality of the rooms. They obviously hadn't had anything done to them for a very long time. The curtains were ripped and filthy.Staff were however informative and friendly.All in all, wouldn't recommend it, as not central and very poor quality of rooms.Had a great time though, despite it!!!
