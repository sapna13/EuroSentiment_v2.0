{"text":"Loved the Copa de Cava.... I travelled to Dominican Republic as a Solo traveller for a week relaxing in the sun.Upon arriving at Bahia Principe Punta Cana which is the sister hotel to Bahia Principe Bavaro same layout etc I was greeted with a local drink... My room was not ready so I headed for a drink at the main lobby bar which was very lively to say it was only 3.30 pm. My first impression of the hotel was very good; everything seemed very well organised and the floors were spotless. I was soon given the all clear to head to my room; a porter took me there in a trolley bus and carried my heavy case up three flights of stairs... My room was very spacioius had queen sized bed and lovely view, I was very pleased. Mini bar was not plugged in but that was the only oversight by the cleaner.The place has such a happy laid back feel to it, nothing never too much trouble. When it rained on the next day I still seemed to enjoy myself; think this was to do with the many tequila sunrise's. Weather was fab for rest of holiday, soon got my barings around the village. Beach very clean, can walk for miles. Lots of watersports...Food: Buffet had wide selection which you have to use 4 nights out of the 7. I also used this at lunch times... Always seemed very busy at main pool near beach so used the pool in middle of resort which was less busy. I liked the French restuarant was very nice Gormet food and service was good too... Went to the Mexican, lacked a bit of atmosphere... Fish restuarant good, nice lobster... Went on Outback safari trip was excellent day out... gives you chance to see how the locals live; visit coffee, cocoa. sugar plantation before boogie boarding on a local beach, well worth getting out and about to see the gorgeous green landscapes. Also worth visiting Spa in resort and having a massage... before heading back home....In all great solo experience met many nice people, felt safe and was happy place to be for a week in my life... Would go back to Dominican again one day and would not have a problem staying here again...
