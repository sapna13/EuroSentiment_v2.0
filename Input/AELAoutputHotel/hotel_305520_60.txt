{"text":"Orchard was OK I stayed at the Orchard Hotel for 2 weeks in Feb. while on a buisness project. The hotel is located right at the end of bustling Orchard Rd. near most of the expensive designer shops and malls. I arrived very early in the morning and had no difficulties checking in and getting to my room. The hotel is divided into 2 wings with one being a little older than the other. I was in the older wing, but thought the room was very tasteful and modern. The rooms are a bit on the small side by American standards, but are still nice. I found the bathroom especially interesting as there is large round window between the bath\/shower and the living area of the room. The only complaints about the room are that you can not adjust the temperature even though there is a thermostat in each room. They keep the air conditioning in the rooms set very cold! The other issue was that the carpet in the room was very dirty and didn't look like it had been cleaned in years. There is a very nice buffet for breakfast with lots of food selections to suit people of all tastes. There is a restaurant in the hotel, but I did not ever eat at it. Room service is offered 24hrs a day and has a pretty good selection, although I never found the food to be that good. There is also a lounge area in the lobby with live music everynight except Sunday. The same group sings there everynight, and although they try, they just aren't very good. The hotel will be going to all non-smoking rooms by March 2007, but smoking is allowed in the lounge area. There is an outdoor pool on the 4th floor which is very nice and some of the rooms in both wings overlook it. You are also able to get Tiger or Corona beer around the pool if you can find the wait staff. They tend to disappear from the pool area during the day. The hotel is connected to a shopping center that has mostly food shops. There is a Subway and Tony Roma's restaurant as well as a money exchange booth that keep good hours. At night, right accross the street there are prostitutes that pick up men in the bars in the shopping center next to the hotel. I went out a few times in the evening as a lone female and never felt threatened, but it was somewhat unfavorable to see next to the hotel. The area is very safe and there are always people out walking around. Overall the hotel sees a lot of business travelers and seems to be busy all the time. I don't know that I would stay here again if I ever came back to Singapore for holiday, but the hotel was ok by me.
