{"text":"Best value in Amsterdam Just returned from my second stay at Seven Bridges. As before, it is a wonderful little property. Gunter and Pierre are so nice, and it feels like you are a guest in their beautiful home. Stayed in room number 8 for my second time, as it is one of only two rooms that have two beds. This room faces the garden and is incredibly peaceful. With an 8 hour time change from the US, an afternoon nap seems to be in order for the first few days, and this garden room is an ideal spot. Just open the windows and listen to the birds sing with the gentle breeze blowing in...heaven. This time I travelled with two friends, so the third wheel got room number 3...also very charming and facing the garden. Tiny bathroom, but who cares? For the price, you are lucky to be getting your own bathroom in this town. We left Amsterdam to travel to Belgium mid-week, and ended up staying at the much more posh and expensive Banks Mansion for our final evening, as a one night stay at Seven Bridges is almost impossible to book for a weekend. Even with all the glitz and luxury, I missed my Seven Bridges. Elevators are over-rated, and I don't feel like I'm really in Amsterdam without dragging my bags up a narrow winding staircase. It's all part of the charm. The location is perfect...central to the whole town. Only one block off Rembrandt Square on a quiet charming canal. Close enough to all the action, but far enough away to enjoy peace and quiet whenever you need it. Breakfast is fantastic...best croissants and coffee this side of Paris...maybe better. I wouldn't be completely honest if I didn't gripe about how much planning it takes to get a room here. They won't take reservations for short stays more than 60 days out, and if you wait to book within 60 days you probably won't get it in. Their cancellation policy is strict and seems to be somewhat at their discretion, but it is worth the effort and planning. I guess with so many repeat customers and only 9 rooms, they can afford to have strict rules. I will definitely return, and it is now one of my top reasons to keep going back to Amsterdam. Thanks again for a wonderful stay. See you guys next year!
