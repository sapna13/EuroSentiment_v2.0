{"text":"Had a great time! Loved it ! We had such a great time! Be aware that when you arrive at Punta Cana International Airport, you will be hit with a $10 fee to get into the country! Thankfully, we had cash on us to pay for that! We got to the resort and it was raining, and the staff was very helpful in getting us to our rooms without getting too wet! These rooms are by far the best on the entire complex, especially if you are travelling with children! All of the other rooms in the other hotels are just standard hotel rooms. The top floor is the one with the loft, but after that much walking around, it was nice to have the bottom floor! It was nice to have the tram, especially with my 2 yr old! He LOVED the choo-choo! However, it did move slowly. The food is regional, so don't expect too much american type food. It took me a couple of days to get used to it! The activities are pretty muich all in Spanish - we found that this resort is big on local people, Spaniards and Canadians. Not very many English speaking people - Brush up on your Spanish! The staff is wonderfuL! And the grounds are absolutely beautiful! At the end of the property, just past the Premium complex there is a flea market which you can buy your souvenirs at a much cheaper price than at the gift shops on resort property! As a final note, make sure that you pack your sunblock, but if you are susceptible to mosquito bites, bring repellant. My son and I had bug bites, which I don't mind, but was not going to pay $20 for a small can of OFF!. ","annotations":[]}
