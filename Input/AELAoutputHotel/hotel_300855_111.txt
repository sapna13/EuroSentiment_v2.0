{"text":"Great hotel Our arrival in Singapore (a stop off for 3 nights on our return home from Bali) got off to a bad start. Our travel company had forgotton to book our transport from the airport to the hotel, although we had paid a total sum of √ä√£¬¢92 for a return journey (they did return this) so we had to get a taxi which was less than √ä√£¬¢5 each way (quite a difference!). Just before we left Bali I had a problem with a tooth. On arrival at this hotel we explained about the mix up with the transport (although this had absolutely nothing to do with the hotel) and that I needed to see a dentist. They immediately sorted everything out for us, also making a dental appoointment for me. We were shown to our room immediately, with a very helpful staff member. The room was brilliant with a fantastic view of the area, including Raffles Hotel and the River. The bathroom was amazing. We had no problems whatever with this hotel and was very satisfied with the service and room. The breakfast was excellent, with a exceptionally large choice for all nationalities. The consierge arranged for us to go on a harbour river dinner cruise, which was an excellent evening and also included a pick up and drop off service. We arrived on the eve of the Singapore Independence Day and the area was heaving with people for a day or so and the hotel was very busy but the service was never compromised. The service and politeness of the staff were excellent. The hotel is in a brilliant position. You dont even have to go outside to enter a massive, spotlessly clean, shopping centre, and the Suntec Centre is right across the road. Raffles is just a short walk and its shopping centre. The walk along the river to Clarke Quay and Boat Quay is a loverly walk, especially on an evening. We had a brilliant steak meal (the best ever my husband said) at a restaurant on Clarke Quay called something like the 1 and only. Totally recommended.We would definitely stay at this hotel again and recommend it to anyone.
