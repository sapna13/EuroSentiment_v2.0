{"text":"Loved the Bahia Principe Just got back from Bahia Principe. Loved everything about it. I can't believe people actually complain about this hotel. After reading some negative reviews about this hotel, I had second thoughts about booking, but I still did. Whoever is thinking about booking this hotel, please ignore the negative reviews. My husband and I went for one week and enjoyed every minute. The hotel is beautiful, the lobby is one of the nicest I've seen and I've been to Punta Cana 3 times. The room was large and very clean. No bugs anywhere. The pools (and there's many) were lovely. We spent 2 days at the quiet pool and the remainder of our trip at the main pool beside the beach. The beach was beautiful, the sand was white and the water turquoise. My husband went snorkeling and loved every minute. You leave a $20 deposit at the rental hut to receive snorkeling gear and you get it back when you return the equipment. Can't complain about the food because there was nothing wrong with it. (Unless you don't like a huge selection of food that tastes good). We went to the El Pescador a la carte:Great, Gourmet a la carte:Good and Garden Grill a la carte:Good. We were happy with just going to the buffet beings it had great food and a large slection of it. Try the grilled fish at the buffet it was good everynight I had it. The chocolate covered donuts were delicous as was the thin crust pizzas being made every few minutes. The lobbybar was huge and is were we spent most of our nights listening to the piano player drinking specialty coffees that they would have every night.The tropical drinks were also good. Try the Dirty Monkey (no alcohol) or the Bahia Principe and Banana Mama if you prefer alcohol. They were all good. The night show started at 9:45 pm every night and ended at 11pm. Then the party would continue at the Pueblo Principe (an entertainment village located in the resort) with another show that would involve the guests more. This show would end at midnight, from there you could go to the disco that ended at 2am (sun. to thrus.) and at 2:30am (fri. and sat.). I agree that there is nowhere to go clubbing outside the resort like Mexico and Cuba, but why would you have to with all thats happening at the resort. My husband is 28 and I'm 29 so this review is from a younger couple who do like to party, and also relax when in the mood. We did both.
