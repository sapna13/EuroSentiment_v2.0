{"text":"GREAT Place to Stay We stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace in Punta Cana the second week of March, 2008 and absolutely loved it there. We had full access to 4 other resorts: the BBBeach, BBCaribe, BBGolf  Spa,  the BBCasino. The other resorts could not use our facilities, as the Palace is the top of that chain; which was nice because our resort was never over-crowded. BEACH: 5* there are miles of sugar soft white sand and plenty of beach chairs, and palm trees for shade. ROOMS 4*: spacious, 2 sinks, coffeemaker, v. comfortable bed; however, the workmanship is not what we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e used to in Canada, especially since my family is in the construction business; but you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in the Carribean, and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ hot and beautiful. Tipping $1\/day each or gifts from the $ Store for the maid and the guy who stocked the fridge allowed us extra towels and lots of beverages. FOOD 4.5*: lots of food at the Buffet, you can get freshly made breakfast, or fresh grilled meats and fish; even a soft ice cream machine. The outdoor restaurant next to the Flea Market had all you can eat fresh shrimp and calamari and even pizza until 5 pm. Steakhouse was yummy, and so was the Seafood restaurant. I usually get sick at these places√à√\u2020\u2022?but I sure didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ at this resort. POOL looked nice, v. clean, but never used it. SERVICE 4.5*: well-spoken English staff and helpful. GROUNDS 5*: very clean, and well laid out. All the rooms are very close to the beach. ENTERTAINMENT 3.5*: costumes  dancers were great, but it was pretty much the same thing every night; you need to go to other resorts for a change; as well everything was in Spanish or French. We also found there weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that many English speaking people there; lots of people from Europe and S. America. CAUTION: don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget your essentials as they charge a mint at the shops in your hotel for things like Immodium (which I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ need anyways.) $3.00 for 1 pill and you need a few if you get diaherrea.
