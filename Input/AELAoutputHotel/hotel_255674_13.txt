{"text":"Fantastic Stay Stayed at the Sydney Harbour Marriott hotel during September 2008 as part of our trip around Oz. The location is fantastic only a 5 minutes walk to the harbour ferry terminal. The hotel itself is beautiful and well worth the money. We had an opera view room which was amazin and really made our stay. The room was spacious and quite luxurious. Staff very friendly and helpful particularly concierge had excellent knowledge about the local area. Internet is quite expensive but convenient. The pool is ok but very cold so we only visited once.While we were in Sydney we walked the harbour bridge which was the highlight of our trip although expensive is well worth the money - an experience we will never forget. The Sydney Aquarium is worth a visit but the Wildlife Attraction is not as good and there are far better similar places in other parts of Oz. We also went on the Jet Boat ride which is an amzing experience but be prepared to get very wet. We didn't get the chance to visit the Blue Mountains which we have been told is excellent. Bondi beach is ok and worth visiting just to say you have been there but would definitely recommend a visit to Manly Bay which is much better.Eating out in Sydney is quite expensive as is any city but we found an excellent pub Phillips Foote in The Rocks where you can bbq your own food at quite a reasonable price. Authentic experience and the staff were excellent would definitely recommend.All in all had a fabulous time in Sydney which was made by our stay at the Sydney Harbour Marriott will definitely recommend and stay again in the future.
