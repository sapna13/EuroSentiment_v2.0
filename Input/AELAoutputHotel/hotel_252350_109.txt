{"text":"Loved this unique hotel The Watertown's tagline is a unique urban hotel and it truly is! I stayed here for a one-night business meeting and then I was taking a red-eye flight to the East Coast the next day. I could not have asked for a better night's sleep and a more relaxing, enjoyable experience. The staff were not just helpful and friendly, they would bend-over-backwards to help you in any way they could. The hotel has very modern furnishings and many tiny extras that add up to a wonderful stay (cookies at check-in, Aveda toiletry products, terry cloth robes, filtered tap water in rooms, coffee\/tea\/popcorn\/microwave, free shuttle around town). The included breakfast was not your standard pastries and fruit and cold cereal, but all that, plus eggs, bacon, toast, bagels, yogurt, hot cereal, etc etc. The absolute best part of this hotel are the free A La Cartes they will bring to your room--I got the spa cart with a foot bath, relaxing CDs and player, aromatherapy, and massagers. It was great and they have lots of other great carts for kids or a rainy day, too. I did not get a chance to use my complimentary wine tasting coupon in the attached wine bar, but I'm sure it would have been as wonderful as everything else associated with the Watertown! If you are headed to the University of Washington campus or just want to stay a bit outside of downtown Seattle, this is the place for you! It's not incredibly cheap (with taxes, my night was about $170), but it's well worth it when you figure in breakfast, a free wine tasting, and excellent customer service!
