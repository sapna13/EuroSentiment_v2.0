{"text":"Value for money Booked thru hotel.de. We had no problems with our reservation especially since I booked just around 2 weeks before our stay.We loved the free mini bar which they refilled everyday. Staying here during winter made me and my husband very thirsty so having that minibar was a definite plus. They stocked it with 1 bottle of water, 2 bottles German beer, 2 bottles orange juice, 2 bottles Pepsi, 2 bottles soda water. The room was old, but clean and spacious. They still used the old key system but the room had 2 doors so you can close both doors if you're worried about security. I didn't encounter any unwanted elements although we didn't really stay out late at night as it was very cold and most of the shops closed at 7:30pm. The breakfast offered included cold cuts, bratwurst, bread, rice, dumplings, eggs, cereal, salmon, fruits, yogurt, juices, coffee and tea. They didn't refill the items right away tho'. The hot milk for the hot chocolate ran out and it was just 9am. Dumplings and rice weren't refilled either.The problem we encountered happened on the second night when the guest on the adjacent room turned on his television at 1AM. It was too loud and we couldn't sleep. He did turn the volume down after an hour so we were able to sleep then. I don't know if the walls were thin or his TV was too loud but that definitely put a damper in our stay.The other negative thing was they had their own magazine with a sex feature right on the front cover. Definitely would not recommend this if you have kids with you.Other than that, I still believe this hotel is good value for money in terms of location, the free mini bar and buffet breakfast included. They also provided free snacks in the lobby that included cakes, orange juice and coffee.
