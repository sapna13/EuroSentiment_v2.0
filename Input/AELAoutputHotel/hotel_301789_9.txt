{"text":"Great hotel once you get there I travel to Tokyo a lot on business and as an elite SPG traveller wanted to try the Westin purely to earn points. It is a very classy hotel located in the Yebisu Garden district.The hotel is done up in that Japanese styled European elegance that must have been popular during the bubble. Service is impeccable and the hotel has recently added a Westin workout facility that's top notch. Rooms are nice, typical of what you'd expect for a Westin, and decent size. Bathrooms are marble\/granite in construction and nice seperate stall shower and tub. And of course the room features an exciting high tech Japanese toilet. The hotel features an executive lounge with cocktails in the evening and breakfast in the morning for frequent guests. Cocktails are generous with full bar and nice selection of appetizers. The breakfast is also generous and filled with amusing options such as green salad (for breakfast?). The Westin staff has learned a bit about western tastes since I was last at the property and are now serving crispy bacon alongside the limp traditional offering.The Yebisu Garden complex provides a lot of dining options (so you're not limited to the $150 sushi sampler on the room service menu) as well as shopping and international ATM at a post office branch. I ate at a traditional tonkatsu location (Japanese fried pork that tastes a bit like weiner schnitzel) and at a yakiniku (Japanese style Korean BBQ) restaurant, but the options were varied and offered options in a variety of price ranges.So...what's not to like? Unfortunately the one major drawback to the Westin is its location. The Ebisu subway station is a 10-15 minute walk from the hotel through the Yebisu Garden complex, and Ebisu is not necessarily close to traditional Tokyo business districts. Check into this consideration when booking your stay as at the end of a long business day or sightseeing venture this could be a drawback.
