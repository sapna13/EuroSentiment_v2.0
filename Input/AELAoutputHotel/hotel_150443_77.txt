{"text":"Joey, Another Teq-ini Please I just got back from a long weekend trip with some girlfriends and I can't imagine having a better time than we had. The Condado Plaza had a lot to do with that. The lobby is beautiful, the staff is so friendly  helpful. We arrived early  had no problem with the early check in. They gave us two beautiful rooms right next to each other. We were on the lagoon side, so we did get a roof view of the building below, but if you just lifted your chin a little higher you could only see the great view of the city. After we unpacked, we hit the pool. I couldn't ask for a nicer pool area. The staff was attentive, but busy, so it was a little slow, but hey, we were on island time. The drinks were a little pricer, but they were pricey everywhere. I challenge you to find a cheap good place to get a drink with a pool side view in San Juan.The staff was extremely attentive. Our bathroom door was squeaky so we alerted the concierge on our way back from breakfast  the maintenance man beat us to the room. He also changed some light bulbs and we were good to go. Do not miss the swim up bar. And when you're there ask for Joey. He was so much fun  made our last few hours at the hotel a blast. We almost missed our flight because we were having such a good time.
