{"text":"Great ;location This hotel is right in the center of the city. We could walk everywhere. it is 5 minutes to Dam Square, ten minutes to the Rembrandtplein, and maybe 15 minutes- walking briskly to the Leidensplein. The breakfast buffet was great- everything from eggs to order, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereals, hardboiled eggs,cheese and meats, but pretty expensive at 25E per person. We were able to get an upgrade to the business rooms where breakfast is included but if we didn't have that I might have looked for a small cafe. Get a good map and you can walk everywhere.The rooms were nice but Radisson please get some new hair dryers in the rooms. They have the old style hairdryer mounted on the wall. It was awful. The tube kept falling out and it looked like it was from the 70's. Housekeeping was ok, but sometimes the glasses were not changed. The bathtub was very nice and deep though. I went to Lush and got some bath bombs. Taking a bath after walking all day is great. I also liked that the windows opened. You really want a room that looks out on the street not on the interior lobby.If you can go to Boom Chicago and take the Saint Nicholas Boat club tour. it is on a small boat and so much nicer than the large tour boats. very unique. You sign up inside Boom Chicago.On the walk to Leidensplein there are several Italian Restaurants .We had some great Pizza at Antonios. The rijsttafel at Indurpura in the Rembrandtplein was very good. We tried a Brazilian steak house near Indurpura but it was only ok.Definitely get tickets on line to go to the Anne Frank House. You get to go in a separate entrance, and go early by the afternoon the lines are around the block. The area around the museum is a nice walk, but if you go on Sunday morning, as we did, none of the shops are open in the Jordaan.We plan to come back. The city is beautiful and the hotel is almost perfect. We had everything we needed except a decent hairdryer- and that is a small complaint. We didn't eat at the Hotel except for breakfast because there were so many restaurants near the hotel.Watch out for the bikes though. We had to keep our eyes open. The Dutch hate it when you step out in front of them- and who can blame them!
