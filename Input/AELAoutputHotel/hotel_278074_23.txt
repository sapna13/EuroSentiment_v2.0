{"text":"Good for business or holiday Four Seasons Miami is in the heart of Miami's downtown business district - great for business travellers but not where most tourists to Miami would ideally want to be, as there are no beaches, shopping areas, etc. within walking distance. However, we were pleasantly surprised - the pool area of the hotel is a destination in itself and the downtown location actually gives the hotel a more sophisticated and exclusive feel than you would get at a more typical holiday resort type hotel. The downtown location also didn't feel isolated - there are actually several good restaurants as well as a good Publix supermarket within walking distance so if you feel like feel like having a meal outside of the hotel or picking up some essentials it is easy to do. As one would expect from a Four Seasons, the hotel was 5-star quality - the highlight is the beautiful pool area with lots of private canopy areas so you can easily get your own canopy to spend the day under. Pool staff are very attentive - you can order drinks or food from them and they will serve you at your canopy or lounge chair. The outdoor bar area by the pool is very nice and is a must either during the day or evening - they serve lunch during the day and bar food in the evenings. On the negative side, the main hotel restaurant, Acqua, was disappointing. Food quality was sub-par and the fusion style food on the menu didn't work. Other slight negatives were that one day part of the pool area was closed for a private reception - they didn't tell us this when we booked or checked in. The outdoor bar was also closed to hotel guests one evening due to being booked for a private event. As a paying customer in a 5-star hotel you should expect to be able to use all of the main facilities all of the time. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for not only business travellers but also holiday travellers to Miami - particularly if you can get a reasonable rate.
