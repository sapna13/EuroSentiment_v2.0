{"text":"A perfect quirky hotel We've just returned from a 10 night stay at the Puri Santrian Hotel in Sanur and loved every minute of it - we didn't want to come home. The hotel was lovely, we upgraded to the Santrian Club rooms which are slightly bigger and have their own small pool which was very quiet and shaded. The rooms were very large, clean, with the sheets changed daily and the towels twice a day. Our room came with a massive double bed which was very comfy.The grounds are very pretty with lots of traditional statues which are decorated with flowers daily. The hotel has three pools all different with plenty of places to lounge about. My favourite place was on the huge sofas on the beach which overlooked the sea which had huge cushions and could easily fit two - I've never seen this before and it was great - a nice place to cuddle up towards the end of the day.The hotel has a thai\/japanese restaurant called Mezzanine where the food was superb. A three course meal with cocktails for two came to under √ä√£¬¢30, this included scallops, fresh fish and the best lemongrass  mango creme brulee ever. I'd also recommend the red snapper grilled in a banana leaf with a peanang sauce - so delicious I had it twice. The food in an around the hotel was all really good, we took the advice from other reviews and went to Donalds which was great value for money and excellent food, we tended to go there for lunch as it was only next door to the hotel on the beach side and we could eat for about √ä√£¬¢1.50 each - try the Nasi Goreng, delicious. Other places to try are Caramel, which is only about 3 doors down from the Puri Santrian, the Village Italian restuarant in the Puri's sister hotel and in Kuta there is a chain restuarant called 'Bubba Gumps Shrimp Restuarant' which is based on the film Forrest Gump, not traditional balinese food but great fun. In the whole time we were there, there was no sign of Bali Belly, we were careful not to have ice in our drinks outside of the hotel but apart from that ate anything we wanted.Sanur is quite a quiet area compared to Kuta but we found it perfect for a relaxing time in the sun. There is lots to do if you want to, we found the organised trips very good value for money and also hired a driver for the day for √ä√£¬¢25 for 9 hours. He spoke perfect english and had a degree in tourism, we had an excellent day. Our favourite trip was to the Dolphin Lodge which is about a 20min drive from the hotel. Here you can spend 40 mins interacting with rescued dolphins in the sea. It cost us $69 each and was well worth it. The dolphins were very well cared for and their trainers were very knowledgeable and we had great fun. We would also recommend a visit to the Elephant Park at Taro where you can have a ride on an elephant and watch a short show. The grounds are amazing and you can spend time just watching the elephants and their mahoots washing, feeding and wandering about - I took so many photos we filled the camera memory.We would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone and are planning our next visit. The hotel has been given a 3 star rating but I think it is comparable to many 4 stars we have stayed in. The service was excellent, with all staff really friendly. The hotel operates a 'passport' where they encourage you to sign for food and drinks etc and discourages tipping (although a 10% service charge is always added to the cost) this means staff are not looking for tips and seem genuinely happy to help you. The hotel spa is amazing, we had a 10 min free massage on arrival and it was also offering a 'buy one get one free' on all treatments, so I took full advantage of this. One warning, the traditional balinese massage is fairly brutal and I'm sure I had bruises for a couple of days afterwards. I learnt my lesson and asked for the next one to be a bit more gentle.Overall, we had a brilliant holiday and Bali was the perfect place to relax in the sun. We spent 4 days in Hong Kong on our way over which broke up the travelling but came straight home - this was a test and totalled 30 hours from leaving the hotel to getting home but we'd do it again to see beautiful Bali.
