{"text":"it's what you want to make of it!!! Yes other reviews are true, Felt that we paid a premium price to stay here for the type of accomodation that was on offer but we had come to see amsterdam not spend all day in the hotel room although having said that a major hang over on the first night meant that we did not surface till 3pm the next day but we were not disturbed by any maids hoovering or the previously mentioned noisey neighbours in fact the whole stay was rather quite even though the hotel was full over the weekend... the actual room was rather on the small side with the previously mentioned shower room door opening onto the bed but it was clean comfortable and warm and we had fresh towels every day..i,m afraid we can't comment on the breakfast as we never made it once!! the location wasn't as central as we were lead to believe but this was easily overcome by catching the metro approx 5 min walk and getting off at central station and exploring from there onwards.. do have to say though we did feel the location of the falcon plaza was a safe one and we both agreed that we would rather be where we were then right on top of all the action as the location of some of those hotels in the most central parts felt very dodgy!! To sum this experience up i would say this hotel was nothing special and some form of modernization wouldn't go a miss but if it's just a place to put your head down in a clean,comfortable and friendly enviroment then this hotel is fine..
