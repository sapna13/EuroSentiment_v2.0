{"text":"Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Warwick about 4 years ago and liked the hotel and location so we did not hesitate to book it again for this trip.We asked for and received a non-smoking room with a king bed and high floor. We were hoping to be on the same side of the hotel as before and we were - with a nice view of the Space Needle. Check-in was nice and friendly. Had our keys within minutes and a nice room with a small loveseat and a Juliet balcony.Love the location of this hotel - just a block away from some of the best restaurants downtown (Dahlia Lounge, Palace Kitchen, and Lola's) and a small grocery store\/mini-mart right across the street that also has wine. It's also an easy walk to Pike Place Market.On site at the hotel is a very nice restaurant and lounge area. Ate breakfast at the hotel once and had drinks in the lounge\/bar a few times. Good service.We didn't have a chance to use it but we did look at the pool and exercise room which is located in their basement. Pool was small but definitely useable. The exercise room had a variety of machines and weights - not the newest on the market but definitely decent machines. Both were kept very neat and clean and the exercise room had plenty of towels and a water cooler available.I think we ran into the maid on most days as we were leaving and she was always very friendly.We used the business center a couple of times which consisted of 2 computers (free internet) and a printer. You just needed to ask for the key at the front desk. Was very nice and handy.Overall, I thought the staff was very helpful, the hotel was quiet with a good location, and it definitely met all of our expectations as it did when we stayed here a few years ago. We would definitely return again (and hope that we do soon!)
