{"text":"Excellent city hotel Stayed in this hotel 2 weeks ago for a couple of nights on business. The hotel itself is nicely presented, with good attention to detail in the rooms and public areas. The rooms are a little on the small side, but they do exude a sophisticated and modern feel that generally makes them a nice place to be. I think given the shortness of my stay, it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really bother me that the rooms are a little cramped. I think it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ worth noting however that a longer stay might put greater emphasis on this design deficiency. May be worth upgrading to a larger room?Service levels in this hotel were a highlight - certainly up to the Hilton√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ high standards. I found every staff member to be polite and helpful, particularly the people manning the room service hotline. Room service was quick and efficient and the food was generally of a high standard. The breakfast selection was also excellent and very well presented.Access to broadband internet was also easy and the pricing structure was actually sensible for a change √à√\u2020\u2022?I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stand it when I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ forced to pay for internet access I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ use, like hotels that require you to purchase access for 24 hours just so that you can spend 15 minutes checking your email. Fortunately, at the Hilton you only pay for the time you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e actually accessing the internet.Overall, a very good city hotel ideal for business stays. If you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e planning a short stay in Sydney then I would highly recommend staying here.
