{"text":"Just Returned Feb.1, 2008. Beautiful Resort We just returned from four nights at √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≠reams Punta Cana√à√\u2020\u2022?on Feb. 1, 2008.The resort is beautiful: manicured gardens throughout, a spectacular beach and a pool that runs the length of the facility. Everything was immaculate. There are flamingos, parrots, chickens, and fish in sculpted ponds. A great atmosphere for a relaxing vacation.I cannot praise the staff enough. Gracious and smiling they always made us feel welcome. While everyone spoke some English, communication could be a problem. To their credit they would find someone who could better translate when needed. The customer service was amazing. The employees did not appear stressed and were always happy to accommodate the guests. The activities staff was wonderful, even if a bit too familiar for my taste. Nothing inappropriate, but it seems their job included cozying up to the guests. All staff from the restaurants to the bars and beaches was truly wonderful. I travel often and this group went beyond all expectations.The food was only fair, but fine. I cannot recommend any of the specialty restaurants. We tried Oceania, Bordeaux and Italian. All were disappointing. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??orld Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ√à√\u2020\u2022?buffet (something I never go to on cruises) was by and far the best choice. Fresh salads, fish, breads and breakfast smoothies were our favorites. The chicken at the beach grill and the fruit stand (mid-pool) were also very good. While not fine dining, there are plenty of options to satisfy almost anyone. The coffee with steamed milk (con leche) is addicting.The rooms are quite nice. The maze of buildings can be a bit confusing at first. We figured the extra walking helped work off the morning pastries. We were in building three, mid-resort. Maid service was good. We would return to find individual fresh flowers surrounding the sink and\/or worked in towel sculptures. We left them a few dollars each day which was well deserved.I was pleased that there was NOT a rowdy bar scene. While some guests may have been serious drinkers, loud partiers seemed contained to a few outdoor bars. While I am not much of a drinker I did ask for extra alcohol when having a cocktail as they make very weak drinks. Bartenders were happy to oblige all requests.The entertainment was fine. This is not Vegas or Broadway but we never expected great theater. Enjoy it for what it is. The male dancers in drag were hilarious and all of the dancers were quite good. Jamaican Dave at the late night piano bar had us roaring with laughter as the guests took turns at the mike. Be aware his is definitely an adult only show and not for those easily offended. In all, a lovely break from reality. I could not do longer than 5-7 days as you stay within the resort unless you chose some excursions. While not √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢ravel√à√\u2020\u2022? Dreams was a great winter escape.
