{"text":"Mixed feelings We switched to this hotel on the fly while we were already in Amsterdam and disappointed with the nearby hotel we booked from home. We spotted the fascinating building and were attracted to the baroque, impressive lobby. We may have reconsidered our booking if we would have seen the room first. We went for the upgraded, canal view room. We also bought the package that includes the buffet breakfast which is excellent. The first room that was assigned to us at fifth floor made us turn around and ask for a different one. Not only that it was unacceptably small but also had small, cheap looking sliding windows. The second room was still quite worn out and in dire need of a facelift but at least had the old world flavour and class we desired. The bathroom was really basic and the shower malfunctioning and was not fixed throughout our stay.To the good parts. The hotel itself is beautiful and the dining hall above the canal is just perfect. Breakfast itself is well presented and tasty. The location is ideal away from main street tumult but still central. The front desk staff was absolutely fabulous! Throughout my many years in hotels all over the world I never run into a team so friendly and helpful. It was a pleasure. I think that the rooms' condition is known to the administration and well reflected in the relatively affordable fare. For this reason I consider that despite the drawbacks, the value for the money is good indeed. Overall we had a pleasant experience and would return to this hotel without hesitation.
