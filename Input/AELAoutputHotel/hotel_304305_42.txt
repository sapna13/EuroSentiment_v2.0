{"text":"Shinjuku's Best! We stayed at the Keio Plaza Hotel for 9 nights a month ago. It came highly recommended by a friend and I am so glad we listened. Keio is located in the business area of Shinjuku, therefore it isn't as chaotic as the other areas near the Shinjuku train station. It was relatively peaceful, especially during the weekends. The great part is all the action is just a 5-10 minute walk away! There were restaurants nearby but we especially loved this tempura place which served the best tempura ever at a great price. Around Y580 yen for a tendon (tempura rice bowl topping) and Y650 for a tempura set meal. Its located in the underground walkway leading to JR Shinjuku station, around 3-5 min walk from the hotel (next to Yoshinoya). We were also very happy with the rooms we got - clean, spacious plus it came with a great view. We requested for our rooms to be next to each other and thats what we got. We were a group of 9 - 5 of them kids - so it was essential that we all stick together. Keio Hotel also has the best-trained staff. All of them were corteous and friendly, and of course they all spoke english really well which was a big plus when we needed any help. The hotel itself is huge - I think more than 1,000 rooms. Luckily we were booked in the South Tower which is more modern (and was just renovated) so I suggest you request for the same when making plans to stay in this hotel.Our trip to Japan was wonderful and our stay in Keio made it even more fulfilling! I would gladly recommend you stay in this hotel :-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":50,"mention":"Keio Plaza Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Keio_Plaza_Hotel"],"startOffset":34}]}
