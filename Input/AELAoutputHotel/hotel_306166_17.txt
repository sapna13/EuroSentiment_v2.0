{"text":"Lovely stay in Singapore I had got the Executive plan rate, which provided a supposedly larger, nicer room and included breakfast daily. It also included 5 pieces of pressing during the first 2 days of the stay and 20% off at the spa.The room was quite nice with a great view of the surrounding city and part of the bay. There was fresh fruit and a box of chocolates, as well as a little teddy bear and a rubber ducky in the bath. The service was amazing! All the staff acted like I was the most important guest they had all year. I went to the main restaurant for the breakfast buffet twice. The atmosphere is a little crazy, but not too bad. Then I discovered that another breakfast buffet is available on the Executive floor, so I went to that one and it was much more relaxing. The only thing missing were omelettes, waffles, and traditional Asian breakfast items, so if you don't care about that, then its perfect.The spa was absolutely incredible! The prices were also quite reasonable. One technician, Mae, was this tiny little woman with the strongest hands and arms. At one point during the massage, I realized that she was actually sitting across my back and I couldn't even tell she was there. I had scrubs and wraps and all sorts of fun things done there, and then I laid poolside for the rest of the day to recover from my long trip. Warning - the food from the pool menu is blah and insanely expensive. Also, there is a buffet for dinner. The price might be approaching reasonable if you are going to eat your fill of crab legs, praws, oysters, and sushi, but if you are not going to eat those things, you are going to pay WAY too much.
