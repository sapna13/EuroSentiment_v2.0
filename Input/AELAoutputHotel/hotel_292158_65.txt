{"text":"5 Star - No Way! A group of 8 of us arrived in Punta Cana on July 11th for what we thought was 7 nights in paradise but it didn't take long to figure out we were in for a long week. We booked 3 rooms through Apple Vacations and I emailed the resort the week before we left and requested rooms in building 2000 if they were available. We did get rooms in building 2000 and that was the highlight of the trip, from there on it was hit and miss. We missed the original orientation with our Apple rep and we re-scheduled a meeting with him later although he didn't act like he was to happy about it. We encountered a lot of that during our stay. The front desk staff, waiters and cooks were VERY RUDE! We speak very little Spanish but we have traveled to the D.R. and Mexico and never had a problem communicating. For a supposedly 5 star resort communication should not be a problem. I found it interesting that the staff could speak Spanish, French, German and Italian with no problem but acted like they didn't understand English. They obviously cater to the Europeans and treat Americans with no respect. Drink selection was the worst I have seen anywhere. I've never stayed at a resort in the D.R. that didn't know how to make a Sammy Sosa or that wouldn't even try to make a drink that you asked them to make. If it wasn't on the drink menu, Fuggedaboutit! The bartenders would not even attempt to make anything else no matter how much you tip. Bottom line is don't stay here, go somewhere else.
