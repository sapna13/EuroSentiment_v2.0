{"text":"4.5 out of 5, Excellent Stay! From check in to check out, we have very little to complain about The Lenox Hotel. We just spent the weekend in Boston and booked a great rate for a king room on hotels.com.Immediately upon check in, the hotel was accommodating with an issue we had. They called about 20 minutes later to make sure everything was ok with the room. The concierge, Tom Bliss did a great job with recommendations as well as getting us a last-minute reservation at Aujourd'hui for dinner. All of the staff was very pleasant and accommodating.The decor is elegant and charming and while might be stuffy for someone looking for a modern decor, I found it very welcoming. Downstairs has black wood and the hallways are navy and gold, just beautiful and classic. The rooms are a similar style, with nice molding and decor. The room was not huge but a good size with a comfortable king-sized bed and a flat screen TV. The marble bathroom was also not huge but very nicely lit and laid out with nice fixtures and there was a large walk-in closet. A good number of outlets and complimentary wireless made a little work very easy. We asked for and were given a room on a higher floor, so we had a nice view looking down Boylston Street but with very little street noise or sound from the hallway of the hotel. Wonderful night's sleep both nights.We only ate breakfast at the hotel, once room service and once at Azure. The breakfast is decent, though you might be able to find something better for the price fairly close by. There was a line at both City Bar and Solas on Friday night, but City Bar gave us priority as guests of the hotel and we did not wait long to get in.Overall, I would highly recommend The Lenox as a relaxing, warm, charming, elegant place to stay in Boston. It was very convenient off I-90 and parking, though not cheap (Copley Place was $34 for 24 hours), is easily accessible within 2 blocks walking distance.
