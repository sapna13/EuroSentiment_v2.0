{"text":"Excellent hotel with great staff and a good location My wfe, mysefl and daughter stayed at Hotel Relais Bosquest twice during the quiet Paris month of August 2006. The hotel staff, Gerard  Abel, was exceptional. They were on all occassions extremely polite, professional and helpful. The Hotel is situated in a real middle to upper middle-class neighborhood, a short distance from Invalides and the Eiffel Tower. It is one block from the gourmet corridor known as Rue Cler. There are artisanal cheese shops and bolangerie one block in eash direction. A post office is around the corner. The metro is one block away. There is an ATM at the bank right across the street; a supermarket three doors donw ; a dry cleaner next to that; a self-service laundromat one block east and some lovely inexpenseive brasseries within footsteps of the hotel. Of course, you can easily get to St . Germain and all the other areas of Paris quickly and efficiently via the metro. The Relais Bosquet offers free internet and wifi in its lobby and a breafast, which we did not take advantage of. The rooms  beds were very comfortable and clean, some with balconies providing a view of Paris roof tops and the Eiffel Tower. We would most certainly stay at the Hotel Relais Bosquet again. Gerard at the front desk was particularly helpful. (By the way, if you have not been to Paris previously or in a long time, I recommend you walk over the the Seine, right beyond the Eiffel Tower some nice evening and take the river tour cruise - corny, but it definitely helps you to begin to appreciate the overwhelming beauty, age and history of the city).
