{"text":"an affordable find Given prices and service in Paris, it is nice to report on a nice find suitable for a range of travellers. I stayed for one night in March, traveling alone, and stayed in the cheapest room. I was pleased to find it of adequate size (I've stayed in smaller rooms, esp in London BBs, for more money), very clean, and well organized in terms of furniture, etc. It had a sink and the toilet and shower rooms were across the hall. (I'm not sure how many there were on the floor - I didn't have to compete for their use, but in the high season this might be an issue.) These were also very small, but likewise clean. The front desk service was excellent - very welcoming, bi (or probably tri or quad-) lingual, and helpful in giving restaurant etc recommendations. The neighborhood is convenient rather than fashionable, but seems safe enough and has a fair array of restaurants within 2 blocks of the hotel. There are a large # of Asian restaurants in the area, I noticed; and a late night convenience store perhaps 1 block south of the hotel. The nearest Metro stop is only a block away but other lines aren't far; I walked from Gare du Nord, and this was about 20 minutes, a straight line down Rue de Lafayette. I didn't have breakfast, though the price seemed a bit steep for what was on offer and what's available at local boulangeries. All in all, I think this was a very good find at the price, and would recommend it as a nice foothold for a night or two in Paris.
