{"text":"ok, but not all that Stayed here for 2 nights at the beginning of my visit to Spain. The room was small, but ok. Had 2 twin beds, small desk, and a wooden straight backed chair. There was a tv, but I dont think it had any english channels. The walls are a bit thin, you can hear noise between the rooms.I took the airporter service from the airport to the hotel, and it was a good thing, I dont think I woudl have found it otherwise. This hotel is located on the top floor of a converted apartment building. There is a small elevator which was working fine for our visit. The stairs are very uneven and often dark. Be careful if you take them.The check in process was quite easy, Staff at the desk speak english and were friendly. Check out was also easy. The staff were not very available between the two processes. We booked for room over the Internet, and they were quick to get back to us.We found we had to run the airconditioning all night or it was much too hot, did not leave the windows open as we were facing a very busy and noisy street. The a\/c works very well, almost too well, we were freezing as the beds only have one thin sheet on them. Made use of the fridge for bottled water, and it was good to have the room safe. Decor is all from Ikea as stated by other reviewers. The bathroom in our room was not as tiny as some have said, there was a tub\/shower combo, sink and toilet. Enough room to move, but not enough for a party. I did not see any bugs, and it appeared to be clean. This hotel is in a good location, but there are litterally dozens of hotels in the area. It is about a 10 minute walk to the three museums, and just a couple of min's to Sol. There are lots of bars, restraunts, clubs, etc in the area. We paid 60 euro's a night for this hotel, it was ok, but I would not stay here again, I would try something else in the area. ","annotations":[]}
