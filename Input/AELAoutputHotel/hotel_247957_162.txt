{"text":"Fantastic! This was my third visit to the Occidental Grand, Punta Cana and it was fantastic! I travelled with my mother and we are both very fond of this hotel. We have always upgraded to the Royal Club and this is the reason we return yearly to Occidental Grand, Punta Cana. We have already decided to return for a forth time in 2009! The highlights are the staff, food, room location and the designated beach area. In addition, the cliental in this area of the hotel all want the same type of vacation; very quiet, lovely food and drinks, location of room, designated beach area and a tranquil pool. We return every year because the hotel offers everything we look for in a relaxing and peaceful holiday. My goal is always to read many books and enjoy the peace and quiet. The highlight for me is the staff as they are so responsive, pleasant and adhere to our needs. All the staff treats you with magnificent attention and delivers efficient service. The management most recently changed and Lenny was superb as she catered to our needs and made us feel very welcomed. Also, the other staff in the Royal Club reception always assisted both of us. In addition, the restaurant is fabulous as the waiters all deliver personalized service and the food is delicious. This year, one surprise was in the restaurant as they changed the wine (both red and white). It was dreadful so we did not drink wine all week! We really enjoy wine at all our meals and we were so disappointed they changed the wine. We were surprised as the previous two years the restaurant served premium wine and this year you had to pay an additional fee for a decent glass (or bottle) of nice wine. So we did not drink wine all week! However, this year we ate every meal at the Royal Club restaurant and every meal was incredible. It was interesting because most of the waiters have been there every year we have been at this hotel and we have got to know Francesco, Franklin and Juan very well√à√\u2020\u2022?we have enjoyed seeing them yearly! They treat both my mother and me very well! Every year there are additional changes at the hotel and we have seen many improvements. This year they added a bar at the beach and new beach lounges. These were wonderful additions; however, they added Premium to this area and it was very crowded compared to our previous two trips. This was the first year where the beach chairs were taken very early in the morning and this seemed to lose the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬©oyal Club special designated beach area√à√\u2020\u2022? We are hoping that they either expand the designated beach area or return to Royal Club only. Overall, it is a lovely hotel and we have already planned to return next March 2009!
