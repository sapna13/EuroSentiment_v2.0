{"text":"huge hotel, I had a great time This hotel is divided into 3 sub hotels. There is 1500 rooms, 8 a la carte, 4 buffet (almost the same food), 3 snack bar and 5 pools. Let talk about the good things first. Excellent service everywhere you go. Anyone will say hi to you. Lots of choice on drinks and make sure you try the snack bar near the beach where they have bbq ribs all the time. Thats the only place you will find ribs. They have 8 a la carte and you are only allow 3 if you stay in regular suite. I stay at the club premier where we are allow 4. The french a la carte is the best. Steak house sucks, mexican is okay and japanese is not really japanese food (all they have is teriyaki sauce on every meat). The buffet just okay. However, there is lobster on sat nite. Most of the time, I just eat at the 2 snack bar near the beach for lunch. Breakfast is the usual stuff. Due the size of this hotel, there isn't much entertainment on site. There is activities every hour in the beach and pool area . The tennis, soccor and mini golf is far from the main lobby. There is an area specially for shopping, clubing and live band. There is a pool table there but is cost you 1 dollar per game. You also can find late night snack here if you arrive there at night time.Before you buy anything from the vender, visit the shop for price. I find most shop offer better deal then the vendor.If you are interested in the national stone, Larimar stone. You can get a good deal on the beach. I pay 9 dollar for a 10 stone neckness and 2 dollar for earrings. However, the quality is just okay via beach vendor. There is a shop with in that small town which they sell high quality Larimar.Overall, I enjoy the my stay at this hotel. I recommand this hotel if you like 5 star service at a low price. There is a 5 star plus hotel next door, Paradisus Punta Cana Resort , lobster everyday but the price is double.
