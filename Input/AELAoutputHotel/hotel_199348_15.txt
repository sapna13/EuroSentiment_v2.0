{"text":"Dated property in desperate need of an update As a frequent traveler and loyal member of the Marriott chain, this hotel was by far one of the worst properties I've encountered. Although the staff was friendly and accommodating in every way, the condition of the property is not up to the standards of any other Marriott Courtyard I've experienced. The exterior reminded me of the older buildings found in Communist controlled countries in Eastern Germany. Very drab, dated and dirty. Not sure when the windows or general exterior had last been cleaned.The hotel staff was gracious in upgrading my room. I was disappointed to find worn, stained carpeting. Carpeting was pulling away from the wall. The bedroom was extremely small, without a television remote or a working clock. The bathroom was also very small, with a tiny (about the 2' x 2') shower with a flimsy shower curtain. There was a very small vanity which barley held the soaps and washcloths√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√®othing more√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√Ös a result, I was forced to dress and shave outside the bath to have enough room. The bathroom door had been kicked or badly nicked at the bottom with no attempt by the hotel to repair this. The upholstery in the room was dated and the curtains were in bad need of cleaning--when moved, they emitted significant amounts of dust and dirt. Although most Courtyard properties offer complimentary internet access service, this property charges for internet. There appears to be sporadic availability of T-mobile in the lobby for those with Hotspot access. I had difficulty with this and was told they were trying to enhance the service but many had similar problems.As mentioned in other reviews, the property is far from central Frankfurt, and on the weekends, required up to a 30 minute wait to catch a bus to the train station and another wait for a train taking nearly one hour to get into the city. Cabs can be had for ~10 Euro. I understand this was formerly a Ramada converted to a Marriott Courtyard. I was never given a clear answer as to whether the hotel had ever been refurbished since Marriott acquired it six (6) years ago. I was also concerned to see that the hotel prints a customer√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ full credit card number on their check out summary (invoice) along with the credit card√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ expiration date and card member√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ full address---a definite concern for those of us who work toward trying to avoid identify theft and misuse of our credit cards.All in all, I would recommend that if you enjoy Marriott properties, stay at the one in Central Frankfurt. A cheap ticket on the train to and from the airport is more than worth the complimentary shuttle provided by the hotel.
