{"text":"Nice but a bit sterile, with smaller rooms I stayed in the Tokyo Park Hotel at Shiodome (not to be confused with several other Park hotels) for 6 nights on business. As other reviews note, it can be difficult to find if arriving by cab (the roads are very complex and under construction) or by train (the train station\/office complex is huge). Best bet for arrival is by limousine bus from the airport.The entire hotel, from lobby to restaurants to guest rooms and bathrooms is beautiful and immaculately clean. It no doubt helps that the hotel is only 3 years old. The rooms are well designed and quiet, and have especially nice attention to amenities in the bathrooms. Beds were very comfortable and there is excellent attention to lighting control in the rooms.The location in the Shiodome area is very convenient for easy transportation to almost everything in Tokyo (or outside Tokyo, for that matter). The hotel connects directly to the Shiodome station for Toei (newer, private) subway line and the Yurikomome elevated train to Odaiba; and it is a 10 minute enclosed walk to the Shimbashi station for Tokyo Metro subway and JR station (Yamanote line as well as several other lines, e.g., to Kamakura). It's only a few minutes by train to Tokyo station for the bullet train. As others have mentioned, it's also about a 15 minute walk to Ginza, Tsukiji fish market, etc.The downside of the location is that taking a cab to the hotel is quite difficult. It's essential to pick up one of their map cards to show the driver. Also, the Shiodome complex is sterile -- full of office buildings and chain stores. Although the enclosed nature of it is convenient when hot or rainy, it can also be claustrophobic, like living in a shopping mall.You may be wondering: why is the hotel so much less expensive than other top hotels in Tokyo, especially since it is new and beautiful? I think there are two reasons: the rooms are relatively small for a luxury hotel, and the hotel provides relatively few services, compared to 5-star hotels. The regular rooms with king bed allow very little room apart from the bed. I stayed in an upgrade corner room which had a separate small sitting area, but it was still fairly crowded, even for just one person. It would be fine for two people, but would probably feel quite small if a child were added (and would be impossible for more than 3). On the other hand, you're likely not to spend a lot of time in the room anyway. One thing to remember, though, is that extra room is very nice when one or more family members suffers jet lag and wakes at 4:00am.As for services, there are many things the hotel does not have: a fitness center, a pool, business services (apart from a couple of computers), a variety of restaurants (only two), etc. Those things are probably of main concern to business travelers. For instance, I needed to make more business cards, which they could not do, unlike other hotels I've visited in Tokyo.Finally, the open atrium style architecture of the hotel (a 10-story high open central space) is dramatic and lovely, but it has a drawback -- one feels as if on display. Eating at the main breakfast area in the lobby, one sits at the bottom of the open area. All sounds are magnified by the echo chamber effect and the hard wooden floors. I felt like I should not talk (it echoes all over) and must walk quietly. When I dropped an umbrella, it resounded loudly throughout the restaurant area. (FWIW, a better place to sit for breakfast is in one of the side rooms, which also have views). So it definitely could feel awkward coming or going through the lobby with boisterous children.In short, is it a good deal? Absolutely. Is it a good location? Yes, very much, as long as you get out of the Shiodome complex. If traveling alone, I'd be happy to stay there again. However, it is not really fair (or the intention of the hotel) to be compared against five star hotels with complete range of services and spacious rooms.
