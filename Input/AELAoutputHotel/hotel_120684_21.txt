{"text":"Very Honest Staff My wife Marydoll , my mate Neil and his wife Michelle and myself flew from edinburgh(total flying time 22hrs) with a 1 night unexpected stop in new york to outrigger waikiki, being a day late in landing we were concerned about our reservations but we were met by a very nice and helpful girl at check in who quickly checked us in to our rooms both with sea views and king size beds and free wifi :) :)  The hotel in the very best location on Waikiki Beach with No resort fees something the The Sheraton Maui Resort  Spa might want to reconsider which was our 2nd stop but i will review that later! While we never used it Hawaiian airlines flight check-in available in the hotel lobby handy to save time rather than the self check in that most US airports now operate (cost saving will start over here soon !) Right now lets get down to the nitty gritty . Food and Drink while we never had anything we did not like most food was great but the state laws about Drink are quite laughable i am 42 right and never been asked for I.D in my life but if you want a beer and you are under 311yrs old take I.D with you where ever you go it did get funny when an old man say about 72 was asked for his I.D to get into a bar with his wife and got turned away because of no I.D (crazy eh?) Must do for food is the Top of Waikiki Revolving Restaurant with views of Diamond Head, sea views, mountain views Great food and Wine we spent our last night here and that was a shame because we would have defo gone twice ! I had left a wallet in our room $279 on checking out, and when my wife phoned form maui we were very surprised to hear that the maid had handed it in to the desk and that they would send it be FedEx to Las Vegas ($279 intact )or last stop for us ,a fantastic service and the Outrigger Waikiki must be commended for this TOP CLASS!!There are street entertainers outside the outrigger and they are good fun but be aware that there are a few ladies of the night infiltrated amongst them looking for business and are quite blazing about it even if you have kids, just so your warned!Pearl Harbour is a must see too, now dont go on any of the expensive tours some as much as $110 per person go youself as there is no charge at the gate not a well known fact !!!! Great place to stay, great food ,great views would go back 10 out of 10!!
