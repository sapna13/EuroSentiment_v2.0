{"text":"Great Family Bonding Time We had a GREAT time at Grand Bahia Principe. We left Toronto on Dec. 27\/07 and returned on Jan. 3\/08. We took our three kids, ages 25, 23 and 19 and our two son's girl friends. The resort was perfect for our group. The food was very good. Even in the buffets, I felt the selection and quality was very good and I like good food. The rooms were very nice and the grounds were beautiful. The beach was great and our kids loved playing volleyball with all the other guests. Our kids really enjoyed the disco too.If I was going back, I would stay at the Ambar, which is the newest part of the resort. It was not offered to us as it just opened three weeks before Christmas. We saw one of the rooms and it was nicer than ours and brand new. Also, if you stay at Ambar you can eat at all the restaurants in the resort. We found the staff very nice but it does help to know a little Spanish. The staff at the front desk are good but they don't always do what they say they will do, so you have to be patient.I would not go on the Country Adventure Trip. We booked it with Sunwing and we were told that it was great but we did not find it to be great and the food was not good at all and it made me sick. We did go on another tour that Sunwing recommended. It was the tour where we went snorkeling and swimming with the sharks, it was amazing and the food was great. Our kids went horseback riding on the beach and they loved that tour too.We have been to many all inclusive resorts and this one was one of the best. We would highly recommend it. I was worried about getting sick and I would have been fine if I had not eaten on the Country Adventure. We did take malaria pills and I was glad as there were bugs at night and we did get bitten. None of us had any reaction to the malaria pills. If you are thinking of going to this resort, rest assured that you will have a great time. ","annotations":[]}
