{"text":"Just Fantastic!! C'est Formidable!! To put this in perspective, my new husband, my son and my brother and girlfriend arrived in Hotel Bassano straight from a superior room in Disneyland Hotel. This little hotel therefore had a lot to live up to. And it did. And how! We were given an early check in to our suite. I'm not telling you the room number since I want to try as much as possible to ensure that it is available when we want to go back!Our suite had a bedroom, a sitting room with a fold out double sofa bed and a kitchenette with a fridge. Not a mini bar, although it served that purpose as well but a fridge. As a mother travelling with her son, this was the icing on the cake. I could wash bubba's bottles and store his milk and food hygienically which is more than I can say for the Disneyland Hotel. There was a huge bathroom and a separate toilet, clever people!Our bed was scattered with flower petals when we arrived. We ooh-ed and aah-ed over the rooms and went out. 5 minutes later saw us posing in front of the Arc de Triomphe following a leisurely stroll down Champs Elyssee. The location is perfect for sightseeing and aimless wandering around the heart of Paris. The staff are the best I have found anywhere. They cannot do enough for their guests. They all speak great English which is just as well as my schoolgirl French was a little embarrassing!To any future guests, be careful which hotel you book as there are two hotel Bassanos directly across from each other. Since I haven't stayed in the other one I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not going to comment on it but this review is about the 4 star one at 15 rue de Bassano. I could write about this hotel forever. In the same fortnight we had stayed in the Waldorf Astoria in New York and as mentioned, Disneyland Hotel and in a nutshell this hotel wipes the floor with both of them. Give yourself a present and stay here. It's now joined my list of 'Reasons to go to Paris'!I will post pictures later but can confirm that unlike other hotel websites, what you see on the hotel Bassano website is exactly what you get. And more..
