{"text":"Not worth the price I stayed at this resort November 13-16 for a fitness conference. The hotel was very busy during this time; I believe there was also a wedding there that weekend. The hotel was not prepared to handle this kind of traffic, apparently. First thing I noticed going into the elevator is that the elevator certificate was expired over three months ago. Not a comforting thought, but I didn't think too much about it. Then the room - the bathroom was old and truly outdated. The room smelled okay. Whatever, its just a place to sleep. We had asked for a fridge from the front desk. One never came, so we called down for one. No big deal. Then the tv didn't work, so we called down again and they sent a guy up. The second night I looked up while showering to notice black mold all over the ceiling of the bathroom. Also, ants were marching their way across the bathroom sink. We tried to call downstairs and the phone just rang and rang and rang. The hotel was getting overwhelmed by all the people. This was also evident by the disgusting state of all the conference and ballrooms. The pool and outside areas were beautiful. The gym was crappy and old. Didn't get a chance to experience the spa. Looked like it was under construction. While checking out I mentioned the mold\/ants and they offered me two free nights in a nicer room to make up for it. I didn't expect anything, so that was nice of them. Yeah, well, it would have been nice, except that the promised vouchers for the free nights were never sent to me! ","annotations":[]}
