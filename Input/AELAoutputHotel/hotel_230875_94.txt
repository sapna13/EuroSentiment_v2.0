{"text":"Perfect!! My husband and I have just (reluctantly) returned from Amsterdam. We had a fabulous time, mainly because the Radisson was excellent. It really is worth going for a bit of luxury in Amsterdam, as some of the lower starred hotels are a bit grim.Location: The hotel is a short walk from Central Station and Dam Square. The area itself is fairly quiet, but very convenient for all the major attractions. There is also a shuttle bus from the airport which costs 12 euros. We walked everywhere, as it was so convenient. There is a bus-boat service which stops at the main museums and sights. Tickets are valid for 24 hours and cost 17 euros. The last trip is at 21.00, which, if its dark by then, is a lovely trip.Check -in. This was the most efficient service I've ever experienced. No waiting in long queues, even though the hotel was very busy. We were upgraded to business class and given a free bottle of red wine, which was a lovely surprise. The staff are really friendly, efficient and attentive.The Room: We were given an upgrade to a Business room. My first impression was that the room was a little basic, but everything is hidden away very cleverly. The decor is modern wood, and each room has a subtle theme; ours was maritime.The rooms have an iron, ironing board, safe, dressing gowns, slippers, icebucket, mini-bar, wi-fi, broadband, and an excellent tea and coffee maker and hairdryer. The air conditioning was quiet and worked well. The rooms were spotlessly clean and well maintained.Dining: Breakfast in the main restaurant was excellent. There is a full selection of cooked breakfasts and chef can prepare an omlette. There is also a good selection of healthy options such as cererals, pastries. yoghurts etc. Freshly squeezed orange juice was always available. I highly recommend the restaurant for an evening meal. The service and food were exceptional and it was a real fine dining experience. They have a salad menu, healthy options and a la carte. Bread rolls are served with a selection of sun-dried tomato, olive oil, balsamic vinegar and lightly salted butter. The wine list was also excellent. Because of this, the restaurant is very popular, so it may be worth booking ahead. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel, we will definitely be returning.
