{"text":"Location, Location, Location My wife and I were going to the Yankee game on Sunday night, driving down from Ma. so I decided to find a hotel in the city for a 2 night stay (Sat.  Sun.). After viewing many locations on the computer I called the Westin at Times Square and inquired about a Government rate. I'm a Sheriff's Deputy and often inquire about a reduced rate in our travels. They indeed had that rate at $214 a night (vs. $279) so I chose the Westin having not been there before, but wanting a central location in the city. We couldn't have been more pleased! The staff was friendly, answered our questions, and upgraded our room to a corner over-looking Times Square. ( a smile and being polite has always worked for me). This location between 42nd  43rd St's was ideal. We taxi'd to Little Italy for dinner on Sat. night, ($15 w\/tip) but rode the Subway all day Sunday, even to the big ball yard in the Bronx on Sunday night. The hotel was clean, roomy, and quiet overall, with the occasional fire truck siren in the distance. I was impressed with the security, as when you enter the hotel from 43rd street, your met by a number of bell captains who ask for your room I.D. before they allow you to access the escalator to the lobby( after 11pm). Times Square (1\/2 block walk) and everything else the city has to offer is a short cab or train ride away. I recommend this hotel highly. ","annotations":[]}
