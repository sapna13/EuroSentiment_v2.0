{"text":"Dissappointing My husband and I were really looking forward to a nice, relaxing honeymoon and we were quite dissappointed. We reserved what was supposedly the best of the best of rooms- the excellence honeymoon suite, to ensure our relaxing vacation. Our room was overbooked the first night. That set the tone for the rest of the week. We were in a sub-par room for the first night (there was no point in unpacking and settling in) and spent most of the second day trying to figure out when we were going to move, where to, and making sure everything went with us. This wouldn't have been that awful, except that the resort wasn't to interested in rectifying the situation. They only wanted to offer us an $80 CREDIT to the logo shop (which we weren't purchasing anything from), any extra wines (which we didn't want to buy), or the spa (which we weren't using). The $80 was supposedly the difference between the two rooms. They also tried to say that they gave us extras on our package, but what they were offering was already in our package. A good part of the following week was spent stewing over this and arguing with the policy. After almost two months of back and forth with the travel agent, the decided to refund us $100 back on my credit card. After spending almost $4000 for the resort, I think a $100 refund is PATHETIC. On top of the room issue, the food was not very good. I keep reading these other reviews and wonder where they were eating that the food was so great. We were not impressed at all. The room service was good IF you tipped them the first time around. The electric was off and on randomly (which I have heard is often a problem in the islands), and twice our cold water went out. (Not really fun to be scalded if you're in the shower.) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":69,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":65}]}
