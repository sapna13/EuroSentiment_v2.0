{"text":"Absolutely the best!! Absolutely the BEST resort we've ever stayed at. The staff was very helpful from the second we got off the shuttle to the moment we got back on to leave. Everyone knew sufficient English to effectively help their guests.The food was out of this world. We ate at the buffet in the main lobby almost every night, with the exception of eating at El Gaucho one night and the Italian restaurant another. Booking was very easy. We didn't get sick once on the entire trip even though we ate everything in sight. My personal experience is that people who have everything to complain about will generally throw in some sickness with the vacation as I have never heard anyone who had a positive experience get sick.The room was amazing. Large bed, cute sitting area, large doors that were nice to open up and let the tropical breeze blow through the room. The rooms are all surrounded by gorgeous tropical vegetation which provides an extremely calming experience. Our room happened to be the furthest from the beach and it absolutely did not take, as previously mentioned, 10-15 minutes to get to the beach. We walked there in about 5 minutes flat each day, even less time if we did take the shuttle. We personally enjoyed walking as the resort offered so much to see that you could really take it all in with a nice walk. We came across a mini nature reserve of sorts in the middle of the resort one day which turned out to be a great surprise.The beach was pristine. Not too crowded and nice and quiet. We didn't have to deal with obnoxious drunken Spring-Breakers or screaming children. Enough chairs down by the beach for everyone.The casino was a great time and not overcrowded at all!! People always available to bring you drinks.Overall, I would rate this resort 6 out of 5 stars - our experience was THAT great. I would recommend this resort to anyone!!
