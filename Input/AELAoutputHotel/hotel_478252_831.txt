{"text":"You have to look pretty hard to complain!!! We stayed at the Bahia Principe from Jan 19 to 26th 2007.We have to agree that after reading so many reviews of this place, and having traveled to a large number of hotels in the carribean, there really isn't anything to complain about. This place is huge. But, it is a well-oiled machine. While we were there, it was to capacity, and that means (from what a worker told us) about 5000 guests. But, you really could not see it - the hotel covers so much land, its so well organized, and there are so many pools and beach - it really does not seem too crowded.I do have to say (because this was very difficult for me to get information on before I actually got there)--- something about the upgrades. We traveled from Canada, and got the Premier package. For us this meant that we were about as far back from the beach as you can get - they say this is a quieter part of the hotel, and we did have a large 'private' pool and a restaurant that was smaller and more 'personal' than the large main buffet restaurant. Anyway, I just thought that I would add that in because the way the travel supplier explained it, they figured it was closer to the beach. The Gold section is closest to the beach. The staff are trying their best, and are - unlike most places we have gone- are definately NOT moving at Carribean speed. These people hustle. They really are trying to please.It was a great experience overall. I could go on and on, but I just wanted to say that it was the cleanest hotel I have ever been to, and I never heard of anyone getting sick while I was there at all (which is always a bit of a concern for me, especially since I work as a scientist in the area of food microbiology). Keep in mind though, if you go there and eat 10lbs of fresh fruit - that will be a bit of a shock to your intestines (even though there are no bacteria involved)!!! Give yourself a chance to get used to the wonderful fresh fruits!!!Enjoy! ","annotations":[]}
