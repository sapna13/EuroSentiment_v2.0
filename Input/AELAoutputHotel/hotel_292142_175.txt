{"text":"Room with a view! Stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 5 days at the end of April 2008. I haunted the forums of trip advisor for months trying to choose the right hotel and I wasn't disappointed! It was hard decision choosing a hotel as we had a decent budget and we found that there wasn't allot in it price wise for the top rated hotels-except the Affinia it was the only one that offered a significant saving on the others which swayed us! We booked direct and they also offer non-refundable rates which offer even greater savings. We'd requested a room on a high floor with a view of the Chrysler building which we got. Wow what a view! Walking into the room and seeing that view is just something I'll never forget. The rooms are large and very comfortable. The bed was large and comfy and the kitchen was an added bonus having coffee making facilities. Although we never cooked in there the fridge was handy and the ability to have a quick slice of toast with your coffee first thing was also great! As others have said this hotel isn't opulent but it doesn't charge rates which reflect this either. To be honest it was as nice as the rooms in which we stayed at in 5* hotels in Las Vegas later in our trip. We have very little interaction with staff in general on our holidays unless we have a problem which we never did however all the staff from the doormen to the cleaners were friendly. the location of the hotel is quite residential with the barking dog next door which do breakfast lunch and dinner all at a good price and I found the quality good\/expectable for what you paid. There is a little market next door too where you can get milk, wine, etc if you like. There are a couple of dinners close by too and bars and restaurants close by if you don't want to stray far. There is a subway stop about 5 mins from the hotel and this was our preferred method of getting around the city. The ESB is about 10 minutes walk away and Flatiron another 5 mins away. To me the location wouldn't be important to me if I returned as everywhere is accessible and you're never going to be close to everything. The Times Square area would be the only area that I wouldn't be interested in staying in and around just not my scene. This is a great hotel, my favourite thing was the view and if I were to return to NY I'd certainly check the rates for the Affinia and stay again!
