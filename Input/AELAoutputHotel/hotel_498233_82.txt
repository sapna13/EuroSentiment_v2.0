{"text":"Great Choice! The reviews are correct. Its in a great location...about 10 minute walk to the French Quarter, the Aquarium, Harrahs, and about 20 minute walk to the Superdome. We stayed in a suite which was very clean and very big. We loved the 2 story ceilings in the master bedroom and living room. Our room faced Magazine st and wasnt noisy at all. The courtyard and pool are very small but its a nice quaint little area. The fitness room was also adequate as my wife and I did cardio each day. The breakfast is good and we even had scrambled eggs offered every morning along with the yummy waffles you can make. The staff was EXTREMELY helpful and friendly. Be sure to talk with the bartender at the hotel bar..His name is John and he'll tell you everything you need to know bout NOLA. Tell him Brian and Stephanie from Ohio say Hi !Mothers is right around the corner and Bon Tons is right next door..both delicious. Also went to Nolas and Mr Bs Bistro...EXCELLENT! Dont forget to go to Frenchman St (take a taxi) and enjoy the JAZZ. The locals we met were very nice and greatful we're there to help New Orleans economy. IMPORTANT! we kept hearing how the city was so crime ridden and dangerous. NEVER did my wife and I ever feel in danger. There were lots of police in the area (as there is in any large city) and whereever we walked we felt safe! Just dont go walking down the proverbial dark alleyWe are so glad we went down to watch the National Championship game. We never would have experienced NOLA otherwise and we will DEFINITELY go back and stay at the Country Inn and Suites ","annotations":[{"endOffset":403,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":399}]}
