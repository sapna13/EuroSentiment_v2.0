{"text":"in two minds about gresham memphis!!!!!!! Myself and my partner have just returned from a 3 night stay at the gresham memphis. We went on boxing day as a xmas present to each other, which was lush to get away after the stress of xmas. However when we got to Gresham after a 20 euro taxi ride from central station we felt it left a lot to be desired! We had booked the xmas special package which included entry into diamond factory, casino, a welcome drink and a bottle of champagnoise in the room - this was provided. However the manager who was on reception was quite blunt and rude with us because we wanted to pay cash for our stay up front. we had paid a small deposit by credit card wwhen booking on line and owed approx 200 euro, he then wanted another deposit and city tax totalling 290 euro!! I was not pleased - as a young couple on a budget money can be tight and we wernt willing to pay this deposit as we had not known in advance of it! The room was nice, clean and fresh.However the chambermaids came in once during our stay and only replaced items from the mini bar!! didnt replace tea, coffee, toilet roll etc! only things that we had to pay extortianate prices for where replaced!The hotel itself is in a bad location too far away from everything i was very dissapointed with this! 2 phonecalls home cost us 20 euro from the room! ridiculouswe were also booked in for a smoking room but we when we arrived found all the rooms to be non smoking! Personally i think this this hotel is not the best the location is poor, staff unfriendly and demanding, service poor, and most definatley everything in it is way over priced. would never return to this establishment again.
