{"text":"Beautiful Grounds and Beach My girlfriend and I didn't originally book this hotel, but the one we had booked was being refurbished so they 'upgraded' us. The hotel is very impressive to look at and is set in beautiful gardens and there is a beach which drops off the back which is just a nice. I found the hotel room was more than enough room for 2 people, although the bathroom was a tight squeeze! The rooms were extremely clean, as were the stair wells and balconies. I saw the odd fly\/mosquito whilst I was out there, and of course, ants around the drinks areas, but other than that, not one single spider or other insects.The food was simply 'ok'. It was nothing to crow over, however, was enough to satisfy your needs. Be careful that the food is heated throughout, as I did come unstuck with lasagne which was only 'warm' and gave me a funny tummy. I did enjoy the breakfasts though.Some staff were extremely rude, however, the majority were nothing short of perfect. The bar staff can normally understand basic English, so enough to order your drinks. My only major gripe with the whole holiday was the evening entertainment. Most of it in Spanish, which is fair enough as it's a Spanish speaking country, however, they didn't really cater for English speaking holidaymakers.I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. I found the atmosphere relaxing and fun too. I would recommend this hotel to couples who want to spend the week together and chill out. PS : We heard that June was wet season..... we had beautiful sunshine all week!
