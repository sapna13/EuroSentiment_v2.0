{"text":"Majestic vacation I won't repeat everything in previous reviews so I will give my highlights:Room:Arrived Dec 15. Check in was super fast, was brought right to the Elegance Club. I booked Elegance Club junior suite, got room 4136. Room was beautiful everything worked just fine. Some details looked rushed like marble cut but not finished, grout missing in certain spots, TV not mounted on wall, switches wired backward. But it all functioned OK so we didn't complain about anything. We did hear of this shower flooding issue in another room. Ours had a little lip in the tile to prevent this. We also used jacuzzi every day it was awesome. Maids always left fresh flower petals every day.Grounds:Everything was super clean and staff was working nonstop to keep it this way which we appreciated. A few things are not finished such asa couple fountains not having water in them yet, but minor stuff. Bali beds at pools were so nice to relax on. Club terrace bar was beautiful also don't miss it!Food:We thought food was average with exception of Japanese steakhouse. That was fantastic, lots of sushi to pick from and the hibatchi was tasty and entertaining. French restaurant sea bass dish was very good, but other courses were just OK, soup was very salty. Only 2 entree choices to pick from at this place which we thought was too little. Italian was good, we went for breakfast and lunch also. The buffets were typical buffets, lots to pick from so you can find things you like. They made fresh pitchers of fruit smoothies at Flavours buffet, great! Also the pineapple was so sweet I couldn't eat enough of it. We never got sick and we tried everything.Beach:Excellant like other reviewers posted.Elegance Club:The private lounge was very nice with free fast internet connection. They always had snacks, drinks and espresso machine too. Aromatherapy pillow menu was not available yet which we were disappointed in. We got 3 bottles of liquor (Baily, johnny walker black and vodka). Also had bottle of champagne waiting for us and a Majestic polo shirt and hat.Staff:Cannot say enough about the staff they were so friendly and accomodating. Everyone always had a smile and greeting for us. Service was very fast at restaurants which I'm not used to in caribbean. Plates were taken as soon as we were done, coffee and drinks refilled, etc... Its helpful to know a little Spanish if you have a question about something but you get used to it after a couple days. The animation team was fantastic and shows were decent every night.We went to the disco one night at Majestic Colonial and had a fun time. We walked way down the beach past Rui and found some local shops right on the beach. Prices here were way cheaper then at the resort. Would suggest going there and haggling with them, don't take first offer they give you.have a great time!!!
