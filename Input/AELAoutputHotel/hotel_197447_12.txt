{"text":"Praise for Grand Hotel Francais Myself and my boyfriend stayed at the Grand Hotel Francais last week (13th - 17th) and were very happy with our stay. After reading tripadvisor reviews we decided to book the hotel as we had got a good deal. We could not complain at all about anything in our room (61) everything was perfect from the decor to the air conditioning. The space available in the room was fantastic and the shower room, especially the shower with jets that was fantastic. We had 2 small balconies whcih the doors opened and as we were on the top floor we left them open. On holiday it is always a thought sometimes to come back to your hotel but not here we felt very relaxed in the room and enjoyed coming home to sleep. The service provided in the hotel was brilliant, the cleaners were very thorough in the rooms and the reception staff were brilliant - especially the young girl who gave us so much info regarding places to go and how to use the metro. We didnt have breakfast in the hotel but there are so many patisseries near by we just bought from them. We also ate in a recommended restaurant, Les Galopins, it was a fantastic meal, we thoroughly enjoyed it and wasn't too expensive. The metro service is easy once you get used to it and 2 stations were nearby rue de boulets (line 9 - took us to eiffel tower) and nation which has a lot of lines going through and also RER A which takes u to Disney (35mins). We mostly walked to the attractions as the weather was good, the walks are very enjoyable. One thing the hotel didn't have was tea and coffee facilities so we brought our own kettle as we like a cup of tea (Milk is available at near supermarket). We took a Taxi to the airport the day we left because we had an early flight cost approx 45 euros - make sure you are waitin for the taxi and not the other way round (On arriving at the airport we took the RER B to gare du nord then line 5 to oberkampf and then 9 to Rue de boulets).All in all our stay in France and at the Grand Hotel Francais was fantastic. thoroughly recommend it.
