{"text":"Mixed Feelings!!! I recently stayed at the Natura Park, it was an ok holiday. The hotel grounds were beautiful, the beach was nice, the pool was nice . The hotel staff were friendly service was good at the buffets , and pool side I did not have to wait for service, mai service was good room was clean, I tipped each day and no problems. There were small ants in the bath room sink area. We did have problems with A\/C for 3 days had to go twice to guest services to get someone to fix it also found that while A\/C was off a problem with mosquitoes !!!Lots of bites!!! We loved all the wildlife lots of birds this really made the resort special!!! The entertainment was ok loved the nites that the dancers came in toperform the costumes were beautiful took lots of pictures. The pool side entertainment was fun , enjoyed most days would like more modern music to listen to while at the pool and beach. One thing Inoted I travellled with my daughter and her friend , thishotel is not the best for young adults not much night life suited to this age group the girls made some good friends however but I think this hotel is not known for nite life sometimes they found it boreing , so they were disappionted Well I enjoyed our time there the food was hit and miss but we had our favorites the pasta at the poolside the ice cream .I had an omelete every morning ,Andrea is the best a smile and a song each morning she made my morning really!!! Tony at the snack Bar best server a really nice guy!!! I do have one concern as a mom I did not like that one day my daugther and her friend were invited off the resort by two staff members this made me upset, and I would watch young teenage girls as this is not a safe practice nothing happened but I didnt understand why they needed to go off the hotel beach area?Over all I enjoyed my holiday some small issues . I travelled with sunquest service was good, but one complaint we left T.O late sat got in early sunday so we did not use hotel services at all on Sat and then we had to check out early on Sat , had to leave our luggage out in the reception area,not secure!! I fet short changed would have been nice to keep our room until 5 pm especially since we did not get to use the room on the first day I will never travel with that time line again I felt short changed So beware when booking to aviod this!!!I hope this review is helpful I would return to this hotel ,but especilly if a got a good deal or sell off rate.
