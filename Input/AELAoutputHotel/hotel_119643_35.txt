{"text":"Excellent Family Choice We stayed four nights at Hotel Del Sol during a 10-day California trip with my wife and two daughters - ages 7 and 8. We booked in advance into one of the two room suites, which worked perfectly for us and was well worth the few extra dollars. The beds (even the pull-out!!) were very comfortable, and the DVD player was a nice surprise. Only issue we had was a lack of closet space and a very tiny bathroom- but we coped with both just fine. We enjoyed the continental breakfast every morning, and were pleasantly surprised by the variety and quality of the food - especially for a complimentary breakfast. My daughters made there way into the pool a couple of times despite the eary June chilly days.The location was OK, a very safe neighborhood that doesn't feel too crowded. However, it did take a bit of patience on occasion to get a taxi or to catch the bus. Best bet is to call down to the front desk 5-10 minutes before you want to leave and have them call you a cab and it should be there waiting when you get down. We ate in one of the restaurants in the area, which was recommended as a casual family place by the front desk, but we were unimpressed. There were several places very close by that I would have loved to try, but didn't look great for kids.The free, convenient parking was a big plus. Several commented about the overflow lot. This was not a problem at all as it was just across the street. Overall, we will gladly stay here again if we make another family trip to San Francisco.  - Spike and Family ","annotations":[{"endOffset":351,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":347}]}
