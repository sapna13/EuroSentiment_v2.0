{"text":"Great Hotel in a superb location stayed here with my husband on a last minute deal for a couple of nights - paid only √ä√£¬¢118 through hotelsclick for 2 nights BB.Hotel is in a great location for transport links throughout the city - it is a 2 minute walk from alexanderplatz train station from where you can get trains to just about anywere you want to go!!!Room we had was on the 27th floor and we had a super view of the tv tower and the alexanderplatz - one point to note the room was stifling hot even with the window open and no matter how hard we tried we found no means of cooling the room down using the air conditioning!!! another point to note is that some of the walls are quite thin in the hotel - we were lucky we had really quiet neighbours but we did hear people comment that they were kept awake by a rather vocal lady being pleasured by her companion for most of the night if you get my drift - not exactly what I want to hear while on a short break!!!the bathroom we didnt find too much of a problem - but then we are married i guess!!! ours offered quite a bit of privacy with frosted glass right to the roof of both cubicles so not too sure what the other rooms are like - - only comment i have to make is why do other hotel guests insist on slamming their room doors at all hours of the day and night - the doors of most hotel rooms are on self closing hinges so you dont need to slam them after you - show some respect for others who may have arrived on early fligths or leaving on early flights please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Breakfast was great with a huge selection of cereals, cold meats, fruit, breads, cooked items - you certainly will not go hungry - it kept us filled up for a good part of the day so if you can do try to get a deal with breakfast included - if not there are burger king, mcdonalds, dunkin donuts, subway and various others within 5 minutes walk so you wont starve!!!Good little restaurant and bar just as you leave the back entrance to the hotel onto alexanderplatz - it is a little pricey for drinks though - we paid almost 5 euro for a large beer and discovered that an equally quaint little bar in the train station ( i know it sounds crap but trust me all the locals drink there!!!) served the same beer for only √ä√£¬¢ euro - have a guess where we spent some time????anyway for me it was a nice city but i wouldnt go back again - i just dont enjoy trawling museums all day and thats anout all there is to do - i would highly reccommend the hotel for its location and the breakfast - we didn't have to wait to check in as described by many others on here - we had our room at 10.30 am so maybe we just got lucky!!!!anyway if you get a good deal then go and enjoy the beer - its fab!!
