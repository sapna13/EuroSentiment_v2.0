{"text":"ok if your on a budget My husband and I (we are in are early forties) just returned from LTI last week. We have been going to the Carribbean every year for the last 10 years and this was one of our least favorite vacations. Actually, it was the first time I was ready to come home.First of all, the food is not very good. The best place is the poolside bbq. Hold out for the chicken, pork chops and veggies they cook later in the afternoon, they are good. The hamburgers and hot dogs they cook at lunch are awful. We did not care for the buffets much. The pizza place is ok.I liked the beer, but the rest of the booze is poor quality. My husband did not find anything he liked to drink here (which is unusual for him) Also, they give you very small cups, bring an insulated mug if you want to go for a walk or get tired of walking up to the bartender so often.The beds and pillows are the most uncomfortable ever. Bring your own pillow if you can, trust me! The rooms are ok. Ours smelled very musty and I had to air out all of our luggage when I got home. Those were the bad things. On to the good. Beach, pool and grounds are very nice. Do the Carribbean Festival snorkeling trip. Lots of fun. We seen lots of fish and you get to snorkel with stingrays and sharks. Awesome! Saona Island trip was fun but we were stuck on a bus for three hours with no bathroom. They told us an hour and half, they were wrong.We got a very good deal on this trip and was worth the money we paid, but we definately learned a lesson. Next time we will spend more money for a nicer resort.
