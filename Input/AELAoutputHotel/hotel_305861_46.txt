{"text":"Very Good hotel in Causeway Bay area of Hong Kong I stayed at the Metropark for 4 days in May, 2008. We had booked a double room. I was traveling with my adult son and they did not have a room with twin beds when we checked in. They provided a roll away free of charge, however for the first 3 nights. We checked out for one night at Macau and were provided a twin room when we returned. Our room was an Executive Parlor room with a great view of the harbor and Victoria Park. The room was large, with a small sitting area. The staff was very helpful. They provided free internet access through computers at the executive level check in. Breakfast was a small but excellent buffet with terrific coffee at the executive level check in. You could also go to a restaurant. The room was attractively furnished. The room was quiet with little to no noise from other rooms. They have a complimentary happy hour in the evening. The bed was firm but comfortable. The bathroom was large and well designed with a separate shower and tub. There is a subway stop 2 blocks from the hotel, and it is on the same line with a stop connected to the airport express. We took the taxi to the city stop for the airport express because we had a couple of large bags and didn't want to lug them up the flight of stairs at the top of the subway station. There are many excellent restaurants one subway stop way from the hotel or a short walk if don't mind the excercise. The subway line also connects a few stops away to the line that goes to Kowloon. We enjoyed our stay at the hotel and would stay there again if we return. There is a small market at the end of the same block if need water or snacks and don't want to pay mini bar prices. There is also a 7-11. Restaurants in the immediate area, were not great, but you're only a few blocks from an area with lots of shopping and restaurants.
