{"text":"Exceptional!!! Even whilst we were there we were discussing what to write in our TripAdvisor review! We spent the first four nights of our 12 night honeymoon at the Uma Ubud, and never regretted it for a second! We arrived around 9pm, exhausted and delirious from an 18 hour journey from London via Singapore, to a very warm welcome. The first thing we noticed was the feeling of peace  calm, as it is set away from the main road into Ubud and once you reach reception you'd think there was nothing else for miles around. Check-in was quick, quiet and easy, and we were then shown to our garden villa (number 29 - recommended!) and were mightily impressed. Although not a large space, it was beautiful - light shades of distressed white wood, light oak and crisp white linen on a huge canopied bed. The bathroom was lovely with huge sunken bath, plenty big enough for two, and a semi-outdoors shower. Within 10 minutes of arriving we received a delivery of complimentary pink champagne on ice which was delicious and much-needed after the journey! As we arrived at night (the sun sets at 6.30pm all year in Bali) we had no idea what views awaited us from our veranda. When we woke the next morning we were awe-struck - we were on the edge of a valley of coconut palms and banana trees with a river rushing through it... so that's what the 'wildlife' noises had been through the night! (tip: if you are woken at night to what sounds like something loudly tapping on glass, don't worry it's actually just a frog in the nearby foliage!). The food in the restaurant is fabulous, very tasty and only slightly 'expensive' in relation to Bali restaurant prices (you can still have a 3 course meal and drinks for around √ä√£¬¢10 each) but is worth it at least once whilst you're there. Breakfast is a must, especially the mixed juices (smoothies but nicer). The pool bar has those great big mattress sofas to cuddle up on, the cocktails are wonderful, and the music is relaxing and funky. There are koi karp in the many ponds scattered throughout the grounds. The grounds are beautifully maintained by an army of gardeners, who were really the only people we saw during the stay! The place was full but we saw maybe 4 or 5 other couples during the whole stay! The main pool is lovely, but very cold! We didn't have any spa treatments as we felt they were overpriced in relation to what you could get in massage spas in town (can recommend Eve on Monkey Forest Road - a wonderful 30 minute massage was 50,000, just √ä√£¬¢4!). The yoga pavilion has the best views and we did do one of the complimentary 4pm yoga classes just for the experience - try it, it's worth it, even if you can't touch your toes!Through our guide Pusmara (from Asia Trails - recommended) we had a full day tour of east Bali including a temple, paddy fields (spectacular) and an active volcano and lake. It's worth taking a tour as Bali is more beautiful than words.After four days of alternately resting in Uma and touring we were ready to move to our 'real' resting place in Sanur for 8 more days, but that is not to say we didn't love everything about the Uma. It is a fantastic place, perfect for people who like us wanted to unwind from planning a wedding! We would go back tomorrow if we could afford another honeymoon!
