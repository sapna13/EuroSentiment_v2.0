{"text":"not bad i don't know is anyone know is hard to find the hotel in Paris. usually price is high then other country. Franch people really know how to make money from Traveler. anyway i stay here for 5 night, down side is there is no wireless is the room, only way conect internet is Loby or you buy the wireless card for start as 35 euro. i think that is stupid, this trip i travel in europe for 1 month. this hotel is the only one i stay is no internet connection in room. food is Paris is kind the high specially inside the hotel. i am travel along so did not eat breakfast inside the hotel, but been to other cafe place food is high then italy  Netherlands. if you bugect travel need watch out the money you spend on your daily meal. you can take air france shuttle from airport but if you bought round trip will cheap then if you buy sigle tickets, but i cannot believe hotel stuff did not tell me this when i am in paris. bus driver also will not tell you. and watch out the change when you shop or go out buy the food. i got 5 times they give me change with wrong amount of change back, so be sure take your time count the money first before you leave the store. sometime busy small restaurant or store will give you lots coins not the bill so you just did not think much and left but be careful sometime you just give them extra tip you even did not know.anyway so far everything is ok, but really hard to find the hotel or even good location in the average amount you paid for it. taht is how i feel from this trip in Paris, if anyone know let me know.....
