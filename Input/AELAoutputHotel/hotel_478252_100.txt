{"text":"July 20-27\/08 Not The Best Experience! Where do I begin.... I went on a girls vacation with my sister and our friend to relax and unwind. The ride from the airport was fine but finding the bus was rather confusing. I have never had to wait in line to find out what bus is taking me to the resort. A representative is always waiting with a huge sign to direct people, however this was not the case in Punta Cana. We checked into our hotel on the bus which I found very convenient. Everything was ready (wristbands, room keyes and towel cards) so you just had to off load from the bus and go straight to your room. We were unaware however that there was a Punta Cana side and a Bavaro side (no one explained that to us) as we were walking around in circles the first night looking for the main restaurant just to be told to go around the corner. Everyday we had to go to the front desk to have the three keyes reprogrammed as they would deactivate for some reason. We were told that if the key is next to anything electronic such as a camera or cell phone that the key would deactivate. Needless to say this was very annoying and a very uncomfortable experience.The service for the most part was NOT acceptable. The resort is beautiful but some of the workers were not friendly and at times very rude. We found that the Europeans were favoured and everyone else who paid their hard working money to come to the resort were pretty much ignored. We went to watch the House Band a couple of nights and found one of the waiters to be very rude. He didn't want to serve us and walked by us several times without asking us if we wanted something to drink. Apparently we looked to be Dominican and although we do not speak Spanish and the fact that we were wearing our yellow bands didn't seem to matter much.The food was good. There was variety however the menu could have used a shake up on a couple of nights. I did have the runs for a full day while down there. My sister had the runs on our last day on the resort. Thank God for pepto bismal and graval.Didn't like the fact that we had to check out of our room by 12pm and then had to hang out in the unbearably hot lobby for five hours. There were no hospitality suites in this five star hotel!Our housekeeper Isabel was very friendly, kept our room clean and smiled all the time! Eddy Perez our conquest tour operator from Hotelbeds was amazing and made us feel welcomed! He was very friendly, knowledgeable and easy to talk to as he did speak and understood English! I would not come back to this hotel because this is not a five star by any means. There needs to be more English speaking people on staff and I think that the staff need to be trained on what it means and takes to give excellant customer service.KWToronto ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1877,"mention":"shake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Milkshake"],"startOffset":1872},{"endOffset":1877,"mention":"shake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Milkshake"],"startOffset":1872}]}
