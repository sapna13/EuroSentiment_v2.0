{"text":"Can't wait to return! Would recomend this hotel to anyone, we stayed in the 4* golden tulip amsterdam art, the rooms were just about the best i have EVER stayed in and well worth the bit extra you pay. Totally spotless, tastfully decorated, modern, sexy, comfortable and well equipped. Staff all spoke excellent english, were VERY helpful with tips on buses to catch, places to go etc, we booked shuttle bus to return to airport but it didn't turn up, reception staff rang the company and arranged for a private car to be sent out to us so we would still make our flight. All done with a smile and at no extra cost. We paid 15 euros each for breakfast when we were there and the choice is amazing, crackers, meats, cooked breakfast, breads, croissants, various jams and spreads, cereals, fruits, yoghurts, the list was endless and you could eat as much as you liked so a good breakfast would set you up for the day! Had drinks i the bar each evening, again good service, we only stayed for two nights, took my hubby for his birthday present, he didn't want to leave!!! said it was the BEST prezzie i have EVER got him. Thanks to all on here who have posted other reviews, the useful info on bus services, directions to hitel etc were VERY helpful, so i advise anyone reading this to take the time to read through ALL the reviews coz there is some really good info on here which will come in VERY usefull during you trip. I know i have waffled on but i hope this is helpful, if you are going here, you are in for a lovely stay! We will most definately be back!
