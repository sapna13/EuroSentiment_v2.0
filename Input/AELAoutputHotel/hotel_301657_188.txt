{"text":"Fantastic place - would recommend to anyone not bothered by heights! Booked this hotel after reading reviews on this website  so glad we did - what a great place. We were on a 3 day stopover on the way to Oz with our 2 toddlers. Hotel lobby on the 25th floor of the Shiodomemedia tower in the Ginza district of the city. Booked a superior room size was more than enough even with 2 cots, despite endless reviewsmentioning shoe boxed sized rooms. Also despite various reviewers having difficulty finding the place, we had no problem at all. We arrived at the airport too early for a limousine bus direct to the hotel so we got one to Tokyo station and then a short taxi ride to the hotel. I did give the taxi driver the map provided by the hotel website which is in english and japanese. Staff were very courteous and efficient. The views from the hotel lobby are amazing  we also had a fantastic review from our room on the 30th floor. There were lots of lovely toiletries and yes the biddet stye loo was an experience in itself! The local area does take some navigating  getting used to especiallyas there are lots of levels, i.e, underground trains, street level traffic, elevated pedestrian walkways. There is a 24hrs supermarket in the basement, easy to find,  the cafe on the 3rd floor of the tower is good for a quick bite. Lots of eateries in nearby towers  in the underground malls, best thing is just to explore  you will find.We visited Ueno park  saw lovely cherry blossom, easy to get there, public transport very efficient. A real gem of a find was a lovely garden about 10mins away from the hotel, begins with 'h....something rekki  can't remember name but lovely - reception will know it  a definite must for some peace  tranquility in such a busy place. Overall loved tokyo, loved the hotel, would DEFINITELY return. ","annotations":[]}
