{"text":"Great hotel We wound up here after picking a bad hotel and having to change. Could not have made a better choice!1. Location - We did not want to be on a noisy street, but wanted to be near shops, etc. This hotel is in a perfect location - it is at the north end of the Ramblas, but on a one-way side street. We had a room overlooking the street (with doors that opened onto a balcony) and never had any trouble with noise. 2. The room - Comfortable and super clean. Bathroom was modern and had big, fluffy, over-sized towels. A\/C worked well and the TV had more than one station in English! Hurrah! It was still all news, but at least we didn't have to watch only Sky News all day. Lots of closet and hanging space, mini-bar and safe.3. Internet - Might not be a big deal to everyone, but to us this was important. WiFi worked perfectly and was free. Also, there is a business center in the lobby - if I remember correctly there were 3 computers, each with printers - also free.4. Staff - Very nice and helpful. Our phone wasn't working (we never would have know this since we didn't use it) but on our last night we asked for a wake-up call at 4:15am in order to leave for the airport at 5am. They actually came up to the room and knocked on the door to make sure we were up since the phone wouldnt work!There is also a nice bar in the lobby - we did not have a chance to check it out though.All in all, we had a great stay here and would go back!
