{"text":"Beach and food: GREAT Hotel: GOOD Room: VERY BAD This was my third stay at a RIU resort, so I am a RIU fan; however, this was my first negative experience. Let me start with the positives: Overall the resort was nice. The food was good and plentiful, the beach and grounds were beautiful and well-kept. The staff were friendly and helpful. Caribbean Street and the option to go to the other resorts added some variety that was nice. It was a little difficult to get reservations at the specialty restaurants, but The Carib Grille on the beach was worth it.Now for the negative part: The rooms (and I do mean rooms - we changed rooms twice and viewed half a dozen others) were not comfortable. The main problem was the A\/C - it wasn't working for most of the week. Our first room was easily 85 degrees plus and the ceiling fan didn't work, so there wasn't even moving air. It was miserable. We contacted the front desk and they were helpful and friendly and showed us several other rooms. Most were no better, but we finally found a room that had a working ceiling fan so that brought some relief and cooled the room to about 80 degrees. In many of the rooms we viewed, there were refrigerators that weren't working, broken telephones, celing fans that barely worked, etc. I did notice that the moldy smell that many reviewers have mentioned was worse in some rooms than others, but it wasn't too bad in our last room. There were small annoyances: the remote control didn't work, the TV in our room only received a few channels (and only one English channel), but we were not on vacation to watch TV anyway. The showers are very narrow, so the shower curtain rubs against you when you are in the shower. Prior to our trip, I read another review that mentioned the shower curtain and I thought how petty, but it really is annoying and gross. We just left the shower curtain open and put a towel on the floor to sop up all of the water and it was not an issue anymore.Regarding the A\/C, the staff said that they were having problems in the entire resort (meaning the Palace Macao and the other RIU hotels as well) and that they were working on it. But we spoke with several other guests and while most were complaining about the A\/C, some said that their A\/C was working, so I am not sure what the deal was. But they were definitely having A\/C issues in other parts of the resort as well. Several nights the dining room was uncomfortably warm. And the casino was UNBEARABLY hot. When you see the Domicans sweating profusely, you know it is hot!! They brought out a fan for us at the poker table and that helped.About poker in the casino: They have one table where you can play Texas Hold 'Em, so that was good. They let locals come to the casino to play, which I found odd. I guess the locals think they are coming there to fleece the tourists (and let's face it, most tourists are not very good players), but the locals aren't very good either. If you are a decent player, you can make some money at the poker table. There is one older, local guy named Eli who was there most every night and he is a pretty good player. But other than that it was pretty easy money. So before I would go back to this resort, I would confirm that they have the A\/C issues resolved and get some assurance\/guarantee that my room will cool to at least 70 degrees. I can deal with most issues without complaining, but let's face it: when there is no place in the resort to go to cool off, it can be pretty miserable. During the day, when you can get in the pool or the ocean to cool off, it is not a big deal. But in the afternoon and evening not being able to find an air conditioned area was a real problem for me.Overall, it was a good trip and I have no complaints about the food or service. And I can't say enough about the beach and the grounds - absolutely beautiful. The public areas of the Macao are still fairly nice and well-kept, but the rooms are really starting to show their age (a\/c, furniture, beds, etc.). I would say it is time for RIU to either renovate the rooms or downgrade this hotel to a club level. It certainly isn't as nice as other RIU Palaces I have stayed at.
