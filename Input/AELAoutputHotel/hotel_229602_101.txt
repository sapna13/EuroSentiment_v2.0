{"text":"Really Perfect at this price The Hotel Relais Bosquet is in a great location if you want to stay in a more local setting. Plenty of local resonable restauants (some quite good) and a great local food market right outside the door complete with one of the most famous cheese stores in Paris right across the street, called Ann Cantin (amazing) and Lenotre pastry around the corner.We had a superior room which was very nice. Comfortable bed, nice bathroom with double sink and seperate toilet. The room has a safe and a refrigerator which comes in handy being so close to the market. Also, you are less than two short blocks from metro and great location to walk to the Eiffel Tower.The staff was exceedingly helpful during day and Frederica is a standout for help. That said two comments on the slightly negative side. First, if you are a sophisticated eater and want advice on where to eat amazing French food I suggest you do your research and have the hotel make reservations. They are not very knowledgeable about food. Second, the hotel rate does not include breakfast which is an additional 13 euros per person (common in France). While I was there I found that if you mention Rick Steves and his travel books at the time of booking, breakfast is included, so this is a great tip and savings.We have booked again at the hotel for our next trip in 6 months and look forward to this reasonable hotel in crazy, expensive Paris.
