{"text":"AS GOOD AS IT GETS AT MARRIOTT This is a typical high rise Marriott, reasonably new, very clean and well kept, in the Miami suburb near several large malls, including Dadeland Mall. The hotel is quite a long way from both the airport and downtown Miami or the beach, so if you consider this as an airport overnight, be aware that it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a double digit cab ride from MIA. If you are thinking beach, look for a hotel on Miami Beach, or South Beach, but this one is no where near any beach.The hotel adjoins the terminal stop of the Miami Metrorail, which is a reliable elevated rail that services communities along the SW Dade area, including Coral Gables, the University of Miami, and Coconut Grove. This is a cheap way to get around and adult fares at present (8\/07) are $1.50.A lot of new construction in the area is bringing in new restaurants and small businesses, so it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a high growth area, but seems safe to walk at night to and from the hotel and the mall. A Publix supermarket is next door as well. Check in was outstanding√à√\u2020\u2022?.the fastest and most efficient I think I have ever seen. No waiting, no delay. They had my reservation and I was on the way to my room in less than five minutes after coming in the door. I booked through Marriott's telephone reservation service and still find this more efficient than going on line because the operators can tell me a lot more than the web site will. The room I had was not on the concierge floor, but on 21, two floors below, with concierge access. This was fine and seemed less noisy than the 22 and 23 floors, which had direct access to the concierge lounge on 23. As a personal observation, I would like to see Marriott restrict concierge access to people over 18, (after all, they are serving\/selling alcohol), as this is one of many concierge lounges I have visited where the kids more or less take over the place as a TV and food area, making it very hard to do any business work or just relax. I find it interesting that Marriott places no restrictions on children, but prohibits pets. Room layout was super, with a well appointed king. The large, wall mounted, flat screen TV was the first I have found in a hotel room. A direct internet connection terminal on the work desk had wireless keyboard and flat panel screen√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√πhen it worked. Direct, plug in internet access, if you have your own laptop, was a flat $10 a day, noon to noon. I did not use that option because the desktop worked for most of the three days I was there. Dressing area with a cotton robe and plenty of toiletries and clean, heavy towels, plus a toilet\/shower room were well kept and clean. Another nice amenity was an espresso machine on the dresser that allows you to make one or more cups of pretty good coffee as you want it. There was a conventional coffee maker in the cabinet as well. I did not use any food services, but the lobby lounge was large and seemed to be doing a good, lively business. Overnight parking is $17. Valet service was courteous and efficient. This was off-season and the single room rate was slightly under $200, which makes it a bargain these days for this level of comfort, safety and facilities. On my personal Hotel Perfection Scale, I would rate this one at this time at 98% or slightly higher as I had no problems with anything during my stay.
