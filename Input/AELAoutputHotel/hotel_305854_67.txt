{"text":"Okay hotel... but not for an extended trip Stayed in this hotel for three weeks while on business. The rooms are extremely small, I felt really claustrophobic while in them. I could literally touch the television and desk with my toes while lying on the bed. There also seemed to be a lot of dust in the room and there was this weird smell in the closets. It smelled almost as if someone left their stinky shoes in there and it never aired out. Well, I had to put up with this smell for three weeks. I did everything possible to get rid of it√à√\u2020\u2022?I bought incenses, room deodorizers but it would only mask the smell. Anyway, in addition to that the room didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ come equipped with an iron which I thought was extremely odd. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° have to call housekeeping to deliver an iron and board to your room only for them to whisk it away in the morning once they cleaned. Additionally, some nights I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° get a turndown service and others I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. Where√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ the consistency? I rather you either provide me a turndown service every night or none at all (hey, you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ miss what you never had). Oh also, there was a weird drip coming from the ceiling in the shower. At first I thought it was perhaps condensation from the steam while I showered until I noticed that the drip continued hours after I had showered. Perhaps I just started to become a bit nit-picky since I stayed so long, but by the end of the third week I was ready to get out of there! All in all, this hotel is sufficient for a short weekend trip. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ in a decent location and they provide a shuttle service that takes you to the city center which was extremely convenient. But if you plan to have an extended stay I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° recommend trying a different hotel from a comfort standpoint.
