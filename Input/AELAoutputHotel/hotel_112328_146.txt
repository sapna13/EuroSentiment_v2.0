{"text":"Loved the Clift I stayed at the Clift for the first time this past week for a business trip. The staff was fabulous -- everyone was friendly, helpful and very polished. In recent stays at some of the travel industry giants, the professionalism of the front desk staff, doormen, bellhops, etc. was quite poor, so this was very refreshing -- to use an analogy, it's akin to the marked the difference between the people behind the fast food counter at the airport and the people behind the desk in the Admiral's Club. The bar and restaurant are very nice, and they close the bar to external visitors on Wed nights, making it exclusive for hotel guests and their guests. This was nice, seeing as the prior three nights the bar had been packed -- while the scene was great those nights, it was nice to have it a bit more mellow too. The housekeeping was excellent -- my room was impeccable each time I returned. The doormen were great too -- as I was leaving the hotel, I realized I couldn't find my cellphone. Before I could even ask, one of them asked me what my phone number was so that they could help me find it. After I got home, I realized I'd forgotten to grab the copy of two fed ex airbills that I'd left with the concierge -- I called and he immediately offered to hunt down the info. He called back two minutes later with the tracking numbers and other info I needed. It was a refreshing change from the 20 min I usually spend on hold with customer service. It's the little courtesies like this that differentiate the great from the mediocre in my mind.. It's by far the most enjoyable business travel experience I've had this year. You can tell that this team takes a lot of pride in their work and really enjoys what they do for a living. I'd definitely stay there again the next time I'm in SF.
