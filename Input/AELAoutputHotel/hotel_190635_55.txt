{"text":"Arts for Arts sake!! Difficult to start the review for this particular hotel. The arrival and greeting on formal name terms is endearing and the friendliness of staff genuine almost relaxing after a long journey. Reception is a dream area with the abundance of fresh flora and fauna. I stayed in room 1414 with sea and city views. It was pretty noisy being next to a casino and lots of sirens from police and ambulances all night. The room though was just a perfect size and one of the most comfortable I have stayed in. Bang Olufson sounds and TV were superb and bathrooms divine. Now the downside of the place. The mini-bar prices are totally outrageous and the most expensive I have ever seen. A beautiful coffee machine was there, work of art but users beware that each and every tiny sachet you use is 4 Euros, each small bottle of water is 5 Euros and each can of Coke 7 Euros, totally outrageous on the VERY expensive rates they charge for the room. Breakfast runs at 30 Euros per person and BEWARE they have IVA (VAT) on everything! So if you want luxury it comes at a cost and this place costs., believe me! At the rate they charge free bottled water and free tea\/coffee would be small change for the hotel. The Six Senses Spa on the top floors again is a 40 Euro entrance and includes no extra treatments. The booklet they leave in your room has no price list which begs to make one think if you need to know the price its too expensive for you? To eat in the hotel or use the bar well be ready for really high prices, but fantastic presentation. The area around the hotel has pleanty of excellent local restaurants and bars with great atmosphere, The Agua restaurant was fantastic food and ambiance. Barcelona is a great place and really upcoming. They profess that the Rolling Stones stayed here. Might be nice to see a TA Report from Mick or Keith ..??? To me though the Arts hotel is more business like than leisure but who knows I may return, never say never! Happy travels!
