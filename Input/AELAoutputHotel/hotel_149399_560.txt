{"text":"Great For Relaxation This hotel is very large and beautiful. We decided to do the Royal Service and very pleased that we did. The hotel room was great and large, with comfortable beds and pillow service. The Royal Service Restaurante (Gabi Club) and pool as well as the private beach were really convenient. The beach was beautiful. Nice sandy beaches to walk on. The water was a little rough the first few days we were there, but eventually settled down and we were able to go in. The seaweed is not horrible and is mainly on the shoreline. It is still very hot there this time of year, so take light and comfortable clothing. Also, take the following:1. Bug Spray: I was attacked by mosquitoes at night, while walking or eating dinner.2. Lots of $1 bills or $5 bills for tipping. We tipped generously to the waiters\/waitresses, as well as the maids. One waiter recognized us daily in the Gabi restaurant and had the hostess seat us at his table daily for breakfast and lunch. The only thing is, I felt like he knew he was going to get a tip regardless and instead of the service getting better, it started to go down. After 2 or 3 days of consistent tipping to this one guy, he just quit refilling the water, coffee, juice, etc. I also felt that many of the butlers and servers do not feel compelled to do things for you unless you are willing to tip them. Service went down for us as the days progressed.3. A Spanish guide book to help with phrases. Do not go down there expecting them to know English. They all know a little, and remember, we are going to their country! Know a few phrases and you will get by.Do not bother with the casino! It has about 30 .25 cent slots that are so old and three poker tables. Not worth spending your $ there. The Spa:My husband and I both got massages which were the best I have ever had. Definitely worth it. Now, the bad. Ladies, DO NOT get the pedicures. I got a Spa Pedicure ($40 US) the day before we left. They do not have the equipment to do the pedicures. They soaked my feet in one of those home foot spas for about 3 minutes. Then, she rubbed some apricot scrub stuff on them, rinsed them in the home foot spa, and then dunked them in paraffin. The parrafin was very hot and I instintively pulled my foot up for a second to let it cool and she pushed my knee down so my foot went back in. Then, she took off the paraffin, put one coat of polish, did the other foot, put my flip flops on (my toes were still wet) and sent me on my way. When I walked out of the room, her and her two coworkers were laughing and carrying on. They were all very rude. Definitely not worth the money. She did not trim the nails, take off the dead skin, nothing....If you are looking for a place for relaxation, this is your place. If you are looking for a place with a lot to do, not the place for you. The evening shows are mediocre. Not a whole lot of entertainment. The food was OK. Dominican rest. was great. The Chinese rest. made me sick.
