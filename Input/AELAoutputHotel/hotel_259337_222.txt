{"text":"Strongly recomended We stayed at GP Bavaro Resort and Spa Sept 3rd-9th. The forecast had said scattered showers for the entire trip, but it is deceitful, because it only rains breifly and strongly for a short streak in the middle of the night. The weather was perfect all week long.All of our booking was done through Expedia. Upon our arrival we were a bit worried about finding our way to transportation, but it is effortless, there are luggage carriers that immediately put you in the right direction. It is about a 30 minute trip to the resort and cost us $30 for the both of us. Once you arrive you check in (check-in is at 3pm). They give you a map of the hotel, activities itinerary, and guest information. From there it is up to you to plan your trip.We purchased additional activities through expedia (the aquatic tour, and the outback safari). They were both worth doing. It is nice to have a little variety outside the resort. We thought the outback safari would have more walking involved, but you barely walk. The whole tour is on a truck\/jeep, and basically takes you through the small towns to give you an idea of Dominican lifestyles. It is concluded with a little boogieboarding at a secluded beach that was very beautiful.At the resort, there is plenty to do. Especially if you are active and enjoy the outdoors. All of the facilities are clean and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I will just list everything with a comment.Bedrooms: We had a standard room, it was very clean, neat, I would give it just as high of a raiting as a Fairfeild Inn or a Courtyard by Marriott.Buffet: Delicious! Tons of food, good variety, we ate at La Catedral most of the time. Every night has a different theme (American, Mexican, Italian, Oriental, Spanish...) If we woke up late and didn't make breakfast, we would get an A la Cart sandwich or salad at La Uva, or just wait until Arrecife opened for lunch Buffet. We didn't have any stomach problems, but I would take sometimg just in case. Our stomachs just arent used to all that seafood and fruit.Sport Center: It is pretty neat. They have basketball, soccer, badminton,paddleball, tennis, ping pong,etc. The mini golf is not like it is here though. It is a little rustic. The Beach: Paradise! The water is clean, warm, you couldn't ask for much more.The Pool: The pools are just fine, not fantastic, but not bad either. If you would like to get your hair braided, here is where you can do that. It cost from 50-80 dollars, depending on how long your hair is, and takes a couple of hours. The Bars: All are fine, there is one in the middle of the front of the resort that is really nice and sort of private. The bartender is Julio Cesar (he goes by Master One) he is super nice and treats you extremely well.Tipping: Tipping is not necessary, however, do remember that these people work 11 days straight, and then get 3 days off to visit their families in their hometowns. They make about 200 dollars a month. So if they give you supurb service, I'm sure a tip would be greatly appreciated.ATMs: There are no atms on the resort, yes you can take out money at the casino with a 7 dollar service charge, but they will make you play a hand before you can cash it in. The stores only accept credit for purchases greater than 40 dollars.The Shows: They are every night at 10pm, and are entertaining, but not like anything off broadway. Everynight has a different show, and its theme is posted on the event calendar in the main lobby around the corner from the front desk.Massage: Both of our massages were great! (approx. $65 each)Suggestions: Bring lots of suncreen, maybe smashball, or a frisbee to throw around at the beach. Ready Cash. If you don't speak spanish, maybe a spanish phrase book. Most of the guests are Spaniards, and the staff is a bit limited in their English skills. But they are friendly and try their best to communicate.Anything you may forget: medicine, repellent, swimsuit, sun screen, etc. can be purchased at the supermarket. But dont expect a CVS or Vons, they are more like minimarts.Have a great trip, we very much recomend this resort for a carefree vacation.
