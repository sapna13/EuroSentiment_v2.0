{"text":"Amazing, Relaxing Vacation I had an absoultely wonderful time when I went to the Riu Palace Macao! I would really recommend it to everyone! The hotel is beautiful and has everything that you would need! AIRPORT: Getting there was fine, but leaving another story! Took longer to get to the airport because of the traffic. They made us wait in the bus for almost 30 mins, so that the bus driver's baggage carrier friends could take our stuff to the departure desk which was only a 1 minute walk away! People on the bus got pissed and demanded to get off. You are expected to tip well if they take your bags. They are very determined to carry your bag.ROOM: The room was very good. Had a small fridge with water and pop. There was a drink dispenser in the wall, tv, small hair dryer, A\/C (worked well). There were two huge beds put together and two arm chairs and a table. My boyfriend ordered room service every night. They had a small but good menu. I think food could be ordered until 11. Large closet and safe. Don't leave money out as the maid will take it for tip. LOL I recommend small tips each day, as the people that work at the resort alternate shifts.MEDICAL FACILITY: There is a doctor and pharmacy at the Caribbean Street. The Pharmacist didn't speak very good english, but still gave me the correct prescription. POOL: The pool is nice as well, but I preferred the Riu Bamboo pool because it was more lively and had a swim up bar and waterfall. You can always visit the other hotels pools. But the Riu Macao had a nice hot tub. It was hidden inside trees like a canopy. The water really wasn't warm though. The only thing I didn't like was that you couldn't swim at night. FOOD: The food was excellent. They had special meal nights and also different events going on everyday. They also had four restaurants for dinner. You must make reservations early (for the specialty restaurants) and I think you can book a few days in advance. The buffet is always available. The grill closest to the pool got really hot at dinner time because of the temperature and cooking inside. My boyfriend felt too hot also b\/c he had to wear pants. The drinks are good. They had a lot of variety. THINGS TO DO: Make sure to visit Caribbean Street and if you walk towards Riu Naiboa, there are some shops there that you can get some really great deals. It's a little sketchy. I found the resort to be nice and comfortable. Riu Palace Punta Cana was worth taking a look at, but was so fancy I felt I needed to dress up if I stayed there. I went to the Animal Adventure Park. Make sure you ask the events planner. They never mentioned anything about it during the excursions lecture. They had a booth at Riu Bamboo. Was worth going as you could swim with the sea lions, play with monkeys, watch a bird show, swim with nurse sharks, pet a baby lion, star fish and sea cucumbers. The drive to get there takes about 1 hour and was really bumpy. The facility was nice. They take your picture at the various places and you have the option to pay for the expensive pics. Bring your camera! Some extra fees to swim with sea lions and nurse sharks as well. Some other people I have talked to recommended the catamaran trip to this island near by. Perhaps look into that. BEACH: The beach is wonderful! Nice white sand and clear water! Excellent! Much better than Puerto Plata. PRICE: I booked my trip around One and a half to two months prior and the trip was $1100 CAD pp with tax and ins. So I thought a fairly decent price. I am looking forward to going to Riu Place Arruba. I would like to stay at the other Riu resorts.
