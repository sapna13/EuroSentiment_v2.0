{"text":"Nice, but nothing special... I stayed two nights at hotel V. They tried to make it as a boutique hotel, but I can say that I stayed in much better three\/four star boutiqe hotels in the world. There's nothing wrong with the hotel, but actually there is nothing special.PRICE: I payed 75 euros\/night for small single room. Ok price.ROOM: It was small (expeted, as I payed for small one), with balcony (poor view), nice bed but small and average bathroom.LOCATION: It's good for short stay, as you need only 5-10 minutes by tram to train station (RAI) and than 10-15 minutes to airport. But, it's not in the centre and you need 15-20 minutes by tram to the center. Nothing special in the neighbourhood, few average restaurants and the market. I heard famous vienna massage bordel is nearby.INTERNET: Free fast wireless is a big plus for this hotel. You get a password on the front desk. There is also satelite tv with the pay per view option (you need to buy an extra package with remote for a cheap price)HOTEL INTERIER: Very difficult steps to reach the floors (no elevator). Hard for people with many luggage. It's like in some old building where you have to battle with all those sharp steps.Front desk loby is nicely decorated, but that's all.BREAKFAST: Included in price. Again, nothing special, I've seen better. Some cheese, butter, ham, marmelade, crispy, milk, juice and coffee or tea.OVERALL: I am not impress, but for that price in Amsterdam you really don't need to be impressed with hotel like this. Sometimes you have to be satisfied with an average accomodation, because there are many worse hotels in this city for this price.
