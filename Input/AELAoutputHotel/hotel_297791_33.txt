{"text":"Would never consider staying at the Coqui Inn again This year I booked three rooms at the Coqui Inn for a one-night stay prior to a cruise leaving from Puerto Rico. The rooms were for my wife and myself, my daughter, her husband, their two small children and my mother-in-law, and my brother. For such a one-night stay I just wanted something basic, clean, economical and comfortable. We selected the Coqui based on the reviews I read on this web site, and the 3 out of 5 average it received. I think this is a point or two higher than it should be.Our impression was the general lack of upkeep and cleanliness. The rooms were nothing like anything you would consider modern (think Best Western, Red Roof Inn or Holiday Inn). We were very reticent to put our bare feet on the floors. We had a kitchenette in our room that we wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even think of using. We were very disappointed with the overall appearance and condition of the Coqui.There was a dead roach or something on the bathroom floor, and a few insects flying around in the room. We awakened in the morning with some mosquito bites.The handicapped-accessible room my wife required was not available even though we made prior arrangements for it. We were told the party who previously occupied it decided to stay an extra night. I was not in a position to find another hotel so I had to physically carry my wife in and out of the bathroom.Our room did not have a doorknob √à√\u2020\u2022?I had to do a trick with the key in the look to pull the door closed from the outside. There was also another door in our room that led to an outside walkway. This door did not have a deadbolt lock, which made us feel rather unsafe.My brother√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room was like a closet. It was slightly wider than the width of his bed.The sheets in our room did seem clean and the bed was comfortable. There was a TV and AC, both of which worked OK.The Coqui Inn is a short half-block from a major busy highway and its noise. But it is very convenient to both the airport and the cruise ships port by taxi, being located somewhat between both.We only saw one restaurant within walking distance √à√\u2020\u2022?the Nikko √à√\u2020\u2022?but they have excellent Asian food, service and ambiance. The pool area at the Coqui is very nice, and there are two computers in the lobby with free Internet access. Snacks and drinks are conveniently available in the lobby. The staff was friendly and they lock the front entrance at night.But we would never consider staying at the Coqui Inn again. And we would not recommend it even for an overnight stay for someone expecting at least the quality of a basic US hotel-motel chain. ","annotations":[]}
