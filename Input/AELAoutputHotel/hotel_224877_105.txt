{"text":"Loved this hotel I disagree with some of the reviews i have read on tripadvisor re this hotel. we stayed one night at the loew's hotel miami beach where we have stayed many times and then moved to this hotel for 2 nights. what a huge difference! the mandarin blows loew's away...and we will be staying at the mandarin in the future.From the time you walk in the door, this hotel makes you feel welcome. the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy and comfortable. there were always two doormen opening the lobby doors and my car door, offering bottled water for my drive; the front desk walked us to the elevators; the room attendants were dressed nicely and left special touches in the room and the room was very clean - my husband and i took a bath both nights (we never do that); the bath towels are luxurious; the room size and the bathroom size are larger than most; the bed is very comfortable; the hotel is very generous with room amenities; the food at cafe sambal was delicious (azul was closed for renovations). Yes the pool is small but the last thing i want to do at a hotel is sit around a pool with a lot of people. the beach was magnificent. I suppose the thing that stood out most to me was the friendliness of the staff; if they weren't genuine, they certainly fooled me and my mate. i loved every aspect of this hotel and i will definitely be back, especially to go to the spa. the spa looks unbelievable and unfortunately, we were on business and did not have the time.
