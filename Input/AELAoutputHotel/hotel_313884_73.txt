{"text":"Great choice for adults-only Resort:The resort was very beautiful and well-maintained. It was laid out very nicely and not a far walk from anywhere. We stayed in Building 5 which is closet to the beach and looks out to the pool. If you like to nap in the room it can get a little noisy around the pool at 3 when the activities group plays games, but we were mostly at the beach so it didnt matter. We went the 1st week of May and the weather was absolutely perfect-it rained for 15 minutes total the first 2 days and that was it.Rooms:We had a platinum suite which i don't think is much different from the other rooms except you have a bottle of rum and cigars in your room upon arrival. Rooms were tidy and maids were great, especially when you tip them. You could tell a little updating was needed, The bathroom showed it the most and we had a mysterious leak by patio doors but it was only during the last couple days. Activity:I loved the fact this resort was adults-only. Having no kids running around the pool or crying at dinner was great. It was very peaceful. If you're coming to do a lot of activities this is more of a laidback setting. The 2 sister resorts had restaurants and a casino if you wanted to go there. Excursions are offered-my boyfriends parents went horseback riding and rode thru the towns to get to the ranch, which was a little scary.Food;We enjoyed the food and didn't get sick at all. We didn't drink the water they pour at dinner, just stuck to beer, soda or juices. The 2 restaurants at the Princess were good-loved the tex-mex one!People: The people who worked there were very nice. Communication was ok if you knew a few spanish words for the maids to understand what you needed (washcloth, soap).Overall it was an enjoyable and relaxing vacation. The first time we went out of the country to vacation-beach is more beatiful than I could describe. The tipping could get to be a little much but that is probably more my fault beause I can be a sucker. I might go back but most likely will try to visit other places ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1335,"mention":"ranch","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ranch_dressing"],"startOffset":1330},{"endOffset":1486,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":1482}]}
