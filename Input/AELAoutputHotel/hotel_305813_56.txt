{"text":"Extremely overrated! Don't be fooled My Partner and I stayed here in late September 08. I truly can't understand the raving, salivating and gushing reviews on here.Friends of ours from Australia stayed here and also rave about it so we thought we would give it a go after we got caught up in a typhoon and could not get out of Hong Kong.We booked over wotif.com from the airport and arrived 1 hour later only to find they did't have our booking yet. The check-in girl in true Hong Kong style was rather aloof. I opened my laptop to show her the email that I recieved confirming the booking had been paid for however, this did not satisfy her. Rather than allowing me to come behind the counter and forward the email from my web mail with all the booking details and payment confirmation to the hotel, she made me wait some time for a user name and password from the internal office wif-fi system in the hotel so then I could forward the emial to their booking system. Then after she was satisfied that it was a legitimate booking, she then proceeded to fluff around for a long time before she took any details or allocated us a room. There was all manner of talking, phone calls, posing and posturing with others rather than paying attention to a customer - now correct me if I am wrong but aren't they in the hospitality business?Finally after a good 15-20 minutes we got our room. We arrived at our room and opened the door only to find we had been given a pokey substandard room that we didn't pay for with smelling carpet and a rundown cobbled together bathroom - just foul. We went back downstairs and asked for the room we actually paid for and after much fluffing around we were given a new room.  Only after some time we realised we had been given a limited mobility room........rather than moving again we decided to stay in it even though it was VERY questionable behaviour by the check-in staff to do this!We found the restaurant staff to be very rude, food way over priced and BE CAREFUL you do not order a freshly squeezed juice....this will cost 100HK or 17 AUD for a crummy glass of juice! My partner was sick and didn't order food and the waitress got irritated by it, she then proceeded to up-sell me on bread, dips, chips, drinks and anything else that could turn a $$ in lieu of my partner not ordering anything - do they have a minimum seat quota???The check-out process was another story indeed, the check-out lady seemed more interested in talking to others than helping us get checked out and to the airport to the point we had to step in and get her to focus on our check-out and stop talking to a colleague about something frivolous - something I have NEVER had to do in my life and I stay in plenty of hotels believe me!The Langham promotes itself as the most modern of hotels in Hong Kong but it doesn't even have free in-room wi-fi. All five star hotels that I have stayed in in Asia, have free in room wi-fi so I hardly think the Langham can promote itself as the latest and greatest all in all, VERY ordinary, VERY over priced and VERY misleading a 3.5 star at best!!! The bells and whistles don't account for or compensate for below average service and facilities - don't be fooled! Spend your money elsewhere for a better experience!
