{"text":"Thumps up! Very nice. My husband and I stayed in Sofitel St. James for 4 nights. We have only good things to say. All the personnel was very helpful and friendly, always greeting us with a smile. The bed was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in in a hotel. I didn't feel the weight of my body on the mattress at all, even after a long tiring day. There were also several nice touches, as small bottles of water by our bed for both of us every day, slippers, bathrobes, and towels were renewed even in the late afternoon, if we had used them during the day. Instead of the welcome blaring from the TV set, there was a letter on the desk from the general manager of the hotel addressed to us.Location, location, location. Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, St. James' Park, Buckingham Palace etc. all in walking distance. One night we went to a theatre, and just walked there and back. We found some interesting shops and cafes for lunch in the neighbourhood. Also right next to Piccadilly Circus on Regent Street there was a big grocery store, Tesco. Many times in big cities it is difficult to find a grocery store, (for example in New York). The hotel is also the straight shot from Heathrow Airport on the subway, Piccadilly Line. You can take the tube to either Victoria Station or London Bridge to catch a train to Gatwick Airport.The hotel room was not huge, but it was big enough and tastefully furnished. The shower was also amazing. The hotel was very peaceful, no rowdy groups. I would definitely would like to stay there again next time I am going to London.
