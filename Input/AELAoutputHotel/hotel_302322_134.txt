{"text":"Very recommendable hotel This is a nice modern hotel, with a good choice of restaurants and a good view, if you get a harbour view room.The place is modern and quite grand, plenty of marble and wide, light corridors. It would be an ideal business hotel.We went there as the first port of call for our honeymoon, and booked a Harbour Club room, you get a personal registration area, afternoon tea, evening buffet and private breakfast area and it is well worth taking advantage of and you are made very welcome. Breakfast and evening buffets are well worth doing.We did not however realise that it is quite a long way round the harbour and is not within walking distance of the famous hotels near the star ferry terminal. It is within the Hung Hom district. This meant that other than the hotels own restaurants, five if I remember, there is not much else unless you take a taxi ride. The Japanese Robatayaki restaurant is very good as is their own Chinese √à√\u2020\u2022?Hoi Yat Heen, but both are quite expensive. The Waterfront bar is more reasonably priced for both food and drinks. There is a ferry terminus just outside so you can quickly get to the Hong Kong island ferry terminal in about 10 minutes and as taxis are so cheap and plenty full in Hong Kong access to other parts of the city is easy. One final thought, we went at the beginning of August 07, not a good time for a tourist as it is in Typhoon season and very hot and humid. The rooftop swimming pool is a great feature, but we were unable to use it, as with a typhoon warning in the area (only a grade 1, they go up to 10 !) they closed it for fear of lightning strikes.Overall a good tourist hotel, great features and as long as your mind is not set on a Tsim Shat Sui area hotel on the harbour front. a great one that is not too expensive. Finally, we booked through Asiarooms.com who offer some great deals and a easy to work with, however do not expect an immediate response as they are an agent. It takes 24 - 48 hrs and they debit your credit card before booking and the hotel is not always available.
