{"text":"Another Outstanding Stay at the O! Just had my annual stay at the Orchard, and as usual, it was an oasis of calm and comfort in the midst of a chaotic business trip. I would not stay at another hotel in San Francisco--the value at the Orchard cannot be beat. The rooms are a nice size compared to many boutique hotels in the area, with quite a large bathroom--plenty of counterspace for a lady to spread out her necessities! The down comforter, crisp linens, and fluffy pile of pillows make for a wonderful night's sleep, as does the individually-controlled air conditioning--another item missing from many SF hotels in this range of quality. Lovely robes, nice toiletries, and plenty of room to pack away your things all add up to an incredibly comfortable stay.Free internet adds to the allure, as does the excellent room service provided by the restaurant downstairs. Food is really good and always arrives promptly and at the right temperature--best of all, The O is thoughtful in providing the appropriate condiments and utensils--things you may not have thought about yourself! The daily maid service is unobtrusive and consistent--I have never failed to have exactly what I need or requested provided promptly. And best of all, the service and attitude of the staff are just amazing. They respond with friendly professionalism and never fail to offer a smile along with their excellent service! And all of this at an excellent value in a truly convenient location. What more could you ask for?I highly recommend this hotel to people who want to feel comfortable and welcomed and prefer a quiet, traditional-style hotel to the newer hip hotels full of sleek, minimalist decor. The Orchard is, admittedly, showing a wee bit of wear, but like the grand dame she is, her put-you-at-ease personality is like your favorite aging aunt--you love her all the more for her little cosmetic flaws. Everything is spotlessly clean and fresh, and all you will find are a few worn spots on the edges of furniture or carpet--certainly nothing that will spoil the experience.I won't stay anywhere else in San Francisco. The Orchard Hotel is my home away from home, and I wish there was one in every city!
