{"text":"Great Hotel! Great pool! I just got back from the paradisus punta cana with my family, and we really enjoyed our stay, and would have enjoyed it even more if not for a little error before we left: we were booked at the new paradisus palma real but they overbooked themselves and we had to go to the older paradisus punta cana. If not for the mindset that we could be at a better hotel right now, the trip would have been great, and it still was very good. Apparently, people got bumped out of the Paradisus Punta Cana also. Anyway, here is an overview of the hotel:POOL\/BEACH: The pool was absoloutely fantastic...it wasnt heated but the air kept it warm all the time...it was very refreshing. All the cot's were seperated into little groups, so your family could have their own little private area, royal service or not. The bars were convineintly located also. There were also little huts all around the pool to give shade to whoever wanted it. The beach was also outstanding. The sand was unbelievable and the ocean was very nice. The waves were perfect for people to go boogy boarding or windsurfing! The one flaw about the beach was that it was very crowded, as it was filled with cot's, and didnt have its own little family areas like the pool.ROOMS: The rooms at the hotel were average...not great, just average. The beds are fine and the chez lounge was quite comfortable for relaxing. The TV got terrible reception and only 2 or 3 channels were in english. Not a good trip for TV watching. The mini bar in my room turned on and off by itself at times, so you never knew if you were going to get a warm drink or a cold drink. The airconditioner in my room leaked for the first couple of days and we could not control the temperature..there was a huge puddle in my hallway and my room was freezing all trip. Also, there is no door to the bathroom, just a shutter, so privacy is limited.RESTAURANTS\/FOOD: The food was mostly good throughout the trip. The selection at breakfast and lunch was limited and the exact same thing every day. I got tired of having the same thing and ended up going to the 24 hour pizza place (also the italian restaurant) and getting pizza for lunch. There was a huge selection and huge variety for dinner. I thought the steak restaurant was by far the best! it had amazing sirloin and tenderloin. the buffet was the same every night but had some outstanding chicken wings. Also, the italian restaurant was great, especially the pasta and the pizza, (but dont over do it on the pizza or you will get tired of it). I didnt go to the chinese, french or seafood restaurant. The japanese restaurant was very nice, and the meat was very good. The give you a variety of sushi, which is not very good. The mexican and brazillian are also very good, and much higher than my expectations..they offer several kinds of meat for you to chose from and are pretty good. Overall, breakfast and lunch wasnt so great, but you made up for the empty stomach with an outstanding diner. Note also that the only two restaurants that require reservations are the japanesse and the french.RESORT FACILITIES: The resort was very nice, with tons of nature mixed in. There are ponds containing various wildlife, including flamingos, which were really cool. The resort is huge, and there is a tram that takes you were you want to go. When it passes your destination (i.e. your room) you just say gracias so the driver can hear you and he will stop for you. The tennis courts were clay, and pretty good, although very hot. You should reserve your courts around 5-6 at night, so it isnt as hot. The provide you with some tennis racquets and balls, although they are not very good.BAR: The bartenders were very good, fast and knew how to make everything you want. Every bar was amazing.SERVICE: We called for the hotel to service my air conditioner and mini bar several times, but nobody ever came. The check in was fast and the waiters were very good at the restaurants.
