{"text":"Great base to discover Barcelona First visit to Barcelona and this hotel suited our needs perfectly. Chose to stay here since feedback from friends and family was that the city centre tourist areas (Las Ramblas etc) would be loud well into the wee small hours. Getting to and from hotel was simple √à√\u2020\u2022?we took airport bus (Aerobus) to Plaza Espana √à√\u2020\u2022?hotel is a 10 minute walk away.Modern hotel, friendly staff, clean spacious rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?pictures on the internet are exactly what we got (not always the case!). Beds are comfortable, air-con is efficient, rooms are double glazed so you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l get a good night's sleep! Booked through Lastminute.com Special Offer and paid √ä√£¬¢294.00 for 4 nights. Emailed request for high floor to the hotel, which they allocated us. Didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have breakfast at the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ included in our rate and at 14 Euros per person, it seemed a bit expensive for what was on offer; we did, however, get a free glass of Cava (although the bar area where you claim it from is dead!) There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ plenty of small caf√ã√\u2022√ñs and great cake shops in the vicinity which offer much better value for money. Hotel is about a 10 √à√\u2020\u2022?15 minute walk to the University then a further 5 minutes or so to the Plaza Catalunya and the start of the Ramblas. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a nice walk along tree lined boulevards with lots of interesting buildings en route. There√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ also the Rocafort Metro Station just round the corner for the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?the metro system is really simple to use (just make sure you go through the right side of the ticket barrier!)The only 'negative observation' (and not a problem) was the lack of restaurants in the local area - plenty of small bars with tapas etc, but nothing really serving anything more substantial. There's a Mediterranean Restaurant across the road which serves traditional meals - ideal of pig's trotters are your cup of tea... I would stay here again.
