{"text":"Decent hotel, great customer service, but don't expect luxury. Upon arriving in Fajardo, I was simply not impressed with the immediate surroundings. It seems this town is a launching pad to see the rainforest and to visit viecques or culebra. My first impression was that the customer service was impeccable. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. When I called for towels or pillows, I received them in a timely manner. The honeymoon suite was ok. We had some problems with the door key, but someone came by to fix this issue. The floors are tile and the bathroom is dark with a large tub. It's not hugely luxurious, but clean and sufficient. The kitchen area was a huge plus, since we didn't want to eat out in Fajardo (options were limited) and we certainly didn't want to rely on eating at the on-site restaurants 3x a day. The living area was also decent, however don't expect luxury linens.The grounds were kept up, but there is a lot of construction going on. Also, note that the pool area with mini-golf and tennis courts is open to the public. I did have a good time there for a few days, but as I was on my babymoon, it simply wasn't romantic enough. We checked out a day early when a full bus of local teenagers showed up at the open pool and they started blasting reggaeton. We went to the reception area and booked a room at el convento in old san juan and handed in our keys. All in all, this is a wonderful place in a not-so-amazing area IF you have kids with you. I really wouldn't recommend staying here for romance. After years of trips to mexico, the local beaches just don't compare. I'm sure the surrounding islands are great, but we stood in line for an hour in the morning to get on a ferry. A half hour before departure, they said the tickets had been all sold... and the line had never even moved. I'm a very DIY person and like to rent a car and travel around locally... but in this case, I regret not paying the extra cash to stay in San Juan or elsewhere and just taking proper tours to the islands for snorkeling.
