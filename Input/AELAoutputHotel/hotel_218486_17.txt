{"text":"great holiday When we had booked our holiday we looked at the reviews on trip advisor and held our breathe. The reviews were far from great.On arrival at our hotel we were delighted. In the rooms there was shampoo, conditioner, body wash, combs, shower caps, a sewing kit and a coffee maker. Also a fully stocked fridge.Ths maid service was excellant we had clean linen each day.The actual hotel was lovely with many bars pools and restaraunts. The selection of food and drinks was superb.At the pizza bar you could eat and drink 24hrs a day. There is an english speaking woman named Santa who is there to help guests and her service was second to none. She was there in a flash when I suffered from prickly heat and brought me some aloe vera leaves which work a treat she also gave me a knife to score the leaves to extract the sap.The waiters couldnt do enough for you they are polite and helpful and will help with advice about where to shop etc.as per usual market shopping is a nightmare as you dont get much peace ,never tell them that you will look at their goods on the way back as they will wait and wont forget. It is best to remain polite and say you are not buying today.Back to the hotel. As with any resort in the Dom the food is always luke warm it is very good but never hot. It is advisable to take a generous supply of tummy solutions with you. The mosquitoes lay in wait for guests too. I think they love our pale skin. The main complaint I had at this hotel was the poor supply of beach towels so when you get some dont give them back perhaps just change them when you really need to. Overall the holiday was fabulous the hotel is lovely the entertainment is alittle repetative but if you want a nice break to rest and be waited on you need to book up. We had a fantastic time.
