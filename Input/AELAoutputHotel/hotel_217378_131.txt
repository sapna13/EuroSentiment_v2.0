{"text":"Awful experience I am staying at the Miami Beach Resort and Spa for a conference. My husband is coming to meet me at the end of the conference, and we are staying to enjoy the weekend in Miami. Originally our plan was to stay at the conference hotel, but we are moving as soon as the conference is over. The accommodations here are below par, and the service is worse! It began with the check-in process. I was told although I reserved a king bed with a bay view, they only had double beds available. In order to get a king bed, they downgraded me to a partial water view. It is partial because there is a construction high-rise site blocking the water. There was no apology or explanation as to why they didn't have the room I booked available, and then I had to wait 3 hours before my room was ready. They knew they had a conference coming in of about 400 people, yet rooms weren't ready for hours. In checking with the front desk periodically on the status of my room, I asked to speak to a manager who was incensed that I wasn't happy that my room had been changed and that I was waiting hours for it. From her behavior, I realized why the other front desk staffers weren't friendly or accommodating - they have no example or reason to be. The pictures on the website are misleading. The room is very outdated, and you can't depend on hot water when taking a shower. Also, when I ordered room service for dinner, I began my order saying that I'd like some lobster bisque. The voice on the other end interrupted me asking, By some lobster bisque, do you mean one bowl or three bowls? What exactly do you want? Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend staying here. There are plenty of other places to stay with friendlier staff and superior accommodations for around the same price point. Being stuck here for four days is certainly a disappointment.
