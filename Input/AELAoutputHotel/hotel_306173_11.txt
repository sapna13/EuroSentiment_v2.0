{"text":"Fullerton 'sweet' for baby we have just returned from 6 nights at the Fullerton on an extended stay with the Suite Weekend Deal and were very impressed. The room offered a separate bedroom and almost 100 sqm of space with carpeted floors perfect for our 9 month old baby. Only pain was that there were 6 stairs down from the front door to the whisper quiet apartment with river views of Clarke Quay precinct and Museum  Bridge.Suite deal include access to club lounge and breakfast with Tattinger champagne that can be had downstairs in the main room with more breakfast choice and river views if desired. The breakfasts were extensive and had options of Cook to prepare what you want re eggs and omlettes on request. From 6pm til 8pm you can go to the lounge and have as much Champagne or cocktails as you wish whilst enjoying buffet sushi and canapes of a very high standard including Asian and western options. The staff are friendly, english speaking and will go out of thier way to assist you. Internet is free in room and on the club level.The Fullerton is in an excellent position and if you book a cab fom the room , one will appear in 5 minutes in the foyer and you just have to provide your booking number. $2.50 sing booking fee and about another $5 to anywhere thats imprtant in SIngapore such as Orchard Rd, Suntec City shopping or the fabulous VIVO City shopping Mall near Sentosa that you must see. You ca walk in 5 minutes to the underpass that links Metro stations and walkways to the linked malls if you ca stand the Singapore humidity.Fullerton Hotel is well maintained and definately 5 star but being a newish (8 years) hotel in an old building there are a few issues and compromises that are only a problem if you look for them like high windows and some water damage in walls of room but no mould smell. Bvlgari toiletries, granite tiled bathrooms and two LCD tv s and DVD in room. Room service food is excellent and cheap..just stay away form alcohol and buy it at shopping malls for a fraction of the price. A $18 (after taxes) local beer is hard to swallow in the room! more like $3 at the supermarket.Highly recommend this hotel and got a rate of under $US450 a night so excellent relative value. Good on you Fullerton, keep up the high standards.Remember to find the best rate on the hotel website then ring for a better deal..it works for most hotels in Singapore.
