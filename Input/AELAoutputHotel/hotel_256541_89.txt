{"text":"Fancy hotel with superb location and staff We were on honeymoon and stayed in the four points for 4 nights at the end of August. Before we arrrived we realised that our travel agent had booked us a city room so when we got to the hotel we asked about an upgrade. It cost us $30 extra per night for a harbour view. We decided to go for it.The room was immaculate, with a HUGE bed (I didn't think beds came in that size!) lots of cosy cushions, a massive TV, fridge, mini bar, safe, hairdryer, not to mention a fantastic view of Darling Harbour.The maids service was second to none, the room was always well made up. The check in staff were very helpful as were the consierge staff. One member of staff who sticks in my mind as going the extra mile was Tony (he was on the front door). We wanted to go to Bondi Beach and were recommended to take a taxi, however Tony asked if we were feeling adventurous and wanted to save some money. Why not. He told us to get the tube, then change at Bondi Junction and get the public bus to the beach, he even told us how much the fares would be and what platforms the tubes were on. The hotel catters for the business world and there were lots of suits about and to be honest sometimes we did feel out of place being the tourist, but we were not treated any differently by the hotel staff.The restaurant prices are steep, but there are loads of nice places to eat at Darling Harbour or if you like steak and ribs there is a Tony Romas a few doors down.The hotel is only about 4 blocks from the Queen Victoria buildings which have the most fabulous array of shops and boutiques (the tube station is also here too). The first few days in Sydney we got on the Ferry boats to take us to cirular quay, but we realised it wasn't that far to walf.All in all its a great hotel. The staff are great, the hotel is clean and when we were checking out we didn't have to pay our suppliment for a harbour view as they upgraded us for free for being on honeymoon.
