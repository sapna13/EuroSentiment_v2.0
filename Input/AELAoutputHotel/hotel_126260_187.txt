{"text":"Treated like royalty at the Palace! We arrived early on Friday Sept 28th at the Palace. It was a crazy weekend to be in NYC with the UN meeting just wrapping up. Our room was unavailable for early check-in so we were taken up to the 8th floor to clean up and arrange our bags. The bell man was very helpful and our children liked the service in the spa area very much. When we returned to the hotel we were told that we were upgraded to a one bedroom suite in the Tower! Our original reservation was for a modern double room at the Tower, so this was quite a big move. The room was spectacular! Huge living room with giant flat screen television, dining room, kitchen, and additional bathroom. The bedroom was very large with a nice full size bathroom and walk in closet area. This definitely was one of the nicest rooms we have ever checked into and we travel quite a bit. It is also the first time we were able to upgrade in NYC to a better room with the AMEX card. The breakfast was quite expensive even with the complimentary continental breakfast attached. We ate in the restaurant 3 times during our stay of 4 days.The location is perfect for families. Great shopping, museums, and theater all in one spot. Every time we entered the Tower we were greeted by name and the smiles were quite genuine. I would highly recommend the Tower at the Palace hotel to anyone that wants to be pampered.
