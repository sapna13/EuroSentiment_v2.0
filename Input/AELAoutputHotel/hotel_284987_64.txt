{"text":"Worst Hotel Stay Ever... No kidding This hotel perfectly fits the description of looks can be deceiving. The property is located in the north east part of the island about 45 minutes from San Juan. The resort is beautiful, but the service is the worst I have ever experienced.My wife and I traveled to the island to join my parents and siblings for a small get together. In all we booked 4 rooms for 3 nights. The booking process alone was an ordeal. We showed up at 3pm and were immediately directed to a ball room for checking instead of the front desk. There was a line of about 30 people waiting to check in with only two hotel employees handling the reservations. After 2 hours we finally were given our rooms but without the room keys.It turns out the rooms were not ready yet. I demanded to speak to a manager and after demanding to get some resolution I was given keys to two of our rooms only. The explanation for the delay was that the hotel did not have any clean sheets available and we would have to wait for new ones. We ended up getting the other two rooms two hours later. In all the checking process took 4 hours.When we got to our room we noticed the bathroom did not have any hand or face towels. Upon inquiring about it we were told there were none. My guess is either the hotel is short staffed or they don't have enough supplies for all the guests.Another issue is the charges for room service and meals at the resorts restaurants. My mother ordered breakfast for two in her room and she was charged $100. Needless to say, during our stay we bought our meals outside the hotel. ","annotations":[]}
