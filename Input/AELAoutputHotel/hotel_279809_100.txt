{"text":"You get what you pay for We nearly didnt go to this hotel after reading some of the reviews, however we decided that most of them were probably from whingers who want something for nothing.The Facts:The hotel is quite small and in grounds that were clean and very well kept.The rooms are a little tired but clean and perfectly adequate for the amount of time that we wanted to spend in them. If you want to be really critical, the bath towels were rather small!The staff were never rude but some were friendlier than others and the friendly ones got the tips!There were bars to suit different tastes, we enjoyed the relaxing waitered service in the lobby bar.The food was ok but a bit repetitive, having said that, i enjoyed all my meals and put on weight in the week i was there.The beach was cleaned extensively each morning by hotel staff and was left immaculate.We had a number of approaches about timeshare in the resort and by hawkers on the beach, they all took notice of a polite no thanks and we never felt pressured.The hotel was quite empty except for the weekend when the locals decended, however there was no problem with this except i had to queue for a couple of extra minutes for a beer.I was a little dissapointed about the lack of snorkling from the beach, but that may have been because the sea was fairly rough.We wanted a quiet relaxing week on the beach in the sun at a budget price and this performed as well as we could have expected. It is not a 5 star luxurious hotel and doesnt cost like one, like all things you get what you pay for. We probably wouldnt go back, but im not sorry we went ","annotations":[]}
