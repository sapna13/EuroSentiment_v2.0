{"text":"Nice resort, crappy service My boyfriend and I stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach resort in January 2008. We got a room in one of the buildings in the middle of the resort, central to most of its attractions. The resort itself was pretty nice. The food at the restaurants was good, especially the Japanese and the Brazilian. The Mexican and the Italian weren't as good though. The pools were nice, as was the beach. The alcohol was plentiful, though pretty much all local brands. The pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris were subpar, but they were free, so you can't complain too much. Overall, the facilities were good.So why give an average report? The service was pretty bad. Anytime we had a problem (we changed rooms, got charged for phone calls we didn't make, etc.), the management was unenthusiastic even hostile in trying to make them right. Some of the managers were outright mean. We just wanted to enjoy our vacation and not let the little things get in the way, but one of the reasons you go to an all inclusive resort is to get good service. You might here, but it's not something you can expect. And you should be able to expect it.If you find a good deal to stay at this resort you might want to go. The facilities are nice enough and if you keep a good attitude the whole time (don't overreact about little things that aren't too important - yes flies exist in the outdoors) you'll have a good enough time. But if you have any problems or want any help from any of the staff, you'll be lucky to come out of that satisfied. Now I haven't stayed at any other resorts in Punta Cana\/Bavaro, so I can't compare to them - but I would hope this is not the standard of service anywhere in the world.Oh, and by the way - we had to pay for those calls.
