{"text":"Catalonia - Wonderful Vacation We just returned from a wonderful week in Punta Cana and the Catalonia Resort. We were there from April 12 - 20th and had a wonderful time. The resort is beautiful, the grounds are well maintained and the staff were wonderful. Everyone always said hello when you passed them by. We had a junior suite as we had triple occupancy and the room was spacious and clean. They cleaned everyday, no matter what time it was ( our teenage son often slept in so they had to clean late in the day)There were alot of activities to keep you busy and the best thing they did was have a beach party on the Monday night. They do this every Monday. They had barbeque stations everywhere, tables set up with tablecloths and chaircovers. The entertainment that night was spectacular. The hotel band was great and we danced many nights to the Bachada, Merengue, etc. They really work hard to keep everyone entertained, and the bartenders and the animation team are the best. Say hello to Luis and Alehandrina on the beach..boy were they fun, and Abraham at the bar is crazy. Every morning he would give us a Mammajuana - their local drink to start our day. Just tell him love you baby! when you see him and you'll have lots of fun with him.We were hesitant to book here because of some of the reviews, and don't understand where it is coming from. We never tipped the front desk and they always responded to our needs. We tipped our maid $2 every day and the bartenders we tipped $10.00 at the end of our stay. There is nothing to complain about t this resort and there is lots to do. The bartenders make $150.00 u.s. a month and they were always happy.We would go back anytime. My teenage son (who is hard to please loved it and didn't want to leave) The only thing I would complain about was the coffee - it's not Tim Hortons!Something that had nothing to do with the hotel was our tour group Nolitours. Here is something to complain about. Our rep was only available from 12:00 to 12:30 everyday and from 6:00 to 6:30 only. When we arrived they were nowhere in site ( and there were two bus full of people) and when we left they were nowhere in site. At the airport only the Air Transat section was a royal zoo and no direction from Nolitours. I will be complaining to them officially, but this has nothing to do with the resort.
