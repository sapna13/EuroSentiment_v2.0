{"text":"Great Hotel - Beautiful Beach! I just returned from a stay here on June 18-20th with 3 other travelers who were in their 20s. I am a frequent, somewhat discriminating traveler, with this being my 3rd trip to PR. This facility was a nice suprise. First tip: as already stated by other reviews, you definitely need a car! I got a great deal through Hotwire. The hotel was immaculate. We arrived at the hotel at 1 a.m. and the hotel had our rooms waiting for us. The front desk was extremely helpful and pleasant. The beach is just lovely! It is very private and the hotel was pretty empty so there was not much activity, which is what we were looking for. Just relaxing on the beach was fabulous. If you are looking for tons of stuff to do, this might not be the place for you. We did not eat at the hotel, in part because the facility did not offer full menus due to the fact that the hotel was so empty. However, we got some good recommendations that we tried that worked out well for us. If you take 115 to 402 to Rte. 2, there is a McDonalds, Walgreens and a place called Bonanza Supermercado. It is a supermarket with a cafeteria counter inside with some of the yummiest food we ate! And it was very reasonably priced. Also, if you exit 115 to your left from the resort, there is a place on your left called Panaderia, which had some yummy breakfast. Further up on your right, there is a restuarant called Rincon Tropical - the most authentic food we are there! And again, reasonably priced. Check-out was a breeze and parking was free. All in all, a good place for hanging out and relaxing! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":236,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":232}]}
