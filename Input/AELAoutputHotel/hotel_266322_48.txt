{"text":"I'LL Be Baackkk ! The location is a bit hard to find the first time, but once you figure out the cross streets, you realize that this is a great location. I was visiting the area museums and friends and found that it was located in a great spot. Once the rail transportation system is up and running and the road construction finished, this location will be more easily accessible. I stayed there before the pool was finished, but I am looking forward to my return and the chance to see what was constructed in the open space. As my niece said, the colors reminded her of being back in the 1960's. The bed was fabulous, the room size was very large, and yes the bathroom was small, but the bathtub and sink were clean, and it was supplied with nice fluffy towels. I too had problems with the water supply faucet and trying to regulate the water temperature. As I told the front desk, if a small child had gotten in the tub with the water running, they would have been scalded. I never did figure out the plastic temp. thingie√à√\u2020\u2022?So I am glad that they are addressing that problem. TV is great, so is the sound machine, free internet, frig, coffee machine, desk area, etc. The staff is very friendly and courteous; the maid service was friendly and tried to stay out of your way while they were working in the hall with their service cart. The hotel was still a work in progress when I was there, but it sounds like they will still continue to work on and improve the property. But even staying there during the current time period- The Claredon is still a wonderful boutique hotel, it is a unique and original hotel. When you arrive, ask for an upgraded room, and I bet you get it. They seem very much wanting to please their guests.
