{"text":"Way behind the Competition! We stayed at 4 (4 and 5 star) hotels whilst in Bali and as a Hyatt Gold Passport Holder we found it not just lacking against Bali standards it was lacking against the Hyatt service standards as well. Not only is the hotel screaming to be renovated it was the small things that continuously let in downWe actually treated ourselves at the Hyatt and opted for a Suite over the New Year Period and although in its day I am sure it was a splender it is has never been updated. The walls still had the original cement render pattern that was very popular way back when and floor tiling not only in the bathroom but in the entire suite was crying to be regrouted. The 3 mouse traps of a cardboard square, oil and dried fish (dont worry they where checked daily!) was of great amusement and to be honest if we hadnt prepaid we would have checked out and found elsewhere. I have to say there definitely was no damp smell within the suite and the aircon worked well - however I can see how it could be an issue as there was a strong damp smell when walking through certain areas of the hotel.Within 3 hours of check-in we had a strange phonecall from a local with a made up story about having already driven for us at the airport on the 24th of Dec (quite suspicious as considering we arrived on the 19th and had transport through the Intercontinental) asking if his services where needed (again??). He had our full names and room number and after a little bit of research I am sure our details had been passed out from a Hyatt staff member. The Irony of this is that we had suits made from a well known and reputable tailor in which the Hyatt not only refused to put their phonecall through they also failed to pass on the message!!! The Regency club staff where great and pre-dinner drinks in the club was a casual but lovely affair, breakfast itself in the club is good however the first morning order was taken and forgotten - genuine mistake and forgiven however this set the pattern of those little things building up to becoming a genuine complaint.The Pizza Ria was great and ended up eating there 3 times however they did mess up the order and gave my pizza to another table in which I had to wait an extra 15 minutes whilst my partner was eating his, the other visits in the restaurant where an extra ingredient was requested was also never followed through. The main breakfast area had a great buffet with chefs on hand to cook eggs to your liking, take note though make sure someone stays at the table at all times because you will lose it. In the space of popping up to grab a pastry (another coffee was on order) our table was being cleaned for reseating (3 people cleaning with people waiting to be sat down). As you can see the little things are starting to build up.We had room service which arrived promptly and hot however the requested side condiments did not arrive at all - forgivable ....... absolutely as it does happen and normally wouldn't even suffice a mention in any review however due to the constant mishap it definitely landed on the radar with us this time.Even Check out wasn't a smooth affair, With the pattern of mistakes occurring and now our distrust of Bali Hyatts attention to detail we decided to request a itemised bill early to ensure that it was correct, and Yep you guessed it ..............there where charges on the bill that had came from another room. Once the Hyatt staff requested the invoice copies from Room Service the mistake was acknowledged and rectified ( the process did take just under 45 minutes though). Overall though we loved Sanur and will seek to stay in the area again - Just not at the Hyatt!
