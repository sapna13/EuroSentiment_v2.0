{"text":"WOW!! Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful My husband and I needed to get away and this place was perfect! So relaxing, beautiful resort, friendly people, wonderful restaurants, magnificent grounds and outrageous pool! What more can you ask for? The rooms were nice too. Yes, there were some downsides but a place cannot be perfect... Here are the downsides.... There were a few bugs in our room (that didn't really bother me as we were in a tropical third world country). The drive to and from was 1 hour and very bumpy (you just have to deal and be prepared). The ocean was rough and very breezy (just know that is how it is, if you don't like that, don't go here). That is all I can say for the downsides. I like nice things, good food and nice people and they have all that at Excellence. I stayed mostly at the pool on the float. There is limited shopping.. If you prefer to haggle with the locals you can go to the beach (facing the water) and turn left. Just passed the resort are the local huts. Bargain with them.. They aren't too bad. They all sell the same stuff. We were there for the Super Bowl and everyone kept telling us we would miss it.... But Excellence put a big screen on the beach, a BBQ, and a ton of chairs and the whole resort was there watching! They did a great job. They really go above and beyond. I would hight recommend this resort. I also brought a suitcase full of school supplies... I donated them to dominicantaxi.com. I left them at the front desk and called Rafael when I got there. It is a great thing to do when you go to a third world county.
