{"text":"Location + peace  We arrived at the hotel around 7pm and were extremely tired from our long flight in from Seattle. The hotel suggested taking the Limousine Bus from the Airport and that worked out marvelously. It cost about $30.00 US for each of us and it took us to the door step of the hotel. I must mention it was extremely easy to find the Limo place inside the Airport and they were super friendly. Once we arrived a guy from the hotel greeted us and took us up to the lobby. As soon as we looked out the window we saw nothing but the most beautiful view of Tokyo Tower. It only took about 5 minutes to check and we headed to our room right away. Everything was super clean inside the room. They even provide you with the little things you tend to leave behind like tooth brush, q-tips and nail filer.The hotel is located right above a major train station (Shimbashi) and has tons of stores and restaurants within the station. From the hotel you can access the underground station by elevator which is wonderful. The places you can find down there are MacDonald√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, AMPM, Starbucks, a book store, and many more restaurants. Once you arrive within the station terminal you can take a train pretty much any where you need to. From Shimbashi station we took one train to, Shibuya, Harajuku, Akihabara, Ueno Park, and Yokohama just to name a few. Take the train, its so much fun and so cheap plus to hotel will provide you with a map of the rail way and tell you which train to catch.I must say everyone in the hotel was more than helpful. They all spoke English if that is important to you and went out of there way to make sure we new how to get to the places we needed to go. Bravo Park Hotel Tokyo!!!Going to Tokyo for the first time was amazing and staying in this hotel just made it even better.
