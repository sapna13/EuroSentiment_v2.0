{"text":"Second visit and its still as lovely as ever! This is my second stay in Hosteria Grau and it is a pleasure to stay there! I was hoping that the standard remained the same as when i visited 3 years ago, as I had told my friend how lovely it was. It didnt disappoint! As you are walking down the alley way off the Ramblas towards the hostel, it can look a bit unnerving with people hanging around and the grafitti on the walls, but thats what most of the side streets are like. As long as you are aware of the people around you and you keep your bag secure you will be fine. We arrived at the hostel at 11.20 pm and there was somone at the reception who was helpful. The room had twin beds which were clean and daily made and a spotless bathroom. The aircon was excellent. There wasnt much of a view from our room unfortunately but we didnt spend much time there!There was always someone to open the door to us regardless of what time we got in and on one occassion when I got in at 8.30am the receptionist told the cleaners to be quiet cos I had just gone to bed. When i went back out at 12.45pm the cleaners came in and made up the room for me then...what service is that!! fantastic!I have no experence of other hotels or hostels in Barcelona as I have only stayed in Hosteria Grau, but I wouldnt question staying here again. Fantastic value for money! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":299,"mention":"the alley","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Alley"],"startOffset":290}]}
