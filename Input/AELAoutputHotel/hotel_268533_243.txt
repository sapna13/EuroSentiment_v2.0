{"text":"Just About Right Just about hit all the right buttons as a great location, well appointed place to stay.Unusual decor and rooms and right at the end of Fisherman's Walk , close enough to do the touristy things or far enough away from the touristy things. JUST ABOUT PERFECT LOCATION.For Joggers, walkers cyclists etc the location is excellant, with access to the GG Bridge quite easy on the shoreline footpath.With cable car terminus right outside the hotel, Union Square is easily accessable but as they limit numbers on the first stop just walk to the next block \/ pick up point and you'll get on everytime instead of queing. This applies to any return journey if you get on at the end of the line, walk to the first stop.Lombard Street is just a few blocks away but UPHILL !In a couple of blocks the other way, get a trip down the Piers or even into town or areas such as Castro by way of the Trams, beutifully restored.Get a pass its much cheaper.The hotel staff were great, couldn't fault any of them and they were extremely helpful even though Virgin managed to lose my suitcase on the way out ( IT NEVER ARRIVED ).The happy hour at 5pm added to the ambience with the staff more than accomodating if you required a re-fill.Must do's are Alcatraz, City Tour, Ride the Cable Cars , the sea lions  The Golden Gate Bridge.Be prepared for cooler than normal temperatures.All in all, GREAT HOTEL, GREAT STAFF, GREAT LOCATION, would most certainly recommend and stay there again ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1346,"mention":"cooler","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cactus_Cooler"],"startOffset":1340}]}
