{"text":"Hilton Times Square - Must Stay! Having wanted to visit New York, the opportunity of a lifetime came up when we saw a deal on Expedia for four people to visit the city, staying in the Hilton Times Square, 3 nights including flights and during the holidays at an affordable price. So we booked it.When we arrived there was one little hiccup when the hotel had got our booking slightly wrong, but they quickly sorted it by giving us an upgrade of the original room we had booked and a free breakfast every morning of our stay. To our great surprise we were on the top floor in one of the most luxorious suites in the hotel. It has two single beds and one king sized bed and a bathroom fit for a king with a massive walk in shower and jaccuzi bathtub. The room also had the most spectacular view of the Empire State building with the most dazzling look at night. The room was also equipped with a kitchen, a bar and a living area. A very nicely decorated hotel with so many floors you could do a few miles jogging just by going floor to floor! The room we had been given orginally which we experienced for a few hours was a bit smaller but still nicely decorated and had the nice views. Although you couldn't quite see the top of the Empire State building, but that didn't really matter. The bathroom was also nice and clean with a shower and bathroom facilities, obviously not a luxourious as our new room. It had a tv but no kitchen and the only problem with it really was, there was one double bed and that was it. Which is the reason why we had to change and since they had no room which we had ordered, we got a luxourious one for free! A really nice lobby area, modern with a view of the skyscrapers, however, not as nice as the room's view but still it was dazzling for people not used to New York Skyscrapers. The breakfast was something else. Just amazing. A choice of anything and everything. Cakes, muffins, cereal, cooked food, the lot. A really nice way to start the day. Then as soon as you walk out of the hotel you walk straight into the life of Times Square. An amazing experience bustling with life, you feel lucky to have stayed in this hotel. Five Stars is definately what this hotel is worth and certainly the place to stay in New York.
