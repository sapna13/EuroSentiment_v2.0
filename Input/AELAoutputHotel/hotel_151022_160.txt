{"text":"Excellent Resort As promised before I went on the trip I would provide some feed back as to our experience. We stayed at the Natura Park Resort from Feb\/15 until Mar\/1\/07. We decided to go to this resort on the recommendations from our travel agent as he had taken his family there a couple years ago and had a great experience. We travelled with Sunwing vacations and although we were 2 hrs. delayed on take-off because of a snow storm we still managed to arrive on time as they made up the difference in the air. Our sunwing representative was Juan Carlos and he did an excellent job throughout the vacation from booking golf trips to day excursions and they all went without an issue. Just so you know we travelled as a group of five, My wife, 18yr. old son, 10 yr. old daughter and a 4yr. old son.  I can also say that after I had booked our trip and had stumbled onto the Trip advisory report and read some of the stories I was a little scared, but this turned out to be probably the best vacation we have ever had! The seeweed in the 1st week was a bit of a problem but they had people raking it all day everyday to try and stay on top of it, the second week there were no issues it was all cleared up, and a 100% better! The food was awesome...and so much of everything it would be very hard not to find something that you like. Breakfest was awesome, omellets, fresh fruit, pancakes, french toast and absolutely everything else you could possibly want. As a precaution with kids and all we took all kinds of medicines with us, childrens tylenol, Immodium, graval, afterbite, anti malaria...and we all got vaccinated for Hep A\/B before we left. Well I can honestly say that although we all took the anti-malaria meds, we never required any of the rest of the meds and we gave it all to the workers at the hotel. They were all very thankful!. We went snorkelling and it was great to see all the vibrant coloured fish....but the best of all was the trip to Saona island, it was a little expensive for all five us to go $340.00 US but it was worth every cent, and I would highly recommend that if you only did one day trip that this would be something that you would always remember! I can't say enough about the workers...they were awesome, we had so much fun playing the poolside games that we became good friends with them all and to this day we all are still talking about them. If you go please look for a tall thin guy nicknamed (spaghetti) then there is Maria, Melvin, (Tiger Woods) Havier, Elizabeth . If you get a chance please tell them that Steve and Toni from Canada say's HELLO! In closing, there are a couple of things that we did and it probably helped in making this trip as successful as it was. We always left a tip for the maids that cleaned the room, $1or 2US per day(we had 2 rooms) tip the bartenders a dollar here a dollar there and the young laides that always greeted us for our meals we gave them each (only 2) $10US. as they were awsome! We wouldn't hesitae to go back to this resort again as it was absolutely beautiful! P.S. Make sure you get up early (around 6:00 am) and put your beach towel on the lounger of your choice either the pool or beach and it will be there when you come back later. Have a great holiday....because we sure did!......Steve Skinner  Family ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1390,"mention":"pancakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pancake"],"startOffset":1382},{"endOffset":1404,"mention":"french toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_toast"],"startOffset":1392},{"endOffset":1404,"mention":"french toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_toast"],"startOffset":1392},{"endOffset":2449,"mention":"spaghetti","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Spaghetti"],"startOffset":2440},{"endOffset":2449,"mention":"spaghetti","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Spaghetti"],"startOffset":2440},{"endOffset":2470,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":2465}]}
