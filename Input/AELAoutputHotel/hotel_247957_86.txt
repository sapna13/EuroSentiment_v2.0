{"text":"Not a bad place to stay Arrival\/RoomsMy husband and two children ( 9 and 10) stayed at the Occidental for 7 days towards the end of June. We arrived at the hotel and were checked in and in our room within 30 minutes. The hotel grounds are huge and we were given escort to our room by hotel staff in a golf cart, luggage and all. They will also bring the golf cart if you when you are ready to check out, just give them ample time. The room was dated but clean. D.R. is very hot and humid in June,the A\/C in the room kept the room nice and cold, but it was hard to escape the humidity, although the room was cold, everything in it was damp. The room had a mini fridge stocked with 2 - Liter bottles of water, 2 Pepsis, 2-7 ups and 2 bottles of Bohemian beer which was a nice change because the bars only serve one D.R. beer - Presidente. We used the bottled water to brush our teeth since the water is not safe to drink on the island. FoodA lot of people are complaining about the food. I will try to be as fair as possible. The buffets had a large variety, mostly Dominican fare and Spanish inspired. So unless you have a diverse palate, you may have trouble finding something you are used to. We are Americans traveling with children and my children didn't have any trouble finding something they enjoyed. Personally, I don't have high expectations for buffets because it is always food that is in warming dishes for hours at a time. The best protein at the buffet was from the carving station, it was different every night. The pizza there is cooked in a fire burning brick oven and is delicious. Tacos are prepared authentically in flour tortillas and wonderful, not like the Taco Bell most Americans are used to. Table service was OK. Little things like missing place settings, needing extra napkins etc took some effort getting, however, tipping expedited service enormously. Beach\/PoolsThe beaches were the most beautiful I had seen. Clear water and powdery soft sand. Although it the weather was hot, the sand stayed cool and was powdery soft. Bavaro Beach is topless, which didn't really bother me or the kids. Americans tend to cover up more than the European guests and locals. However I didn't see any sort of lewd behavior, although I have no issues with toplessness when sunning, it was a bit jarring to see women participating in morning yoga class without tops on. ShoppingIf you are facing the water and walk about a mile to the right, there is a beach mall with local vendors. You can get souvenirs for much cheaper than in the hotel gift shop. I got half a pound of Dominican coffee for 2\/$5 and it was 3x that at the hotel. It is safe to go shopping outside the hotel. However store owners put a lot of pressure on you to look inside their shops. All the stores have the same thing...same art, same rum, same everything. If you aren't into high pressured sales it is worth paying the extra money for items in the hotel shop. While we were there, vendors were also brought into the grounds and were setup poolside for a day. Again, all the same stuff. You can take a cab a little further out and there are plenty of higher end stores and shops to visit without people pressuring you to come look inside their stores.StaffStaff was mostly Spanish speaking. The four years of Spanish I studied in high school were very helpful. Despite the language barrier, which was frustrating at times,the staff was very helpful. When we walked by any staff on the grounds (groundskeepers, housekeepers...etc) we acknowledged with an 'hola' and a nod or a smile. OverallWe had a nice week in the D.R. The island is beautiful and people are friendly. The Occidental was worth what we paid. It cost the same as a Disney vacation for us. I enjoy taking the kids to places in America, but it is good for them to experience other cultures. In the end, you get what you pay for and you get out of it what you put in.
