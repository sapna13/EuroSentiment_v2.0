{"text":"Perfect Location! We stayed at the Hotel Milano after reading the reviews in Trip Advisor, and we were extremely pleased. We arrived after a weeks cruise on a Sunday before noon, and the staff were very gracious, checking our luggage until rooms were available. We set off from the hotel to explore Old San Juan, and found it was pefectly located to see the old city. After exploring the streets, doing some shopping, eating lunch and touring the Fort, we returned to the hotel to check in and take a nap. Our room was located on the 4th floor, and the elevator was more that adequate to take us and all our luggage upstairs. Our room had no regular windows, just glass block windows located high up on the wall from which we couldn't look through. No matter, this hotel is clean, the bed and bathroom were comfortable and pretty, (loved the cut-linen shower curtain), the fridge was big enough to hold plenty of wine, etc. We heard no noise from the street or the rest of the hotel. The front desk staff were especially helpful, and advised us about cabs etc. for our early morning flight. It did take less than 5 minutes for the taxi to arrive in the morning, as they said it would. This hotel is very reminiscent of European hotels we have visited, (however the rooms at the Milano were larger than many European hotels) and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking an excellent value in Old San Juan.
