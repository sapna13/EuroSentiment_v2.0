{"text":"Overrated -- Clean, Nice but definitely not outstanding. I am a little amazed at some of the reviews I have read here. Don't get me wrong this is a nice hotel but it doesn't warrant rave reviews, there are some problems.No wireless internet, I can't believe a hotel in the financial district doesn't have wireless internet. The front desk said we needed to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to a room with wireless internet. Huh? You have to be kidding me. The doormen (as all the reviews state here) were not (a) very friendly or (b) very helpful. I would suggest hospitality training.Don't be fooled by the candid pics above you probably won't get the room that shows a duvet (that isn't the room we got), this hotel still uses bedspreads -- very unsanitary (anytime you get a room witha bedspread throw it in the corner immediately) they're a haven for bacteria. Otherwise, the bed was clean and comfortable. The bath, amenities, and towels were adequate though not luxurious. This is nota 5 star hotel or comparative to the Four Seasons though it did remind me of a Ritz Carlton.Our first room smelled like smoke but we were relocated quickly, our bill was overcharged for a mini bar item but was corrected and our room service order was wrong but also was corrected after a call. Park at St. Mary's if you are staying on the weekend it 's 1\/5 the price of the $45 parking rate and catty corner to the hotel. Plan on paying for parking, it is San Francisco. We probably would not do a car if we stayed in the city again, it's too hard with the steep slopes and we are used to driving a lot.The hotel was clean and the location is off the beaten path a bit although still relatively close to everything. The rooms were really clean and the young man at check in was nice and helpful. We got a great price for the weekend so the hotel was well worth our price it but I sure wouldn't want to pay full price for my stay. I would defintely move up to higher end. hotel if I were paying listed rates.There is no view, it was of another building but that is to be expected in the city.Here are some other tips: We had a cheap great lunch at the mexican restaurant communal dining Mijita at the Ferry Building and parking was only $5 with validation, we enjoyed walking around the Ferry Building marketplace but skipped the touristy Fisherman's Wharf. We took the ferry to Sausalito and that was great. We walked from the hotel to the Fodor reccommended L'Osteria del Forno for dinner - it'sless than a mile, go late or go early there is often a line but it iscash only, tiny but casual and we enjoyed the food. Great for the price.
