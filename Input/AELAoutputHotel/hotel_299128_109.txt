{"text":"All other hotels pale in comparison I wrote the review with the title Gounds are great, but the rooms , posted Jan 24,2005. Upon reading glowing reviews about the hotel and its extensive renovations, I nervously returned for a seven night stay in April 2006. Well, what can I say, but 'wow' ! The hotel and the grounds are just fantastic. I stayed in the Singaraya wing, with its own concierge  snack facility. The staff of this wing were second to none: friendly, warm, sincere  provide premium customer service. In fact, the last sentence applies to all the staff at the hotel. There are staff at this hotel who have remembered me from all five stays at this property! When they see me, they have a large sincere smile and welcome me. Now that's great service. I recommend so many things at this hotel, such as a 'grounds tour', a 'behind the scenes' tour, a 'poolside' massage, a bike ride of the local village. The Jimbaran Bay beach is the cleanest in Bali. The grounds are enormous, so even at full hotel capacity, you won't feel crowded (how many hotels can claim that?). The hotel is right next to the wonderful (and extraordinarly cheap) restaurants of Jimbaran Bay (which is where the second sets of bombs occured). There's no need to worry about your personal safety as the security of this area is terrific. I felt extremely safe the whole time I was there. Do yourself a wonderful favour (and also for the truly beautiful people of Bali too) and make your way to Bali and stay at this wonderful resort. I just can't wait to get back there for my sixth stay! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":495,"mention":"premium","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Premium-Cola"],"startOffset":488}]}
