{"text":"Great Location, Great Stay We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for six nights in November. After reading the reviews on this website, we were very excited to stay at this hotel considering the price was average with other hotels in NYC.The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful when we checked in. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a room with a stellar view, but they offered to put us in another room on a higher floor the following morning. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to move rooms after our first night, but their willingness to accommodate our request was refreshing.Our suite came with two queen sized beds, a large desk and kitchen. The kitchen is a huge BONUS! There is a small market store just steps away from the hotel and we picked up cereal, milk, yogurt, fruit, etc. and kept all of this in the fridge. We managed to save a bit of money by eating breakfast in the hotel before we ventured out each day. The kitchen comes with a full sized fridge, microwave, dishes, small oven\/stove and full sized sink. We even brought back leftovers from dinner one night at the nearby Lemongrass restaurant (great Thai food) and ate it the following evening, again saving a bit of money after a long day of sightseeing.The hotel has a very large gym and spa  even offers √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√πitness packages√à√\u2020\u2022?which are free for guests to use. We also had a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬©illow menu√à√\u2020\u2022?in our room which gave approx six options of pillows that could be requested through housekeeping. They even had a pillow that had speakers built into it to be plugged in to an ipod. We ordered the Swedish massage pillow and a buckwheat pillow √à√\u2020\u2022?great fun  great perk at this hotel.A couple of negative items √à√\u2020\u2022?The Barking Dog restaurant is not good at all. We went there because we had read on this site that it was pretty good and affiliated with the hotel (they provide the room service) but after eating there were very disappointed. There are a number of restaurants, pubs, etc. at the end of the block to the east of the hotel. Just take a few more steps down the block past the Barking Dog to other restaurants √à√\u2020\u2022?or even head a few steps to the west to the Lemongrass restaurant.Internet at this hotel is also not free √à√\u2020\u2022?we paid $42 for five days which is very pricey. Also, bottled water in the room is $7 per bottle. You are best off going to the market next door or even the drug store at the end of the block and getting a few litres of water for a couple of dollars.All in all, our stay was great. The Affinia Dumont is in a wonderful location and is a very comfortable hotel. We would stay there again and recommend this hotel to friends and family.
