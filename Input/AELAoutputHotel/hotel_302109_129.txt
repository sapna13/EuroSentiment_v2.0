{"text":"1 week of relaxation (complete with balcony) Stayed at the hotel from the 21\/10\/07-27\/10\/07 (6nights).Arrived at the hotel at the hotel at 07.30 and although you cant officially check in till 14.00hrs, i was suprised when the receptionist wanted to charge me an additional full nights stay (√ä√£¬¢175) even though my room was ready. I challanged the receptionist and they agreed to charge me for half a day.The Hotel is in general excellent.We stayed in the garden wing as my wife and i wanted a balcony. The room has everything you need, from toothpaste, cotton buds, sewing kit, shampoo, dressing gowns, slippers (some guests chose to wear these around the pool) tea + coffee, mini bar, you name it it was available and even if it wasn`t the hotel would have provided it for you. ( we asked for an extra sunbed on the balcony and it was there before i could say Boo)We had room service the first night, served on the balcony, the quality of service and the standard of the food was excellent.We slept in most days till lunch time (i blame the fabulous comfy beds) and the staff would always have our room made up late afternoon. There was also a turn down service.You can be served food and drinks around the pool all day and the food is brought to your sun lounger on a small table.The poolside staff also provide foot and full body massages and the pool is open till 10pm which is nice after you have been out all dayThere rerstraunts are always busy but are quite expensive, the quality and service are what you are paying for.The Blue bar on the top floor of the Tower wing is worth a visit, cocktails start about √ä√£¬¢15 ahead but the view is outstanding.The gymnasium is ultra modern and has a great view of the pool.On the down side, the hotel has many function rooms and is used by buisnesses during the week and for weddings at the weekend, however this should not put you off as the intereference is minimal.Taxis are plentiful outside the hotel entrance.The hotel is situated at the top end of Orchard RD and Orchard Road is a short walk (10 min max). Here you will find many bars, restraunts and shops, every one you have at home and more. One recommendation to travellers is goto the Irish Bar Muddy Murphys, about a 12 min walk from the hotel (dont worry you are perfectly safe in Singapore to walk about at anytime) Great atmosphere, good food, the Guiness is outstanding (especially when its free on Halloween) I was in Singapore 13 years ago and prices then seemed extortionate, now there is so much competition prices have stayed the same. Prices are about the same as the UK like for like.A truly fabulous holiday.
