{"text":"Don't eat the food--Only Benefit...Lose wieght! We got sick...Basically my advise is DO NOT eat the food! After 2 days my husband and I were in the bathroom more than I would like to admit. None on the mayonasie based items were ever on ice and all of the meats were under or over cooked. Please be very picky about what you decide to ingest! Also, we were on the bottom floor of a room and the room above us was leaking the toilet water and shower water into our bathroom. We called the hotel everyday and no one came to fix it. It was gross and stinky every day. There were days that our room did not get made up either.The only thing that was good were the drinks and the beach. This was the first trip I've taken in 10 years and every night my husband and I just felt dirty. We even met some other couples down there (quite a few) who had the same issues w\/ the food. Some of then, including us, threw up, got the cold chills etc. and it was not from drink the alcohol. The water will also make you sick because of the bacteria. If you even have a little cut on your leg it WILL get infected. I have a couple soars on my legs because I nicked myself from shaving and they are still infected! My hiusband and I are both going to the doctor tomorrow also because we are still having stomach problems. Next time we are going to St. Martin..... ","annotations":[]}
