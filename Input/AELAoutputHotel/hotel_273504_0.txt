{"text":"Taken for a ride! I am really disappointed and upset about the Kempinski. On the day of the check out, my beauty case with expensive beauty products and some other items (chanel shirt, hair product, etc.) were stolen from our room. It was the first day of our honeymoon. So you can imagine how we felt. We immediately told the management about the incident. They promised to search through the hotel and let us know should they find the missing items. After several phone calls (initiated from us), they came back with the information that they haven't found anything. After I have needled them for hours over the whole day, somebody from the management told me, I should send a letter and list all missing items incl. costs which they would forward to their insurance. I should not worry, the insurance is going to compensate me! (We were talking about approx. 500 Euros).The day after we left to Thailand.. however, back home we got a letter from the insurance company saying that they will not compensate me, as it is the fault of the guest to leave such items in the hotel room, especially after check out. I was shocked! After all, the hotel management does not care if valuable suff gets stolen. Moreover, they have given a wrong advice, that the insurance will pay and I shouldn't worry. (as they were fed up from us bothering them by calling every 30 minutes..). Only based on that information, we have given in.That's why I called the review title: Taken for a ride. I think with that the hotel management indirectly supports theft! They could have compensate us, especially as newly wed couple! I think it's pure brashness and the worst I have ever seen! Will never ever book a room there and cannot recommend it at all! BUT IF YOU INTEND TO BOOK A ROOM AT THIS HOTEL MAKE SURE YOU DON'T FORGET ANY ITEMS WHEN LEAVING THE ROOM\/HOTEL!!! IT'S GONNA BE STOLEN! ","annotations":[]}
