{"text":"If You Like the W Hotels, But Your Budget Doesn't, You'll Like the Mark Twain A friend recommended the Mark Twain to me as a great value alternative to the larger hotels. Boy, am I glad I took her advice! The room was small, but clean and recently updated, with some amenities typically found only in more expensive hotels, such as a flat screen TV, ceiling fan, nice wooden hangers not lashed to the closet rail, an in-room safe, and nicer bedding that included a duvet and pretty woolen throws. Happily, the non-smoking room had no trace of smoke smell, unlike other places I have stayed. It was easy walking distance from BART, Union Square, the theater district, cable car lines and lots of good restaurants. The hotel bar was intimate and friendly, serving high quality organic cocktails (yes, organic!). I did not try the neighboring Farm  Field Restaurant, but the menu looked promising (if pricey).A few detracting factors:-Fairly close proximity to the Tenderloin, and the panhandlers and occasional street-level whiffs of urine that go with it. While walking to a nearby restaurant on Geary, I suffered through several, um, compliments from male passers-by. The neighboring Hilton also presumably has this problem, though. Panhandling and lowlifes are really a problem in many parts of the city. SF could learn something from Rudy Giuliani...-Despite the Mark Twain's best efforts at updating, it's still an old building with: single pane windows that let in a lot of street noise, old fashioned steam radiators that worked overtime, even when off, necessitating opening the windows, shower water pressure and temperature that varied, and a tiny, tiny elevator (NYC prewar apartment dwellers will feel right at home)-Wi-fi that cost $10\/day (guess I'm spoiled by the free Wi-Fi at other hotels) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":367,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":363},{"endOffset":367,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":363},{"endOffset":367,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":363}]}
