{"text":"Nice hotel and a nice area despite some other comments I'm sure most people reading the other reviews and looking at any aerial shots of the location of the vincci condal mar may be a bit concerned about its location. all i can say is that its actually not bad at all when you get there... a block toward the diagonal mar from the hotel is a demolished building it isnt too bad though, and the streets are clean and generally quiet. I stayed at the condal mar whilst attending a conference and walked everywhere, including late night\/ early evening walks between the hotel and the diagonal mar, as well as towards Avinguda diagonal. Generally i found it very quiet, i was quite surprised by how many families and people walking there dogs there were in the area. A dog is clearly the pet of choice in this part of Spain. Generall the hotel was great, with one exception. Im sure most Brits will be a slightly perturbed that there aren't tea or coffee making facilities in any of the rooms. the rooms themselves are very tidy and extremely nice if you like something more modern. the atrium of the hotel is worth seeing, as is a trip up to the top floor where there is a bar area (used in the summer i assume) and a swimming pool (also used in the summer i assume) the views are great. Generally i was very happy. unfortunately i didnt have time to travel into the city due to the long days at conference, but the diagonal mar has plenty of places to eat and most were reasonably priced and the food excellent. This leads to my only gripes about the Condal mar. 1. The japanese 'fusion' restaurant is VERY expensive for what you get. the food was good but there was very little. i had three courses (max available) and was still hungry2. The bar area in the reception area, the private-ish seating is great but the service was absolutely terrible, many times myself and colleagues simply paid rather than order more drinks, we also noticed that quite a few locals came in had a drink and then walked off without paying. They really dont seem to be on the ball with that one on reception. If you stay and find it hard to get any service, go to reception, they seemed to be able to get hold of the barman wherever he was ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":21,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":17},{"endOffset":940,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":937},{"endOffset":950,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":944}]}
