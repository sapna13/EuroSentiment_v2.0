{"text":"Amazing hotel and location! On arrival at the Gran Bahia, we were amazed to see the most beautiful expansive lobby with fantastic marble floors. From the first moment, we found the service provided by the staff to be of excellent quality, everyone was so attentive and helpful. They have to be among the most friendly hotel staff I have experienced! Also, everyone we came across could speak English very well- no problems. Our room was on the first floor with a lovely pool view and was immaculately clean, with the maid ensuring this was so throughout our stay; with towel changes everyday and topping up our mini bar daily. We had fantastic AC which worked perfectly well, an essential whilst staying on this island! It is so hot!The pools were huge! There were plenty of sunloungers to go round and we never had any problems with those. The pool bars were also brilliant and a godsend on those hot afternoons! There were 5 huge pools, 2 being very close to the beach which was perfect. At those pools there was a daily program of entertainment, with all of the other pools being more quiet. The beach, well what can I say- AMAZING!! A big stretch dedicated to this hotel alone, with many, many palapas and loungers. This beach is one of the best on this whole island from my experience, and as beautiful as any other in the Caribbean. The snorkelling was also excellent and the hotel allowed free hiring of watersports equipment, which was great- we took out the catamarans and kayaks which were great to see the whole coast. Food was of a very high standard- everything was well presented and prepared, with amazing choice at the huge buffet restaurants, as well as in the other restaurants: French, Japanese, Mexican, Fish, European, Steakhouse, and Italian. We even had Lobster, Filet mignon and smoked salmon on two occassions! I would not say the food was of the standards you would find in the Four Seasons, however it was great. We NEVER had any tummy troubles at all. Also, just to mention, we only ever saw 2 mosquitos our entire stay!Evening entertainment was very good- a show of some sort every night in the theatre, continuing on in the Pueblo Principe 'village' where there was also a large sports bar, pool table area, diner, shops and fab nightclub open to 3am. Also, the lobby bars had good live music on most nights if you don't have the stamina for the shows or nightclub! Drinks and cocktails were always of good quality- but if you do want them to be stronger, make sure you ask. You can also take a look in the bar menu to check out the imported spirits as they are often included in the all inclusive option, such as Stolichnaya Vodka, which is great!Some tips I would give any potential visitor would be 1) ensure you have enough sun lotion 2) take an excursion out snorkelling and take some fruit or bread along, as you will attract a million different fish 3) take an excursion to see the island i.e the safari tours 4) enjoy yourself, you're on vacation! This hotel is absolutely fantastic and really is a great choice- one of the very best on the island- and I will definitely be back!!
