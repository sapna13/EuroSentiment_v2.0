{"text":"Excellent Hotel For Families And For Pre Cruise We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August before our cruise. We had booked two interconnecting rooms months in advance for the 4 of us. Booking was very fast and easy. Quick responses were recd to our e-mails and each time we asked a question a polite reply was given . I recommended the hotel to all my friends who were going on the cruise and in total 5 families ended staying at the hotel pre cruise. Rooms were excellent. Altho interconnecting, both rooms led to a small hallway which had its own door. It became like a little flat of your own. Breakfast was good too. Its very good value for money but only if you book it in advance as its half price otherwise you pay something like 12 euros. Its about 10 mins walk to the metro. Staff helpful but could do with a bit more smiling. if you get there very late at night there isn't much to eat altho you can help yourself to a free cup of strong coffee and free pastries downstairs . There is a supermarket across the road for your water etc; Downside is the road building noise which starts in the morning but otherwise a superb hotel . I think it is better than a 3 star. Beware of the taxi drivers as they charged me an exhorbitant 35 euros to get to the port. It should be no more than about 25 euros for 4 passengers and 4 luggage!!The rate for this hotel compared to other 3* is less yet overall it is better than a 3 star.I would add that all my other friends had nothing bad to say about the hotel. After the cruise we paid more and stayed at a 4* but wish had stayed at VIladomat!!
