{"text":"Great Find! I chose this hotel based on price and reviews and I wasnt disappointed. The price was good for the location. It is located close to Frankfurter Allee S-Bahn Station and there is also a U-Bahn station nearby. It is also possible to walk to Alexandraplatz from the hotel but it is easier to take public transport! The area itself is fine. The hotel is located off a busy street on a quieter side street so there are no problems with noise at night. Some people may be put off by the grafiti in the immediate vicinity... but you have to remember this is Berlin and Berlin especially former East Berlin is covered in grafiti! Berlin in general is a safe city. I have never felt unsafe at any time of the day or night. There is a shopping centre a short walk from the hotel as well and loads of places to eat for cheap locally. The rooms are clean, bright and spacious. The same with the bathroom. The room was cleaned every day and new towels were provided. There is no hairdryer in the room and if you need one then you have to get one at reception but you will need to leave a √à√\u2020√ü?0 deposit... they will give this back to you when you return the hairdryer. There is free internet in reception and the free breakfast buffet is fab. You have to leave your key in reception when you leave which was fine with us as we would rather this than have to worry about where we put our keys. Over all I enjoyed my stay at this hotel.
