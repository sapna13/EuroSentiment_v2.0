{"text":"Second Time at Gran Bahia--the good and the not so good This was our second visit to the Gran Bahia Principe Punta Cana, the last being May 2006. The Good: Being second time guests at the Bahia proved to have many perks. On day one--we received a bottle of rum, cigars, polo shirts, baseball caps and a small bottle of scotch! We have been repeat guests to other resorts and have never received such special treatment--we were very impressed! We stayed in Club Golden, and were in building #20--the first building on the beach--good location (but we prefer Building 1 on the Punta Cana side). We were able to make reservations for dinner for as many evenings as we wanted. We dined at the Italian, Mexican (our favorite!), the Japanese, the Meditteranean, the Beach BBQ. We also had reservations for the Gourmet, but did not make it due to a bad storm that evening. The service and food was very good at the Mexican, Japanese, Italian and Meditteranean--the BBQ it was not so good.Maid service was good--towel art furnished daily. One day the balconies were decorated with swans made from beach towels, and balloons were on all doors. The room was decorated with flowers several days also. Main pool bar was the best--German and Luis are the best bartenders on the resort--they definitely aim to please.The weather was good, with the exception of one evening thunderstorm. The beach is gorgeous, but was crowded. Towel game was definitely played. We were up at 7:;30 to secure our spot--most days there weren't many huts left by 9:00 a.m.The Not so Good: Entertainment seems to be very repetitive--same music, same activities each day. I feel this has gone downhill since our last visit. The lobby bars close at 11:00 sharp--leaving no alternative but the Pueblo or Karoke bar until the disco opens at 12:00. Other resorts lobby bars remain open until midnight. The entertainment in the Lobby Bars is also the same every night. The Karoke bar is very poorly run. A huge songbook, but most songs listed are not available, the management allows large groups to go up and SCREAM their song--not very amusing--many people got up and left. The person running it really doesn't seem to care. The rudeness of some of the non-English speaking patrons has been addressed here before. Naked children in the swimming pool--obviously no health department here! Overall, we had a good time at The Bahia--but we did have to make our own fun. We also met some great people from Missouri, Michigan and D.C. We definitely will return to Punta Cana, but most likely will try another resort.
