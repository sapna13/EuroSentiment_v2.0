{"text":"Rude or indifferent, you decide We just returned from a fantastic time in New England. I had returned to walk the state of my birth. Our only disappointment during our entire stay was with the Charlesmark Hotel. We generally choose boutique hotels when we celebrate...it was my birthday on the day we arrived. My husband had emailed the hotel-with little interest on recommending ways to make it special. We arrived already in awe of the city to be greeted with a lowered head at reception that did not raise and a monotoned...'Name'. My cheerfulness plummeted, but not detered. Perhaps this is 'uber chic indifference'...but it carried on throughout our stay. To my mind, it became rudeness. We dropped our bags and went down for a drink, 15 minutes early... the bartender was chatting with the receptionist-'not open' again, not interested. As a former actor in New York and therefore bartender. I was disappointed in their disinterest in their customers. I certainly would have offered an alternative to a couple that had just arrived from 14 hours of travel... A true reflection of our entire three nights...they were more interested in gossip than service...which was reflected in the conversation of fellow guests on our final morning. The room was small but accurately represented on their website. The bathroom was great with a terrific shower. In fact, once you made it past the cool indifferent corridors of reception, you could not fault the stay. The donuts and bagels in the morning were fresh and the coffee a perfect start for the day. I wouldn't go there again, which is too bad, as we will be in Boston several times a year...it would have been nice to find a place to come back 'where everybody knows your name'...but I am certain they had no idea or interest in who we were.
