{"text":"Clean but you can find better! We stayed at the Novotel Century for 7 nights in Jan 08. Being under the Novotel banner we expected a great place  excellent service but this was not the case.While the rooms were clean and modern the walls were paper thin. We could hear everything that went on in the other rooms which wasn't very nice. At 8am housemaids would start vacuuming the passages so no sleep-ins were allowed. The lobby had limited places to sit and where you could sit was a cafe. The waitresses would get annoyed if you sat there and didn't buy anything but this was all in the open of the reception area and you really wouldn't want to sit and eat a meal there with everyone walking through. As well the reception\/lobby area was terribly noisy as well and it was just so LOUD.The reception staff were average and the housemaid's broke my personal shampoo bottle and left it sitting on the bench leaking everywhere. The all you can eat buffet breakfast was ok but the staff need lessons in friendliness and manners. As we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a laptop we needed a computer to access the internet  he business centre charged $30HK for 15minutes but found out that you could easily walk across the road to The Pacific Coffee Company  for the price of a coffee access their free internet.For the price there are so many more places in the area that you can stay so I would strongly recommend staying elsewhere.
