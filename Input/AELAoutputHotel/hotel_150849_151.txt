{"text":"Do Not Go Here! My family and I have been to Punta Cana at least twenty times, and we have never stayed at a resort as terrible as this one. I don't know who would call this resort a 5 star hotel; Riu Bambu is anything but. We stayed at Riu Bambu for 11 days, from December 28 2007 through January 7 2008. The rooms were tiny and absolutely plain; there were no ocean or pool views. Apple Vacations, along with Riu Bambu information online and otherwise, advertises that they are an all-inclusive, 24-hour service resort. This is not true; this resort may be a 24-hour paradise for alcoholics because the bars are always open, but good luck trying to find a bite to eat after 11pm, and there are also times during the day where all restaurants are closed. The food in the restaurants is equivalent to that of a 2-star hotel. Even on New Years eve, there was nothing special in the restaurants or otherwise. There are two small pools in the resort, and they are very deep. There is no spa in this resort. I have never heard of any 5-star resort that doesnt have a spa, and only has one buffet restaurant and one other restaurant on the beach. The disco is a good ten or fifteen minute walk from the resort, and drinks are not included there. Also, you have to pay for food at the bar outside of the disco. There were also piles upon piles of cockaroaches crawling around the lobby and bar areas. The only good thing about this resort is the entertainment team; which was excellent. The shows were pretty good. If you are planning on booking a vacation in Punta Cana DO NOT go to this hotel. Go to another REAL 5-star hotel in Punta Cana. ","annotations":[]}
