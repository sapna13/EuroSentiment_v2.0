{"text":"VERY pleased!! highly recommend after reading some older reviews about disappointed guests  god forbid mice in the room, I immediately called my husband to see if we could cancel. we couldn't-or at least, he wasn't going to! SO glad that we didn't. Its definitely worth the extra money (and you save it later!!) if you stay on the 4th floor Gold Club level. you will be treated like royalty-immediately we walked off the elevator and were greeted by name. They gold club is the hospitality or concierge area that includes a library with books  DVDs you can borrow, chess  scrabble set up, a private office with computer\/printer\/internet, formal living room, dining area  kitchen-the best part!! they serve breakfast (we're talking full buffet-not just continental), happy hour with appetizers  cookies before bed. Throughout the day you have full access to the coffee, bar  coolers filled with beverages, bottled water, beers, juices, etc. the only charge is for wine\/beer\/ cocktaails and its the honor system- $5 per drink (very reasonable for Boston!).considering we ate breakfast there every morning and also had drinks  hors dourves a few times in the late afternoon we definitely saved money and feel the upgrade was wonderful  well worth it! Also, it was great to stop at the concierge desk and get suggestions\/directions\/weather report\/ reservations, etc on our way in or out.I honestly can say our stay was great and the staff was very friendly and helpful (on all levels-not just the 4th floor!).
