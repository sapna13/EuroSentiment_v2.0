{"text":"The Views Are Amazing...Be prepared to spend Lets start with the positives: The place is absolutely beautiful. Exactly as advertised. The grounds are amazing and suprisingly the photos of the pools are exactly what is there. The pools are clean...the place is just incredibly well kept. Contrary to the reviews early on, since the Wyndam has taken over perhaps, the staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The people behind the desk (Jessica) and the concierge were great help and there was absolutely no problem with the bill. It was easy to check in and check out. The drinks at the pool were great. We recommend the ziggy zaggy drink. They were a bit pricey but like any resort they were about ten bucks for a 8 oz cup. Its about right but they were great.I would advise you to rent a car. Rent a car at the airport if you are smart since the cabs out to Rio Grande are 65 dollars to begin with and the hotel offers a shuttle but charge per person. Plus, the restaurants on site are incredibly pricey and quite ridiculous as they do not offer a midrange restuarant for the average joe. We chose to rent a car and drove down the road to Antojitos Restaurant whih has moderately priced meals and were fantastic. Plus, Fajarado is about ten minutes away and there are a ton of restaurants down there. The parking is only 15 bucks on site for self parking which I recommend since you often got your car before the valet parkers did.Anyway, the place was a great resort. There are a ton a children there but there are areas of privacy. My advice is to also get a mountain view room as its away from the noise of the pool.There were some negatives. The first thing and this may come off in a weird way but you never feel as though the hotel is giving you anything. You pay all this money for a resort and you would think, you may get a free drink or some attention from the staff, perhaps some organized fun perhaps but there is nothing. Once you check in and give your credit card, there is this feeling of you against the hotel financially. There are drinks that cost a fortune and they charge you for everything. For example, I had complimentary golf tickets from the American Cancer Society and the course was gorgeous. Really nice. But, they charged the two of us $110 for club rentals and refused to take it off our bill. Now, thats understandable but lets get real as this was something we got for charity. It's little things like that including the 15 dollars for parking, the 4 dollars for a muffins or even using the expensive spa, there is not this sense that the resort will grant anything to you. Maybe I am asking too much but they charge for everything. There is one place called Davids cookies for breakfast which is decent as its somewhat cheaper and quick but the line is about a half hour. That is frustrating. Overall, we are a patient couple who enjoyed the trip overall. the resort is gorgeous and to sit by the pool is great. We actually bought a twelve pack of beer at a local supermarket and some wine and brought it out to the pool and had an amazing time.
