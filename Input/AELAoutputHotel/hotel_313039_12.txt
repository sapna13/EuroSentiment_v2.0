{"text":"Nice Hotel Stayed here for 3 nights from 1st - 4th February with a group of 8 girls. The hotel is lovely, modern, clean and the staff were very friendly and helpful.The only thing that upset us was that when we arrived at the hotel around 5.00 p.m. that we were told the kitchens don't open until 8.30 p.m. and we couldn't get anything at the bar or any room service. The kitchens are open from 7.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. then from 8.30 p.m. to 11.30 p.m.. In between those times there is no food available. We went out in search of somewhere to eat but there is not many restaurants around the area.The hotel itself is a 10-15 min walk to Las Ramblas when you get your bearings but the hotel ring for taxis for you and they are very cheap.The breakfast was nice with a great variety of foods both hot and cold. Plenty of bread, cakes, fruit, youghurt, cheese, meats, salmon, juices and cooked foods, e.g. omlettes, sausages, rashers, eggs. I tried some of the cooked foods and didn't really like them so I just stuck with toast, cheese  ham.The bar is quite small but the drink is very cheap. We had a few there before heading off to different locations.All in all I would stay there again but would prefer a hotel nearer the sites and within short walks of restaurants and bars etc..We didn't use the spa or pool facilities. We tried to book some treatments before we went but were told there was no facilities. I think maybe the staff didn't understand us but there are lovely treatments available, we just didn't avail!We had to fly to Reus Airport as our flights were cancelled to Barcelona. We used the bus transfer from Reus to Barcelona for √à√\u2020√ü?0 return. The only thing was the bus company only put one coach on and that was full, they did organise a 2nd coach after about 20 minutes. Coming back on it the same thing happened and this was a bit of a mess and there was a delay too. We didn't miss our flight but it just added to the travelling times so I would definitely fly directly into Barcelona the next time I travel there.We went on the open top bus on the Sunday but the heavens opened and we didn't get to see many sites, but these things happen and we'll just have to return to see them again!!
