{"text":"Better than Expected After reading all of the reviews we were confused as to what we would find once we arrived. We decided to stick to our reservations because of the price and on average all the reviews were good with only a few exceptions. We stayed at this location as a pre-cruise stay to take in the sites at seattle. We also datyed there for one night post cruise and it was a great exp as well. When we arrived at the property, I was pleasently surprised with the location as the bldg itself;some of the pictures do not do it justice. The lobby area was very nicely decorated, clean, and nice to walk into. The staff was awesome, and since our room was available we were able to check in sooner. When we got to our room, we had a King suite and it was awesome. We requested the non-construction side since we had read some of the reviews. Our room faced the city and we could see the Space Needle from our room. The room was like a small apartment. We had a sink, microwave and fridge. The room was separate from the living room. Some one had writtten that the beds were the best beds that they had slept on, and we agree. The beds and pillows were awesome. It was the best beds we had ever slept on in any hotel. The hallways were very clean, room smelled nice as well. My parents stayed in another room and they had a balcony room that faced the city and it was awesome as well. Our main concern when staying in a hotel is cleanliness, beds and overall look of the room. This location had it all as far as we are concerned, and we are an extremely picky group when it comes to hotel stays. The breakfast area and what they offered was awesome as well.They had waffles that you could make and they had on some of the days biscuits and gravy. The location was in walking distance to alot of the locations. And if you wanted to visit the waterfront its was like 8 dollar cab ride. They now are adding 2.00 to each of the fares for gas, but even so for us it was 5.00 a couple. They are right next door to 2 car rental places where you could rent a car if you wanted too. Overall this hotel was better than expected and we were very pleased on the nice stay that we had there. Those that wrote a 'bit creepy' and the worst stay might have expierenced having bad rooms or the const side, but for us it was great.
