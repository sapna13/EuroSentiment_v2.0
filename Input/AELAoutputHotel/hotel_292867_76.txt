{"text":"Loved it !! :) My husband and i stayed at this hotel for our honeymoon, we had spent most our money on having a brilliant wedding day and had little left over for our holiday!Ive been to The Dom Rep 5x before and my husband had never even left britain!!This hotel was a 3* at the time so i expected 3* not 4* or 5* like some people do!All i will say is the room was clean, sheets changed regularly and the air conditioning was out of this world - so cold i had to turn it off at times!! The maid was a Gem, i left her a little note on my first day asking for diet coke only in my fridge, and a small tip 2 -3 dollars and my fridge was 'packed' solid' with the stuff every day!!Plus she left us flowers etc in our room!!There were 3 pools! one with a bar which was a little busy and too loud for myself!!One between the two hotels which was quiet and then there was the pool next to the Tropical Princess, this was amazingly quiet with little fountains and a bridge!! Very easy to get a sunbed, however there was lots of Americans who used the free pool towels to reserve sunbeds at the pool while they went to the beach!! - So we played them at there own game!!The beach was lovely, the sea was gorgeous the best so far, (do not go to the North as the beach is not that nice!!)The food in the hotel was 'typical 'all inclusive pizza, pasta, chips then rice salad etc with a few dodgey looking meat dishes!! - use your common sense when eating, people seem to leave this at home on holiday!! (Its not the uk and Hygiene standards are lower - GET OVER IT!)Which brings me on to a review i read earlier about the birds, Yes birds fly into the Buffet restaurant, its open air .... What do they expect!!Occasionally a family of Peacocks would walk past your table, personally i found this quite charming as they were cute!!There were other restaurants that you had to pay a supplement for and when you check out you pay for these, about $10 a head - except they didn't charge us at all!! If you are looking for excitement at night then this is not the place for you! The animation team try and put on a good show but by the time they've spoken in 4 - 5 languages youv'e missed the punchline or your just totally lost!! - we gave up!!The one bad thing i would say about this hotel is the 'lucky lucky men' who come into the complex with there stalls. They come in about twice a week, and they can get quite pushy and occasionally rude!This would have ruined our holiday if we had not made it into entertainment for ourselves - getting from the pool to our room was like running a gauntlet!! - it was Funny!!If you go on any trip go on the 007 speedboats, you drive your own mini speed boat over the sea and go snorkelling!! - this was amazing however i did have to tell my husband to slow down as he thought he was a speed demon!!!!When taking into concideration reviews from this site remember people are after different things and have different expectations!!We ignored the bad reviews and am glad we did!!You get what you pay for we only paid around √ä√£¬¢600 each and loved it!!To say my husband had never left Britain - now weve booked to go to cuba!!P.s One last thing, we visited the shop near the lobby most days for an ice cream - Dont bother its free in the creperie!! Which is right next to the pool we were at!! We didnt discover this till two days before we left!!
