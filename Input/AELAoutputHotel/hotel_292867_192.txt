{"text":"Fabulous Vacation! We stayed at the Caribe Club Princess from Jan.1 - Jan.5th.I rarely write reviews, but after reading some of the negative ones I feel the need to comment.This resort is absolutely beautiful. The room was clean and comfortable. The towels and other linens may not be ready as soon as the room is cleaned because they are being washed. I think that the staff must get very frustrated by the amount of laundry to be done. Especially since there is a need for many self centered peope to get hotel beach towels, save chairs at the pool AND at the beach (some rude people get up at 6am to save seats and then go back to bed!). This is so foolish. It usually rains in the early morning, briefly. The towels get wet, the selfish tourists trade the wet towels for dry ones, then complain that they don't have towels in their rooms. How many washing machines do you think the resort has???It is annoying to get to the beach or pool and see rows of lounge chairs covered in towels with no one there. In my opinion, the only problem with the resort is the inflexible tourists who think of no one but themselves,The food..well.....it is very good. I recommend the buffet because you can see what you are eating and it is all fresh and delicious. The fish is amazing.I also recommend a trip to the spa. It is lovely.If you want the comforts of home...stay home!You must be flexible and kind. The Dominican people work very hard and they take pride in what they do. Go and relax, it is worth the trip!!
