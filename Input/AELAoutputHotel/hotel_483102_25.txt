{"text":"Good hotel in great location. My wife and I stayed for 3 nights in early Feb 08, booked on the H10 website and paid √à√\u2020√ü?11 per night BB. Taking the advice of a previous reviewer, I included a request for a street-facing room on an upper floor - which we got.The hotel is very well located, only about 100m from Plaza Catalunya. Our room was clean, comfortable and reasonably spacious. Everything worked satisfactorily. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a busy street and the noise level is high with the window open, but no problem with it closed.Breakfast in the basement dining-room was an excellent buffet selection, with plenty of hot and cold options. Well worth taking as part of a package. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have lunch or dinner in the hotel.Two free internet terminals in the foyer, adjacent to the bar. The bar is a bit lacking in ambience, and customers, though the bar-man was friendly and the drink was reasonably priced. Some free snacks are available there in the afternoon.Generally, staff were friendly and helpful and most spoke good English.My only √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âomplaint√à√\u2020\u2022?is the quality of internal sound-proofing. We were there on √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?\u201AÑ¢uper Tuesday√à√\u2020\u2022?(the US primaries) and I found myself listening to the CNN coverage, as the guy in the next room had the tv on till 4-5am. Occasional noises from corridors and other rooms could also be clearly heard, but thankfully nothing too sustained and intrusive. But you could be unlucky with your neighbours and that can be very irritating.Overall, an excellent hotel at the price, we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° certainly be happy to stay there again.Eating out: Senyor Parellada, C. de la Argentaria, is worth a visit - nice ambience, good food, not too expensive. The hard to find Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ de L√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©√πcademia, off C. de Jaume 1, is worth finding. Excellent food. Flamant, on C. d√à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬©¬¢nrique Grandos, is a nice place for lunch or dinner, very affordable, nice bistro ambience, ok food.
