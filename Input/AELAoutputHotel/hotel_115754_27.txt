{"text":"Average stay at the Springhill Suites We stayed at the Marriott Springhill Suites from November 21-24. We drove from California-terrible traffic from Salem to Vancouver WA. Arrived at 9:30pm. We were immediately helped from our car, however, there was no one to bring up our luggage so my husband brought a luggage cart to the car to unload. Since we had been driving for a long time, we sort of had things all over the car. The vallet was sort of in a hurry to park our car and we were unable to remove everything. By the time we got to our room we realized we were missing several items. We had to wait for the vallet to come back and then ask for the keys and directions to our car. We then had to hand carry many items to the room. The room was nice. However, the sofa bed looked a bit old and tired. Unfortunantly, the beds were only doubles. It was my husband and I and our daughter. All rooms have only double beds unless you order a king room. Most hotel rooms I have stayed in offer two queen beds. Room was very stuffy and there was no way to create a more unstuffy environment, we even turned on the A\/C and ran the fan. The toilet was not in very good working order and we had to call housekeeping on several occasions. On Thanksgiving day there was no room service until 5:00pm. We were visiting with family so we wanted some appetizers in the room. We had to go down to the bar and pick these up. Also, not much space in the room to eat. The breakfast is fair, but very boring with styrofoam plates and plastic silverware. My grandson did enjoy the indoor pool and sauna. That was very nice. Parking $18.00 - when our son and his family came to visit, his parking fee was $10.00. Overall check in and out was very easy, our room was clean, beds comfortable but too small and staff was friendly and helpful. I think on my next trip to Seattle I will look a smaller hotel less commerical hotel. ","annotations":[]}
