{"text":"Not a 5-star, but a good 4-star I stayed at the Fairmount in December 07 during 7 nights. Halfway through the week, it went from being called the Raffles Plaza to become the Fairmount.I stayed on the Raffles Inc. floor (25th or 26th floor) in the North Tower. It was a huge corner room with big 2 big balconies (1 towards CHIJMES and the other towards the Financial District) and great finishings. I did not see the issues other reviewers saw about tired carpeting and bathroom, everything looked renovated (and trust me that I looked).I expect to be blown away by 5-star hotels. This hotel is a 4-star level.The biggest complaint is that the internet service was not free. One had to call reception, get a code, enter it everyday (and some days it did not work, but we were reimbursed), and I don't remember the price but it was not cheap. For a high-tech country like Singapore, that is just ridiculous. Sure we had access to the internet in the business lounge, but who wants to wait around for a computer to free up and have people lurking around?I loved the mattress and the electronic controls in the room. A few disappointments when the hotel changed management: 1\/ the bath supplies offered by Raffles were more exotic and luxurious than the ones offered by Fairmount, 2\/ No more chocolates on my pillow! 3\/The turndown service became less efficient.The breakfast and happy hour at the Raffles Inc lounge were phenomenal. All kinds of choices, and all delicious.The service was spotty. We noticed that some customers were mostly ignored, while others were served promptly. Luckily for us, we were always in the latter group. Some of the reception desk people were professional but cold, others were very helpful (I dislike over-the-top, fake American-style friendliness, but expect a minimum of assistance).Great location for everything, although it's faster to walk half a block to get a taxi rather than wait at the hotel door because the traffic blocks the entrance for the taxis.So overall very good, but not fabulous.
