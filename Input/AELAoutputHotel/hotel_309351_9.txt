{"text":"Fantastic hidden gem .... Overall, the trip exceeded our expectations. Upon our late night arrival a driver picked us up at the airport and drove us to the resort. When we arrived at the resort, Nils the owner greeted our arrival and joined us for a snack of gourmet tuna sandwiches and mojiteas (a house speciality). We then retired to our lovely bungalow complete with an outdoor shower and private jacuzzi. We woke up the next day to paradise. The entire resort has an zen-like energy about it. From the smell of fresh morning dew to the soft sounds of a Balinese flute. All in all, the highlight of the trip was hands-down the staff and the food. The staff at Damai Lovina provided personalized attention to our every need from arranging snorkeling trips to a chauffeur driven tour of northern Bali. Plus, they were just super-warm and friendly.We had most of our meals at the rooftop restaurant which has a 360 degree panoramic view of the surrounding area. It was nothing less than spectacular! Although we were miles away from the hustle and bustle any major city, the food was 5-star gourmet quality. From the tuna tartar, to the special Damai bouillabaisse to the delicious pineapple tart. I also had a few spa treatments in their outdoor spa. I started all my treatments with a foot bath of regional Balinese flowers. When I closed my eyes, I felt my stress just melt away. I felt so far away from the crowds, noise and pollution of my every day city life. Our trip was so amazing that we decided to get married at Damai Lovina. More details to come....
