{"text":"Royal Plaza - no place to sleep We booked this hotel , requesting a quiet room as we are country dwellers , paying US$196.00\/night for deluxe room and stayed four nights in April 2007 .We had the worst hotel stay of our entire life .First room we were sent to had no bath tub , we paid additional $35\/ night for upgraded room with bath tub .Second room we were provided was on floor 7 , next to lift shaft and airconditioning plant room . Room change No. 2 soon happened along with our complaint to management to attempt to read guests preferences .Third room was on level 12 , doing quite well untill adjacent three rooms began a meeting \/ conference in doorways and passages at 8.30pm . We requested these guests to allow us to enjoy our ammenities without disruption and noise from fellow guests .No joy there , room change No.3 soon after .Room No.4 was great , had bath , but no hot water .Hotel attempted to rectify water temperature , without success .Kept awake by fellow guests with loud television and room doors banging closed , most of the night .Second night , again noise from room doors slamming closed and fellow guests .Third night complained to management about noise from adjacent room , and management resolved that incident very well , evenually obtaining us some sleep .Fourth night , now quite sleep deprived , we now had hot water to bath in , but again very little sleep .Management apologised , sent flowers and tee-shirts to room , but what we required was a change of hotel .
