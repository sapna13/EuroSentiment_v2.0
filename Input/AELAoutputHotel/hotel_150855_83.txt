{"text":"Lucky they have that beach and sea It was my second travel to Punta Cana! The first time (three years ago) I stay in Fiesta Beach now Palladium and that was really a 5 stars (4 stars)! Now I am completely disappointed, the food was always the same day after day. There was no animation on the beach, and I never heard merengue music or dance! Some shows happen at night in a hot closed space (not in open air) we always give up and went to a fresher place. The room was spacious but need urgent new equipment; everything is old enough to continue serving the guests! What a five stars! The bath was so old that had many marks to remind you! The furniture√à√\u2020\u2022?no words! Black was the colour in some parts. Anyway we sleep! But I thought that five stars could be more pleasant and that is a feeling that you just have when you are on the beach or on the warm sea waters, and for that I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ happy to know that this hotel is not responsible for!!!We were 2 adults and a young boy with 6 years old. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ drink alcohol so water was our drink! And guess what? One day, after request 1 big bottle three times to the reception (all morning waiting), we went to a mini market to buy it, don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ forget that this is an all inclusive hotel and with five stars, and you cannot drink the water on this country. After that a was so upset that I call again to reception saying that a have a children that was completely water needed and in desperate act I went to a shop to buy a crucial liquid to survive with that high temperatures, but it is true that alcohol was there like a bar and not a room! And after that they were ok just for 2 days and I were again asking water for the room! One day when we were dinner we saw a young man with a little baby (6 or 7 months) in the reception with the bottle on the other hand asking for a new bottle! So even if you have a baby that is no important! And what about kids club! Before going to Punta Cana I try to see some pictures of the kids club, and I never found it! You now why? Because that is just a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Øirage√à√\u2020\u2022? They say that exist but you cannot see√à√\u2020\u2022?Finally in the last day we ask for reception someone to take our bags and once again this five stars hotel took more than 30 minutes and two phone calls! So if this was my first time in this country I definitely never return again! But I know that we can have good hotel service in this wonderful land√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√\u2020ut not in Riu Taino!!!Maria Morais - Portugal we stay from 21th till 28th of May!
