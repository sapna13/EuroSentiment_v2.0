{"text":"Don't Go!! Beware!!!! What a disaster!!! We arrived to an open air, one room lobby with two hard benches - and it only went from bad to worse. The entire place was under construction. There were only 2 buildings open and our group occupied 5 of the rooms. The rooms were just opened and not yet finished. Our view out of our room was construction trash and instead of the music of the Dominican - we had jack hammers, drills, and other construction equipment going the entire time. Our air conditioner in the room did not work and we left the sliding glass door open (no screen) only to be attacked by bugs. They would only give each room one key which operated the power and air. If one of the occupants wanted to leave for some reason, the other was without power. The staff told us we could not walk to the beach as it was not safe and we would have to take a bus which ran every two hours. We attempted to make the best of it and headed off to the beach. When we returned, the entire place was full of smoke as they were burning construction trash and we were locked out of our rooms as there was a computer glitch. We spent over an hour in the halls waiting for the manager to open the doors. Once we were in, we were told that if we left the key would not work and the manager would have to let us in. The dinner buffet was exactly the same as the lunch buffet. We checked out the next day and moved to the RIU - and were we ever glad that we did. What a difference. No IFA in our future - sorry...but I can't even believe that they would rent rooms. Our visit was meant to be a relaxing Thanksgiving vacation - not a nightmare!! ","annotations":[]}
