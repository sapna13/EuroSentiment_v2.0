{"text":"Just OK...and Be Careful Booking Your Room My family of 4 joined my wife's extended family (20 people) for 6 days there between Christmas  New Years Some had been to other Occidentals and recommended the Royal Club...good thing. It costs a lot more, but there are definite advantages. Food: Everyone's taste in food is different, but the consensus in our group was that the food outside the Royal Club was not very good...lots of choices, just not very high quality. We've travelled a lot, and there is a difference between cultural differences of food, and quality. Culturally different food still needs to be well made and served hot, to be enjoyed. All of the buffet food was very salty, even the fresh steamed veggies. The Beach Club buffet was better than the main buffet. The La Reses and the Italian place were OK, but more for the change of scenery than the food. Everyone loved the pizza and the tacos...but the reviews of the Home Rum food were just OK. The service in the buffets was OK, but quite slow at the Royal Club. The staff were very friendly and accomodating, and most of them understood enough English. I found a little (un poco) Spanish goes a long way. Even if you don't speak Spanish well, they really seemed to appreciate if you try. In general the cleanliness of the restaurants seemed good. We drank only bottled water, but the ice was local. Some in our group had stomach issues, but this is to be expected in poor countries like the DR. The Royal Club: Costs a lot more and you get MUCH better food (if you don't mind leisurely dining). For the group, if we had not been able to eat at the Royal Club, the trip would not have been deemed a success. Most of the rooms were fine, except some had A\/Cs that were so loud you could not sleep. In our 3rd floor room, the bathroom had a leak in the ceiling that got progressively worse every time it rained (most nights). When it rained hard, our room and another 3rd floor room had water leaking from the ceiling everwhere. When we told the staff, they shrugged their shoulders as they said they would report it to maintenance. No one ever came. Our toilet leaked where it was caulked to the floor...complained 3 times but no one came. Fridge was well stocked by the maid and plenty of towels and hot water. No power outages. Be careful when you book the Royal Club...their room descriptions border on deceptive advertising and you can get ripped off. Some in our group paid extra for Ocean Front rooms. What we got was a room that had a front door facing the ocean...300 yards away, with buildings in between! The ocean was only visible from the front door on the 3rd floor rooms. You only see the ocean as you leave your room. 1st  2nd floor rooms had no view at all. When we complained, they said that is ocean front ...it faces the ocean. Some of the rooms were booked and paid in advance for Junior Suites, but were given Standard Rooms. The travel agent is working on getting a refund for the difference...time will tell. Everything else: Beach is clean and magnificent. Pools are good. Shows were entertaining...this is not Vegas so don't expect a fancy show. Facility is spotless everywhere. The salespeople are everywhere and obnoxious but backed off with a firm no thanks (saying No gracias seemed to incite them to be more aggressive since they thought you would understand them better in Spanish). They are even on the beach from other resorts trying to get you to stay there next time! The snorkeling and Swim with the Dolphins were reported as OK. My family didn't go as we have done lots of snorkeling. My kids enjoyed the windsurfing lessons. No issues at the airport coming or going. This is a 3 star hotel, tops.
