{"text":"Charming with a great location We stayed from 20 to 24 June in room 36 facing the park. I'll start out with the negatives because there were only a few main ones: the elevator was broken and there really isn't a view of the park. The elevator broke after our first night, so we would come home from a day sweltering in Paris to another few flights of stairs we had to climb. That sucked, but I understand that it was just bad luck. We left before it was fixed.When I booked the room, I expected to have a view over the park. I probably should have researched more, because you get a view of the government building across the street, huge trees and part of a clay tennis court. No big deal, but just adjust your expectations accordingly. You will not be overlooking magnificent gardens. The hotel is narrow, so I can't imagine the view is any different from any other room streetside.The shower was nice, with both a handheld and a rainshower head. I noticed that for some reason the water was a lot hotter in the handheld, so I didn't use it, but I'm a wuss about hot water, so most people would be fine. The toiletries were scented with a fairly masculine scent: Chrome by Azzaro.My husband didn't like the breakfast, but it was about the same as most European breakfasts. If you like yogurt or cereal you'll be fine. I was happy with it. Usually three or four different croissants and rolls, two different loaves of bread for cutting your toast (please use the napkin provided to hold the loaf so your icky fingers don't get all over it! I saw a typical ugly American couple holding the bread with their bare hands and I was very grateful I'd already cut my slice off). They have fresh fruit and a variety of teas plus coffee. You can order American breakfast food a la carte, for an additional fee.The pillows kinda sucked and it took us a couple nights to get them just right, but they are your standard down pillows, just not as stuffed as others we've encountered. The bed was your typical European firm bed. Adequate.The room had a nice closet with some shelving, and plenty of drawer space. A desk for writing too. The room was a small but well planned space.We liked this hotel and would stay there again. The staff was very nice and accommodating, and they have a killer gym for a hotel of this size (though I'll admit I was too tired from walking all day to use it, they had one of those cool Power Plates.) The decor is charming and makes you feel very much like you're in an old, elegant home in Paris. You have to walk a little to get to the metro (we used St Sulpice most of the time) but it's not bad at all and there are plenty of restaurants within walking distance. Check out Aux 2 Olivers: the best meal in two weeks of traveling Europe. The proximity to the Luxembourg Gardens was a big plus for me. They close fairly early in the evening, so be mindful of the time. We were very grateful for the quiet location when we discovered they were having a city-wide music festival on the 21st. We went out walking into crowds of people near the Pantheon where bands were set up in the street blasting all kinds of music. Very fun! But when you're tired and want to go to bed, you wouldn't want your hotel above that, so we were happy that ours was in a quiet location. A couple we met on a Segway tour (go! it's totally fun!) had their hotel right above one of the bands set up and they didn't stop playing until 5 am!There is no room service, but they have some arrangement for take out from what I can tell. There is no iron in the room, but when we asked to have a couple of shirts ironed, they did it for free and with a fairly good turn around time, so that was nice.If we want to stay near the Latin Quarter again, we'll pick this hotel for sure.
