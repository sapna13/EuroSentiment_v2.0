{"text":"HORRIBLE STAY I will begin how most others did, the beaches were beautiful, the water could not have been more blue.The outside of the Resort was beautiful and that was all that was good.The service was horrible, they treat you like your an idiot. Upon arrival we find out you have to pay for the safe. It was basically pay for the safe or have the maids steel from you. There rooms were bad. We had no lock on our back door and we were on the 1st floor. They gave you an ironing board but with no iron. We called for an iron and never got one. We had no clock in the room and when you sat on the beds you sank into the middle.The food was terrible. There are two lunch buffets with low-grade food. For dinner there was one buffet and a couple of restaurants. The restaurants are so booked that you can only eat at one by the end of your trip. You only get 3 coupons to eat at the restaurants, which is no biggie for us because they were terrible. We ate at the Dominican restaurant and were sick for the rest of the vacation.Overall, if you want to go to the Dominican Republic do not stay here. We spoke to many other people on the resort who were not happy with there stay as well. To be honest, I have traveled all over the Caribbean, and I would never go back to DR again. We met others from the other resorts and they all sound the same as ours, BAD! If you want a good vacation try the Bahamas or Puerto Rico. ","annotations":[]}
