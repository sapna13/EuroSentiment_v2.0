{"text":"Fantastic hotel - will be going back asap! A colleague and myself stayed at 1898 at the beginning of July for a work trip. We both work in the fashion industry and would be bringing clients back to the hotel so we needed somewhere that would impress - and it certainly did.Because the hotel is newish, we managed to get quite a good rate on the room. It was around the same price as some of the more traditional hotels on La Ramblas but you got so much more for your money. The hotel is really modern but has an old school charm, for example dark oak walls and marble floored bathroom. It adds a cosy feel without losing the sleekness.Oh by the way, bedrooms have a free pillow menu!Breakfast was great and catered for all the health freaks to full on english breakfast and cakes.Location could not be better - you're right in the middle of the centre but we were never disturbed by noise since the rooms are sound-proof.I was on a work trip so only managed to check out the rooftop pool once but it was so lovely sitting on the deck with a cocktail. The views of the city were great and it was so quiet from where we were - you would forget you were in a busy city.I had a full body massage which was so relaxing that I almost fell asleep at dinner later on!We will be going back next year and so will our clients - everyone loves it!
