{"text":"Gorgeous hotel in excellent location I booked the hotel on a special rate through a Leisure Direction offer in a newspaper - the agent had been extremely complimentary about it, and having done a fair amount of research after booking, I had high hopes and high expectations - I am delighted to report that these were all met.First things first - Location! The hotel is excellently located just off the Champs Elysees - go to George V metro, take the George V exit, and go to the right of Louis Vuitton. Take the second road on the left and it is 100m down the road - how easy is that?!!Having read the various reviews below, I decided to upgrade to a superior room, and so cut a deal with the hotel - so was especially pleased to find that we had in fact been upgraded to an executive room. Ludevine, who I had been in correspondence with was the person who checked us in, and was charming, setting the tone for the whole stay. Rather than the normal reception area where you stand on one side, and the staff on the other, the reception is extremely civilised - all parties sit down at a desk!Our room was on the 6th (top) floor, overlooking the courtyard, so was incredibly quiet. I think it may be the red one that features on the website - it certainly seemed to match the photos (other than one picture now being on a different wall! It was fairly spacious for a Paris hotel (having stayed in some absolutely tiny rooms in Paris in the past), was very well appointed and had a great bathroom - the water pressure was high so the bath filled quickly and the shower was powerful, the hot water was very hot, and the smellies supplied were good. Also had bathrobes and slippers.Breakfast was included on our deal, so we had it every day - if it is not included you may think you don't want to pay 21 euros - but as they serve until 11am,, you could have a late breakfast and save on buying lunch! The choice was excellent - various juices, including freshly squeezed orange, glasses of yoghurt with fresh fruit, or commercial ones if you preferred, a good selection of cold meats and cheeses, fruit salad and fresh fruit, smoked salmon, crabcake, asparagus, salad, and hot eggs and sausages, cakes, pastries etc - so you are bound to find something you like!! There were also a selection of newspapers - Le Figaro, International Herald Tribune, The Guardian and El Pais.We had drinks in the bar one evening - the bar area is delightful - a winter garden, comfy chairs and sofas and a very helpful bar man. We had champagne cocktails, which were delicious, and about the price you would expect in a 4* hotel in Paris!Nearby there are plenty of places to eat - we tried Maison D'Aubrac in Rue Marberf - but there are lots of restaurants in that street so you should find something to please. We also tried Noura at 27 Ave Marceau - their posh one is at 21, but the food is excellent at 27, and the prices are cheaper! If you like Lebanese cooking, this is highly recommended. Further afield, we can highly recommend Maceo on the Rue de Petit Champs, near the Palais Royal and Le Petit Chatelet, next door to Shakespeare  Co book shop opposite Notre Dame on the left bank. (Rue de la Bucherie)If you are a museum buff, try the Musee Guimet, which is about 10 mins walk away from the hotel - it is the museum of Asiatic Art and was an excellent find - and is free until 30 June as an experiment (as is the Musee Cluny in the Latin Quarter, so do visit to help persuade the authorities that free museums are the way to go!!)Apologies for the long review - but do stay in this hotel - it really is as good as everyone suggests!
