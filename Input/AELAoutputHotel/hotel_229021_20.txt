{"text":"Great hotel in fantastic location Mrs. Geek and I stayed at this hotel for 6 nights in early April and we were very, very happy. The hotel is located in the heart of the city, right in the middle of the main pedestrian street between the Duomo and the Piazza della Signoria. Having such a central location meant that we could return to the hotel between museum visits, and walk to everything we wanted to see. I was attending a geek conference across town, but walking to that location was no problem.We got a very large room by European standards, with a queen bed and a settee or couch. (It was called a deluxe double but might have actually been a triple.) We were on Floor 4 (5th floor for N. Americans) overlooking the main street. The street crowds were loud with the window open, but completely muffled by great window insulation when the windows were closed. We also had a small window in the bathroom with a view of the towers of the Bargello museum. We came to love the bells that start ringing at 7am. The bathroom was also large, with a long tub that two people could squeeze into, and a bidet.Breakfast each morning was wonderful, and included the usual European items as well as bacon and scrambled eggs.The service at the reception desk, in the breakfast room, and the other staff was polite and professional.Geek factors: * There were very few accessible electrical outlets for charging geek toys. * Wireless Internet was available, but it was a pay service from a local provider. The cost structure was awkward (e.g., 1 hour connection was too short but the 5 hour option was too long), and the speed performance was so bad to be almost unusable. A reliable Internet connection should be standard for a hotel of this class, and this was a dissapointment. ","annotations":[]}
