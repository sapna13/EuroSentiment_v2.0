{"text":"Fantastic location for price! I stayed in a single bedroom with shared bathroom facilities  breakfast included for 45 euros a night. The location of this hotel is so central and why I chose to stay in it . The views from the top of the hotel on the 6th floor terrace are fabulous- lots of great photo opportunities. The breakfast is simple and the hotel is very basic but for such a reasonable price, I thought it was great. I could go out sightseeing, do a bit of shopping and then drop the shopping at the hotel before heading out again. If you just use the hotel as a base it's terrific. As for the dodgey lift people keep mentioning: I only used it to go to reception (on the 5th floor) or the top terrace. My room was on the second floor so I used the stairs. There's stairs everywhere in Europe so you have to get used to that. The hotel is only a ten minute walk from Santa Maria Novella, the main train station. I would not recommend having a hire car while you are there as there is no parking. However you don't need a car because you can get to all major sights on foot. Florence has very strict car access laws anyway, no matter which hotel you stay in. If you are someone who likes staying in a fairly nice hotel then this may not be for you but if your looking for budget accommodation in an awesome location- go for it  enjoy the amazing city of Florence!
