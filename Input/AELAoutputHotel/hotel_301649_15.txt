{"text":"Great Rating for the Legian The Legian - Bali is an outstanding hotel --- the room, the accomodations, the staff were exceptional. I was travelling solo in Bali for the week and the hotel staff went out of their way to welcome me and ensure my comfort.The room was beautifully understated --- lovely Balinese\/Asian style with a veranda complete with teak furniture -- table, chairs, chaise loungues. Spa style bathroom with full amenities. There was also a small kitchenette stocked with tea, coffee, drinks and snacks, a fridge. For starters, I was greeted at the airport by their driver, who had cold water and chilled towels to refresh me after my flight. When I arrived at the hotel, I was greeted with a fresh fruit cocktail, additional chilled facial towels while I was checked in.I had a private suite on the ground floor -- in a private corner by lovely water gardens overlooking a temple. When I entered the room, the staff had lit incense and had some lovely Balinese- style new age music playing. They had set up a tray of fresh sushi, fresh fruits along with a iced bucket of champagne. I was impressed and to tell the truth, sorry that I had only myself to enjoy the experience with. The fruit basket was replenished daily with jack fruit, snake fruit, bananas, passion fruits ...The grounds were equally lovely, as was the spa (though quite expensive --- you would do better to go to the local spas in Seminyak --- they are excellent, clean and inexpensive. That said, you can't beat the convenience of the on site spa and their staff is excellent.The food was fantastic --- I skipped the am brunch and asked the staff to prepare Balinese dishes for me -- I was delighted with the food. I had martabak --- it's almost like an egg strudel --- thin layers of seasoned eggs in won ton type wrappers; each day the staff prepared a special dish for me. The staff respected my privacy and at the same time went out of their way to socialize --- I think they were a bit perplexed as to why I was travelling alone --- and maybe felt a bit sorry for me.The Legian is right on the beach and it is a spectacular beach. It's easy to go horseback riding, rent surf boards, boogie boards, etc there. Also wonderful for simply walking the beach or going for a swim -- though the surf is very strong there. Outside the Ku-De-Tah (next door restaurant\/bar) there is usually a surf line up. Even if you don't surf -- its fun to watch the others catching the waves.So, if there were any negatives, it would be that the Legian could be a bit sedate --- the other guests were families, couples and not very sociable or inclined to conversations. I travel extensively by myself and usually meet people to dine with or for drinks --- not the case here. The lounge at the Legian was very quiet as was the ocean side bar. That said, the ocean side bar had beautiful sunsets.I would definitely recommend the Legian for couples and even families, also for solo travellers who enjoy privacy, rest  relaxation.
