{"text":"Great Vacation!! Well, I will make this short and sweet. Travelled with about 12 other family members. Two children included, under 3 years old.I just read a couple of reviews and I always chuckle when my fellow Americans get all hot and bothered by road trips on roads that are not eight lane super highways with twelve lane off and on ramps. This is Punta Cana, DR, not Buckhead, Atlanta...and after doing the due diligence on Trip Advisor and other places, we expected an interesting ride. I will admit it was long, but we were chatting up a storm so it wasn't half bad.Check in was smooth, and we were fine with our rooms. As mentioned, as long as we adjusted our expectations, and weren't looking for the equivalent of the Mandarin Oriental at Time Warner Center in NYC. It could have been a bit cooler, but we made our adjustments.This is a huge resort, we stayed in building 4 which meant a long walk to the beach. Big and beautiful swimming pool that almost covers the entire left side of the hotel. Plenty of room for everyone, and if you decide that you only want to hang by the swim up bar, then you will have to deal with the numbers there. Better to spread out and find a nice spot that's not crowded. Food was decent. The World Cafe Buffet was good, a great amount of variety. It could get tired if you did it more than once a day, so we made sure to go spread the love and do the other restaurants. Himitsu was cool, although we couldn't do the Japanese grill because of the girls. We had a 4th of July celebration on the beach that was very scenic and nice. The beach grill during the day was actually pretty bad, that was the one piece I was unhappy about.We loved the beach, although the life guards seemed to be more interested in looking cooler than the visitors as opposed to doing their jobs. I was firm with the vendors who would try to hassle us into trips or stuff; a simple not interested today, maybe later ended any conversations. If you are looking for nightlife, it ain't happening. And that was fine with us, as we were just looking to eat and then chill. The night entertainment was fine, and we went to see what the club was all about. Nice setting, but nothing like lousy DJing to mess it all up. But the young teenagers seemed to eat it all up, so it worked out for some folks. Would have been nice if the pool stayed open late at night.The staff were interesting. You could tell there was some kind of hierarchy amongst the workers and the higher up the chain, the more attitude you would get. Not much attitude, but you could sense some aloofness. They were friendly in general, and really nice, and I made it my choice to think it was genuine. All in all, this was a great vacation, and we all recommend Dreams as a place to visit. Just don't go there thinking you will be getting Ritz Carlton type service or amenities, 'cos this ain't the Ritz, people. It is Dreams Punta Cana.;-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":293,"mention":"lane","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lane_cake"],"startOffset":289},{"endOffset":325,"mention":"lane","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lane_cake"],"startOffset":321},{"endOffset":325,"mention":"lane","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lane_cake"],"startOffset":321},{"endOffset":325,"mention":"lane","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Lane_cake"],"startOffset":321},{"endOffset":736,"mention":"Mandarin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Mandarin_Oriental,_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":728},{"endOffset":807,"mention":"cooler","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cactus_Cooler"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":807,"mention":"cooler","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cactus_Cooler"],"startOffset":801},{"endOffset":1764,"mention":"cooler","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cactus_Cooler"],"startOffset":1758},{"endOffset":2153,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2149},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2169},{"endOffset":2173,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2169}]}
