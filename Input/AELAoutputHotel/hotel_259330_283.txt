{"text":"Overall, better than expected from other reviews. Remember, you get what you pay for. This place was a good value for the price. If I were to go back to Punta Cana, I would pay a little more, and stay somewhere else, and hopefully have better food. My wife and I stayed here for 10 days May 18 - 28, 2007, We were a bit apprehensive because the Trip Advisor reviews were all over the place. We now feel it rates somewhere in the middle. We found the rooms very clean, spacious (though somewhat sparce). King bed turned out to be more comfortable than expected. Service and attandants were very courteous and friendly. Front desk staff very helpful. We were glad for the information we had recieved from Trip Advisor members. We asked for two room keycards. The air conditioner card was already in the room and it was very cool and comfortable the entire time. We kept all valuables in the safe but never felt insecure or nervous. The grounds are well kept, beautiful flowers etc. We were given help with our luggage to and from our room coming and going, (all 6 bags) no problem. I gave the bellman $5.00 each way and he seemed to appreciate it. We left the maid $2.00 each day and thats the only tipping we did the entire time. Never felt any obligations to tip at any time. Temp was 87 to 90 degrees the entire time with very high humidity. We stayed in building #6 room #6226. Perfect location overlooking the pools, and ocean view as well as central to everything else. Thanks to another Advisor members advise we had asked for Building #6. Thanks. The beach was beautiful!! Water perfectly clear and gorgeous. Rained three times at night only. Now our only complaint, but it's a BIG ONE. THE FOOD. We only liked the Steakhouse Restaurant. The Chinese and Italian restaurants were our other choices and didn't like either one.We prefered The Laguna Buffet Restaurant to the ala carte restaurants because you had a larger selection. Sometimes we were hard pressed to find anyrthing we liked. Every night there was a theme, German, French, Dominican etc. I ate buttered roasted potatoes several nights. It's hard to describe but everything had a weird taste. They had a hugh variety and the presentation was always appealing. But hardly anything tasted good. I never saw hotdogs used so many ways. Also used luncheon meats extensively. Very creative. Chopped up in mixed salads, ground up into paste and piped onto vegitables, fried like bacon, etc. Seemed like leftovers were used to create new concotions. Overall we had a wonderful time.
