{"text":"Good Hotel ; Good Train Access My husband and I stayed at the New Otani for four nights. Three nights we were in the Garden Tower and one in the Main. The Main tower is a newer more contemporary styled Tower. The rooms are the same size, but the Main tower rooms have a floor to ceiling window which gives you a nice view. The Garden tower is a bit dated, but still comfortable. When we got to our room, it was on the 12th floor facing the garden and it was beautiful. We even had a view of Mt. Fuji!! Overall, the hotel is a good choice in that it's a good price (230 for garden, 330 for main) and it's about a 7-10 min walk to the Yotsuya train station.As for the rest of the hotel, the staff was very helpful, attentive, and spoke english. The resteraunts are ok, but we only tried the sushi and the bfast buffet. But, avoid the sushi rest (can't remember the name, in the garden tower). It's below average and a complete rip off. You're much better off going to Roppogi and getting sushi there. As for breakfast, there's a buffett in the lounge area overlooking the garden which is beautiful. If you'd rather have a quick bfast, try the train station (yotsuya). They have a Beck's Coffee shop on street level as you enter the station, that serves a delicious breakfast (eggs, toast, yogurt, coffee or hot choc.) for about 6 bucks!For a 4 star hotel, this is a good deal, convenient location and has great service.
