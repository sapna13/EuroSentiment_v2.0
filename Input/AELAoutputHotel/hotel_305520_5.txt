{"text":"My all time favourite hotel Easily the best hotel I have stayed in. I stayed here in March 2006 during my stopover on my return journey from New Zealand, spending nearly 3 days in the balmy 33√ä?√ªC of Singapore before returning to a cold (4√ä?√ªC), wet London. My room was lovely, well designed, with a spacious marble lined ensuite. The hotel is huge and the vast lobby of the hotel hosted live music in the evening. I arrived at 9.00pm in the evening and by the time I had sorted myself out the hotel restaurant was closed (more about the restaurant below). Hungry, at 1.00am I ventured downstairs to the reception to find out what kind of food was available through room service or locally. I was asked if a dish of fried rice was acceptable, brilliant I thought, not the usual fare of congealed potato wedges and dips. Less than 15 minutes later a steaming plate of food arrived with not just fried rice, but chicken, singapore noodles, spring rolls and other goodies. The service at the hotel was the best I have ever experienced.The Orchard's restaurant offered an √ã√ë√∏ la carte or buffet selection, both of which were of the highest standard. I was in my element at breakfast time with a wide selection of breakfast fare, a choice of eggs (scrambled, poached, boiled, fried or omeletted to order). I chose to return to the hotel for most of my meals during my short stay in Singapore, as the food was so good.The hotel is situated close to the shopping area on Orchard Road, where you can visit the designer shops, or buy electronic goods and jewllery for far less than you would in the UK. In the shopping mall behind the hotel I found a good tailor who was able to make a dress and suit for me in just over a day and at a reasonable price. I would highly recommend the Orchard Hotel to anyone staying in Singapore. ","annotations":[]}
