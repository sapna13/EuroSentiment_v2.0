{"text":"Enjoyed our stay at Adagio My mom, sister, and I just returned from our weekend in San Francisco, staying at Hotel Adagio. We've all been to San Francisco before, and planned to focus this trip on shopping and seeing a few local sights. We all enjoyed the Adagio--the location is great--just a couple blocks up Geary from Union Square and tons of great shopping. The hotel is very clean, retro\/hip, and completely adequate for a weekend in San Francisco. We were impressed. We were actually surprised at the relatively low number of panhandlers on this trip as compared to previous visits to the city. Of course there are quite a few around town, but I remember being more shocked on other visits. The hotel is in the theatre district, so I think that is why. Walking up and down Geary was no problem for us, with very few encounters. There are significantly more panhandlers if you go the other way and down Jones to O'Farrell. We walked all over town, hit Chinatown a few times, and took the cablecar to Fisherman's Wharf. I have to mention breakfasts at Segafredo Cafe on Powell just off Union Square. Perfect breakfast place for us--great coffee, good food (smoothies, fruit  yogurt, breakfast bagels, etc), quick and convenient. We're not into the mega-breakfast sit-down scene, yet prefer to actually sit as opposed to grabbing Starbucks and standing on the street. All said, I would recommend Hotel Adagio to anyone looking for a reasonably priced, clean, convenient hotel in the city.
