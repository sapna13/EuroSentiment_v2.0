{"text":"Trendy hotel that has lost its sheen My normal hotel was full due to the IMF conference so I found the Gallery on Expedia. It looked interesting and was in a part of singapore I have never stayed in before. Though once you are there it looks like it is a stage set or themed area in a big theme park. Getting there from the airport took over 40 minutes by taxi. The decor is very minimalist with lots of stone, marble, steel etc. To get to your room you have to take one lift to the fourth floor (where the resturant is) and then get another to the bedrom floor. On opening the bedroom door the first thing that struck me was the ingrained dirt around the keycard holder inside the room. The bedroom door also needed a good clean. The room was very stuffy and smelled musty, as did the corridors. I got the impression the carpets have never been cleaned. The room has a central control panel for the aircon, ligts, tv etc. This was not working and i had to call reception who sent up an engineer who took about 30 minutes to arrive. This later malfunctioned again at 1am and started switching the TV off and on at random. Also the aircon went off and I couldnt switch off the bedside lights. After a call to reception they sent someone up who couldn't fix it so offered to call out an engineer but i insisted they get me another room, which they did.I was on a business trip and so had reports to write. The rooms have free broadband connection which is a very nice and rare feature. I only wanted a sandwich to eat so i went to their cafe. They said their kitchen closed at 6pm but they could get me something from the upstairs resturant if I wanted. I said I would just go up their myself. I had to wait about five minutes to be seated as the only waitress was on the phone. The menu is a bit sparse and unimaginative but the tenderloin I had was very good. I only ate in the resturant on one of the three nights as there were private functions on Fri  Sat. Overall the hotel is ok if you like that sort of thing, I have stayed in a lot worse but there are better hotels in Singapore for the same or not much more money. Very young and inexperienced staff.
