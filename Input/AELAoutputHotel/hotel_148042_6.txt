{"text":"Lovely Hotel....Spotty Service Stayed at the Ritz just for one night prior to flying over to St Maarten\/St. Martin for more vacation time.Hotel is beautiful with lovely grounds, pool and hotel rooms. All amenities in the rooms are Bulgari. Check in went very quick and easy. It was later in the day but decided to get alittle sun before it set so we went to the pool right away.The pool bar\/restaurant was closed for renovation. We wanted to order beverages so looked for a pool server walking around. No one seemed to be interested in taking our order. We had to wait a long time and finally I got up and went over to someone to get service. He did bring us one beverage but we never saw anyone else so we gave up on any other service at the pool.Had dinner at Mares which was excellent. Prices are a bit high but since it is a Ritz, to be expected. Seafood was fresh and the Sangria was very tasty! (of course it was $55.00 for Sangria so keep that in mind if you are on a budget!)Went to one of the shops and decided to purchase a copper tile of a parrot which was in the window. The girl checked the price on the back which said $30.00, which was a pretty good deal. When she went to ring it up, it rang up as $45.00....a bit more than was quoted. She was nice and said she would give us a 10% discount since we were staying in the hotel. We did buy it anyway.Went to the casino which was fairly busy considering it was slow season. Roulette was pretty fun and I actually won some $$, since my husband lost I guess we broke even. Got complimentary drinks, which was very nice since we didn't get our beverages at the pool earlier!Checked out the next day and requested a valet to handle our luggage. We waited for a long time but no one ever came so we just handled it by ourselves. When we went to the front, they weren't very busy so that was not the reason for no valet service.Overall, the hotel was very pleasant and attractive, however, being a Ritz I would have not expected the issues we had with the pool service or valet service. Still a very nice hotel. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2061,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2057}]}
