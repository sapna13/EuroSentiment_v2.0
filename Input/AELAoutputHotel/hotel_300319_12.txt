{"text":"Wouldn't recommend it We booked 4 nights accommodation at the Novotel Century in Wan Chai during the month of April but was not very satisfied with the overall experience in this hotel. First of all, we made our booking a month prior to our stay and requested for non-smoking rooms. To our disbelief they gave us rooms on the smoking floor (Floor 9) which they did not apologise or try to make amends for. The room definitely smelled of cigarettes which is foul.We also paid $1400 HKD for a 'superior' double room but only to receive a room about the size of a shoe box. They were clean but absolutely tiny without enough room to put our luggages. There was cable TV but most channels were in chinese, otherwise they were business-related programs..Im sure most people would agree that having HBO or other movie channels would have been nice.Another major complaint is that the walls  doors in this hotel is paper-thin..You can hear almost every conversations taking place outside your hotel room..Nothing worse than being woken up at 7.00am because of noisy neighbours. However, the house-keeper shouting Excuse me, house-keeping at 9.00am is also inexcusable..Surely they can do it at a more reasonable time so as to allow guests on their holidays to sleep in a little!! Very frustrating as they ignore the Do not disturb sign.The location was good as it was almost midway between Causeway Bay and Central. The hotel is also situated next to the ferry terminal which allows you to take the Star Ferry to Kowloon. Overall though, we felt that the hotel room was over-priced and iwhen you include the other disadvantages such as noise levels, inappropriate timing of house-keeping, absolutely tiny size of rooms and poor window views of old apartments, then Novotel Century would not be a hotel that I would recommend to others.
