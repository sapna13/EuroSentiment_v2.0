{"text":"a light in dark bali just got back from the bali mandira, was great!Liked:-The security. Before our taxi could enter the hotel grounds this guard came out and used a rod of some sort with a torch and a mirror to check beneath the car for bombs or additional passengers.-Cleanliness  Decor. You can choose between a modern room or a cottage. Modern room is lovely, clean, nice lighting, ok beds, very nice bathroom. Cottage rooms come with chairs and a coffee table outside I think, and modern rooms have either a terrace, a balcony or a raised platform inside the room. A definite A.-Food. While I did not get the opportunity to order room service, do try the Parasol Pizza from the Parasol Restaurant, just remember to tell the waiter to minus the garlic which comes in huge chunks sprinkled on the pizza.-Location. The hotel is located right on the beach, and you can walk down to the beach without leaving the hotel grounds, whereas hotels like the Hard Rock have to cross a busy road. Many sunbeds facing the beach yet out of bounds to outsiders, very very nice, just watch out for the bird [----].Did Not Like:-Lack of View. None of the rooms have an ocean view, which is a waste. The modern rooms look out onto a plain concrete verandah which is inaccessible. -Mosquitoes. While I did not get a single mosquito bite during my stay, I either saw the same mosquito about 4 times or 4 different mosquitoes. -The hotel staff did not replace our shampoo, bath foam or tissue even when it ran out. While this may sound trivial, any hygienic person cannot survive without bath foam. Tips: Dont get too drunk or into trouble. One of our taxi drivers told us about the traditional police (who dress entirely in black). Apparently there was a case when a Caucasian man got drunk and picked a fight with some local gangsters. Then the traditional police came along and, quoting the driver, crick crack shoop chop. The tourist then lodged a police report, but there was no case.
