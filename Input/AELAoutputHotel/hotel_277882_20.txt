{"text":"A Wonderul Place To Stay I stayed at the Hampton Inn Manhattan\/Seaport\/Financial District from March 23-28 and had a wonderful experience. The hotel is clean and the staff gives excellent service. My room was cleaned everyday and I had a spectacular view of Brooklyn, Brooklyn Bridge and the Seaport. Breakfast was served every morning which was very convenient for me considering I stayed there for business and did not have a lot of time in the morning to stop and get something to eat outside of the hotel. The doorman gave me precise directions to get anywhere I wanted to go. It was a pleasure staying at this hotel and I would certainly stay there again. The only thing that I did not like is that if you use the Fulton\/Williams Subway station near the hotel during the day time, then don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ always expect for it to be open late night after 12:00 midnight. The station was usually closed late night for maintenance during my stay or I would need to make a transfer to another train because the trains are rerouted after midnight from this station. I would have to find an alternate route or catch a taxi back to the hotel. This was not really a problem at all it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just that I had to walk a few extra blocks by using another station. The fitness room is small and only has one treadmill so I had to wait until the person using it was done. They also have a spin bike as well. The hotel is 3 blocks from the Seaport for shopping and fun. But if you are looking for a clean hotel with comfortable beds, excellent service and breakfast with a smile then I highly recommend this hotel. I can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wait to go back!!
