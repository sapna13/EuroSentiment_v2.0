{"text":"Fantstic - a very special place. If you have booked here and are reading up on it now - don't worry.It really depends who you are, as to whether you will appreciate the charms of this place.What is most special is the atmosphere and the amazingly hard working, genuine staff. The people are warm, the hotel is fun yet relaxing, and everything is designed to help you forget about everything else.I cannot believe anyone would criticise the food. It is superb - and I am fussy. The buffet is probably best of all, different every night, beautifully presented and delicious.The rooms are fine - spotless and comfortable. Not huge, but 3 of us together were more than happy.What takes this place to another level is the animation staff. They work all hours, produce brilliant shows, teach amazing classes and are simply wonderful. Any one of them would have a place in the west end. Talent in abundance....Thomson rep was worse than useless, but everything else was as fantastic as it was possible to be.I didn't know that there were places like this.Usually after day 10 I am itchy to get home. Not this time. My family of mum and dad, children 16, 12 and 2 were properly sad to leave.We will be back.We never saw anyone not smiling. However, reading the reviews, it does seem that Europeans prefer this style of holiday. Some American people seem not to. No judgements there but everyone is different and look for different thingsDefinitely....Do the dance classes and workoutsGo to the Carnival on Thursday eve (7.30 onwards)See the Afrika show - breathtakingDon't bother with the steak house - but if you do - choose the rump!Make friends with the team especially: Kuchi, Little Alex, Capuccino, Wasa Wasa, Richard, Daisy. These are truly amazing people, hilarious and wonderful.p.s. the Palace hotels may look a bit grander - but were locally referred to as the 'cemetaries'. Their guests descended on the Bambu for the shows and entertainment every day.
