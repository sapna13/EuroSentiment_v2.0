{"text":"quiet resort Myself and abunch of my friends stayed at this resort for 7 days from Jan 14-21, 2007. The resort grounds were beautiful. lots of palm trees, ponds, gardens, birds, bridges etc. I will start with our room. we were upgraded to a suite thanks to our travel agent who asked for this when booking for us as we had a party of 10 in our group. the suites were huge, 2 bathrooms, king size bed (was kind of hard) had a sitting room with tables and couches, and an enormous belcony overlooking the ocean, and pool. I have nothing to complain about our room however a couple of my friends had said that their air conditioner didnt work or their fans. and one couple who came later had a standard room and said they didnt like it. but im assuming they said this comparing it to our suites. The food was ok a few of us got a little sick but nothing major, there was quite a bit to choose from so that was nice. we ate at all of the a la carts and liked them for the most part I didint really like the steak we ate at the one it wasnt cooked very well and a couple of us didnt feel too great after. The beach was nice lots of palms and long stretches of sand, however it was pretty dirty with seaweed most of the time, but whatever you can still enjoy it. the entertainment was ok too, nothing special, some were good some were boring. Overall we had a great time, I think that if there werent as many of us we would have been very bored. there isnt much to do after the shows over so if your looking for some party time this is definately not the resort for you. resort was nice but we probably wont go back to Dominican again, I found it kind of dirty compared to all the other islands i've been to. watch out for the beach bar where you can get hot dogs and burgers.....my friends got sick from this as the meat stays out all day and they dont really keep things clean. This resort was ok overall but definately not one of my favorites.
