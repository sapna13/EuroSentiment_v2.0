{"text":"Wonderful - Loved Everything We stayed at PCP from 4\/22-4\/29. After a very rough start - we were to leave Boston at 9:30 am - didn't get off the ground until 7:30 pm - Apple Vacations - that's a whole other review - poor service.We arrived at PCP at 1:00 am - even at that time everyone was scrambling to accommodate us - they were very sympathetic to our situation. We ended up going into the main buffet at that time for something to eat and drink - Merengue's for all - great drink!Our rooms were really nice, comfortable bed\/couch, clean and spacious, maid service was terrific. The sun was great, rained every day pretty hard at times and the wind was blowing pretty hard, so we opted for the pool most of the time which was wonderful! Loved the swim up bar. Only problem we had was being VIP (worth the up-grade) we had access to the day bed's (worth the up-grade very comfortable) were that regular guests would occupy them it is not posted at that pool that the beds are for VIP only - the beach area is. The resort was filling up as the week went on, so we did find ourselves reserving a day bed. Food was very good, good assortment in the main buffet (Marina night was not so great), Mar Nostrum was our favorite restaurant during the evening (beef with stuffed lobster in wine sauce A++++ can't say enough about that). The Fondue restaurant was a lot of fun - it was our daughter's birthday and they went all out for her. We went over to the Caribe Club for their buffett one night - similar in food - but it is very, very hectic and much larger. We couldn't wait to get back to the PCP! The night entertainment was a lot of fun - tequilia funnels! OMG! Emilio at the bar was so funny - ask him for a bikini! Bernardo  Jose at the pool bar - were just great - lots of dancing, singing and fun. This resort was great in that it is small and intimate, but that is what we like - we met the best people from all over the world during our week; something you don't encounter at a large resort as easily. My daughter and her boyfriend got engaged while we were here and they will go back for their honeymoon. Overall, my husband and I would definitely go back to the PCP we had a great time. Would definitely do the upgrade to VIP again as well, it comes with some really nice extras.
