{"text":"Potential is there... We arrived New Years to the Elegance and were concerned about all the negative reviews. This was our first trip to the Domenican and so we didn√à?√¨t really know what to expect as a standard as our reference points are trips to Jamaica and the Mayan Riviera.It appears that there are a few sections of the hotel that do have a lot of problems with the rooms, so its really a matter of hit and miss depending on where you are assigned. We got 2 rooms - in one of them the air conditioning was not working that well. The other problem we had was that the elevator did not work a few days we were there (we were on the 4th floor and did not mind walking up and down the stairs but I am sure this might be a problem for a few folks. It appears that the rooms in the buildings closer to the beach were the ones that were rushed during the opening and are the ones having most of the water problems. As most people have stated, there is not much the staff can do other than move you to a different room if one is available. The Bahia was oversold by about 200 rooms during our week so a lot of people were being moved here.Food was okay to very good... we ate at the buffet a lot, and found the japanese restaurant and the steak at the steakhouse to be very good.The workout facilities are excellent and in general the staff are very friendly.The beach was very nice, although was not as wide as the Colonial or the Bahia (next door). This hotel does appear a bit more upscale to the Colonial.Overall we had a very good time and I think this hotel has a lot of potential. I would however give it about 6 months or so to have the kinks worked out (however if you can find a great deal on the rooms I think it would definitely be worth it to stay here right now).
