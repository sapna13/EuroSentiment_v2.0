{"text":"Best Hotel Yet We arrived in Hong Kong after a 3 week tour of mainland China following the Silk Road so this hotel was an oasis that allowed us to recuperate before returning home. The rooms were spacious enough (despite what some of the other reviewers have said); the beds were unbelievably comfortable; the see-through wall between the bathroom and the bedroom was a bit disconcerting at first until you realized that you could have a view of Hong Kong at night from the luxurious bath; separate rain shower; everything immaculately clean; quiet despite being located in the bustling heart of street markets in Kowloon; free computer usage at the Portal 24\/7. Of the many bests about this hotel, one was the fantastic and varied buffet breakfast delivering anything from poached eggs made by the omelet chef for you (a rarity at a hotel), fresh honey from a honeycomb, home made jams, breads of every variety including gluten free, a chocolate fountain in which you could dunk donuts (kids would love this) -- you get the picture. Another was the well-equipped gym and beautiful rooftop pool located in the Spa area. Try this at night when there are few guests and the ceiling is open to the night air. We didn't try the spa itself but the change rooms, including plunge pool and sauna and wonderful showers, as well as every possible amenity for washing and drying your hair, were quite spectacular.Lastly, the service was excellent, from the front desk clerk to the restaurant staff, from the maids to the spa staff, from the concierge desk to the lovely ladies in pink suits opening doors for you. During our stay, we were fortunate enough to be invited to a manager's cocktail party in a lovely outdoor space behind the breakfast restaurant -- the Backyard. There we got to meet some of the hotel management who made the Langham Place work as seamlessly as it does.We were so happy that we decided to stay in Kowloon. Access to all of Hong Kong's tourist areas was a short and comfortable MTR ride away. Some reviewers complained about the walk to the subway station but either through the Mall or from the outside, it was a short hike. We were lucky enough to encounter a clear morning on Victoria Peak and so got a good view of this lovely City. In the evenings, we trolled the street markets and enjoyed the bargains, especially on the electronics street practically adjacent to the hotel.The shopping mall, attached by a walkway to the hotel, had a variety of restaurants, a Starbucks if you're missing that cappuccino. We particularly enjoyed Genki Sushi, a fast food sushi bar where the sushi plates are delivered to you via conveyer belt and the bill is calculated by totting up the various coloured plates left over.We have stayed at many hotels around the world and the Langham Place is our favourite so far.
