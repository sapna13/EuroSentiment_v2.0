{"text":"Believe the hype! Wow! We JUST came back from this little slice of heaven and I gotta tell you this place is FANTASTIC! I had my reservations cuz of some of the bad reviews on this site but I must say, where the hell were these people staying cuz we had a great time either doing the activities or just doing nothing. We're from New York and we spoke the language which made it a bit easier for us but the majority of the staff speak English. I must say that the staff was A-MAZ-ING! Friendly - Professional - Always ready to help in every way possible. The restaurants were great..I mean, it was great to walk in and eat all you can 3 times a day! The food was delicious. Not Oh My God great .. but it didn't suck. Whatever you wanted and however you wanted it ... NO PROBLEM! The shows were fun .. not Las Vegas or anything like that, but HEY! you're on vacation so enjoy and kill some time and absorb the fact that you're away and being treated like Kings and Queens. The beach was beautiful - though the waves were rough it was still fun and the water color was a sight to see. The sand - soft, clean-white and just so therapeutic to walk on. You have GOT to do the excursions! The best was Catalina Island and snokeling in that still-clear blue\/green water alone with the fishes. ( Bring mosquito repellent ) The other was the historical trip to the country's capital, Santo Domingo. But be ready, it's a long ride( a whole day trip ) so do it on your last day before going back home - It kills the day and gets you ready for the trip back. The horseback riding is a must. It was just fun. Oh! And the place has live animals walking around - Peacocks-Geckos-Roosters that wake you up ( LOL ) - and flamingos by the pond alone with ducks and hens with their new born chicks following them across the road. There's sooo much about this place that I can say but you really would have to experiance it for yourself. We are without a doubt going back .. and very soon! Please don't listen to the Debbie Downers about this place. It was the best resort by far. P.S. Even though tips are included we tipped anyway ( not all the time - $2 - $5 ) for certain reasons. I hear that the staff doesn't get the full 10% gratuity of the package and really, what's so wrong with showing a little genorosity. They're very hard working and depend on tourism alone.
