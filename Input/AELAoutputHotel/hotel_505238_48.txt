{"text":"Lovely Hotel - Great Mall next door! I took my boyfriend here for his 18th birthday in March 2006, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay!Totally modern and chic, it's a perfect base that is completely luxurious. the rooms, though small are all that you need.I'm more a bath person but the showers in the rooms are just incredible! I never wanted to get out, they were like something you see on Cribs!The beds were huge and very comfortable and spacious and the help of a nice big fridge was a bonus, it meant food could be bought and kept withough going bad.Right next door to this hotel was the Diagonal Mar, a fab shopping mall with some lovely restaurants and cafes. We ate at alot of these during our 5 days in barcelona as they were inexpensive and really lovely. It helped that we can speak quite good spanish as this area is more spanish speaking than others.Try the metro for a good way to get around, it's cheap and reliable. And try the Barcleona Zoo as a fun day out, it was inexpensive and we had a good day.The only problem with this hotel was the check-in lady, who was quite rude and snotty and repeatedly started chatting away in Spanish to someone else as I was talking to her, she obviously didn't know I could understand her. Other than her rudeness the hotel is just lovely and a great place to call home for a short visit. If it's more than a 5 day jaunt you're after I'd probably say try a different hotel as the rooms are just not big enough for a long stay. Maybe a few nights in the Barcelona Princess and a few nights in another hotel.
