{"text":"Beautiful Resort!!!!!!! GROUNDS: the most beautiful grounds that i have ever seen!very green and very well maintained. ROOMS: the rooms were big and very clean. they would come in and clean everyday and fill in the fridge with fresh water and pop. some people complained that the rooms smelled. that is true only for the rooms located on the first floor.(humidity)FOOD: the food was average. they have 6 a la cart we tried five of them(mexican, japanese, italian, spanish, brazilian)all of them were really good, the japanese was te best one. they have 2 buffets the italian one is the best and is close to ocean cana. the buffet food was just ok, the a la cart food was delicious!!BARS: a lot of bars around including a swim-up bar=alot of drinking!!!!BEACH: the best beach i have ever seen! there were some seaweeds. it is very stupid that people complain about seaweeds. there is nothing that people can do about that because they dont make them nature makes them so just enjoy nature!!!!! the sand was white and clean. Be careful, the sun is very strong and u can get burnt very easily. the is a beach party once a week . they have many activities by the beach in the morning and afternoon. POOLS: they had 3 pools! the main one was huge with a swim-up bar. the pools were always clean!STAFF: all of them are very friendly. some people wrote on the reviews that they were rude but i think they are making up stuff. we would even hang out with the staff at night when their shift was over! we had so much fun with them, amazing people!Overall this resort was GREAT. i dont see why some people complained. i would recommend it to everybody!!!!!! Enjoy! ","annotations":[]}
