{"text":"enjoyed our stay in Sanur and the Santrian Club We stayed for four nights in the Club wing of the Santrian. It was the cheapest place we stayed in Bali, and definitely the least lavish, but we still enjoyed it. The room was nice, with a comfortable bed and a large balcony. The bathroom area was a little dark, but our only real complaint about the room was that the storage was very poor - it was amazing to see furniture which was so poorly designed for clothing, for example a very large cabinet which contained only a single tiny drawer! But for a short stay this was no real problem.The beach restaurant is very good - especially the Japanese food including the sushi - though the service is a little slow.Breakfast is OK, with a fair amount of choice, but not spectacular.The grounds and various pools are lovely, and we found the staff friendly and helpful.There were two PCs set up for guests - not enough, and the internet connection was very unreliable, which was in fact a problem wherever we went in Bali.This is a large(ish) hotel which caters for Europeans on package holidays but it never felt impersonal. We would probably go back though we might choose someplace a bit more elegant next time.The hotel has opened the Mezzanine restaurant which we didn't particularly enjoy, but their sister hotel (the Griya Santrian) has a fantastic Italian restaurant called the Village - well worth taking a short taxi ride to go there.
