{"text":"Elan is a lovely hotel It doesn't get much better than the Elan hotel as far as prices and quality of the hotel itself. Since the Elan does not have a pool (something that is quite common for LA hotels), it is a bit cheaper than other hotels in the same class but don't be fooled by price. The Elan is elegant, the rooms have ample space, flat screen TVs, and are nicely decorated. The hotel is small (I believe it's two floors total) and provides complimentary wine tasting every night between 5 and 6 PM. The hotel also provides complimentary buffet-style breakfast until 10:30 AM. There is no restaurant within the hotel but who needs one when you have all of LA's great restaurants from which to choose?!It doesn't have the view that a tall, high rise, hotel would have but it is a lovely place to stay while in LA. Centrally located in a very nice neighborhood which is more residential than the busiest part of LA (closer to Hollywood Blvd.). I would recommend this hotel to anyone. We rented a car (and drove up the coast from LA). The staff is very friendly, accommodating, and professional.Some things you should know about the hotel before booking:- The Elan is not within walking distance of Hollywood Blvd. You will have to drive about 10 miles or grab a cab for that but a lot of nice things are within walking distance of the hotel itself. - Try the Urth Cafe right around the corner for a quick, healthy, but yummy meal and a fabulous iced, blended bubble tea or coffee!- If you have a car, you can park it under the hotel for approximately $19 a day. The valet staff is available 24 hours a day and were both courteous and friendly.
