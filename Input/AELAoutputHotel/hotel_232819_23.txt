{"text":"Decent Hotel. Modern Rooms. I stayed at the Preciados for two nights with my cousin in August 2008. We were pleased that the rooms were nice and modern. I totally forgot that the minibar was free so if you do stay here, drink up! Our safe wasn't working when we checked in, but this was fixed shortly. When we first got to our room, the entire floor reeked of cigarette smoke, despite the no smoking signs. For the rest of our stay, it reeked of room deoderizer spray. The hotel is a short walk to Plaza Mayor. I found the surrounding area though less than attractive. The streets smelled like urine and there's a lot of graffiti. Also, there are a bunch of beggers on Calle Preciados, the pedestrian shopping street. There are two PCs in the hotel basement, but only one had an Internet connection while we were there. I found the front desk less than helpful when it came to restaurant recommendations. Perhaps the normal staff was away for August? Firstly, I e-mailed the hotel a week before we arrived and asked for some recommendations and they never responded. Secondly, when we did ask for tips, the guy at the front desk just responded vaguely with Plaza Mayor. Everything is good there. Well, everything directly surrounded Plaza Mayor is a bit of a tourist trap. Plus, we were two females wandering around at 11 p.m. at night and we didn't like not having a direct destination.So while the accomodations were clean and neat, I wasn't too keen on the location or the service we experienced.
