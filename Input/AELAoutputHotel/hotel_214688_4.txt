{"text":"Eh...won't be back It was our first visit to Hawaii and really had no idea of where to stay. After looking at several hotels I narrowed it down to a few and ended up picking this one, but after our stay, I don't think we'll be back.PROS-location is excellent. just a few blocks from shopping, many good places to eat, nice green park next door, and beaches close by.-room size is good-rooms with kitchenette nice and convenience-quiet in the halls -pool,BBQ area, and work out area on site-room decor nice-really liked the toiletriesCONS-stayed in room with partial city view - NOISE WAS HORRIBLE. Every night could hear traffic, sirens, car alarms, etc...I don't know if rooms on the opposite side of the hotel are much better-if the outside noise didn't wake us up, the in room AC units would. When that sucker kicks in, IT IS LOUD-every time I got in the shower I could smell mold. I actually cleaned some off the shower curtain, but smell still lingered-staff were not that nice. I think only twice were we greeted when we entered the bldg-parking $18\/day and only 1 elevator would access the garage so you hoped that would be the one that would stop on your floor when you wanted to leave-first day and a half only one elevator worked. I climbed to and from the 14th floor a total of 5 times each wayIf you're willing to spend a little more I think it'd be well worth it. Stay in the area, but off of this main street.
