{"text":"Mixed Reviews I had read a lot of reviews before selecting the Orchard, and did so because of many positive reviews on this website. I've had good luck in the past using Trip Advisors' reviews, but found the results mixed this time. The high points: the Orchard is in a great location, between Union Square and the top of Nob Hill. This is a good place to be, in my opinion; not as costly as the name places on the top of Nob Hill, and not as noisy as those hotels right on Union Square. Front desk service was friendly and capable, though when we arrived around 7 p.m. on a weeknight, there was only one person behind the front desk, and no bellman apparent. But the reception was still courteous and quick, since things were not very busy. The room itself was a nice size, clean, and well furnished with one major exception: the bed was very hard, and not what one would expect in a superior hotel (no box spring: just a mattress on a the wooden bed base). This may sound like a small point, but after four nights, we were very ready to not sleep here any longer. It just was not a good bed. The hotel offered a turn-down service, but we found the knock on our door at 6:30 p.m. to make the offer too early, and intrusive (as we were getting ready to go out for the evening). Can't this thing just happen while one is out to dinner, as it does in so many other hotels? All in all, this is a fine hotel, and for the price, a good deal for the area it is in. It is not, though, a 4 star experience, and for those spending more than a night, I would probably recommend spending a bit more, and staying on Nob Hill, or at one of the better Starwood properties in town instead. But if you're in town for ony a night or two, don't mind the harder bedding, and want good value for the location, this is undeniably a fine place to stay.
