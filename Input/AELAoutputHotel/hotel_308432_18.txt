{"text":"Fantastic Hotel for Families  We went for a short stay of 7 days and wished we had been there longer. The staff as expected from the orient were fantastic and sooo helpful. The concierge desk spoke amazing English and seemed to know everything about everything, shocking!The food was not cheap in the hotel but not expensive either. Room service was value for money, fast and tasty. The food from the restaurant was great and really really tasty, you just have to eat there. The pools were amazing with 2 life guards on duty all the time watching over you. We felt at ease to let our son play in the pools and on the water slides knowing he was safe. The pool area is stunning and clean, in fact the whole hotel was immaculate. The hotel cocktails are divine, but not cheap by HK standards and really nice, try them!!!!!You just have to take a short walk to the shops and few restaurants around the corner....The MASSIVE prawns and lobster were so low priced and tasted out of this world, everything so fresh and tasty....This hotel is great for families who want to relax and chill out while the kids play safe in the amazing pools. Or those that want a base to operate from in luxury surroundings but within easy reach of the main shopping and business areas.....As for shopping go to the markets as they are CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Barter hard as the prices offered crumble. We got toys, electronics, handbags and all sorts of items for next to nothing and even had to buy a massive suit case at the market to bring it all home in (Case was √ä√£¬¢10) back home we paid √ä√£¬¢50 for the small hand luggage in the same design and when we checked the big one was over √ä√£¬¢90 in the UK shops......Would we recommend this to anyone.........YES! We are going back again but not in June as it was pretty wet with high humidity and very hot.........Our cases will be empty when we get there but full on way back that's for sure! ","annotations":[]}
