{"text":"Swish Hotel The Park Hotel is a very swishy hotel, located on the 25th+ floor of the Shiodome Media Tower. The staff are friendly, speak very good english, but not as friendly as in other hotels. We found it fairly rare to be greeted, but the checkin desk is a few metres back from the lobby, so it wasnt so bad. They have a nice lounge and sometimes music played by a band or quartet. It has a fantastic view of the Tokyo Tower behind the counter. The rooms are big, with comfortable beds and pillows, in-room internet for free (although it is a little confusing reding the instructions) and a great view of Tokyo. It is two stops out of Tokyo station, and one stop to Ginza. The mall below the hotel and joined to the shinbashi station has a few boutique stores, walkways joining to the other shiodome towers (there is like 5 of them) and mini-marts. There is a subway station around the corner from the hotel, next to the subway restaurant, just to confuse. It is also about a 5 minute walk from the Tokyo Central Pokemon Centre, a favourite for young and old alike. This is round the corner from the World Trade Centre, a great place to get views of Tokyo and Tokyo Bay and the Tower.There are a few restaurants in the hotel, we didnt have anything from them, we found the Pedi Shiodome around the corner is the best tower, with lots of places to eat at reasonable prices. Being christmas, there was fake snow in the mall underneath the towers, a christmas show (with prizes) for the kids, carols and differnet events each day. Which was nice.It was nice ot be only a few stops from Tokyo but its a decent 20-30 minute JR ride (all stops) to shinjuku and harajuku from shinbashi.
