{"text":"a great place in waikiki! our first 2 nights in hawaii were at the wyland waikiki, and it was two great nights. i read SO many uneven reviews on tripadvisor of so many hotels in waikiki, but the wyland had many positive reviews and we were not disappointed!the room description was incredibly accurate on their website, and compared to other waikiki rates were appropriate. The room was a smallish but comfy and inviting (especially after a LONG long flight), and the shower was fab as well. Wyland's beautiful art is everywhere in the hotel which is also nice. We didn't have a view, but that was no surprise as we chose the option not too. the hotel staff was incredibly friendly and helpful in everyything, such as booking a van to the airport in the morning for us. we didn't get a chance to go swimming in the pool but it was really beautiful as well. The hotel is also only a short walk to waikiki beach or anywhere we needed to be in waikiki!there was a nice little breakfast bar, lively actual bar, and it looked like the restaurant was jusssst about to open. the lobby is lovely and creates a nice indoor\/outdoor space.I only had two things that i was slightly disappointed in, and really it's just things i hope they do. Wyland himself is a wonderful artist, and clearly has dedicated his life to supporting the importance of sealife and whales. Knowing that, I was hoping that the hotel itself was then more eco-friendly. They give you the option not to wash your towels everyday to save water...but then every hotel does. For example, were sustainable building materials used, or eco friendly carpets? just something interesting for the hotel to think of. Also, it was great to have the two computers in the lobby in as the business center...though it might be good to expand the business center (as there was always a wait to get on the computers) and make the computers a little more business-useful...with MS office for instance. i know everyone's not wanting to think about work in hawaii! i certainly didn't want to, but sometimes you need to :) but seriously, those are just small points, our stay was wonderful, and if we are so lucky to be back in waikiki we would definitely stay at the wyland!!
