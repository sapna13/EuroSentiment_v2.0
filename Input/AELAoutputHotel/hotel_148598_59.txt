{"text":"great staff, beautiful setting Just came back from spending a week there and i cannot say enough about the place. I'm a wyndham member so my room preference was all ready for me. The staff everywhere we went on the resort where very friendly, helpful and were actually quick with service which is unusual on an island (think island time).My room was on the west wing on the 5th floor and it was an ocean view. The fridge does not get cold so please keep this in mind before you spend money purchasing items that may spoil easily. I was not told this before check in so i only lost some milk for my morning coffee. Bottled water we kept on ice. We had a few ants by the coffee maker so we kept nothing on that table top. The bathroom had no vent so it got steamy quick during showers. I also thought the rainshower showerheads were overkill in a standard tub since most of the water hits the wall. That only works in shower stalls that have the space for it.The beach was very clean, with lounge chairs and umbrellas already set up for guests when you arrive in the morning. The two pools are side by side (adult and activity) which didn't keep the adult one too quiet since the water slide was right in the middle walkway of the two. The snacks poolside were very fresh and a good portion. They only do charge cards or you can charge it to your room which is great if we had known in advance not to carry cash\/wallets to the pool\/beach. We ate at the Marbella for a late snack one night and again to try the breakfast buffet. Spend the money on the buffet if you want a hot breakfast because it comes up to more if you order items seperatetly on the continental. We had $4 dollar bagels at the little snack stand right outside the casino mostly. We also ate at the italian rest.(Il Palio?) and it was a very good meal, good sizes (the veal parmegana covered the entire plate), very nice ambiance (low lighting, white table svc., piano player just outside the rest. entrance) and the price was very good for 3 adults with dessert. The tiramisu was on the small side but very fresh and one of the best i've ever had. One day, we even stopped by to see the iguana feeding alongside the front of the hotel. Casino is very tiny and dark i thought and i have no idea where they spent the millions to redocorate cause if that is new, i can only imagine what it was like before. I did valet the 1st night we arrived and then did self park for the rest of the time we were there. I would go back to this location. Rest fee is $30 per night.
