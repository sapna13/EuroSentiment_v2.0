{"text":"Good Stay with Hurricane Force Rain I bought my wife a birthday gift for her 30th (PUNTA CANA Vacation with 4 other friends). It rained 4 out of 7 days, the staff was friendly and helpful (resort provided large golf umbrellas to all), the tram ran everyday (on time) and the food was great. Oh, an Hurricane NOEL crossed less than 40 North of us and we still played golf and the reort personnel kept us occupied with indoor games and talent shows that would normally happen only at night.We had a GREAT Stay even though we did not know why it was rainy (did not care) nor did the resort personnel make us worry or even tell us there was a hurricane close because it did not cause any mjor problems except rain or wind.We stayed on the Royal Service side (A MUST DO) and rea the Florida paper headlines walking by that said Hurrican Noel hits Florida Coast. Personnel still came to our room to run a jacuzzi bath and everything; just like nothing was going on.-We still had a good stay, private golf carts and tram ran everyday with plasitc zipped in windows to keep you dry.Golf course was in good shape, got a free day of extra golf because we got rained out and they even kept and cleaned\/dried our gear during our stay.Only disappointment, did not get to dive because of the rough seas. ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT!WOULD RECOMMEND TO GO, JUST NOT DURING HURRICANE SEASON, although prices are much cheaper ","annotations":[]}
