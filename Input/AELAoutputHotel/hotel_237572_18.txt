{"text":"Only place I'll stay in amsterdam Three of us (my mom, a friend and I) stayed at the Hotel Hestia the last week in May and I can honestly say I will not look for another hotel in amsterdam. This is it, the one we will stay at any time we go back. What a location. Just a few minutes walk to Vondlepark, one way, and a few minutes walk to Leidsestraat or a canal bus the other direction. And yet the Hestia is on such a quiet street you feel like you're miles away. Perfect.What a room. Our triple was huge, even for american standards. And totally clean and updated. Now I have heard that some of the doubles and singles are on the smallish side, but I can only comment on our room. HUGE. Three comfortable beds, a table with four chairs, a large balcony overlooking the street.......who could ask for more. All I can say is if youre looking for comfortable beds in a quiet clean room, this is it.What a staff. The gentleman who checked us in had only been working at the hotel for a few weeks and was perfectly lovely, completely helpful, and genuine as could be. The morning staff who fixed the breakfast and ran the desk were wonderful as well. Sweet, fun, and helpful yet again. There are parrots in the backyard area and an adorable cat named Gregory who hangs out in the breakfast room. The price was perfect too. All in all we LOVED this hotel and would highly recommend it. Do be careful though as the stairs are steap and the elevator is tiny, not for wheelchairs unfortunately as there are no bottom floor rooms. See you at the Hestia. ","annotations":[]}
