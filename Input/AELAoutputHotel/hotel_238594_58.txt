{"text":"Exceptional in Barcelona (or anywhere!) We stayed at the Hotel Montecarlo for one night following our Mediterranean cruise. Chose this property based on the reviews on this site, backed up by other good recommendations in Frommers and Fodors. We were not disappointed. The room itself was very high end, in line with any top boutique hotel in the United States. The staff was exceptionally willing to help with maps, restaurant recommendations and transportation. They all speak English to some extent, and if the particular individual didn't, there was always someone there they could ask.Wireless Internet was free, and there is also Internet via television available in the room. Two HD televisions with various channels available, very upscale bathroom with whirlpool tub and multi-head shower, full-size hair dryer and toiletries, also a mini refrigerator. Our superior double had a view of the peaceful inner courtyard. There was no noise from the street.The location can't be beat in the center of the La Rambla district, near the Boqueria market and adjoining the Barri Gotic (easy walk behind the property). Two blocks from Plaza Catalunya, where our bus dropped us off after the cruise, so we did need to drag our luggage that distance to the hotel (buses can't drive up La Rambla). This was not a problem, it seems to be the accepted way to do it there. We had been told that no cars could drive up to the hotel, but there is a street out front and taxis can pull up out front.Although we did the final booking through our travel agent, we had already contacted the Hotel Montecarlo directly via email to get quotes and inquire about the hotel and Barcelona in general. They were most helpful and responded right away to every request. Our travel agent was planning to book a different hotel for our small group and we insisted on the Montecarlo.There is a nice breakfast room with eggs, cereals, lots of fruit, bread and pastries, however the breakfast is 11 euros additional per person, a small negative in my book. However, it was very convenient the next morning as we were hurrying to leave for the airport.The only other negative is that the bed, although comfortable, was two individual beds pushed together and they tended to separate - something to consider if you want to cuddle. :-)Otherwise, it was a great way to end our wonderful vacation. Do not hesitate to choose the Montecarlo!!
