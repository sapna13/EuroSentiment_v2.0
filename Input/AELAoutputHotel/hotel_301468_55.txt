{"text":"Awesome hotel, over the top service, great location We stayed here in July 2008. The hotel is an exemplary place and my kids are now forever spoiled for breakfast buffets. From the warm greetings when one arrives to the over-the-top excellent service, the MO is what other hotels aspire to be. It is a true oasis of calm and peace in otherwise hectic Singapore.What we liked\/loved: - the SERVICE-- OH MY GOD they were absolutely amazing. Second only to the Shangri La Bangkok but not by much !! - the breakfast buffet is out of this world - the rooms were small but beautiful (fresh orchids in multiple locations)- the swimming pool on the 4th floor is really nice with great views - the aircon is really nice --kept the room meat-locker cool :-) - the overall look of the place -- very nice cool, Asian modern - the location is fantastic --right in Marina area close to everything and right next to the Marina Sq shopping mall (!convenient with a great food court)What we did not like\/hated: - Singapore's National Day celebrations were scheduled to be held right across the street. This meant loud booming practice sessions at 9am. The din was equivalent to a rock concert. OUCH!! - For a super luxury hotel, I was surprised that the MO Singapore did not have those cool TOTO washlets, bidets etc. In fact the bathrooms were the only dated part of the hotel that I could discern. They need to update the bathrooms.- Laundry is definitely tailored for the expense account set. This means that you could be out USD 300 for doing a family's worth of clothes. The MO should come up with some reasonable family plan for this. It is painful and annoying.Overall we loved the place and will certainly stay again. We realize that Singapore is more a business hotel type spot rather than a resort type location but with a few tweaks the MO could move into the heavenly zone occupied by the Shangri La chain and some others. C'mon guys you can do it ! :-) Two qualified thumbs up.
