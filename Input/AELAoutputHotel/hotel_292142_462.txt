{"text":"My Affinity for the Affinia The Affinia Dumont is a great hotel in a great location. I am from New York and go to NYC at least once a year, and I will definitely stay at the Affinia Dumont again (I stayed 12 nights this time). The hotel lobby is quaint and well-decorated, and you can listen to iPods built into the lobby chairs. Everybody is very friendly and they are always telling you to Be Well, which is their slogan. There is so much to do on 3rd Ave. and everything is easily accessible from the hotel. I stayed in a 2 room suite with my father. He had a nice room with a King bed, and I slept on a very comfortable Queen pullout. The room was just under 600 sq. feet, and it had a kitchen with everything you need (stove, dishwasher, frig, etc.). The room was definitely a converted apartment because I felt like I was at home the whole stay. The one downside, and it is very, very minor, is that I had to share a bathroom. I used the kitchen sink sometimes to brush my teeth, etc. We had a nice room with a view of the East river, and there were TVs in both rooms. The one channel that is missing on the TV is Bloomberg TV, which I believe is a necessity for business travelers. That's subjective. The maids were very friendly and attentive and our rooms were always spotless. The manager, Dave, is a very nice guy, and he made a our stay great. On the 2nd level, there is a Fitness and Spa, which have everything you need. I worked out a few times and it was perfect. Each treadmill\/elliptical has its own TV screen. All in all, I had a great time at the Affinia (difficult to say since I am a Hilton Honors member - I have stayed at the Doubletree Suites, The Waldorf and the Millennium Hilton, and although the Hilton rooms are great, they are not as good as the Affinia in my opinion.) I am going to find out if the Affinia Dumont has a rewards program because I would like to stay there again and again...Seth ","annotations":[{"endOffset":567,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":563},{"endOffset":1004,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1000},{"endOffset":1320,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1316},{"endOffset":1320,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1316},{"endOffset":1679,"mention":"Waldorf","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waldorf_Hilton","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waldorf-Astoria_Hotel","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waldorf_salad"],"startOffset":1672}]}
