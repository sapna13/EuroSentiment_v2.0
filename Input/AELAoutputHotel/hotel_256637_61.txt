{"text":"Let me know when the service gets sorted out I followed up a stay in August for a conference with an overnight stay in October. It has a lot going for it -- opposite a good park, decent sized rooms particularly for suite deals, on a mall etc.Comfy beds.But the staff seemed to be just going through the motions on little things. When the room wasn't ready at 2pm (which was fair enough) they said they'd allocate it and put in the bags. They then forgot, had to find one at 5pm, which wasn't a good one, and took 45 mins to deliver the bags. When I rang to find them --we were going out --I was told they were coming and no more interest. When they didnt and I rang for the manager I was put on hold. Bad start. It might have been a one off but it took a similar time to get bags the previous trip. When I asked about a late checkout they said that they didn't need the room but it would be $50 if more than an hour. Since we had a suite and were in the exec club, this was a little surprising. When my wife called later to check that we hadn't been charged twice (which we hadn't) it took her three calls to speak to someone as she was simply transferred to someone who wasnt there!All in all we might have just been unlucky on two stays. The rooms were still fine and the price competitive. If I were a tourist I think I'd look for a hotel with a great harbour view. If I was staying for business or was used to Sydney, I'd wait for them to iron out these wrinkles as there are plenty of 5 stars without them I think. I'll be interested to see if the next reviews find that this has been sorted out..
