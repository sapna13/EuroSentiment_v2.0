{"text":"Can't wait to go back Just got back July 2nd 2008.I have been to lots of places including Europe Canada south America and stayed in first class hotels, But this is by far the best hotel we stayed in. We got the deal through AAA and Apple Vacation, everything was perfect since pick up till we got home. The resort is beautiful,clean. the staff is Aplus. the rooms are big we stayed in the loft suite, my husband and I in one and my 2 daughters in a separate one.When we got there there were not 2 together, but a half hour later they called me from the front desk and offered one in the same complex, so the bellman came right away and switched us. Very Very friendly staff and I mean all the staff. The pool is awesome (it burned down a day before we left but the same day they started rebuilding it, we came back from the disco at 2am and the crew was working) The beach was clean and clear just awesome. The shows are very nice and we felt very safe, especially witht the girls. The only down side is the ac it works but not like we are used to in Florida. The previous reviews I read helped a lot, took little gifts from the $ store for the maid, and singles to buy some souvenirs Its true its all inclusive. The best drinks are in the lobby and the pool, the ones in the beach were kind of weak. but refreshing. The weather was super nice hot and humid But breezy.Men make sure you do wear long pants for a la carte restaurants they DO enforce it. The food was excellent.No bugs or mosquitoes.I highly recomend this resort. We stayed in the Villas 82, to me that was the best pavillion, our rooms faced the beach we sat in the balcony and just chilled. Ask for an xtra key so you can leave it in to keep the ac running while you are out of the room. Also when you open the sliding door to the balcony the ac stops running.The bohique is great for lunch. For the 10 p, show walk accross to take the train b\/cwhen it comes back by the hotel is full. I took a wet noodle and used it a lot, they do not sell them there. The soaps are very very small, but they give you plenty. The staff will do anything to keep you happy. They cannot do more for you. I am sooo happy we chose this resort. The shuttle was right on time picking up both ways. You really do not need to bring any $, except for gifts. For seven days just take 3 nice outfits the rest of the days just casual for the afternoons the days you stain in your bathing suits. Do not think about it twice. You will not regret it. Have fun. Take a clock with you there is none. You do not need any transformers either. the power is the same.
