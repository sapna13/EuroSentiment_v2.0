{"text":"One of the better (if not the best) places to stay in Culebra We stayed at Tamarindo estates 2 weeks ago. Since we spent a lot of time looking into the accommodations in Culebra, we are puzzled by the negative reviews of Tamarindo. There are 2 things to remember about accomodations on this quiet, rural island: 1) the options of where to stay are limited and 2) the typical resort type hotels are rare. Most decent places charge $200\/night because they can. Culebra is for people who need peace and quiet, want to unwind and clear their mind at the beach, and can live in comfortable but not luxurious resort type hotels. Tamarindo Estates is efficiently and very well run. We stayed in a 1 bedroom cottage that was well kept, comfortable, very clean, and had a lovely deck facing the ocean. All the cottages at Tamarindo should afford great views. There is a lovely pool right on the ocean and you are steps away from Tamarindo beach. True, you will not be brought a stack of clean towels nor will your sheets be changed daily. There is no room service or a luxurious on site spa. However, all you have to do is make a quick call to request new linens, and towels. (There is apparently a restaurant on site, but we never used it). We cooked simple meals in our kitchen, which was well equipped. There was no oven, but a bbq grill with charcoal is provided on the deck on which you can grill to your heart√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ content. There are a few things that Tamarindo can easily upgrade that would improve the experience -- they could provide better bed sheets and linens, and use real and not tacky plastic flower arrangements. To us, these were minor issues given the lovely surroundings and views and pretty comfortable accommodations. (Another plus is that Tamarindo, because it is off the main road and not in town) seems to lack those famous roosters that people have complained about keeping them awake. However if you stay in town (see our review of Casita Linda, which we do not recommend, particularly for people in our 30-40 year old demographic) the roosters will keep you awake most of the night. A note on getting around the island -- unless you are an olympic cycler, you will need a car to get around. We had a good experience with Carlos Jeep Rentals. ","annotations":[]}
