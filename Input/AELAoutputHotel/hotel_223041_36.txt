{"text":"Expedia gives a horrible description of this hotel Hi There: I stayed at this hotel on a split trip for business and pleasure over the summer and was rudely suprised by the physical location of the place based on what I saw on Expedia. Although the hotel is smack dab in the heart of LA just down the street from the Beverly Center. It is FAR from Modern and for what I paid a night almost $200 a night it still gives me a burn in my belly just thinking about it. Not to mention, there is absolutely no parking around the hotel so they force you to valet. The hotel looks like its straight out of a 1960's movie in desperate need of renovation. The room was a matchbox and very nasty. We sleep in all of our clothes the first night because we could not adjust the AC and the street stunk. The bathtub was dirty and the sink was stopped up. When we requested another room the staff told us that they were completely soldout all week. Expedia wouldnt give us our money back and told us that we were on our own if we wanted to go elsewhere. The only thing that saves this hotel from me giving it complete TERRIBLE rating is that the manager and staff were extremely apologetic and accomodating understanding our concerns. We ended up getting back like $200 off the stay and some credits from Expedia after about an 1hr 30 min wait on hold. Nonetheless, Joel Majors and the entire staff at Elan Hotel Modern were very nice. I hope that the owners read this review and invest into upgrading the hotel. ","annotations":[]}
