{"text":"Loved Hotel Casci and its staff I was delighted to find this wonderful bed and breakfast hotel in the heart of the old city of Florence, Italy. The staff was very helpful, kind and treated me as if I was a guest in their home. I had a bathroom with shower in my room and both the bedroom and bathroom were spotless, as were all of the linens. Since I was traveling alone I wanted a small hotel that would care about me if I had any problems, and that is the kind of treatment I received. The owners and other staff took their time with any concern I had. They even spent time with me explaining the euros before I went out sightseeing the first time. They directed me to sights I wanted to see and to other sights that I was not aware of. The hotel is only 150 yards from the Florence Cathedral and very close to all of the monuments and museums. The staff offered to make reservations for me at the Uffizi and Accademia Galleries.I received a warm welcome via e-mail once I booked my stay and the day I left the hotel, I received warm goodbyes from the owners and a hug from one of the staff members. I will definately return again to Florence and when I do I will stay at the Hotel Casci. I have stayed at many large hotels but never one as comfortable and memorable as my stay at Hotel Casci.
