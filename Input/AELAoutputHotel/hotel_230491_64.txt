{"text":"Terrific Little Hotel! I have been meaning to write this review forever. My husband and I stayed at the Residence Henri for four nights during New Year's week. I can't say enough about the hotel or the charming staff. We had a room on the first floor with no balcony. However, it was very clean, spacious with a nice little kitchenette. Nice bathroom toiletries as well. Our one complaint (and this is about most European hotel beds) is that the mattress on our bed was not very comfortable. Just way too firm for our liking. That aside, the staff are incredibly helpful and friendly. Our day manager during our stay was a young man from Morrocco who was studying at the Sorbonne. His English was fantastic and he was very good natured about my terrible French (which I insisted on practicing to my husband's chagrin) My husband took ill one day, and he was very helpful in directing me on where to get medicine and even recommended warm Coca Cola for DH's stomach (it does work wonders by the way).I underscore other review's comments about the location - it's perfect for getting around Paris. Not only are you in the heart of the Latin Quarter, a stone's throw from Notre Dame (go very early if you don't want to wait in line for hours to get in!), but there are many wonderful restaurants within walking distance. Make sure to go to the Erik Kaiser pattisierie in the morning to get some of the best French pastery you will ever eat! Overall terrific hotel and a great value in one of Paris' best neighborhoods. I'll be returning for my next trip.
