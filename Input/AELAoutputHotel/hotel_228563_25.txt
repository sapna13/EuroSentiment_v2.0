{"text":"You will not be disappointed We stayed at this lovely hotel for three nights in December 2006. We booked via Lastminute.com and paid just √ä√£¬¢225 for the three nights B+B which we thought was very good value. Had seen it at twice that price on some websites so it pays to shop around. The staff were very friendly and attentive. The rooms were excellent with brilliant showers and amenities - the only thing I missed were tea and coffee making facilities. The rooms were exceptionally warm - I had to turn the heating off completely. If I had to take issue with anything it would be the cooked breakfast - it was cold. Despite this the selection for breakfast was oustanding and everyone should be able to find something to their taste. Had the breakfast been hot I would have given this hotel the full Excellent rating. Breakfast was served between 0700 and 1100 giving us the opportunity of a lie-in after hours of shopping. The area the hotel is in is commercial and on a busy road although we had no problems with noise as we were on the 7th floor overlooking a side street. The hotel has a pillow menu if you require different pillows, unfortunately the pillows we requested were not available. If, as we did, you have a hire car there is plenty of parking nearby in underground parking lots at a cost of around 2 euros per hour or leave it all day (24hrs) for 24 euros and use the good transportation options available. There are trams, taxis, buses and metro in abundance. We found the underground metro very useful and cheap 5 euros each to travel as much as you wanted all day. Just be careful of pickpockets as my wife had her wallet taken from her handbag and we were aware of the problems before we went and still became victims. Local police were very helpful in filing a crime report for us and very apologetic. The pickpockets appear to be Eastern European and definately not Spanish. Do not let this put you off as we had a really good time in Barcelona and will be going back and very likely staying in the same hotel.
