{"text":"An absolute gem The first thing i have to say is that this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed at - for many reasons. First the location is fabulous, you are a very short walk from Fishermans Wharf and Pier 39. You are also close to the cable car stop. There are several great restuarants in the area, our favourites being Bubba Gumps and The Rainforest Cafe - both fun places, with good food and service. Our room was a good size, well equipped, comfortable and quiet. We had no view at all, we over looked other rooms, but who goes to San Francisco to stay in their room. The bed was amazingly comfortable - if only we could have sneaked it home in our cases.the free breakfast was wonderful. especially considering it was free. There was plenty of room to sit, plenty of food, and it was replenished through the morning (during the set hours) There were plenty of healthy options available too. It certainly set us up for the day, and nobody seemed to mind us taking fruit with us (for a mid-morning power snack!) .The staff were polite, helpful and willing to help when we needed assistance.Having free internet access in the lobby was great, there are two computers and at times we had to wait to use them , but if we popped back to the hotel mid-afternoon (to drop off shopping!) they were usually available.The hotel is clean, and nicely decorated and has a welcoming feel to it. Like other people who wrote reviews, we were on the first floor and had to use the lift as the stairs were all marked as fire exits. But this is such a small thing to mention, and lets face it you're going to get plenty of exercise walking up and down those hills - you'll probably be glad of the lifts. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone. We plan to return to San Francisco in a couple of years, and will certainly be stopping here again. ","annotations":[]}
