{"text":"Not Quite There Overall--This is a Four Seasons, so the rooms were beautiful and the public spaces were quite elegant. However, the hotel has several service issues that are perplexing. These inconsistencies could be a bit maddening.Room--Very spacious and pleasant. Terrific marble bathrooms and the best part is the window seat, which allows guest to feel as though they are perched above the city while enjoying the sun. I felt like a lucky cat.Maid Service--Clean and to the point. Nothing out of the ordinary, but no complaints here.Food--Very good food for room service and very good food at the restaurant.Pool Area--Very open and relaxing and huge space.Gym--One of the best parts of the hotel. The gym is the LA Sports club, which has everything one needs.Service--Here I have to admit there were a few snafus. There was the reservation issue with Platinum AMX, which consisted of rate confusion and whether or not our card was supposed to be charged ahead of time. These issues were resolved, but not without a headache. Then there was the issue of me asking the concierge is he could suggest a catering service for a small party we were having at an apartment in South Beach. The guy never even called back with information or an explanation that he could not help us. Normally I would understand these small missteps, but at the Four Seasons? My experiences at their other properties were antithetical to this. In short, they need to work on service. Comparison to Mandarin Oriental--Two weeks after my stay at the Four Seasons, my partner and I spent a week at the Mandarin. Alas, the Four Seasons did not even come close to that experience.
