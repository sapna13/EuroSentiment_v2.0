{"text":"Don't believe the reviews My wife and I stayed here from 29 Jun - 5 Jul. First of all, as I have learned from many reviews off Trip Advisor, don't believe everything you read. The only thing I have read consistently with any accuracy is the need to get a rental car.Let's break it down. Rooms were spacious and well kept. The first night we arrived the maid never came by, but it was minor to us. We had plenty of towels and only slept in our bed for a night. I gave them the benefit of doubt and never complained, and to there credit we never had that problem again. They called us daily to see when we would like housekeeping to come by. Yes, the room had a bit of a musty smell, but it wasn't due to the lack of cleanliness. A candle fixed that. We even had an extra fridge in our suite so we were able to keep our own supplies readily cold in our room for consumption. Property was awesome. We were in villa 924 with ocean view and yes, it was a bit of a walk to the main resort and pool, but that was how we liked it. We enjoyed our daily walk to and from the pool\/resort. The scenery was amazing so we enjoyed taking in all of it during the walk.There was never a time that as we walked to and from our room, a staffer with a golf cart stop to offer a ride. Never ate in any of the restaraunts since we had a rental and wanted to experience Puerto Rican food while in Puerto Rico rather than Japanese or Italian. We ate daily at the pool grill for lunch and it was decently priced. C'mon folks, a $9 Cheeseburger with fries is the norm. If you want a value meal, then stay close to a McDonald's. Same goes for the drinks. I don't know where some of the reviewers normally go, but where I am from and where I have been $5-$10 for a drink is norm. Bartenders took care of us and never skimped on alcohol content. Try to stay during the week if possible. Service is different when the volume increases, but that's to expect anywhere. One thing I was frustrated by was the parking situation on the weekend. There was so many guests and so many people visiting guests, parking was non-existent beginning on Thursday and no one in the hotel seemed to care whether you found a spot or not. We ended parking on the other side of the resort. A small discrepany, but definitely something that needs attention. That Friday we had a problem at the pool grill too. The servers didn't have a grip (nor cared) on who had what tables so several families waited for some time to even get to order a drink. A couple next to us called management and to their credit the grill was swarmed with management and additional staffers within minutes. They personally stopped by our tables, took orders, and comp'd drinks and food for the inconvenience. Every resort working on that scale is likely to have problems. It's how they react and attempt to wrong the rights it is what counts!There it is. Don't let such a great place\/deal be overlooked because some people expect way too much even though they got a great deal. We thoroughly enjoyed it and because a few good reviews, we were prepared and it made our vacation so much better.
