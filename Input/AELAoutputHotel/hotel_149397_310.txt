{"text":"The good ...the bad Just got back from a week at the Princess Mar 30 -Apr 6. Thanks to all those who wrote reviews before. They were all helpful in setting my expectations.I'll keep it simple. The good....-The most beautiful beach I have ever seen. My girlfriend and I walked for hours everyday in each direction on unending powdery palm tree line beaches with the warmest water spashing on our feet...perfect.- The grounds were lush and immaculately kept. Such a beautiful variiety of foliage and lots of free ranging birds lik peacocks. While grounds are a little spread out, it never took more than 10 minutes to walk from one end to the other again in a beautiful setting. Shuttles always available if we wanted.-The weather was 10\/10...80 degrees sunny light to moderate winds. Couldn't have dialed it up any better- The rooms were open, spacious well air conditioned aqnd not musty or buggy. Individual verandas awesome in AM and evening-Platinum club was great. Helpful staff nice clubhouse. worth a few extra $- Went with Air Canada Vacations...no problems...smooth operation. On time, good flights, quick transfers with everything well organized. The bad...- The food could have been better. Like any all-inclusive it gets to be all the same by weeks end. Lots of variety though so you should be able to find something to your liking.- Staff was not always the happiest crowd. And language was a bit of a problem.- Hot water was not available at peaktimes (4-6pm) but cold felt good after hot day in sun.Hope this helps...we'll go back...
