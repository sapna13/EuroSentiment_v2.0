{"text":"Wonderful vacation! We booked this trip several months ago, and we were very excited, but I started to get worried when I read negative review as we got closer to going. I was worried for nothing because this is a wonderful hotel! First, you need to realize where you are going. The Dominican Republic is a very poor country, and they do things differently than we do here. They also speak Spanish. That being said, the resort is beautiful, and the workers at the resort know enough English to get you what you need. I speak Spanish, and this definately helped. My husband doesn't speak the language, but was fine.At the last minute we upgraded to the Servicio Real, which I recommend if you can afford it. If not, I think you can still have a great experience. (We had friends who were there that didn't do the Servicio Real, and their only complaint was the whole dinner reservation thing)The food was pretty good, but nothing fantastic. The Japonese place was our favorite, but the Dominican and the Italian were pretty good too.It rained a little bit, but it was fine because it is so warm you can just stay out in it and you are fine. One day we stayed in the ocean during a downpour because we figured we may as well. It was fun.The resort is huge, and we walked everywhere. There were plenty of trains, etc... for those who didn't want to walk.In all, I would recommend this place to just about everyone except the elderly (The place is very big, and you may have to walk a lot), and anyone who is very picky about food. (If you don't like trying new foods, etc..) ","annotations":[]}
