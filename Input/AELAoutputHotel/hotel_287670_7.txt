{"text":"Lovely stay We've just got back from the Banys Orientals, having booked following reviews we had read on this site. We booked direct by e-mail, and they were very efficient and answered questions promptly in English. We felt that the room price was excellent value.We caught the bus to Barcelona from Girona Airport with no trouble, and because it was very hot when we arrived at the bus station we decided against carrying luggage up and down stairs on the metro and caught a taxi instead - 15 minutes in heavy traffic, √à√\u2020√ü?, not bad, and a friendly lady driver who dropped us off at the corner. We travelled around the city by metro on one day, using a ten journey ticket between the two of us, and found it easy, and the rest of the time we walked slowly because of the heat, and with a prolonged lunch somewhere, and a siesta back at the cool hotel that worked fine.Our second floor room was very stylish, especially the bathroom, but it was quite tight to get around the bed, and there was a huge wardrobe but no drawer space or hooks to keep things tidy. However, who cares, for three days? The wardrobe safe, air conditioning and free iced water and internet were all very much appreciated, and the bed was wonderful. We looked out at the back of the hotel on to a quiet area. The staff in reception were unfailingly helpful and courteous, those in the restaurant were less smiley, but did the necessary. We were using both English and Spanish and felt that their knowledge of both might have been less confident than the reception staff.We ate one dinner and all our breakfasts in the hotel, and they were all delicious and very good value, especially the breakfasts if you can eat lots from a buffet in the morning, easy to fill up and then you don't need much later. If you don't want to eat much for breakfast, it's probably cheaper to go elsewhere, like right next door to the hotel. We also had some lovely lunches and dinners in the bars and restaurants round the city, and can recommend the Taller de Tapas and the Taberna del Cobre in the same street as the hotel.We didn't know Barcelona, and three days was a good introduction, one for the historic central part, one for the port and beach area, and one for the Gaud√à√¨√ú trail. Try the chocolate museum not far from the hotel! With ordinary city street awareness and common sense about what to carry when and where, we felt quite safe everywhere at all times. We shall go back for the rest of the sights at a slightly cooler time of year!
