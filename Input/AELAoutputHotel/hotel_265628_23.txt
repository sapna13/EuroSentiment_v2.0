{"text":"A total chill-out Just returned from two weeks at the Sirenis Tropical Suites, Punta Cana, and can honestly say that we would go back again. The staff, from the room maids to the entertainment team were cheerful and determined to make your time at the resort an enjoyable one. We did not take part in everything the resort had to offer as we opted to chill out and spend our days at the pool or at the beach - if we had wanted, there was a schedule of activities to take part in day and night. The food was average, some nights good, but the buffet style was a bit monotonous after two weeks - we did opt for the Italian and Japanese a couple of times and these were OK and made a nice change to queueing up with a plate. The Steak House and Mexican were to be avoided on a night unless you didn't mind being eaten alive by mosquitos. We had a junior suite room which was comfortable with air-con and a mini-fridge stocked daily with water and soft drinks - we left a daily tip of 100 pesos for the maid which ensured a well stocked mini-fridge and a swan made out of a hand towel every day - bless! The entertainment team were first rate, with the chance to win prizes from activities they arranged during the day to having a laugh and watching a decent show at night - followed by the Sirenis band or karaoke. Watch out for 'Spaghetti' who was hilarious!Weekends were inundated with locals which made competition for loungers on the pool or beach and the place did feel crowded at these times. By the way the beach was ideal for sun-bathing with a lovely breeze - the pool was good for the swim up bar but was roasting hot - wear sandals when walking about the pool area!Would recommend the resort for both families and couples. The pool and beach outside the Steak House area was more suited for couples perhaps with being more chilled out the other pool area was where the entertainment team led activities and was enjoyed more by young families.
