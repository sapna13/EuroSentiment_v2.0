{"text":"Pretty great ... but still needs some work. Overall ... when we stay on Oahu this is our favorite place (I have stayed at the Sheraton, etc). If you are happy to spend $300+ on a room then it is a good bet. It does have a few issues - see below. It is in a great location, it is clean, the rooms are well laid out and the beds are positively dream inducing. The views are great and the services\/amenities are also hard to beat (2 pools, parkade, laundromat, wedding services, shops, bars, several restaurants, Seattles best coffee, etc)There are however a few really annoying issues which need to be resolved.Issue 1: The elevators in the tower away from the beach (so any room that is not a deluxe ocean view) are terrible. They are so dumb that they are not staggered (they all go to every floor) and they all try to go to the same location at once. Every morning people waited as they hit almost every floor. If you are on a high floor you will have no problem getting on but you wil have to make 15 stops on your way down. If you are on a lower floor (10 or lower) you might have to wait 5-7 times before an elevator car is empty enough to fit you (and god forbid your kids) on board. To be fair to the hotel ... they are currently addressing this. Did not help us for the 8 days we stayed there ... but should be fixed in 2 weeks or so from the date of this post.Issue 2: The Kuhio Beach Grill restaurant is overpriced and has a long wait every morning. Go to Arancinos (the Italian place) which is also in the hotel. The buffet is awesome and the cappucino is great.Minor Issue #3: The room keys suck. You have to shove them in and out multiple times to get the lock to respond. The parkade seems to read them perfectly. What gives? The first time I stayed there I went down to the desk twice for new keys before I realized that I had to try 20 times to get it to work. Maybe you will have better luck ... but they are old and need to be updated.Minor Issue #4. The gym has no windows. In such a beatiful place it seems criminal to me that the gym feels like a bunker. It is a decent gym ... but I want a view.I have stayed in this hotel 3 times and have always had a relaxing and happy time so I keep coming back. It is close to the zoo and an easy hike to Diamond head. It is close to shops and has a built-in parkade if you have a rental car (tip: get a new 07 convertible Sebring not a mustang).Some tips:1.) Stay on a higher floor if you have a partial or ocean view. You will get better scenery and will get first dibs on the dumb elevators in the morning.2.) Get a deluze ocean view room if you can spend the money... you will get a better view and much better elevators. You will also get to avoid the registration desk on your way to and from the beach. Our best experience 2 years ago was when we stayed in a Deluxe room (you get what you pay for ... I am sure I heard that somewhere :-)3.) Get up early ... you will get seated for breakfast without waiting ... you can go to Hanauma Bay before it gets crowded and you will get your Americano before the line starts. Oh ... and your elevator might not stop 15 times on the way down as it picks up competitors for the breakfast line.4.) Buy booze, water, food, etc at the ABC store and keep it in your room. For anyone new to Hawaii ... this is a must. Maker sure sunblock \/ sunscreen is the first thing you buy. The second thing you buy should be the Oahu Revealed guide for $16. Best money you will spend the whole trip.That's it ... hope this helps you out!
