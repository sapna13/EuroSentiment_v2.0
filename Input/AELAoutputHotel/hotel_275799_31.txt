{"text":"Excellent Service - Great Food - Fun Ambience My boyfriend and I just returned from a 4 night stay at the W Mexico City - what a treat! We booked ourselves here because my boyfriend had to attend a convention in a nearby suburb, and instead of staying at the Fiesta Inn closer to the venue, we decided to treat ourselves and make a vacation out of the trip.Check in was a breeze and the hotel staff was very helpful. The staff at the Whiskey\/Lobby bar were extremely accommodating of our love for the Sauvignon Blanc that was only served in the upstairs restaurant, and went out of their way to travel up and down the stairs just to bring us the wine we like! We stayed in a Spectacular Room. The beds were extra comfy and the rooms were clean and unique. We loved the hammock in the bathroom and the three-shower heads in the shower. The only downside to our room was the closet space √à√\u2020\u2022?there was virtually none, which was kind of a hassle. We treated ourselves to massages (Swedish - both excellent) and I enjoyed a pedicure - very expertly done! We worked out at the gym daily - all the machines are top of the line (they're equipped to read your heart monitor if you have one) and the equipment is extremely well cared for. As far as the neighborhood, you can't get any better than the trendy Polanco district - it's extremely chic, and there are wonderful restaurants and shops just within blocks of the hotel. If you'd like to go anywhere, the hotel will arrange a driver for you, and even send the driver to pick you up when you're done exploring!We ate at the restaurant every night for dinner and I tried 4 different entrees, and they were all impeccable. My boyfriend is a vegetarian and he found the selection quite ample and was able to enjoy a variety of fish and veggie dishes. The brunch options are also fantastic.All in all, our stay at the W Mexico City was really the highlight of our trip.
