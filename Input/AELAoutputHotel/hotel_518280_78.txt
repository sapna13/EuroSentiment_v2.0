{"text":"Beware nighttime construction noise next door I just left after a week at the QT, where I've stayed many times. As others have commented, there is much to recommend it:O the location is wonderful (a half-block east of Times Square)O the staff are pleasant and helpfulO the beds are comfyO the free breakfast is excellent -- REAL croissants, bagels, muffins, along with hard-boiled eggs, cereals, yogurt, etc.O there is a hi-tech espresso machine, available 24 hrs a day, that makes reasonably good espresso, lattes, and cappucinos (decaf and regular)HOWEVER, there is construction under way next door to the hotel; it looks as though a building will soon be going up where there used to be a parking lot. But the noise is not during normal construction hours: It lasted from approximately midnight until dawn, apparently because trucks can't get through (or aren't permitted to) during the day. The noise wasn't constant, but I was awakened from time to time by clanking (steel beams being unloaded?), and didn't enjoy restful sleep all week.It's probably a good idea to ask about the construction when making a reservation.A few recommendations near the QT: O Orso Italian restaurant -- Like the QT, right in the heart of the theater district; excellent, reasonably-priced, charming placeO John's Pizzeria -- justifiably renowned pizza and FABULOUS baked ziti. Quite cheap, pleasant ambiance (it's a converted church), but noisy. A couple of blocks from the QT.O DB Bistro Moderne -- not cheap, but superb modern bistro food; owned by chef Daniel Boulud. A couple of blocks from the QT.O Tang Pavilion -- about a 20-minute walk from the QT, just off 5th Avenue near the Plaza Hotel, FAO Schwartz, etc. Amazingly cheap, excellent Chinese (esp. Shangai-style) food in a superb location.
