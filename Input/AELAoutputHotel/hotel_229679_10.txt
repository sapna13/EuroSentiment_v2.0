{"text":"Simply stunning! My brother and I stayed at the Le Meridian for 4 nights and it was a fantastic choice. We looked at lots of luxury hotels in Barcelona but the location of this one sealed the deal and we weren't disappointed. It is a fantastic escape from the charismatic but noisy Ramblas whilst still retaining the feeling of being part of the action. The hotel has recently been refurbished and it oozes quality and style from every angle, including the very cool image mosaic on the doors and windows of the entrance, the futuristic lighting in the lobby, the Gaudi chairs at the concierge desk and the stunning Cent Onze restaurant and bar. We stayed in a twin deluxe room, which had one of the best showers I have ever experienced (perfect after a long day of trekking and sight seeing!), very comfortable beds, bathrobes, slippers, tea and coffee and a ridiculously large plasma television to name just a few (including a second flat screen in the bathroom!). The only negative was the over priced mini-bar but all the hotels I have been to are the same. Breakfast was superb with a huge selection to suit all tastes and diets. There is a chef on hand cooking eggs and crepes to your liking which we thought was a fantastic concept. Wonderful omelettes! We also dined in the restaurant which is pricey but the food is excellent as is the service. All the ingredients are bought fresh from the Boqueria market apparently! A three course meal with wine was around 65 euros each.We found all the staff excellent. They were instantly helpful in reserving tables for dinner, calling taxis and making calls for us.There is also a gym and business centre with free internet use.I would definitely recommend it. We didn't want to leave!
