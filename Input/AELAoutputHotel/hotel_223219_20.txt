{"text":"Cool Kids Suite We stayed here for almost a week while my husband was in Seattle for a conference. We chose a 'kids suite' because we were traveling with our 21 month old son. It consisted of a regular king size hotel room with a separate room which contained a set of twin bunkbeds, an adult desk, a small kid-sized table, and a bookshelf\/dresser. The problem with the room layout is that the bathroom and closet door is located off of the kids' room. For the price (compared to other downtown hotels), I was very happy with what we got.Overall, the hotel was nice, not great, but nice. Rooms were clean, pillows were comfy (including a pillow menu to choose whatever you like), towels were relatively absorbent though small. The front desk staff was very helpful, including 2 or 3 phone calls before the trip. The location was OK, near downtown (my husband walked to the convention center every day-15 minutes walk), but the area seemed to be in a state of revitalization. The park that's across the street had several homeless men and women who'd 'hang out' there, yet there was a very nice whole foods grocery store not 3 blocks from there. There was a TON of road construction going on on Dexter Ave., but that was par for the course across the city and not Holiday Inn's fault. There was a restaurant in the hotel, but we never went there. The biggest negative about Seattle in general is the parking. The hotel parking was clean, safe, and easily accessible through the elevator. If you'd travel off property, you'd pay $10-12 for 2 hours, almost regardless of where you went. Hotel parking was $8\/day and there were plenty of spots. If I had to go back to Seattle under the same circumstances, I would definitely choose this hotel again.
