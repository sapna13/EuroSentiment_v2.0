{"text":"Beautiful Intimate Hotel in Montparnasse Although I did not stay in this hotel myself (I wanted to, they just did not have an available room), the friends I was travelling with had a wonderful experience. I went to visit them at Hotel Chaplain Rive Gauche and was so impressed. The hotel has been completely remodeled and is beautifully appointed and modern. My friends' room was so comfortable and luxurious. I spent the better part of an evening there and the staff was extremely accomodating. The same was true the next morning when I went back to have petit dejeuner with them in their room before they left to go home to the states. I have been to Paris a number of times and this is a hotel that I would recommend to any friend who asked. Also, the location is excellent, just off of Bd. du Montparnasse and Bd. Raspail at Vavin Metro. There is a self-service laundry just around the corner - something that is much needed by travellers, but very difficult to find! Merci bien to the staff and the management of this great establishment. This experience topped off the trip to France for my friends who had never been out of the USA before.As for price, from what my friends told me, some would find it quite reasonable, others might consider it a treat for themselves, as they did. But, they also said that it was worth every euro and that while they worked to pay off the trip, the memories of that treat would make each payment much more pleasant. They felt in the lap of luxury during their stay. Mae ChamberlainSouth Carolina, USA ","annotations":[]}
