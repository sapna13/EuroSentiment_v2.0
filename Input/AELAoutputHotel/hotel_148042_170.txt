{"text":"Nice Time at the Ritz My partner and I had a great time overall at the Ritz. When we arrived, we were able to check in and got a room facing the pool on the 2nd floor. We were quite happy the first night. On the second night of our four night visit, we had some REALLY noisy neighbors in the room next to us. There was LOUD music from 6 PM to 6AM. We complained three times and the loud music would stop for a while and then start up again. In the end, on our second night we literally got no sleep. After explaining this situation to management the next day, they were very apologetic and we were moved to a very nice ocean view room on the 10th floor. Our bill was also adjusted accordingly and I asked for a meal credit which was given to us and was used at Mares. The food and service at Mares was very good. In fact, they have the best guava flan I have ever tasted. It was so good that I requested a copy of the recipe, which was emailed to me, when we checked out. We also used the gym (which is part of the resort fee) which was nicely equipped with treadmills, etc. We also had continental breakfast in the lobby bar which at $18 a pop was not cheep but nevertheless was good with great coffee. On our last night we ate at Il Molino which was expensive but the service and food were excellent. The beach just outside of the hotel was very nice. They obviously comb the beach to get rid of the trash, rocks, etc. They also provide great lounge chairs with umbrellas. Regarding the noise, yes this hotel is right next to the airport runways and this is a known fact. If airplane noise bothers you, then go somewhere else, however, you will not hear the noise when in your room and it is not like LAX, JFK or ORD where there is one plane taking off every 20 seconds! Based on our experience, we will return to this hotel.
