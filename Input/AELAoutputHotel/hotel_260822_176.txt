{"text":"Modern chic, clean, convenient, great staff. I live in Florence and a friend asked me to find her a hotel near everything. Of course I read Trip Advisor first before surfing the web. All good reviews so I told her I preferred this one to a couple of others in the area with good enough reviews. And as I looked more into this hotel I found it to be only nonsmoking rooms which is wonderful and very rare in europe except the large chains and that they speak english. So she was happy from the pics from their website and this information. She stayed 3 nights and just left and probably will write her own review. She said she will always stay here. But I felt I needed to write one too as I was very impressed. It is so close to everything that we came back to the hotel several times as she forgot to close the window as it was cold, then we came back again to use the bathroom. So it is so convenient if you need to unload your packages, get your coat, or whatever. Also it is very cool and tastefully remodeled in subdued chic style. It is small but that is the italian quaint. You still know you are in Italy unlike the chains. Visitors are not allowed in the rooms so I only peeked in her room for a few seconds and it had a lovely view, nice and bright, flat screen tv on wall, large new bathroom. The website pics do not do it justice. The staff are so nice. My friend was alone so she felt safe and well cared for. It is near the train station that you could easily walk if you travel light. But her room was silent, no noise from the street.The hotel is renovated new, it is near everything, it is cool yet quaint. I will recommend it to anyone who asks me where to stay.
