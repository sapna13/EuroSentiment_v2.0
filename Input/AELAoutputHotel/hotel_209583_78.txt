{"text":"Disgusting, Horrible and would never go back in a million years Where do I begin ...Friends and I went to the Barcel√ã¬\u2022? B√ã?¬©varo Palace for a girls getaway for 5 days and had the worst experience. Our reservation was messed up from the beginning from the pont where they stated they took American express and then they would only take MC or Visa (luckily I had another card). We had to check in twice in order to keep our rooms. The front staff were not very friendly, the room was smelled of mildew and there was mold in and around the entire bathroom and tub. We arrived around 3:30-4pm so we wandered around the grounds. Based on a recomendation from the staff we ate at the seafood resturant La Brisa where the food was overcooked and taseless (we sent 90% of it back) and for our troubles I had food poisoning the first night there wishing for a plane ride home. Over the course of the next few days we had to scrounge for edible food and we most likely lost 10 lbs each. Customer service was poor or rude everytime we needed help or asked a question. All the drinks were watered down and it was hard to find a good drink at the various bars. The beach is beautiful and you can always find somewhere to lay which was the only saving grace of the trip. A few tips for those brave enough to still want to stay here;-Bring Lysol for the room-Bring plenty of Rolaids or Tums- Pay the $20 fo rthe American channels to watch TV but please note that 6 of the 18 will still be in Spanish.-Bring a deck of cards or something else to do in the evenings for entertainment is poor-Bring Neosporin or something for bug bites you will need it.-Get used to lukewarm water for ice is never offered.-Stay away from anything dairy if you want to survive. (Leche muy mal)-Try the Steakhouse for at least one decent meal-Bring a flashlight for there are only low lights or no lights every 20 feet on the property.- If you are not shy try the beach massage in the huts but you will be partially nude during your massage.-If you have older children, be prepared to know that partial nudity is allowed so don't be surprised at what you see.-bring a Spanish speaking friend, a handheld translator, learn some very key Spanish phrases.- Finally, kiss the soil of whatever county you come from when you make it back in one piece!
