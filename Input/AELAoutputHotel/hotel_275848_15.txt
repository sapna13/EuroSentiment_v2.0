{"text":"Room with a bit of a view Super little hotel close to the train station - but longer if you can't follow the map on the hotel website! clean modern rooms, great bonus is the free wifi and also the laptops in the rooms.Photo's make hotel common areas look more spacious than they are but rooms are a perfect pit stop for a few days in florence.Breakfast was adequate, usual fair, nothing to write home about, breakfast room was small so could be a bit of a problem when hotel busier. We ate locally at the Trattoria Tuscano - super and no wait unlike the Zsa Zsa (or similar?) that had been recommended by the hotel (both located in the market square at the end of the street the hotel is located on)Hotel well located for the top attractions, all within strolling distance. On our second day we spent a long lazy lunchtime in a great restaurant just round the corner (name escapes me but italian for hedgehog) . Very attentive service with bespoke menu created - and at a time when the Serie A finale was being contested! (Bravo Inter!)both meals in the local area much better than offerings closer to the tourist haunts and half the priceunusually for may we visited and enjoyed torrential rain and no tuscan sun so most of our time was spent enjoying pasta and wine!when the sun did break out we struck lucky and stumbled across a tiny little private club located on the banks of the Arno beside pont vecchio (look for the green door just past the hotel orafi) and soaked up the rays right on the banks of the river (cheap coffee too) would recommend hotel and location for anyone visiting florence ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1258,"mention":"pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":1253},{"endOffset":1357,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1353},{"endOffset":1357,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1353},{"endOffset":1531,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1525},{"endOffset":1531,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1525},{"endOffset":1531,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1525},{"endOffset":1531,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1525}]}
