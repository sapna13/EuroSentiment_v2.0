{"text":"Amankila, Bali, a unique expirience Bali: Amankila, Bali, a unique experience,magnificent!Date: May, 2008Reviewer: D Nuttall - seasoned traveller  My wife and I have just returned from a 10 day stay at the Amankila resort in Bali. This boutique resort has to be one of best travel experiences of my life. One of the first things to impact on you is the feeling that you are a very special guest. we were made to feel so special from the second we stepped off the aircraft and transported in air conditioned luxury to this one of a kind resort. We were welcomed as if we were long lost family members. The stunning architecture and amazing service was only surpassed by the quality of the food. What's more I can guarantee that the diverse cuisine will meet the expectations of the most discerning global palette.Not only were we interviewed daily by the executive chef (James Stanton) for special requests and daitary needs, it seemed to me that his team of waiting staff were telepathic. By this I mean one only had to think of a glass of fine wine and it appeared.It was so lovely that it was hard to drag ourselves away from Amankila to go soak up the other attractions Bali has to offer In fact on many days we didn't bother. We simply wrapped ourselves in the family atmosphere and let Bali come to us in the form of many cultural evening shows. During the day we often enjoyed many hours by the terraced pools overlooking the tropical shoreline below. Then there was the pool side massages which were delivered elegance and serenity.  Overall I would say this is probably the best resort experience in my 51 years on the planet. So if you want to mix sheer tropical luxury, real Indonesian culture and world beating cuisine, then Amankila and it's food is an absolute must ","annotations":[{"endOffset":8,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":50,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":42},{"endOffset":214,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":206},{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":1128},{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":1128},{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":1128},{"endOffset":1136,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":1128},{"endOffset":1744,"mention":"Amankila","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Amankila"],"startOffset":1736}]}
