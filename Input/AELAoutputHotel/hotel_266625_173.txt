{"text":"windy Jan 5 √à√\u2020\u2022?12 2007We are a couple in early 30, experience travelers, with many visits to Cuba, Dominican, Mexico, and Bahamas.FLIGHTSkyservice - plane e320 is very small, can feel every little bump  they put people like sardines. No J class. Flight was 4hrs and 25 minutes to Punta Cana from Hamilton. If you flying from Hamilton note that this facilities are very small, and yes - no duty free or smoking area.ARRIVE IN PUNTA CANAPrepare yourself to walk from the plane down the stairs. Quick process at the airport. Bell boys not too pushy - just say NO. Ride to resort is another story - they say is around an hour - more likely two hours on curvy, bumpy road. Sirenis is one of the fares one, so be prepare to stop in others resorts on the way there - too long. TAXI faster, but not recommended - not sure about safety.SIRENIS COCTAILLate check - in is a totally nightmare - it seems like they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know what they doing, that is why is so long, no welcome drink. Be prepare to wait till morning hours to finally get to your room and even then you cant be sure that there is nobody else already sleeping there. It had happened too many people on our flight - ....and haw many others?? In the middle of the week we were awaken in the early morning by another couple try to get their room. Since there we kept √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬£O MALESTADE sign outside our door.Rooms - good size and clean. Be preper that some of the things in the room may not working and it takes forever for them to fix it ( things like - phone, air condition, patio door) thing that takes 5- 10 minutes in here - over there is like 5 - 10 hours and there is always tomorrow. NOTE - if you plan to have some gifts for cleaning people - they are most men, not ladies. We were at √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√∫ - coco side - the best ocean view - just few meters away from the beach  pool.Food √à√\u2020\u2022?there are choices of food for everybody, and we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see anybody being hungry. Only disappointment was in a lack of fish. Island and no fish sound bizarre. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√©l Carte√à√\u2020\u2022?restaurants are in my opinion are waist of the time √à√\u2020\u2022?most people end up at the buffet anyway. What is the point to serve a chicken at √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºeafood restaurant√à√\u2020\u2022?or √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºea cocktail√à√\u2020\u2022?with two little shrimps in it and rice?????Entertainment - except few shows there is nothing there. Perfect for anybody who like to be in bad by 11 pm. Bar open till 12 am with no international drinks. Daily entertainment is very poor. If you are a party animal look somewhere else. Disco is small, smelly, dark, and you have to pay for the drinks. Going outside the resort at night time is not recommended due to your safety. Shopping √à√\u2020\u2022?there are few shops in the front of hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?expensive, for good bargain visit one of the small shops at each end of the property , right on the beach. Bargain, bargain prices , they usually start from high and you can pay only 20%. Nice paintings.Grounds √à√\u2020\u2022?very clean and in good shape √à√\u2020\u2022?from time to time you can see crew working on something √à√\u2020\u2022?no problem.Beach and Pool - beach is not bad, cleaned daily. Coral reef is close to the beach √à√\u2020\u2022?watch were you stand in the water. Pool is nice, big, two swim-up bars, quiet section, kid√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ pool √à√\u2020\u2022?cleaned every morning. You have to reserve a lounge early in the morning.Extrusions √à√\u2020\u2022?there are few trips that they are offer, but really nothing special and way overprice.Overall impression - It is not bad for 3.5* - 4* resort. Very windy.
