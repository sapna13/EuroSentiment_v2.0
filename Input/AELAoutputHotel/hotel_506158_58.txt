{"text":"Classy  The title of this review is a bit of a give away...Position- spot on- right in the guts of La Rambla...initial perspective, lobby etc, very classy, expensively done, very stylish. The reception people were a tad cool I thought, not overly burdened with a service ethic. We arrived around 1pm, and were told that check in was at 3, and felt that they didn't really try and help us in what we might do for 2 hours. They weren't rude or anything ,just didn't really seem to care too much. Anyway, our friends booked into their room- a normal one with a view over a alley way\/stairwell thing, and we went to our superior room- v expensive at 420 Euros, but very well appointed, lovely big king size bed, superb pillows, and a sun terrace. good for entertaining. All a bit small for the $$$ however- comparing it to the room we had in a Paris hotel afterwards.We were on the 5th floor, out the back, overlooking a plaza that got a bit noisy later in the days. Faciities are very good, the gym\/ pool complex in the basement was very groovy, as was the bar\/ pool area on the roof- warning- don't try and dive in the pool, it is tiny and only knee deep, really there for true dipping as opposed to anything else.Yes, drinks are expensive, but the 360 degree view is superb. The service levels stayed the same over the 3 nights we were there- cool, standoffish- they don't help people in off the street with their luggage for example- they stand back and wait for you to come to them! Didn't eat there, too many choices outside.All in all, as I've said above. I think it was expensive for what we got, I think you may as well just get an ordinary room, a fair bit cheaper. I wouldn't stay there again, as much to do with the overall attitude as much as the value- they are linked of course. ","annotations":[]}
