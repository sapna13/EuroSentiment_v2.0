{"text":"great hotel - stay here! Well I read the reviews before booking and I can just say that gay guys are tough customers! All those little things in the reviews are tiny things that sure could be better - but overall its a great quality hotel..and best of all its gay.Its not a 5 star hotel but its great - extremely clean, very friendly staff who went out of the way to help with everything, nice rooms with terrace overlooking street, great jacuzzi and steam on rooftop, very convenient location to both gay and tourist sights.Beds are super large and comfortable, yes the clothing rack is a rack and not a closed cupboard (can this seriously ruin your time in Barcelona!) and yes the shower door doesnt go right across the shower and some water gets on the floor - but you have a mat to put on the floor and your room gets cleaned every day - so does this really matter so much?!As for the guys saying there are men looking for sex here - well it is gay hotel! But if you are in your room with the door closed - how would you know what is happening outside your room!!! I saw a few guys giving smiles and eye contact - but nothing more than you get on the streets outside! There were straight couples here when I stayed and gay guys with straight friends staying too - everyone was super friendly and relaxed. It is a little bit expensive for what it is - maybe should be a bit cheaper but overall I had a great stay for 5 nights, met friendly guys, walked to the gay bars, enjoyed the terrace on the roof, and slept wonderfully in the bed and with the 3 curtains that block out all the sun in the morning.And finally yes its a busy streets outside, but look around you. It is Barcelona! Everyone lives on a busy street here, its city life and thats what is part of amazing Barcelona.So book here and enjoy your time in Barcelona ;-) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":393,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":389}]}
