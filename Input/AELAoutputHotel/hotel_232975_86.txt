{"text":"Terrific Hotel After having made reservations at two other hotels in Florence and reading disturbing reviews about them on tripadvisor.com, I decided to reserve a room at Il Guelfo Bianco after a family friend spent some time there in mid-July and raved about the hotel. We spent three nights at the hotel. It was a short walk from the train station, which we were able to do with little difficulty, even with two large duffel bags on wheels and two children in tow. We had one extremely large room with four beds and a beautiful bathroom. The room was the most exquisitely decorated hotel accommodation we had during our two-week Italian trip. The hotel staff was extremely helpful, especially one young woman who helped us get bus schedules to and from Siena the day before the Palio. A note to travellers who might be planning a day trip to Siena prior to the Palio on August 15, a national holiday in Italy (the Palio is held on August 16) -- buses do not run very often to and from Siena from Florence. We took a 9:10 a.m. bus to Siena but had to wait until 5:40 p.m. for the bus back to Florence. That was a long time to spend in Siena., especially with two children. It would have been ideal to get back to Florence by mid-afternoon. A large plus for us was the hotel's location a few doors away from McDonald's, where we spent a lot of time. Because of my 10-year-old son's picky eating habits, we would get him his daily dose of Chicken McNuggets for dinner and then the rest of us would have dinner at a nice restaurant, while he would sit there sipping his $4 Coke. The hotel was very close to Michelangelo's David, and because we reserved tickets ahead of time, there was hardly a wait to get in. One downside to Florence was the crowds, but we managed to escape the hordes of tourists by exploring less crowded areas of the city. A highlight for us was a tour of the Synagogue, which like the rest of the city, is absolutely beautiful. Breakfast was good, nothing special. We had the choice of eating inside or outside. There is an outdoor flea market very close to the hotel, where all sorts of leather goods and other souvenirs can be purchased. Some of the stalls were part of established stores selling quality leather products while others were just stalls selling knock-off purses. So, buyer beware. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Florence.
