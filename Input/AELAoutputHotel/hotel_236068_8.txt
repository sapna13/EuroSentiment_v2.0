{"text":"great location We traveled as a group of 4 and therefore stayed in the basement 'suite'. this means you have two bedrooms, a bathroom and a hallway to yourself with a private door. the rooms were all very light and spacious, and there is plenty of wadrobe space and a bookcase of left behind books. however the steps down were VERY steep, but this seems to be the case in most places in amsterdam. the hotel was clean, the breakfast was continental, but of a good quality. we had a tv in each room with a few english speaking channels. there was also a hairdryer and fan, although no coffee making facitities.the only issue with staying in the basement is you are below the dining room and therefore it is VERY noisy from around 7am but is otherwise very quiet for the rest of the day. the staff were friendly when you made the effort to speak to them, they were very helpful in giving us local information but kept themselves to themselves mainly. we never felt they were rude or unreasonable. we came home late on a few occasions but no one complained to us about being noisy so even though this is a quiet hotel, you can still use it as a base for a more lively holiday. as said previously the hotel is round the corner from the tram line there is also a small shop selling most things you would get in the uk. you are about 10mins away from the museums and the park and about 15 mins away from plenty of nice bars and resturants including hard rock cafe. the website clearly states you will need to pay upfront when you check in so have your money ready (remember the tax also) we paid 630 euro for 4 people for 5 nights which really was a bargain (esp with the prices in amsterdam - pint of beer is around 5 euro).also we were told no drugs in the hotel so you would be best to check before you book, but obviously amsterdam is very liberal with this so it shouldnt be a problem finding somewhere else. the bars smell very much of weed and tobacco, which took a bit of getting used to from the uk smoking ban. i felt this hotel was excellent value for money and was in a great location - if you fancy a walk it is only around 30 min walk to the main area (red light, train station) and this is a nicer area to stay in. i would reccomend the hotel but would think twice if i had children under 5 or those with mobility problems (although you may have problems with most stairs in amsterdam).
