{"text":"I love this hotel! I can't say enough good things about the Savoy,I lived in Florence for two years and love the city and go back at least twice a year,so I've stayed at quite a few places in Florence and sorry to say, but Italian hotels can often be outrageously overpriced and short on amenities, but this is the best hotel in Florence, without a doubt and one of my favourite hotels in the world.It is a beautiful building right on Piazza Repubblicca,minutes walk from fabulous shopping on Via del Sole, Via degli Vigna Nouva, via Porta Rossa and Piazza Duomo and very close to any tourist sites you will want to see,it has been absolutely beautifully decorated by Olga Polizzi(Sir R's sister!)and the bar and restaurant are lovely- great food too.The rooms can be a little on the small side but not ridiculously so and the bathrooms are wonderful(again sometimes not a given in Italian hotels!)The staff and service are impeccable,some of the best in the worldand they seem to have a very low turnover rate- you will see familiar faces when you return and I think that's always a mark of a good hotel\/restaurant, they cannot do enough for you and the ever effiecient concierge is on hand to reccommend and book any restaurant\/tickets that you could wish for.I am really sensitive to noise and I have never had a problem here.However, they don't have a gym or spa,I know that some people especially Americans have a real problem travelling to Florence because they simply can't find a hotel with a gymt,although the Hotel Lungarno was in the process of building one I think).I haven't got a bad word to say about it-well, maybe one and to give people a warning too-the outside terrace is lovely and a wonderful place to sip Prosecco and watch the world go by but....keep a real good eye on your valuables,I personally know two people who got their mobile phones stolen here, the trick is that a young gypsy guy will come up holding out a piece of cardboard claiming he is disabled in some way and hold it very insistently over your table, as you are trying to shoo him away, he will use the cover of the cardboard to root around your table and steal anything there,I know that some hotels and restaurants have installed security guards to combat the problem, I'm not sure if the Savoy is one of them. Gypsies are everywhere in Florence and the level of pickpocketing very high, be careful if you are approached by young girls and some of them are really young, only four or five, they tend to hold out newspapers or again cardbord, three or four of them will then surround a tourist and distract him while one of them rifles through their pockets,there is not a lot of violent crime in Florence at all, I have felt completely safe walking around at night, but it has a huge drugs problem and so petty crime is up too - be especially careful in the Mercato Centrale,pickpockets are rife!I've also had a couple of friends have their bags razored along the bottom and the contents stolen like that.Don't be paranoid, but be careful- just like anywhere else I suppose!One other word of warning- the caf√ã√\u2022√ñs in Piazza Reppubblicca and Piazza Duomo can be outrageously expensive if you sit on the terrace, there is a fixed price in every caf√ã√\u2022√ñ for a drink at the bar, then a higher price if you sit at a table and then a higher price again if you sit outside, and if you want to sit outside near a major landmark- well, the sky's the limit- I used to work in a caf√ã√\u2022√ñ on Piazza Duomo and I alwas hated having to tell people that yes, that beer they'd just had was really going to cost them 15√à√\u2020√ü?have a good idea of the prices before you order!That said- sitting outside on a fantastic terrace may be an experience beyond money!but at least you've been warned! Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ Gilli- is the best caf√ã√\u2022√ñ on Piazza Repubbica( IMHO)and to sit outside,sip your drink and watch the beautiful people of Florence,swan around the piazza for their evening passeggiata-is priceless!I wish I was there now!
