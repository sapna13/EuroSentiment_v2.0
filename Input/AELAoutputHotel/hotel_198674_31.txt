{"text":"OUR BEST HOTEL EXPERIENCE YET We visited Florence as part of our first anniversary trip, and I chose this hotel after much searching and bargaining. We got a great deal on our standard room, and while excited about the location and cost, I was a little nervous.Well, Roberto greeted us at arrival and we were swiftly checked in to the room. He showed us around (safe, light switches, view, etc) and left us to settle in. What a great surprise! We had a nice open view with lots of light - and the top of the San Lorenzo dome just a rooftop away! The room was well decorated even though somewhat small (but quite reasonable by Italy standards in big cities and plenty for four nights) and spotlessly clean. The bathroom was also nice, with a small but not tiny shower also brand new. The water temps were a little finicky but not a big deal, especially considering Florence's ancient plumbing. The room was free of street noise, but since we were near the breakfast room it could get a little loud but we were already up and we're also heavy sleepers. Area rugs could help solve this I'm sure. If you're a light sleeper, just request a rear 2nd floor room or just to be on the third floor.Both Roberto and Margherita were extremely helpful. Margherita booked our Uffizzi reservations (a MUST if you don't want to wait in line for possibly hours), helped us find directions  the right bus to visit an old family friend, and also helped immensely (international calls from our room were VERY reasonable, and worth the additional cost over a phone card since the calls were short) when our bank stopped our credit card thinking it was stolen. The breakfast was TERRIFIC by any standard: 3 juices, bottled water, fresh coffee, milk, toast, pastries, meats, cheese, fruit, yogurt, cereals, hard boiled eggs ....... just a wonderful spread well presented in the pleasant breakfast room.We spent most of our time outside the hotel, but our time there was memorable, warm, and a delight. We will definitely return again, and perhaps splurge on a deluxe room for a longer stay.Just a note, if you are picky about your bed, ours was quite firm but that was good for us so it's a matter of preference. The shower is a bit small so if you're very tall or larger (to be fair) it might make showering a challenge. I don't see any reason you couldn't request a shower-tub room. Also, the independently controlled central heat\/air is REALLY nice. I forgot to take photos of the room but here's the view (it was rainy on our trip, but great anyway) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":457,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":453},{"endOffset":1720,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1714},{"endOffset":1733,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1728},{"endOffset":1743,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":1735},{"endOffset":1773,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1767},{"endOffset":1977,"mention":"delight","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Turkish_delight","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Angel_Delight"],"startOffset":1970},{"endOffset":2428,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2424}]}
