{"text":"Great location, but I expected more personal touch I stayed at the hotel as a stop-over on my trip to Siem Reap.The Intercontinental hotel is definitely a great hotel. It is very well located, close to a mall and an MRT station (Bugis). It is also a short walk to the Esplanade area or even to the Arab district and Little India. I cannot faul the hotel for anything about its features and amenities. Big room, soft bed and pillows, big bathroom, flatscreen tv. I was a bit turned off though by the fact that they didn't provide complimentary water for their coffee-making facilities. One bottle was 12SGD! :) A small detail as it may seem (and the fact that water from the tap is safe to drink in Singapore), I think that would have been an extra most appreciated by the guests.The hotel breakfast was good, with a wide variety of choices.While I had some little problems with my booking thru Asiatravel, I got a prompt reply from the hotel when I emailed them direct and I didn't have problems with checking-in.In general, the hotel is great, the staff is good, but I had expected a little extra from the staff service. I noticed the stark difference from the very warm welcome I got from Swissotel Merchant Court on my stay coming back from Siem Reap. It seemed that I really was welcome and the interaction with the staff seemed more sincere instead of just standard procedures.Nevertheless, I still highly recommend Inter Continental Hotel and would even stay there again primarily because of its great location!
