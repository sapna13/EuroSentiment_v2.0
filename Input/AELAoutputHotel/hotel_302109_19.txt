{"text":"A Great place to stay We recently stayed in the Shangri La in Singapore for a two night stop over en route to Bali. We arrived at 6am after a direct flight from the UK. The reception staff were really efficient and we were able to check in to our room even at this time. The hotel lobby is grand and our room was a good size with a nice bathroom with large walk in shower. The bed was really comfortable! Breakfast was included with our room price and was very good. There was a large selction of food available on the the buffet breakfast. Sign posts direct you to different stands with various styles of food available at each one.The coffee shop next door to the restaurant serves beautiful homemade cakes. Well worth a slice or two. For those of you who like to work out there is a large well equipped gym and the pool is very good too. However be wary of the price of drinks by the pool side. We ended up paying approx √ä√£¬¢8 for a large bottle of water!The location of the hotel is great for shopping and sight seeing. You can easily walk to Orchard road for shopping and taxis aren't expensive.We would recommend a vist to Singapore zoo. The flyer is big! and Clark Quay was a good night out. Try the chilli crab. It's delicious. No trip to Singapore is complete without a Singapore sling in the long bar at Raffles.Overall Singapore is a safe and clean city and the Shangri La is a great place to stay.
