{"text":"Ok for business, not for pleasure Stayed at the AC for 3 nights for a business event. And that's what this hotel is good for: business events\/meetings. It is too far away from all the sights to use this hotel as your place to stay for a touristic visit of Barcelona.There is a metro station around the corner, and the hop-on-hop-off bus stops in front of the hotel, but I would not recommend this hotel for tourists.The hotel itself is a bit of a design hotel: all modern and trendy. The rooms are comfortable and the bathroom is very nice. It even had a bidet! Beds are good and the minibar is included n the room rate! There is a nice pool area on the 13th floor, although I didn't use the pool.Breakfast is ok, as is lunch. I didn't have diner in the hotel so I can't comment on that.The check-in went fast ans smooth, but I was surprised to find another suitcase in my new room. It turned out that the room was assigned to two people at the same time... Seems like they need an upgrade of their software. Anyway, it was taken care of in no time.The downside was the very poor wireless connection. I paid for 24 hours, but couldn't use the service most of the time because of poor reception. I think the capacity of the wireless network was not aadequate for the number of guests...All in all: good hotel fi you have to go to Barcelona for business, stay away if you are a tourist.
