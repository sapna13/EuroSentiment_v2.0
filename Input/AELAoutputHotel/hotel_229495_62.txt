{"text":"Great Hotel! My husband and I stayed at the Amsterdam Marriott one night pre-cruise and used Rewards Points for our stay.Arrival and check-in: We arrived in Amsterdam early and decided to take the train from Schipol Airport to Central Station, and then the #1 tram from CS to the hotel (or a square about 1 block away). The trip was relatively easy and stress-free even though we had to drag 4 pieces of luggage with us. Next time, I think I will use the airport shuttle for a few Euro more.When we got to the hotel around 10:30 am, the front desk was very nice and let us into the room immediately. We were using our points to pay for the night, but they offered us a chance to upgrade to the Executive Level for another 250 Euro, which was the rate had I just booked the room outright. We didn't think we'd eat and\/or drink enough to validate spending almost $300 more for a room! ;-) Once nice tough, by the way, was the bowl of mini stroopwafels on the front desk.Our room, on the 6th floor, was average size and spotless. The bed had a wonderful, fluffy matress cover into which you sink. There were also 6 pillows and a great comforter on the bed. When we finally decided to go to bed after a day of seeing Amsterdam, we slept very well in that comfortable bed!The hotel;s location is great! The Marriott is very close to almost anything. While we did buy a Canal Bus pass, we also walked a lot, seeing everything from the flower mart to the RLD on foot. One word of advice if you are walking around Amsterdam: Watch out for the bikes! There are 600,000 bikes in Amsterdam, and it seems like 90% of them are on the roads at any given time. Bicyclists do have the right-of-way, and they don't stop for pedestrians.The one negative comment I have is about the restaurant. . .It's over-priced, and the food was not that good. It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't worth the price.We would stay in this hotel again should we make it back to Amsterdam!
