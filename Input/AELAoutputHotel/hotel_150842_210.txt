{"text":"Bad experience We just came from our vacation this weekend, and I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° like to share with you our feedback for Iberostar Dominicana.The overall feelings tell me that we never ever are going to go to the same Resort again! I am not talking about very poor selection of drinks over there (only domestic drinks in a 5-star hotel!); I am not talking about lack of simple cups for coffee and spoons every breakfast√à√\u2020\u2022?I am talking about the service. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe never seen such a slow service before. In order to get a simple set for a bed for our kid we had to call 4 times to the reception √à√\u2020\u2022?finally it took 4 hours to get it! When the air conditioner broke and water started dripping on a floor we had to call 5 times to get it fixed! And they sent two men to fix it only after my threat to call Apple Vacation in NY right now!But the most embarrassing situation has occurred with the environment of our room# 3847. Actually, it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ even more interesting, that we were accommodated to the Iberostar Bavaro which supposed to be an up-scale place. The minute after we√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° entered the room we discovered hundreds of our future neighbors √à√\u2020\u2022?tiny ants!!! They were everywhere, even in a bed√à√\u2020\u2022?From day 1 till day 5 we asked management to spray the room and help us to get rid of these unexpected neighbors. On day 5th we quit√à√\u2020\u2022?we were tired of calling√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>If you think that this was the end of our problems, you will be very surprised√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Last day of our vacation√à√\u2020\u2022?We got up early in a morning and started to pack our luggage. All of a sudden my wife screamed with horror!!! She found a huge cockroach on a floor. Size about 2 inches. We wanted to show it to the manager of the hotel Yves A. Colman, but we were told that he is on a meeting, and we had no choice but to leave peacefully the Dominican Republic couple of hours later. I just was smart enough to preserve this cockroach and couple of small ants in an empty plastic bottle from water, so now I have these Dominican friends in my fridge waiting for their final destiny.
