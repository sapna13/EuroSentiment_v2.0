{"text":"Bavaro Princess is Wonderful-Go Platinum! My husband and I went to Punta Cana for our honeymoon from May 22 - May 29. It was wonderful. Just to let you know our past vacations, we've been to Florida, Canada, Ocean City and Myrtle Beach. GO PLATINUM!My biggest recommendation if you stay at Bavaro Princess is that you get the upgraded package known as the Platinum Package. It is SO worth it. We were treated like royalty. We didn't have to wait in line every day for dinner reservations (which you must do if you are not Platinum and the line is LONG and you have to get up at like 7:00 a.m. to get in line). Also with the Platinum Package, you get access to the Platinum Lounge which supplies you with wonderful service for anything you need, free internet and emails (which is great to contact family and MUCH cheaper than phone calls) and access to breakfast, sandwiches and drinks all day. TAKE WHAT YOU NEED!Things are much more expensive in Punta Cana so I suggest you take everything you need (sunsceen, toothpaste). We bought a hanky and a bag of chips and it was $8.00.NICE ROOMS AND GREAT SERVICE!The rooms are nice. They are clean and decorated nice. We didn't really spend that much time in the room. With the Platinum Package, we were extremely close to the beach! If your not Platinum, you could be a 10 minute walk from the beach. We left are maid a $3.00 tip everyday and we had PLENTY of fresh flowers, drinks and towels everyday. $3.00 may seem like a lot but remember, these people have nothing and everything is inclusive so it didn't kill us to leave her a few bucks a day. GOOD FOOD!My biggest concern when going to another country was the food. I was so afraid that we were going to get sick. I stayed away from most meats and didn't eat anything that I wasn't sure what it was. Most of the time we ate at the buffett in the huge hut by the beach and the one in the main lobby (you have to try the Pasta Station there, it's wonderful). They had french fries, pizza (not American pizza, but it was still good), hot dogs, salads (which I stayed away from) and many delicious deserts. As for the restaurants, we liked the Italian restaurant, the sea food restaurant and Goucho. If you go Platinum, you get a complimentary dinner at Licey. We checked out the menu before making reservations and decided to pass. The food was not our style (the had ox on the menu). Basically with the food, be smart about your choices, don't over eat (because it's so hot there) and drink alot of water.DRINKS!I'm not much of drinker. It is so hot down there all I wanted to drink water (make sure its BOTTLED WATER!) Don't even brush your teeth without bottled water. If you try a drink, you have to try a Coco Loco, ther're great. THINGS TO DO!WIth the Platinum Package, you get a free massage (which we didn't do) and a free water sport. We took a boat and went snorkling. I had a great time but my husband got sea sick and threw up. If you can't handle a small boat with big waves, I suggest you try something else. Another thing we did was called the Marinarium which was the highlight of our trip. It cost us $70.00 a piece and it was so worth it. You get on a bus and go to marina (you get to see the poverty of Punta Cana on the way. It's kinda sad) Then you get on a glass bottom boat and get to go snorkling with sting rays, fish and nurse sharks (which don't have teeth). Afterwards you get back on the boat have a sandwich and Coco Locos, cookies with music and dancing. The crew of the boat put on a great show. We had tons of fun and it was so worth $140.00!!!!!! RELAXATION!If you need to relax, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU! TOTAL RELAXATION!! We had an excellent time and would highly recommend Bavaro Princess and Punta Cana.
