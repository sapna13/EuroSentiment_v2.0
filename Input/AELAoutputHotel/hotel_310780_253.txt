{"text":"Loved Hotel Europa Staying at Hotel Europa was like staying with relatives. Gassim welcomed us with a cold bottle of water and showed us our room.The room was large and simply yet tastefully decorated with a double bed, sidetables, dressing table, and wardrobe. There was also a TV, electronic safe and the air conditioning was excellent. Prior to our stay, I had questions and also requested for help with reservations at the Accademia and Uffizi Museums, the hotel was always prompt with responses and also made our reservations with no problems at all.Our room also had our own private balcony (10 euros extra), with a view of the Duomo, the courtyard below, and of the neighourhood. This was really lovely as we could enjoy a glass of wine after an afternoon of sightseeing and museums.The hotel was quiet and service was excellent. Gassim was always more than happy to help with any request or questions we had and without asking, he also gave us a map and marked out major attractions when we arrived.Buffet breakfast in the dining room was lovely and included cereals, croissants, breads, jams and spreads, yoghurt, boiled eggs, juice, water and also a cappucino or latte if you fancy. Gassim once again was always there to welcome you and help with anything you needed.Upon check out, we were able to leave our luggage at the hotel with no problems at all as our train out of Florence was leaving later in the afternoon. When we returned, Gassim also eagerly showed us around the rest of the hotel including some beautiful suites perfect for families or for those wanting a lot more room. One even had a 300 year old fresco on the ceiling and some beautiful sculptures!It's true that the hotel is not the Ritz, and it's by all means not a new hotel, however it is family run and has been by the same family for 30 years and is extremely well-kept and maintained. You will never receive service as warm, friendly or as genuine as this in any of the 5 star hotels. Thank you Gassim for all your help and for making our stay in Florence and at Hotel Europa such a wonderful and enjoyable one. Ciao!
