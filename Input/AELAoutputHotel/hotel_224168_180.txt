{"text":"Hoped for best and got it! we chose this hotel for our all-important family holiday after spending many hours on this website. What a pay-back! after six days of touring LA and area, seeing and thinking about other locations, we were convinced we couldn't have done better. We toured everyday in the car, except for the one stop subway trip to Universal which was a bonus of staying here. It was always a pleasure to come back to the hotel. which was fresh and new and welcoming. So handy to walk just outside the door, restaurants, entertainment and all that Hollywood offered in a safe and clean setting around the Hollywood\/highland Centre. Since this was important to us, should mention the the centre itself is quite up-market as far as the shops are concerned. We ate on a budget at Johnny Rockets which was fun another night had an excellent treat at the Steak House which wasn't too bad at 120 dollars for three with wine. We saw two premieres being set up and a new star being placed on the walk of fame Can't imagine you'd get anything like this outside another hotel. Our room was huge and modern, had an unbelievable view. Bathroom well designed and spotless. Parking was easy at 10usd a day. We used the Club room(extra 30 dollars a day for 3of us) which, as has been said before, was convenient and just worth it. (especiially as we stocked up and small sodas to take out for the day trips!! Only used pool once and we were the only ones in it, but it was lovely. We consider ourselves lucky to have made this choice for a perfect base to tour LA ","annotations":[]}
