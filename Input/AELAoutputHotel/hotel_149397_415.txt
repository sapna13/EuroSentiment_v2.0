{"text":"Fantastic Resort, but stay away from time share !!! My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our week in Princess Bavarro. *Food was quite good, varied, and of course all drinks (including champagne, cocktails, etc) were served for free*Service was friendly, diligent, and rather efficient, *We were VERY much impressed by the performance of the entertainment team. Congratulations, guys !*The room was large, well decorated, with a nice little terrace opened on lush vegetation, *Beach was large, clean, white sanded, with turquoise waters. *Swimming pool was large and surrounded by vegetation*Crowd: mostly couples\/honeymooners\/families, all ages, not that many singles*The ambiance was romantic, peaceful, friendlyOverall, a fantastic place that I'd recommend strongly.BUT WHY ON EARTH DO THEY SPOIL THE WHOLE THING BY ASOCIATING WITH √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬©OYAL VACATIONS√à√\u2020\u2022?AND THEIR TIME SHARE SCAM?????While passing through the lobby, occasionally someone will invite you to go to some kind of a showroom where supposedly they will tell you how to come back to Princess Bavaro next time without passing through a tour operator√à√\u2020\u2022?(and hence saving your money). I've done the experience with my girlfriend, and what we saw was shocking.They will put you with a salesperson whose only objective is to have you sign a paper and get your cash. This person will endeavor to lie bluntly, deceive you, and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e your signature and your credit card number. He√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l invite you to drink liquor and promise you the world: unlimited vacations, the lowest prices, full flexibility to book in any resort in the world, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≤o hidden charges√à√\u2020\u2022? VIP treatment. Ask for it, you got it.The truth is that all this is BS.-they will forget to mention the tremendous booking constraints √à√\u2020\u2022?when you book online or with your travel agent, you are free to go anywhere, not anymore if you sign with Royal vacations -that their catalog includes less than 200 resorts √à√\u2020\u2022?on a worldwide basis, that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ little-the notion of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âredits√à√\u2020\u2022?(you get a certain number of credits per year, for example if you pay 10,000 euro you might get about 10,000 credit; and each resort in their catalog has to be paid with more or less credits depending on the standing and the season); -that a 10,000 euro √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√£nvestment√à√\u2020\u2022?doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even give you enough credit to book at a week per year at princess Bavaro during December√à√\u2020\u2022?of course, on top of the credits, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° have to pay 1200 Euro plus plane tickets, --for a couple to stay there); -that those reservations come with expensive plane tickets that you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l have to pay for √à√\u2020\u2022?check out the price of a plane ticket to punta cana-that you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l have to pay management charges, maintenance fees, processing fees, etc; Try to ask for the contract. You√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l have a hard time! They might even kick you out. I managed to see it after 2 hours of discussion, pretending that I was interested and ready to sign. Funny: one of the first things this contract mentions is that whatever they told you orally is not part of the deal! In case some people might give credit to the salesperson pitch√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>Also, they wont mention either the sophisticated way they set up their business with shell companies in tax paradises, and scam friendly jurisdictions (Dominican republic, spain, etc.), the army of lawyers that work for them to cover clients receivables (from those clients who don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want or cannot pay). Actually they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l tell you these lawyers work for you!!And of course, they will hide that once you sign (under Dominican law), you CANNOT go backwards, and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e set up for 30 years !Really, as a business person with some investment and law savvy, I was smiling at the scam and thinking √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢ow can one possibly fall into that?√à√\u2020\u2022?But then entered a young couple. They had signed the contract one week before. They had trusted the guy in front of them. He had promised the company would charge much later but the company in fact had liberally paid itself as soon as they had gotten the credit card number. The couple√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ account was negative; they were in deep financial trouble. The lady was crying and going to each of us in the room, urging us not to sign.They were not the only ones we met that fell in the trap. This is why I decided to write this post. Princess Bavaro is a great resort, but stay away from Royal Vacations. THEIR DEAL IS A ROTTEN DEAL !And to the management of the resort: Amigos, please clean your back yard, that wont give you good reputation.
