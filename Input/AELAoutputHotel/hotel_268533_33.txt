{"text":"Great Hotel in an excellent location We decided to book the Argonaut for our stay in SF after staying in the excellent Muse in NY another Kimpton Hotel. On arrival we upgraded our room ($20 per night v reasonable). We were richly rewarded with a large, spotless room on the third floor overlooking the Cannery. The two queen beds were extremely comfortable and the ensuite had a good shower. The room was quiet as the entertainment outside the Cannery finished at about 8pm. There were some really nice little touches in the room such as L'Occitane toiletries, Starbucks coffee, Ipod dock and free wifi. We ate breakfast at The Blue Mermaid restaurant on a couple of occasions and both times found the food good, reasonably priced and the service very good. The staff in the hotel were in general excellent; friendly, helpful and efficient. We found the location in Fisherman's Wharf an ideal location for tourists as many of the major attractions could be reached easily by walking or catching the cable car or F line streetcar.Some highlights for us were riding the cable car (go early as the queues can get long later on), the sea lions at Pier 39, the farmers market on Sat morning at the Ferry Building, shopping around Union Square and cycling over the Golden Gate Bridge. If you want to go to Alcatraz I would recommend that you book online prior to going. Alcatraz Cruises were very good and the boat goes from Pier 33 a short walk from the hotel. There a several restaurants a short walk from the Hotel and it is well worth a walk up Columbus to North Beach for excellent Italian food.
