{"text":"Great resort, but food ????? My friend and I stayed at this resort Sept 9 through 16, 2006, in the Club Golden section. We got a great deal through selloffvacations and also paid for Club Class with Air Transat. Both upgrades are well worth the money - the Gold villas are closest to the beach and main pool while Club Class on the plane meant decent leg room and food and priority baggage service (first off the plane). The Gold villas are also those furthest from the lobby and buffet restaurant, but we spent most of our time at the beach anyhow and only had to take the resort shuttle for dinner.Overall, we enjoyed our stay however I did suffer from food poisoning the last 2 days (my first experience ever), so I personally can't give the resort 5 stars. My friend didn't get all out poisoning but he did have to pop a few Immodium pills here and there (which by the way, I strongly recommend you bring from home) to settle his stomach.Pros:Lovely room and maid service - everyday we had different towel art with fresh flowers and balloons.We stayed in villa 2 on the Punta Cana side, close to beach  pool - suggest you get a room on the 2nd floor as we met several couples who had 1st floor rooms with major bug problems.Beach was great - long stretch of white sand. Staff are constantly cleaning up cups, seaweed, etc. Would be nicer if guests disposed of their cigarette butts properly instead of just leaving them on the beach though.Cons:Staff were friendly but english was limited - suggest you brush up on some basic spanish on the plane trip down.Food - although there were 6 a la carte restaurants (only 5 were open during our stay - the Mediterranean restaurant was closed), we found the food good at only 1 - Le Gourmet (the French restaurant). We also tried the Japanese (was ok), the Garden Grill Steakhouse (beef was tough and salad bar was extremely salty), and the Seafood restaurant (terrible!). The food at the beach snack bars (where most people ate lunch since you don't have to get dressed out of your beach wear) was the same everyday. I avoided all raw vegetables and peeled fruits for the first 3 days (stomach was fine then) but gave in on the 4th day. That's probably where I went wrong and got the food poisoning. I'm still not exactly sure what it was that did me in but I'd stick with the rule: hot food should be served hot and cold food served cold (not lukewarm or room temperature as was the case at the buffets!). Also, I found the house wines undrinkable (especially the red) but you can order other wines (average bottle $20 USD, better bottles $25-30), which we did at the a la carte restaurants.I doubt that I will be returning to this resort anytime in the near future, just based on the food poisoning experience (I've never been so sick in my life!). If I didn't get sick, I imagine I'd be recommending the resort to everyone for the price and service alone. Hopefully if food quality improves, I will have a change of heart.
