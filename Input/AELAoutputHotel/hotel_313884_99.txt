{"text":"Great Resort My husband and I spent our 10th anniversary at this resort. We booked the Platinum Package through Vacations To Go which I recommend. We go somewhere twice a year, always all inclusive Caribbean and Mexico, so we are familiar with what to expect. Other that one minor thing this was a great resort. I would rate this a solid 4, maybe 4 1\/2 out of 5.First the bad:When we got to the resort we were told it was our lucky day we were being upgraded to a Honeymoon Suite. When we booked I requested a regular room in Bldg. 5 by the beach. We were given a room in Bldg. 3. It is the building farthest from the beach and the room was on the top floor at the far end. I wasn't happy about the location but the view was AWFUL! We were overlooking the resort dump. Broken palapas, etc. The room was done in all white with a balcony and whirlpool bath. Being all white, it showed every scuff. It could have used a paint job. The next morning we switched to a room in Bldg 1. This was a regular room but was MUCH nicer. The front desk was nice about the switch.The good:Everything else. The grounds are very pretty. The pool is really nice, although a little cool for my taste. Wonderful pool beds and beach beds and palapas. Great beach. Lots of chairs.The food was about what you expect at an AI. The buffet was pretty good. The Italian restaurant had good food but the service was slower than most. The steak house was ok too. We really liked the fondue place. The seafood restaurant by the beach was very good. Excellent ceviche! We also booked a beach dinner on our anniversary. I was overwhelmed! I expected a table on the sand and maybe a tiki torch or something. We had a table in the pergola outside the seafood restaurant. The beach was lined with palm fronds, fig leaves,  flowers forming a pathway to the pergola. They took our arms and escorted us to our table while humming the wedding march. We were served 2 different wines plus a bottle of champagne. Had a 5 course meal with dessert. They really went out of their way to make our evening special. We were given printed menus to take with us, they took pictures for us, 3 waiters served us. All this for $50 US !!! Worth 3x that.The people in DR are fantastic. They are the friendliest, happiest, most helpful people we have encountered. They genuinely love tourists. Please understand that these people live off of their tips, not their salary. Even though tipping is included in the package we always take $100 -$150 in $1's and $5's. Let's face it. 1. The service is always better when you tip 2. They really need it and work their backsides off for it and 3. If you can afford the trip, you can afford the tips.For anyone contemplating DR or Punta Cana Princess, you won't go wrong with either.One tip: Watch out for the Mamajuana! It tastes pretty good, and a shot or two is fine. Just don't drink too much of it because it will give you the WORST heartburn you've ever had the next day. (Normally we never have it.)Also if you want to take it home make sure that it is in a bottle. Don't buy the stuff in the plastic bags - they confiscate it at the airport! We found out the hard way.
