{"text":"Don't Stay At This Hilton!!!!!!!!!!! I travel frequently for business. We toured Italy for our Honeymoon. The service at the front desk at this HIlton is the worst I have seen from Hilton. Most Hilton hotels I stayed at are very nice. When we confronted the front desk manager about our issues, she said the reason was that this hotel is not a 5 star hotel, it's just a 3-4 star hotel. Clearly there is NO desire to improve. We spent an hour trying to extend our stay with Hilton points. The front desk manager told us that though there were no rooms available on the system, she had a cancellation. She told us to book it through Hilton.com. We spent more than an hour on the phone only to find that we could not book the room. The front deck manager said she did not know the rules for booking while using Hilton poiints. So why did YOU TELL US TO DO IT! SHE HAD NO ANSEWR. I am also a GOLD member. She did not care one bit. The front desk manager should be FIRED! A job at the post office woudl suit her better. We left and went to the Hilton Garden Inn and though not as nice a hotel, the service was significantly better. If you are visiting Florence, I suggest staying at a hotel down town near the action. Both Hilton's require a taxi ride. The Venice Hilton was also outstanding. They were customer focused, accomodating, and always met us with a smile. Claudia in the exxcecutive lounge was outstanding as was Kaki at the front desk. The room was very nice. The location is beautiful. If you visit Venice, stay there!!!The Rome Hilton is also outstanding. The service is great. The views are spectacular, and the facility is top shelf. STAY AWAY FROM THE Hilton Florence Metropole.
