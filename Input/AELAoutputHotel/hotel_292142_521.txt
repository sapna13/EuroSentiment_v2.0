{"text":"Loved it. Fab rooms and very friendly staff My boyfriend and I were looking for somewhere central to stay but without the hassle of Times Square for New Year. We looked at so many hotels but got a good price direct on the affinia's own website. We had a corner room, so had two huge windows with great views from two sides. The rooms are a very good size, with the kitchen area a huge bonus for the early morning coffee and juice! The bathroom was clean and also a good size, the shower was powerful and the bath nice and deep for a relaxing soak.The staff were friendly and helpful and there was always someone on hand for general questions. Didnt try the Barking Dog restaurant for dinner, but went in for cocktails and coffee, both times the staff were really friendly and the atmosphere relaxed and easy. The food looked great and the prices were very reasonable.No faults at all with this hotel, would gladly recommend and will certainly return.If you are staying for a few days, get a 7 day Metrocard, its $24 (which is about √ä√£¬¢12.70 right now) and you can travel anytime on any of the subways. This is a great way to get about when your legs are just about to give in.For cheescake try Carnegie Deli, 854 Seventh Ave, at 55th St. The food here is lovely, but HUGE portions, so be careful what you order, although you can always take it out with you if you dont finish it!
