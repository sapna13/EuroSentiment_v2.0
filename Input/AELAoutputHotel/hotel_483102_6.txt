{"text":"Hotel is stealing my money I work for an airline and have traveled extensively. I've seen my share of hotels, some good and some bad. Generally, what sticks out in my mind when I am contemplating rebooking at a hotel is the type of service that the hotel provides.We arrived in Barcelona early on the morning of September 14th. We were on the last leg of a nine European trip. We originally scheduled to leave the hotel on the 17th, but we were hoping to leave one day early on the 16th as we were getting a little tired from our trip. We spoke with two people at the front desk. The second one assured us, that since they have a 24 hour cancel policy, it was OK that we canceled our room for the night of the 16th so we could leave a day early. We ended up leaving the hotel the morning of the 16th and returing to the U.S. Upon my return home, I realized that we were charged for all three nights. I have since contacted them several times and they are telling me that they can't (or won't) refund my money for the last night we canceled because neither of the people at the desk documented it. So, now they are just saying it is my word against theirs. At 145 Euro (roughly $210), this is no cheap mistake on their part. Yet, we are the only ones paying for it. Very disappointing!!!The hotel itself is pretty nice (great breakfast). Except, I do not recommend staying in the rooms that end with 10, as they are the small rooms that everybody is complaining about. It is just so frustrating that a nice European vacation had to end with some disappointment all because of the staff of a hotel!
