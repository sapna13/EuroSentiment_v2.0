{"text":"Beautiful grounds....not much activity We stayed at the Rio Mar from May 31st thru June 2nd. The property is immense and for as large as it is there is actually very little to do other than golfing and swimming. The casino was closed for renovations and during the week it seemed that the place closed down at 9:00pm. We went out on the grounds (poolside) after dinner to take a stroll with our infant and we felt very 'alone'. There usually wasn't a soul out near the pool after 7:00 pm. No nightly entertainment, which we are used to in most Caribbean resorts.Definitely rent a car. The hotel is out of the way and without a car you would be stuck eating at the expensive hotel restaurants. Breakfast for 2, around $50. Dinner at Palio for 2 (only 1 glass of wine each) $150. Instead, try Richie's, Antonojitos or Don Pepe. Also, if you drive south on Rte 3 there are many fast food and Sizzler type restaurants.Drink's at the hotel are almost prohibitive, so we asked for a fridge in our room and bought beer and wine and the local supermarket!Beach was ok, not too clean. Pool area was nice. Grounds were well maintained. The rooms were ok, beds and pillows were horrendous, service was ok and slow...staff was not too friendly. Had to complain to front desk more than once, not something I like to do while I'm on vacation.All in all this was an okay vacation with a high pricetag!Also, take note of your bill because we had erroneous bar charges on ours and had to have them investigated before we left.Would probably not go again! Too many other places where I can spend my vacation and get a better value!
