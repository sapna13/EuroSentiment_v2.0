{"text":"THere location is not without problems.... Reading the reviews of the hotel two thingsstood out - location and club lounge. I only rated it as 4 here because those two let it down. I stayed in a Club King - and it is an excellent room. The windows are on the corner but used cleverly to create a working space that's effective. The photo on the web site is exactly how it looks in the flesh. Comfortable and very well equipped, light wood tones. The check is in smooth and the entry to the hotel uses a clever use of glass and lights because for the ground floor resaturant and bar there is virtually no natural light. THe feeling is spacious, chic and very modern. However, whilst the club lounge hasa good range of drinks on tap, breakfast is limited somewhat. More to the point despite being on the higher floors it is darker than some nightclubs. Little natural light and dark wood on the walls makes it feel small. There are better club lounges than this in Asia, including the Plaza and Conrad's in Singapore if that's what you look for. As for location, it depends greatly on what you want. A couple can happily shop in the area and lots of eating places. However, the cross the road from the hotel and walk toward the THai Embassy and the atmosphere changes - Singapore's Orchard towers and strreetwalkers of all genders inhabit that part after dark. It lets the location down. Better here than the Hilton directly facing Orchard Towers though. Of course if that's what you seek it's a perfect location, otherwise leave the hotel and stick to that side of Scotts and you will be ok. Much as though I thought the room was good if choices occur in future I'll be in the City Hall\/Marina area rather than here.
