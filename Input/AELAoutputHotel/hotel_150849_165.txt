{"text":"Very European!! Last year we stayed at the Riu Jalisco so I am comparing the Bambu against it.First thing, first. This resort very much caters to the Europeans clientle. Since Riu head office is in Spain, I would imagine the resorts are very heavily promoted throughout Europe. The food especially is rather bland and cheese and cold cuts are offered at every meal. We found on numerous occasions we were treated like second class citizens by certain guests. Butting in line at the buffet, interupting conversations, and generally being rude constantly. By no means did this apply to all the European guests, but one group was by far the worst. I'm sure everyone reading this will know whom I referring to. English is not widely spoken at the pool or during the shows.Just for the North Americans reading this...be prepared for the topless sun bathers. It didn't bother me, but it does kind of take you by surprise the first time you see it. All ages,sizes and shapes believe me. The speedo is still very popular for men on the beach too (Yuck!!!!)The pool is kept very cool, almost to the point of being cold. I can't quite understand it, since the sunshines on it everyday.The beach is lovely but the water was very rough. I don't know if it is just the time of year, but we were rather disappointed.Went on a shopping trip, which was alright. Brought us to a mini-mall sort of shooping center not a market (there was one right down the street). Obviously the tour operator receives some sort of payment for taking tourist there.Stay Out Of The Casino!!!! What a rip-off, really old slot machines and games they warn you about on the bus!!!The resort itself is very nice, accommodations are nice but not even close to the Jalisco!! Small rooms.very plain.I guess it is obvious that I feel that the Puerto Vallarta Riu is a much nicer resort on pretty much all accounts except maybe the beach. To each his own I guess ","annotations":[{"endOffset":338,"mention":"cold cuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cold_cut"],"startOffset":329},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"cold cuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cold_cut"],"startOffset":329},{"endOffset":338,"mention":"cold cuts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cold_cut"],"startOffset":329}]}
