{"text":"recommended Stayed here early August after reading through the reviews. As a family in two rooms we found the hotel well placed with easy covered walkway access from the hotel to the Shinjuku station via the basement exit . Along this walkway there are a few shops and a convienence store wjhich was very useful for water, crisps, etc., Use the airport shuttle as is easy door to door at 3000 yen and for 100 yen more you can get one day metro passes which I recommend as it has easily understood ticket machines and convienent way around the city. The mainline JR line ticket machines are not easily understood and we required local help. Dont drive as most signs are not helpful and traffic is awful. Hotel rooms were clean and with a good view of the government building (free viewing platforms at the top floor), Breakfast was buffet with good choice and I recommend sign up for their EIC membership online for discount rooms and priority check in and use of the business room in the south tower (as a good place to plan your visit with free coffee and soft drinks). This hotel is closer to the station where there are stacks of shops than the Hilton. Check out the food halls in the shops - absolutely amazing. Only downside of the hotel is that being on this side of town adds 20 mins to the shuttle time to the airport at 90mins. Hotel swimmimg pool is shaded by the building at certain times of day so plan your visits.
