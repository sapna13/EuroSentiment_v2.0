{"text":"A Mixed Bag With a trade fair on in Florence at the time of our stay, accommodation was extremely scarce. The Machiavelli would not have been our first choice it is true to say, but on the whole was a fairly good choice. The reviews on this site are very mixed and that is because the Machiavelli is an old and somewhat weary converted convent and therefore has extremely varying rooms. Ours was fairly small with a window opening only onto an internal light well that seemed to be a receptor for all the daily Florentine heat. Therefore it became imperative to keep the window tightly closed at all times and covered with the heavy curtain to try and maintain some semblance of coolness. Unfortunately the airconditioner worked only intermittently so we relied on cold showers to keep us cool! On the plus side the bed was comfortable. The breakfast was very ordinary indeed and the coffee was almost undrinkable (very unusual for Italy). As reported elsewhere, the hotel is very close to the Termini which proved invaluable to us as we were travelling by train. On the other hand, returning to the hotel late in the evening had us walking down gloomy roads that felt unsafe. We thought it good to have internet access available downstairs if required. The front desk staff were generally cheerful and helpful. We were disappointed in the hotel's attitude when we had to leave a day early due to a train strike - having given them two days notice of our intention they would not refund even part of the money we had paid for the room for that unused night. Would I stay there again? Probably not.
