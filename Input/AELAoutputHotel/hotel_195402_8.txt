{"text":"Finding Firenze Accomodations in a Hurry I really feel uncomfortable to travel without a hotel reservation. I had reservations at another hotel but cancelled because I thought I would not make it to Italy after my passport was stolen in London. So in a mad scramble--my travel mate found it and I am usually the one that books the hotels after methodically searching for the optimum in a hotel. I was so concerned about his choice because he was not certain where it was-- after a quick search on my map it seemed fine. When we got to Florence we immediately walked to our hotel. It was a bit further out than I expected. I have learned many a lesson by looking at a map and saying wow that's close only to discover it is a little further out. If you have heavy luggage take a taxi. Taxi's from the Santa Maria Novella are reasonable and it makes your journey a little less sweaty and more enjoyable. At first I didn't think I would like how far the hotel was from the historic centre but I got used to it by walking along the River Arno which was a nice a calming stroll. If you need to take a taxi to your evenings event it is inexpensive and quick. The hotel itself was nice. I was so worried but I found the staff really nice and accommodating and helpful. The room we had high ceilings. The breakfast was simple and nothing fancy.
