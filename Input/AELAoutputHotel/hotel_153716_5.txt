{"text":"Great Airport Hotel-Clean! For an airport hotel the Hilton Mexico City Airport is great! The staff is wonderful and is able to help with any request. Rooms are a bit small, however I had a king bed, desk and chair in mine with room to move around. The bathrooms were CLEAN and NICE! The cleaning staff does a great job with fresh water every morning. The hotel is on the third floor so it is quite safe with Hilton security in the lobby. Great business center with two computers and wireless connection available throughout the hotel. (no wired ports in the room) If you are here for a week as I was I would recommend booking a room with the breakfast buffet! It is great and custom order. If you want anything else just take the elevator down to the main hall and you have a mini city with everything you could imagine to eat. Local to American! You have it here! Workout facility is clean and nice.The only downfall I found was with the smoke of the airport. I stayed in a non-smoking room however there are no real smoking laws in Mexico City. Although the room was smoke free smoke comes in from the main airport check-in and the lobby. I don't think there is much the Hilton can do about this. This is the first hotel I have stayed in that I did not want to rip the comforter off the bed when I arrived! It was spotless! Room comes with a small electronic safe in the closet that is great for the passport and cash, however if you have a laptop, don't plan on leaving it at the hotel. Flight Check-in counters are at the bottom of the escalator-Easy! If you have business at the airport or are transferring through I would highly recommend this hotel!
