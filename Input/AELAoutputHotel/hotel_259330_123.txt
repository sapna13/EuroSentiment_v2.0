{"text":"Not too good Got my room through Bookit. com. I was not impressed at all. The place was old, rundown and the staff were very strange and for the most part could care less. The linen trucks were run down and all over the place and almost running you down. The workers could not speak English and acted like they could care less. They wanted to fumigate my room while I was there. That really made be nervous. There was no remote for TV and my room was subpar and the bathroom was a joke. I barely had enough hot water to take a shower most days I was there and they were real stingy with the shampoo. Ran out of that too and had to beg for some. To make matters worse, the weather turned foul and the ocean turned into a mass of fury and I thought a tsunami was coming. After it was over, the beach was so torn up and the ocean was full of seaweed and there was dangerous coral all over in the water so you could get hurt real easy going in the water. That lasted 3 days or so. I just took a lot of excursions and one of those ended up bad also as diarrhea set in. The only think that was okay was the buffet. It was not great but palatable. I know for a fact that one couple left after two days as they hated the place and couldn't escape fast enough. One never knows what to expect on vacation and you have to just hope for the best. Have been to DR many times and this was the worst for me. ","annotations":[]}
