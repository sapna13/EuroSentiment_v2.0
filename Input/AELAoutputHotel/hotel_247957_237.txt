{"text":"Not worth the Headache (or the stomach ache) This was not my first trip to Punta Cana, and I have stayed at numerous all inclusive resorts before. Prior to my arrival I took the time to read several reviews on tripadvisor and I had an idea going in that I should not expect top line service. I am a pretty easy going person and entered this vacation with every intent to take any inconveniences in stride.... Unfortunately, my vacation was filled with too many inconveniences for me to maintain my optimistic attitude. When i left the hotel on my bus, bound for the airport, a funny feeling hit me. A feeling that was unfamiliar to me - out of all the vacations i have been on and all the resorts i have stayed at - this feeling was new... after a few minutes I realized what it was - I was actually happy to leave the resort and get back to NYC. Usually I do not look forward to leaving the beautiful waters and weather of the caribbean for the winter of the northeast, but this is exactly how i felt - Happy to leave. My complaints, in no particular order:- a la carte restaurants were awful- buffet, while better than the other restaurants, left my party and i with bathroom issues- speaking of the bathroom - my toilet broke 3x while there (others in my group had their toilet break)- my shower had no pressure and got luke warm at best (others in my party had shower issues as well, of different varieties)- bartenders, while working hard, definately served spanish speaking guests first- management was not helpful at all, in any circumstance (our rooms weren't ready when we arrived, we had false room charges, i asked REPEATEDLY if they would have any special showing\/setup for hte superbowl, and after repeatedly being told no - i find out that one of hte bars had a projector screen set up)- I am positive the staff was talking about me (not behind my back, in front of my face)- we hired a band to play music for my mothers birthday - the manager of the restaurant interrupted them in the middle of hte song to tell them to leave- the staff has a general lackadaisical attitude - they don't seem to mind if there is a line of ppl waiting to be served food or drink or whatnot, they will still take their sweet time- the weight room was completely outdated and small- the hoop at the basketball court was uneven, very uneven- i was very excited at the prospect of windsurfing, i waited for a nice windy day, and was not allowed to windsurf because their equipment was only for beginnersto be fair there are some nice things to say as well- the club mangu was quite fun and was packed every night - the beach and water were both beautiful- the rooms were spacious- the frozen lemonades were great- the layout of the entire hotel was spacious and we always were able to find ample space to congregate (we were a party of 16)- the late night pizza was actually worth the wait ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2406,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2402},{"endOffset":2406,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2402},{"endOffset":2406,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2402},{"endOffset":2406,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2402},{"endOffset":2406,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2402},{"endOffset":2406,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2402},{"endOffset":2406,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2402},{"endOffset":2406,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2402},{"endOffset":2526,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2522},{"endOffset":2526,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2522},{"endOffset":2526,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2522},{"endOffset":2526,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2522},{"endOffset":2526,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2522},{"endOffset":2558,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2554},{"endOffset":2854,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2849},{"endOffset":2854,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2849},{"endOffset":2854,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":2849}]}
