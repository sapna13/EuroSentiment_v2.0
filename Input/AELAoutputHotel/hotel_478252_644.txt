{"text":"The True,The Whole Truth And Nothing But The Truth! We stayed at this resort from 21 may-june 6th 2007 with my wife and 2 children,aged 10  6We flew from gatwick with my travel and upgraded our seats to 'premiergold' i must say that it was worth the extra money the staff were wonderful,plenty of food and the seats were great,would highly recommend it to get your holiday off to a great start.Got to the airport,wow so hot and what an expericence thatched roofs airport,so relaxing with the caribbean music playing and they take your photo, you can pick them up on your departure.At this stage,just remember to have $10 per person ready to pay at the airport,for your arrival and $20 per person on your departure(they say this is a poor country,well someone is getting rich).Got to the resort in approx 1hr,first impressions were beautiful and how clean the resort is.Checked in quickly and were taken to the room we were staying for the next 14 days.The room was next to the diamond pool,as requested via email a few weeks before holiday.They say when you contact them that they cannot guarantee anything,but our request was excepted by the diamond pool where it is quiet and near where the action is in the nights at the concert hall.The golden package is mainly available to the americans and the travel agents around america,or you can book it on line,could not upgrade via british travel agents,this includes a room closer to the beach, extra vists to the resturants and 24hr room service.The large pool at the top of the resort was busy in the afternoons,mainly with canadians,americans and spainish.We stayed at the pool a couple of times but liked the diamond pool,which is situated in the middle of the resort (quieter).The afternoon buffet you can get up by the large pool\/beach or you can travel to the main buffet,which is a 10\/15 minute walk or a short tram ride.The trams run 24\/7 and were great.The beach was beautiful and not that busy,we had no issues about getting seats at 8-9.00am,just dont expect good seats at 11\/12pm onwards.The resturants were good,our favourite was the italian and japanese,but to be honest they were all good and they gave great service.We only went on one excursion saona island,which was $88 for adults and $44 for children, the island was beautiful but long boat ride to get there approx 2.5 hrs and you only have approx 1.5\/2hrs on the island then you go back quicker in a speed boat,stopping off to see some starfish which was nice.My only issue with this trip is why can't you go on a speed boat there and back,then you can have more time at the island?From a british point of view compared to spain and the rest of europe this was better value for money holiday,the dollar goes further compared to the euro and the cost of the holiday for me with 2 children and a wife was just around the same price as half board going to spain.I think the only thing that puts of british people not going to places like this is the flight times,which i felt went quickly .I did have a bad stomach for a few days but that is the price you pay with all that good food and drinks.Been a parent of 2 girls aged 10 and 6 was concerned regarding depth of pools, but had no issues my kids swimming up to the pool bar and getting drinks themselves,which they did often.Finally the cappuccino in the italian resturant and in the main lobby were amazing,have one you will enjoy them.I am going back there in 3 years time,and that really says it all.I hope this review was helpful and that if you go there you will have a good holiday like we did.
