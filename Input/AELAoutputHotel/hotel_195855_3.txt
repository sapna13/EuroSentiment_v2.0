{"text":"The Only Place To Stay in Florence! The Savoy is located in the Piazza della Republica, the best location for Florence. Florence is small and easy to navigate so staying somewhere further a field would not have been so terrible, but I like to be in the center of the action especially in the evenings. The Savoy is ultra modern, beautifully decorated, very clean and the air conditioning was excellent. When you're travelling in July you want great AC. Our hotel room and balcony were overlooking the Piazza. There is a great outdoor cafe which is great for people watching. The hotel is close to the galleries, duomo and the best shopping. The concierage gave us pretty good recommendations for dinner and lunch. He told us about the best Tuscan steak restaurant in the city.... stay away from steak if you're used to tender great cuts of meat. Steak in Italy is gigantic and really tough. My husband took a bite and left the whole steak on his plate. It was that bad. We went to a great restaurant La Giostra. The food was great, the atmosphere very charming. You can eat outside or in. It's romantic and if you're travelling with kids they will seat you away from the diners who prefer a quiet evening meal. For lunches, stick with pizza and pasta from the little local places. The hotel bathroom is sleek and comes equipped with great ammenities. In the evenings after a great meal you can relax on your balcony with a drink while watching the scene in the piazza below. The Piazza della Republica has a big beautiful carousel for kids, street performers (comedy, opera,) and artists. The best entertainment is watching the fake purse and sunglass dealers packing up their wares as the local police arrive on the scene. If you're used to 5 star accommodation the Savoy will not disappoint. Staying at the Westin near the train station would have been a huge mistake as it is quite far from where you want to be.
