{"text":"Great hotel, great service I stayed at the San Francisco Omni twice during my 11 day trip to N. California. I have never stayed at an Omni, even though I travel 5-7 times a year. I loved this hotel, specifically because of its superb service. When traveling for pleasure I prefer BB because of the hospitality, local flavor, attention to service. I have to say that the folks at this Omni treated me and my wife as if we were at their home. We were always graciously greeted by the doorman, front desk, and concierge....they actually remembered us. It is such a surprise to get this level of attention in such a big city, in the heart of the financial district.The rooms were very, very clean. As I was there twice during my trip I was able to compare 2 different room types. Both times, the rooms were impeccably clean. All of the amenities you would expect for a business hotel are available. The hotel is located very close to the Ferry building and Chinatown. Being located in the financial district makes the hotel close to San Francisco's excellent restaurants including, Aqua and Perbacco. We ate at Perbacco and would recommend to anyone.We used the concierge services extensively and they were always courteous, quick, and thorough. It just wasn't the concierge that helped us. Everyone in the hotel goes out of their way to help. The lady that checked-us in, Crystal, was superb!!!They made a number of reservations for us and provided excellent recommendations.It's not close to the touristy areas near Fisherman's Wharf, but I wasn't looking to be in the heart of a tourist haven. If you are looking for a great hotel, with excellent service that makes you feel like you are at home this is the place to be. I will definitely be coming back to this hotel. ","annotations":[]}
