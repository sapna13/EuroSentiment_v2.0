{"text":"Great hotel, great staff Was spending 4 days in Seattle in August and based on trip advisor reviews we chose the Watertown which was a great choice. The staff at this hotel goes out of their way to assist you with everything. I was traveling out to Seattle by Amtrak and was arriving early in the day. They were able to arrange an early check-in which was really appreciated after spending 2 days on a train! I took advantage of several of their carts while there ...it was great to have a computer in your room...had problems with the printer working but I was able to print my return trip boarding pass at their computer at the front desk with no problems. The breakfast is great...not your typical dry breakfast buffet...they did have all the usual suspects...i.e. granola, bagels, etc...but they always had scrambled eggs and some type of breakfast meat every day. There is coffee and tea available all day long long with a short wine tasting in the late afternoon. They also have a free washer and dryer available for guest use. Another big plus. We chose a corner suite which was absolutely great...very roomy and comfortable. If I had to be picky and find something to fault them I would say their housekeeping could use a little help..there were stains on the couch and the comforter....I had to flag down a housecleaner to vacuum my room ...the same piece of string had been sitting on the floor for 2 days so I know they hadn't vacuumed . But overall my experience here was very good and I would definitely recommend it.
