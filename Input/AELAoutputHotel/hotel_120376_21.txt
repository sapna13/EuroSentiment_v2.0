{"text":"Ok, convenient, clean I stayed here for just over a week. The hotel is EXTREMELY convenient...right in the financial district  minutes from 95  beaches. We walked to Publix, Blockbuster, Walgreens. The parking was $16 per day, but very secure. We had assigned parking space. We needed access key for garage  all elevators. No random visitors.The worst--no concept of rush hour on Brickel Ave. There was LOTS of construction  only 2 lanes. Workers had no reservations about blocking lanes @ 5:30pm on Tuesday afternoon. Traffic would be backed up for blocks...learn the short cuts!The Fortune House has complimentary internet access in the lobby biz center only. I couldn't get a signal in our room. There were only 3 computers, but I just brought my laptop  worked just fine.It seems they were well into a major renovation during my stay. New paint  wallpaper was going up on my floor. Washer  dryer in our unit helped much. Needed cleaning. Left lint on some garments.The furniture  appliances seem a bit worn, but ok. 2 TV sets  stereo. However, the couch felt like sitting in a bucket. We never spent much time there anyway.Plenty of dishes  cookware in the kitchen. We mainly used to warm leftovers. We cooked breakfast a few mornings  the maid service cleaned for us. Nice to find all clean when we returned from the pool.The bathroom could use some upgrading. We used our own bath rugs, etc. ...none there.Walk in closets...very spacious. No patio furniture.There is a deli in lobby for hot breakfast sandwiches  snacks. sweet staff ...expensive, but very convenient.Staff eager to please  not bothersome. Would check here first before booking another hotel. Great stay.
