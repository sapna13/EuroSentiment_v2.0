{"text":"Paradise in Puerto Rico! My husband and I stayed at this beautiful resort 12\/24-12\/29 - our first visit to El Conquistador and Puerto Rico (but not our last!). The resort was busy and festive. Our room had a breathtaking view of the Caribbean. Our bed was so comfortable - we slept well each night - unusual for us when we travel. The highlights of our stay included lounging by the pool w\/live music, Palomino Island (plenty of shade, not crowded, no wait for ferry), the exceptional restaurants (Strip House, Blossom, Stingray) and the Bioluminescent Bay kayak tour (don't miss it!). We enjoyed the tour of the El Yunque rain forest - our guide was interesting and knowlegeable and had an infectious enthusiasm (check it out!). We spent time at the resort casino after dinner on two nights. We broused the shops at the resort and made a few purchases (great selections on resort wear, swim suits, sandals). The ice cream bar was always busy - with kids and adults! We worked out in the spa gym twice and enjoyed walking the beautiful and extensive grounds for additional exercise. A romantic, relaxing yet active vacation for us. We brought our tennis rackets but never made it on to the courts. So much to see and do - we simply ran out of time. Would like to return to the resort and spend time at the spa, explore Palomino Island, visit old San Juan and take a day trip to the Virgin Islands. A new Ballroom is under construction but did not disrupt or impact our stay. We found the resort staff hardworking and eager to please. We didn't hear (or overhear) a single negative comment from other guests during our stay. The guests we met\/encountered were enjoying the resort as we were. We highly recommend the El Conquistador and look forward to returning!!
