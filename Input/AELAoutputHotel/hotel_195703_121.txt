{"text":"Friendly, Clean and great location. We recently spent 3 nights here with another couple. We found the hotel in a tourist guide and called and made a reservation for one night thinking that if we didnt like it we could find another hotel when in Florence. Turns out we lucked out finding this place. It is kinda hard to find, sign outside is tiny and hotel is located on the second floor, however it is an easy walk from the train station and to all the sites. There are also several very good restraunts that are only a short easy walk to get to. The staff at the hotel are incredibley friendly and helpfull. They made reservations for us at the Accademia and the Uffizzi, otherwise we would have stood in line for hours! They also recommended the great restraunts we ate at and gave us very easy and accurate directions to get to whatever site we were going to. The rooms are spacious for European standards and our bathroom was huge! They are also spotless! And I never once heard noise from outside or in the hallways or the rooms next door. The breakfast is good, the homemade yogurt is great, and the ladies that run it are always checking to see if you need something. They even opened the breakfast early for us when we had an early departure for a day of sight seeing in Rome. Nice little wine store next door and a place few doors down that sells kabobs, which were sandwichs in a pita, that were out of this world!!! Overall a great place, great staff, great location and great price! We couldnt have done better!
