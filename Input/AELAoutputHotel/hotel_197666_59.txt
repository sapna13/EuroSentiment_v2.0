{"text":"Nice Hotel, Great Location! We enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Ares. The room was small, but nice. I loved the wood floors-it seems so much more clean than icky carpet. The bathroom was small, but the shower was actually pretty nice. Bring your own washcloth and soaps and shampoos though. We ended up using a hand towel as a substitute for a washcloth, and also ended up buying emergency soaps at the grocery store as the hotel's soaps were like cologne. Very pungent. The air conditioning in the room was wonderful (I wasn't expecting European ac to be very effective). One night the ac didn't work at all for about 6 hours, but then miraculously came back on. We had huge windows that opened onto a little patio so there was the option of leaving the doors open too for a little fresh air. The street noise was almost nonexistent except for garbage trucks and the occasional passerby. Towards the end of our six nights we finally noticed we had a view of the Eiffel tower. It wasn't very dramatic, but we could see from the upper observation deck to the top. Pretty cool! You aren't going to be any closer to the metro either-it's right around the corner. All in all, we really loved the hotel and the location. If you want a cheaper stay though, my sister was one metro stop away down by Rue Cler (which has lots of good food choices) at the Mugeut Hotel. The room was smaller and the bathroom miniscule, but it was clean, had a great breakfast sunroom and nice ambience all around. We ate at her hotel as we didn't feel the 15 Euros for a continental breakfast was worth it. Her hotel charged 9 Euros for breakfast and included all the continental fixings plus omelets made fresh. I don't think you'd be disappointed staying at either place. Great finds!
