{"text":"Paradise! We chose this hotel because you all here at Trip Advisor rated it #1,and it didn't disappoint. Although our flight from Tokyo was over 3 hours late and arrived at 2am, there was STILL someone from the hotelto meet us, which I found surprising and lovely. The lobby is gorgeous and indicative of the open, airy, beautifully landscaped grounds. The staff are friendly and happy and charming.We booked the most basic room at $115, which is significantly lower than what is listed, by calling the hotel directly (tho this price was also matched on the Intercontinental website). It is worth addingthe breakfast at $15 per person - we found that the late hours and lavish options meant we could sleep late, eat a large brunch at 10:30-11:00am, and be satisfied until dinner time.The basic room was perfect - a large comfy King size bed, a large bathroom, a beautiful balcony (big enough fo two of us to do yoga) and nicely decorated.The beach is gorgeous and well kept and mercifully devoid of hawkers and jet skis and other water sport noises. We didn't need to leave toexplore other beaches......Clientele seemed to be mostly European andJapanese, youngish couples, a few families with kids, not much of a Club Med singles scene, which we appreciated.The on site restaurants are pricey - Western prices, about $30-40 perhead, but there are cheaper warungs just down the beach for seaside. We also went into Kuta and Seminyak (15-20 minutes away) by cab for dinner, where you have many choices (we're vegetarian, so were eager for more than the one choice on the hotel restaurant menus)We would definitelyrecommend this hotel - especially if you can get the kind of deal we did....I saw the Conrad in Nusa Dua, and the Oberoi in Seminyak, and this is more beautiful, and better priced......
