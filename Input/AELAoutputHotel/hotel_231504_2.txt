{"text":"ideal for the football stadium We chose this hotel based on its proximity to the Nou Camp, as we were taking our son to a match for his 18th birthday - with that in mind I would say it was a good choice. It was just a short walk to the stadium and it definately saved the hassle of trying to journey back into the city centre on public transport after the match - the queues for the metro after the match were huge.Although it is not in the city centre, it is only a couple of minutes walk to Les Corts metro - and most of the main attractions and the city centre itself were therefore only a short trip away - we certainly didn't feel out on a limb. The hotel was also about a minute away from a large El Corte Ingles store and the upmarket shops on the Diaganol. There was a good choice of restaurants on the Diaganol - we had lunch in one and it was packed out with Spanish people - always a good sign.The rooms in the hotel were large and spotlessly clean - slightly outdated, and more 3 star than 4 star, but perfectly ok. The bed was also huge and comfortable and there was a sofa and coffee table in the 'living area'. There was a huge breakfast buffet, although this did not seem to be topped up during service, so it ran out of things later on. We found the reception staff to be helpful and friendly.I would recommend this hotel for the more budget conscious traveller or for any footbball goers!
