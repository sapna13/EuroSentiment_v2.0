{"text":"Great hotel, exceptional service My wife and I stayed at this hotel on 25 and 26 March 2007, and loved it. We relied on tripadvisor reviews and were not disappointed. We arrived late in the evening and check in was fast and friendly. We had a Club Harbour View room which was very comfortable and spacious, but were too busy in the two days to use the Club facilities, so in retrospect would probably have booked a standard Harbour View room.Breakfast next morning was very good - a very comprehensive buffet, fresh juice and eggs cooked as you waited. The facilities were very good, and in my opinion a touch above four star, but the service was truely exceptionally. Everything was done with a smile. When we visited the bar, we were greeted and shown a seat as if it were a restaurant. But the best was left for last. We checked out early but asked for our bags to stay as we were catching a late evening flight. The receptionist said but by then you will be hot and sweaty. When you return we will give you a room for a shower and change of clothes. I thought I may have misunderstood her intention and that we would get to use the gymnasium facilities, but sure enough we were given a single room (harbour view!), our bags were delivered and we were called when our airport bus arrived and hour or so later. I have never had an experience like this at a hotel. Well done Intercontinental Grand Stamford!
