{"text":"Wonderful, family-friendly, value-for-money, almost-central hotel Husband and I plus three-year-old daughter spent 6 days here in August 2006. This is low season in Germany as many Germans are on their own holidays, so we got an excellent rate (they call it their Sommer-Special) which besides the room included free cocktails in the hotel's Harry's Bar, a river cruise, and discounts on various Berlin attractions including the famous Zoo. On arrival we were very impressed with the stylish exterior and entrance. We were even more impressed with the room - a spacious corner room with ample room for extra bed and running-around for daughter! However I'm sure we only got this because of low season, from the floor plan we could see that other rooms are smaller. Breakfast in the Orangerie was always lovely, an extensive buffet, coffee served to table, hot chocolate for daughter. Viva restaurant was closed while we were there due to low season so can't comment on that. Their Eck-Kneipe is fantastic - delicious, authentic Berlin food, reasonable prices, really gem√Å√∫√¢tlich atmosphere. We are there on our first and last nights. Enormous portions, even for children. If you're not a walker, location might not be ideal - it's a 20-minute walk from the Brandenburg Gate. But this is a lovely walk through the Tiergarten patk and diplomatic district. If you want to explore the former East side, this is an even longer walk. The nearest U-Bahn (underground) station is Nollendorfplatz, about 5 mins' walk away and the network is excellent, though from this location you'll almost always have to change trains at least once.The service in the hotel was always excellent. We requested a screen be put up between our bed and daughter's to help her sleep, and this was done quickly. Hotel has a pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and spa. The pool is very small, but was fine for us and daughter loved it.Another plus is that the hotel is just around the corner from Cafe EInstein, a lovely Viennese-style coffee house\/restaurant that is recommended in most guide-books. The reception staff were happy to make a restaurant reservation for us and suggest routes for trips we made. There's also an excellent babysitting service (through an agency) which we availed of once, we couldn't have been happier with the lady who came. It's expensive at EUR 11.00\/hour but worth it!Berlin itself is great and we found plenty to do for the little one. I'm not sure how ideal this hotel would be for larger families, so that might be one point to watch. Overall I would say, especially if you can get the summer special, this hotel is a definite winner.
