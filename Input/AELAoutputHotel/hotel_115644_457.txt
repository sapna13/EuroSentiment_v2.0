{"text":"Excellent example of an intimate small hotel! Having just returned from a seven night stay at The Chancellor I wanted to share my experience with everyone here at Tripadvisor. The Chancellor Hotel was a wonderful find! It exceeded or expectations. It sounds too good to be true...BUT IT'S NOT!!!!The Chancellor has an old world charm unlike the sterile chain hotels. It is charming with an intimate feeling, small enough to feel at home but right in the heart of The City, accessible to everything. The staff was friendly and welcoming, informative and efficient.There are so many touches that make the hotel special. First, and foremost, it is clean and well cared for with much attention to detail. Ammenities such as comfortable beds, a pillow menu,ceiling fans, a walk in-closet with with a safe, a portable heater, iron and ironing board and an umbrella, plus ample room for hanging clothes as well as storing luggage . The bathroom had a soaking tub complete with bath salts and fine toiletries(as well a a rubber ducky!).There were sweets and coffee in the room as well as delicious Italian Roast coffee,cookies and apples in the lobby, along with free newspapers and WIFI computer access. All make it exceptional in my opinion.I had the good fortune of communicating with Wes Tyler, the general manager, on the forum before our trip and he went out of his way to make our stay at The Chancellor VERY special.My biggest disappointment was that we were not able to meet him and thank him personally because he was away during our visit. Perhaps next time! And there WILL be a next time!We may have been spoiled by the suite of rooms we were given on the 15th floor but we found no problem with the size of our accomodations. Given that is an older hotel we expected something smaller. And there wasn't much more you could ask for...all the ammeneties you could ask for were there. And add to all of that LOCATION, LOCATION,LOCATION! Being right on Union Square on The Powell Street Cable Car Line! We had great weather and had the windows open all week and were able to enjoy the sounds of The City that make it so unique. Even the local street musician playing the saxaphone put us to sleep at night.There are so many things to say about San Francisco and The Chancellor in particular I could go on and on but I'll save some of that for other sections of the forum.I do want to mention,however, that if you are staying in The City you will not have to rent a car. Just get a MUNI Passport (1,3 or7 days). It offers you unlimited accessto all Muni transportation ( buses, streetcars,trollies, AND also INCLUDES the Cable Cars!!!! )(Although we are afraid the MUNI might go broke considering we rode EVERYTHING and went EVERYWHERE for our 7 day $24.00 Passport !!!)Kudos to The Chancellor, the staff and especially to Wes Tyler.
