{"text":"Very good, but ranked way below expectations. First things first, I would have probably written a completely different review had I not stayed at the Ritz-Carlton up the street from FS a year ago. Sure, the villas are amazing, beautiful resort, great service but considering the fact that you're paying a small fortune per night then there should be no compromises, and my only point of reference (oceanview villa at the Ritz a year ago at 600 usd\/night) left me thinking there is better value for money elsewhere.1 - Privacy is questionable, villas next to ours were very close, could easily see the pool next door, also there were paths right underneath our pool and could easily be seen by people taking a stroll.2 - Outdoor space is limited (stayed in oceanview villa #205), villas at the Ritz almost twice the size both indoors and outdoors, plus included a private bale (very cool)3- No sunset views from any villa... have to go down to the beach to get a full sunset view. 4 - Unobstructed views of the ocean are also questionable.. many trees in front of the villa. 5 - We had ants in our room, plus hair dryer didnt work.Our villa cost us about 800 usd per night vs 600 at the Ritz, service and villa architecture\/quality of materials pretty much the same so I am really having a hard time justifying that difference in price, in fact i am having a really hard time understanding why FS is not cheaper than the Ritz.. I think it may be the fact that FS has direct access to the beach, but anyone who's been to Jimbaran can probably agree that they've seen better beaches before.. My personal opinion is that unless you absolutely need to have direct access to the beach then the Ritz offers much better value for money.
