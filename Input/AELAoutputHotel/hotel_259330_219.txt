{"text":"Save your money Grand Paradise Bavaro is a rated a 4 star but I find it hard to give it 1 star as many of the latest victims who have been unlucky enough to have spent good money to go there.Amsha Resorts should be ashamed to call themselves resort suppliers as the only thing this place has going for it is the beautiful beach and nice warm weather. Neither of these things they have direct control over. The rooms are in much need of repairs for things like constant running toilets, broken shower heads, mold growing in the bathrooms, doors that don't close, curtains with no hooks, no towels, 3 days without hot water, 1 of the days with no water at all,sewer backups, broken hairdyers, broken light fixtures. All of this and more was seen in the 5 rooms our party of 10 people were unfortunate to have. One couple had to change rooms as the room didn't have pillows, bedspreads or curtains let alone towels or a shower curtain. Horrible!!! The pool was only vacuumed once in the week we were there. There was lots of sand on the bottom and things floating in the water to make it very unappealing.The food at the buffet was not the best, the al a carte were a bit better. They all seemed run out of food and what was left were empty trays of dried up food scraps that didn't get replaced. The front desk staff, the point of first contact was probably the worst of it. Unfriendly and unprofessional we weren't even greeted with a smile. The 2 people who took care of us didn't even say hi let alone acknowledge our presence. We were an inconvienience as they had to give us rooms and call the bell people to help with our luggage. We had 3 seniors with us who needed extra help with baggage. They had even lied to us when we asked them for something and then spoke to each other in Spanish making gestures towards us. Total lack of respect.As far as the rest of the staff from the restaurants, bars, gift shop, cleaning and pool staff, I could only say that about 10 of the staff were friendly at all. Most of them could have been better however I believe they lacked the training to do their job properly. One nice boy said he hated working there but needed the job. The rest of the staff never said Si they would only say NOSorry to be long winded here but we spent a lot of money booking this trip and got very little in return. Spend a few more dollars and book anywhere but here. Amsha will never see my money ever again.
