{"text":"I wouldn't stay here.... Well after being bumped from our hotel to this place, we were very disappointed. We spent a month researching where we wanted to stay and we definitely didn't want this one. But low and behold, we were here and not by choice. Our room was not made when we got there. The bed wasn't made. The shampoo, conditioner, and lotion were half full. The a\/c didn't work. The tv was maybe 13 with a broken remote. We mentioned these things to front desk, but they looked disinterested. Then every day, we would never have enough towels. Speaking of the towels, most of the beach towels were stained. Some even smelled as if they weren't washed. We hoped the food was decent. But it wasn't. I didn't know that you could screw up breakfast, but this place did. When trying to explain eggs over easy, they didn't understand. Thank goodness for cereal. The lunch was really awful. I don't think there was one thing I can say was actually good. Dinner, make a reservation at the Italian restaurant. But be prepared, what it says on the menu does not mean that is what you will get. So glad to be back in the states and just get a slice of pizza, which tasted better than anything they served. As for the service, if you like having ice thrown into your cleavage and then they talk about your boobs by a bartender. Or a cleaning woman banging on the bathroom door as your trying to go to the bathroom. Or being called a -------- by a shop (the ones by the front desk) owner cause I wouldn't go in. And the list goes on. Did I mention, no one seems to use the disco, casino, theater or piano bar. Don't stay here!!!!!!!!!
