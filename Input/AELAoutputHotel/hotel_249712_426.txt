{"text":"Best Times Square Hotel I've stayed in at least ten different hotels in the Times Square area, and the Westin clearly sets the gold standard. Since my wife was traveling with me for a 3 day weekender in the city, I wanted to stay at a nice property and the Westin didn't disappoint. We reserved a non-smoking king with a request for a view room. When we opened the door we experienced a panoramic view of the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood and the Hudson River extending from the George Washington Bridge to Madison Square Garden. The location is excellent, a block away from Times Square taxi horns, with a subway station in the same black.Our room was bigger than most NYC hotel rooms. It was smartly decorated and spotlessly clean. Like all Westins, it featured the aptly named heavenly bed.The second floor lobby bar is a great place to sip a martini and watch the parade of pedestrians flowing down 8th Avenue.If I had to complain about something, it would be the cable TV news blaring inside the elevators. This unwanted noise seemed totally out of place in an otherwise tranquil refuge from the bustling city. I'll also file my usual complaint against large hotel chains that rip you off for $20 or more a day for high-speed internet access. The budget hotels all offer this for free, so why is it justified for high-priced hotels to gouge you for this service?Nonetheless, this hotel is in my favorites file and I'll be back.
