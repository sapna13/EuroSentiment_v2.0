{"text":"Not so good anymore Sirenis Cocotal Beach Resort√ã√Ö? Punta CanaOctober 13th - 27th 2008We had a fantastic holiday at Sirenis Cocotal in 2006 but this time not so good.The hotel has dropped from a 5* to a questionable 4* now and it was evident in the apprearance of many public areas and service levels.Replacing the central water features with grass and flowers helped remove some mosquitos from the evening walk to the bars. The gardens are a magnificent example of what it was in 2006.Our pre-booked room was excellent and the cleaning service first class. Food was well√ã√Ö? presented, adequate and plentiful at all outlets, bars were good and the Italian and Japaneese theme restaurants were exceptional and worth a visit..All the table service staff were very pleasant and attentive, not so their supervisory staff who seemed somewhat remote from general guest contact and needs.Reception and cashier staff were fairly ordinary, understaffed and not too bothered about helping in any way that interrupted their chatter. TIP - Pay the deposit for safety boxes in dollars else you get 2000 Pesos (√ä√£¬¢40)back on your last day.Do not hesitate to contact IRIS the first class customer services manager who seems to be the only management member with any idea about customer satisfaction. This lovely lady 's staff organised a super small celebration for our wedding anniversary in the Italian theme restaurant.Beach and pool facilites were excellent and loungers plentiful, pool bar staff are the best on site. Pool towel room ran out of returned towel cards on last day so towels had to be taken to the reception check out. Check hotel charges very carefully especially the spa\/beauty treatments if you have discount options on any facilities that you use though the VIP Club membership.In addition to some sewage smells around the conference centre the main complaint is that local Dominicans descend on Friday afternoons until Sunday evenings and take over most of the hotel facilities, bars, pool and restaurant queues, thats the time to take an excursion.Due to the My Travel takeover last yeat we had to travel with Thomas Cook Airlines - late departure as normal, lack of any company communications, poor in flight service and local Representatives were of rather poor quality - come back Airtours.One exciting√ã√Ö? incident was the visiting fire eating cabaret act setting light to a palm roofed maintenance hut and seeing the staff putting the fire out with hand extinguishers, water in pots from the pool and a fire hose that was short and did not work.Recommend and return:- Not until 5*√ã√Ö? quality is re-instated.Likes: Garden setting, pool and beachDislikes: Poor service from reception \/cashier staff, locals taking over at weekends, felt like UK holiday camp with sun.
