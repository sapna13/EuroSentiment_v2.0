{"text":"Classy with large spacious rooms Stayed for 4 nights, July 2008 on a business trip. Was initially booked into a single room, however, upon check-in, the counter-staff very kindly upgraded me into a deluxe room. Counter-staff were polite and efficient and porters readily stored my luggage for a couple of hours as I arrived on an early flight. Hotel is centrally located on Kowloon side, right next to the Star Ferry terminal and directly above the monstrous Harbour City Shopping Centre. Harbour City has hundreds of shops and restaurants, very easy to get a meal. There's a Wellcome grocers in the mall if you need supplies. Only drawback is that the nearest MTR station, Tsim Tsa Tshui is about a 10min walk although riding the Star Ferry is probably more scenic and convenient. The deluxe room was on the 15th floor, and was brilliant. It was a corner room, hence very spacious unlike most HK hotels. Walk-in wardrobe provided. Bed consisted of two twins together, pillows were soft and comfy (pillow menu provided - cheers!) and sheets well-laundered. Toilet with attached bath was clean and did not smell. Rooms well-serviced, and a turn-down provided in the evening. Room seemed rather dim, possibly due to its large size! All rooms had fast broadband access, charges were high but noticed that there's a cheap internet cafe next to the McD's just round the back. Nice room furniture (2 sofas and armchairs), if not slightly old.Enjoyed my stay; liked the helpful staff and elegant room. Deserves it's 5 stars and will be back again.
