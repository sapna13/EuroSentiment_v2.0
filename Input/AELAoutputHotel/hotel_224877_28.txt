{"text":"Best Hotel in Miami We just returned from a fantasic weekend trip to the Mandarin Oriental-Miami. This was our best experience ever in a hotel. Service and attention to detail was the best we have ever experienced. From the time we droped our car with the valet on Brickel Key until we checked out, we were treated like VIPS. The room was wonderful. We were there celebrating our 15th Wedding Anniversary and they had roses in the shape of a heart on the bed. The view from our balcony was breathtaking. We saw the boats sail through Biscayne Bay. Everthing about this hotel is world class. It was such a unique experience, very different from the chains. The room included: bathrobes, a Bose radio, stocked bar, pillows with goose down feathers, clear glass shower etc. We ate dinner at both restaurants. Azul is the eclectic restaurant with food prepared by chefs. Cafe Sambel is the daily place with out of this world food. We were delighted in how our food was presented and prepared in unique ways. I had the Hot Stone massage at the Spa and it was the best massage I have ever had. We went swimming in the Infinity Pool and had drinks afterward on the deck. We also sun bathed at their private white sand beach under palm trees. We will remember this trip for a long time This place is expensive no doubt, however, for a SPECIAL experience this is a place to consider. I choose this hotel because it was ranked #1 in Miami, and I now know why. Think of this as an investment in your relationship.
