{"text":"Sleek Oasis in Crazy Town I love a good value, so when I saw a $199\/nite rate for the Westin over labor day weekend, I couldn't pass it up. My friends and I stayed 4 nights, and I didn't want to leave afterwards. I took the Airtrain and subway into Manhattan from JFK (it's the cheapest way into town and not that difficult at $7\/person), and after all the travel, the Westin was like a shining beacon of sleek comfort when i popped out of the subway at 43rd and 8th. What's not to love about the Westin? Location was super convenient to various subway lines, short walk to theatres, the madness of times square, less than a mile to Bloomingdales after passing Rockefeller Center...but I digress. The service and attitude of the staff was pretty good for New York City. I got the best tips for good local eats from the bell staff. If you have access to the executive club (platinum SPG) you can enjoy their complimentary breakfast each day. While not the grandest spread, it was decent. The lox was really good...but they ran out of bagels each day. I wished there was more hot food on offer (aside from the oatmeal). But can't really complain.The bed and shower was great.The only odd thing was the Apple PC they had in the room. I'm not a Mac person, and the wireless mouse was dead, so I couldn't figure out the keyboard shortcut controls for the thing when i was trying to use it. I ended up leaving it powered on because I didn't know how to shut it down....and putting a towel over the monitor to try to squelch the light in the night. Westin: maybe you can leave the guest some simple shortcut instructions in the event another user has the same Mac-illiterate experiences.Oh, and is there any way you can turn up the lighting in the hallway, so that when getting ready for a night out, I can get a better look at myself? Yes, I know, vain. But really I'd love to stay there again.
