{"text":"nice quiet stay Arrived late in Firenze, travelling with parents, into a whirlwind of traffic. Found Hotel Rivoli between train station (Piazza Statione) and main square (Piazza Republica) is a nice 4 star hotel. Staff was fine - no problems, no extraordinary care or service. We had been travelling and doing a lot of walking and it was a great respite to just park the car and spend a few days. Breakfast was full of food, from american scrambled eggs\/sausage, croissants, proscuittos and cheeses, and cereals - more than enough. Internet access available for a very small fee. We had a very nice room, separate bedroom w\/double bed for the parents, the sitting room for me - sofa-bed. All comfy. Shopping in Firenze - most go to Mercado San Lorenzo - the biggest tourist shopping area near San Lor Church. I found better buys for most items near the train station - a more seedy area, but shopped here for the co-workers gamut of trinkets - key chains, magnets, t shirts - prices were much better. Get your tourist shopping here in Firenze - didn't find much more of variety elsewhere, even in Rome. Shopping area near straw market had a nice jewelery place w\/ good prices-saw same jewellery elsewhere for same or more. The loggia area right nearby ( open arched walking area in front of the post office) also had better prices on the nice paper items (Florentine stationary\/books). Got a nice size extra luggage bag here for $10 - again, cheaper than San Lorenzo. Be sure to shop around. Right in the same Loggia area (covered walking area) was a restaurant that looked very pricey due to style and location, outdoor seating etc, but had an incredibly big steak (something you dont find in Italy) for a great price, and great pasta for great prices.  Shops behind the San Lorenzo area are also good buys for pretty scarfs and women's bags, etc.with a beautiful variety, and very willing to give us a better deal than priced. Food market at San Lorenzo (the mercado) has a great lunch,cheap, sit together- usually for the market workers - but closes about 2 so get there early. In same mercado I found good prices on olive oils (great bottles), vinegars, and pestos in beautiful jars. Italy is in an economic slump due to the Euro, so the shops, including hotels, were willing to negotiate. Found some cool watches near vendors at the Duomo - african dudes quote high but once you walk off price dropped quickly.Restaurant across street from Rivoli was great - good local food with good prices. Found another great restaurant, Abruzzo style food at Piazza San Marco called Accademia. A bit more upscale, but lots of food served beautifully. (take a cab - it was a long walk back). Hope this all helps! Have a great time in this beautiful and crazy city!
