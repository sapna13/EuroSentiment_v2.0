{"text":"brilliant hotel we stayed here for my girlfriend's 30th birthday in september despite other hotels being rated more highly on trip-advisor at the time as we liked the look of the decor and the fact it had a rooftop pool and garden.we had a deluxe room which looked away from las ramblas and are located on the higher floors, making it quiet. it also had a terace which was great to relax on.the room was on the small side but the terrace gave you extra space. it was beautifully decorated and very stylish. the same can be said of the lobby and the rooftop bar and pool area, which was brilliant for relaxing in after the bustle of barcelona. the prices for food at the rooftop bar were not cheap as people have commented, but it was fairly quiet when we stayed and we were able to ask the barman to see if we could order food from the room service menu instead and have it brought up to the rooftop. he asked for us and it was no problem, so that made it much more reaonable. the pool was too cold for swimming in but the chance to lie in the sun more than made up for that. they also let us hang out there on the day we checked out as we didn't leave barcelona until the evening but we were able to keep using the facilites all day. the indoor pool was excellent as well.also the staff were helpful when we were trying to book restaurants and in general they were very polite. as noted previously they didn't carry our bags up to the room for us upon arrival, but personally i don't mind that. i certainly didn't have any problem with them as previous reviwers have commented.overall this is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed in and i would definitely stay there again. it is expensive but if you can afford it the extra cash for the deluxe room is worth the price.
