{"text":"Interesting Culture and Fabulous for Rest and Relaxation My husband, sister, brother in law, and I who are between 25-45 years old returned from Punta Cana on August 31st. We booked our all inclusive package in October 2007.Our room 11201 was ocean view, but we were only able to see palm trees and the pool. Having stayed on this end of the resort I would have preferred a room on the bottom floor where you could walk directly into the pool. My sister stayed in room 1206 which is at the opposite end of the resort and her ocean view room was amazing.The resort is primarily for those who want to read a book by the beach or pool or take naps. Many of the people who stayed at the resort either woke up really early or early afternoon. They are right about the towels and mats. By the time we ate breakfast we seldom were able to locate either.My husband and I love to travel and we enjoy taking in all of the sites and culture. We booked the party boat which involved snorkeling, swimming with the sharks, and stingrays, entertainment, and drinking. I am glad we purchased the excursion because the pool hey have built for the sharks and stingrays in the middle of the ocean is very impressive. The drive to the party boat is approximately 45 minutes. You can purchase a DVD of the excursion but it is overpriced at $35 and does not show the cruise in its entirety.We also booked the Santo Domingo (capital) excursion, which included a trip to the Hard Rock Cafe or TGI Fridays and Christopher Columbus's Memorial. It is an all day excursion from 7:20 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. The day before the excursion we ran into the VIP Tour representative and he told us that he would notify us if the excursion was cancelled due to not having enough people. Assuming everything was as planned we woke up at 5:30 a.m. and waited in the lobby for our tour bus that was to arrive at 7:20 a.m. After 1 hour of waiting we came to the sad conclusion that our excursion was cancelled without notification. We did get a full refund and did not let it effect the remainder of our trip.The drinks at the resort are wonderful. The bartenders are exceptional and good at remembering your face and drink. If I remember correctly our VIP Tour rep told us that they work 12 days straight. The work hard and long hours and deserve tips. The food is different. I enjoy experiencing different foods and I am happy for the experience. On our second to last day we found out that the Lobster House had nachos. We were in the pool bar and the nice bartender (can't remember her name) brought all four of us nachos. I though this was very kind of her. Oregano also has very good pizza. If we did not get full after our meal we would visit Orgeno. Most of the restaurants are open every night so there are a lot of options.The rooms are great. I couldn't have asked for anything better.The 70's\/80's rewind show was wonderful. Also, we enjoyed the piano bar when the man from Jamaica entertained. My husband and I were married in Jamaica in 2007 and we enjoy their music.The VIP Tour bus was scheduled to pick us up to go to the airport on August 31st at 7:20 a.m. Once again they did not show and were unable to reach them by telephone. We called a cab which cost $80.If you decide to purchase mamajuana do not take it home dry it must be in alcohol. We purchased 4 bottles and they were disposed of in the St. Louis Missouri airport. They do not tell you this at the resort or the DR airport where it is sold. Very heartbreaking. You can bring back alcohol (2 bottles per person) and cigars as long as they are not cuban.My husband and I also took professional pictures which look great. They are very inexpensive and worth the money.My advice to all of you who are considering visiting Excellence DR is to do it. The experience is wonderful. You will find many people who love it and many people who find it average. It is all in what you like and you will not know for yourself until you try it. Have an openmind. For those of you planning to book this trip enjoy yourself. It is a great experience.
