{"text":"Great for kids, but in need of some remodel I cannot imagine a better hotel to travel to with kids. The pool area, the private beach, the games to borrow, the activities, bouncy things, fish to feed, etc. etc. This place is just beautiful beyond words. That being said, there are different types of accomodations in this massive resort, and the rate you pay and your Hilton HHonors status do seem to dictate the type of accomodation you get. We stayed in Room 515 in December 2007 for our fourth stay at the property. 515 is in the older, main part of the hotel. There are at least 3 other sections -- the Towers, the Garden Suites, and the Lagoon Villas. We have stayed only in the Towers and the main building. The main building the last 2 times we've stayed, has been in need of some remodeling. The grout around the tile and tub was cracked and black, and the tub did not turn off all the way. The wooden bathroom door and trim were starting to deteriorate from the moisture. And the tile in the bathroom was a pale mauve circa 1958, I'd guess. But everything in the room worked. The bathroom ventilation is a bit odd because you can hear people talking through it as if they were in your bathroom, but you can hear it only when you are in the bathroom. The bottom of the tub in 515 was also starting to separate from the floor, which gave a feeling of standing on a waterbed when in the bathroom. So, the room wasn't great. But we didn't really care. The tower rooms are newer and in our experience are in better condition. A tip -- book online at the Hilton website and check into the bounceback rate. It includes a huge buffet breakfast, which normally costs over $20.00 per person. ","annotations":[]}
