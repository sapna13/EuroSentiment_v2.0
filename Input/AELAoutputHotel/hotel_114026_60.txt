{"text":"Good choice for Waikiki My family and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc for three nights in the beginning of January before heading off to Maui. We then returned to the hotel for one more night before heading back home. Overall the hotel is nice and a good deal. It was recently renovated and the hotel property did a very good job. It has a boutique feel - not as good as the W but the prices aren't like the W either...The location is great, it's only steps from the beach and from some great shopping. The rooms are nice with some cute modern finishes. We paid an extra $30 for an upgrade to an ocean view room and the view was fabulous! I would highly recommend an upgrade for that price.The staff was also very nice. The hotel has a laundry facility (which is a great perk), where guests can do their own laundry. Unfortunately the dryers broke after I put my clothing in the washer. With a little persuading the manager on site agreed to have my laundry sent out for free, which I thought was very nice. We also received a box of chocolates upon returning to the hotel for the last leg of our trip (a nice touch).I would not recommend having breakfast at the hotel. There are a lot of breakfast options in Waikiki and unfortunately Waikiki Parc doesn't really stand up. For a good breakfast right on the beach check out Duke's (less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel). If you're in the mood to splurge the Royal Hawaiian (pink hotel) has a great breakfast but it is pricey.If you're looking for a reasonably priced nice hotel steps away from the beach, I would recommend staying at the Waikiki Parc.
