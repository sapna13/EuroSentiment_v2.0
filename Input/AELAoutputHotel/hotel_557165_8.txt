{"text":"Good Location, Friendly Staff, Excellent Value Although not fancy, the accomodations were clean, comfortable and in an excellent location which was both attractive and convenient to shopping, restaurants and public transit. I found the staff to be helpful and friendly - they tolerated my poor attempts at German with good humor and fair English. We arrived quite late, well after midnight and found that the night clerk had been on the lookout for us as he walked out to meet us when I pulled up in front. The downstairs lobby is small but functional and the hallways are spartan, no extra money was spent on furnishing\/decorating - my boyfriend wanted to know if we were staying in a barracks. However, once in the room, we were comfortable with feather comfortors, platform beds, a squeaky clean bathroom and shower gel provided by the hotel which I liked so much, I have been seeking to buy it for myself. The buffet breakfast provided is very good - a full buffet with a variety of hot  cold food items - and an excellent value, especially if you consider the price of the room. If you exit the lobby to the street, turn left and proceed one block, you will find a convenient, well stocked little grocery store which should have just about anything you require at a reasonable price. Just before crossing over to the store, you will see a bistro\/restaurant on the left - I don't recall the name but the food smelled wonderful and everyone inside appeared to be having a good time. Unfortunately we did not get to eat there but I was told that it is quite good. If\/when I return to Berlin, I will stay here again. ","annotations":[]}
