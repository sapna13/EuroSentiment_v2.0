{"text":"Amazing hotel; felt high end! This hotel is just fantastic! Being Australian, it felt great to meet the owner who is also Australian. She was very helpful and gave great advice and restaurant suggestions. Her and her staff truly care about their guests and their breakfasts and happy hours were like social gatherings. We had trouble finding the place at first (turned down the wrong street), but I called the hotel and eventually found our way. The facade was being redone so it obscured the front of the building. Finally we saw the small sign for the hotel and went up the very reliable elevator to the 3rd floor. The reception was a great preview of what was to come. This hotel is very new and modern. It felt hip and cool even! They offered us coffee while we waited and then took us a floor up to our room at the back of the hotel. The viewwas okay but there was a lot of natural light and the room was just great. Everything felt new and was very, very modern. For the rate (off season), it was a great deal I think.The bed was good and the lounge bench to the side folds out to become a second bed. The bathroom was small, but perfectly fine. We liked theA\/C-heating unit which can be controlled with a remote. The TV was a flatscreen and also good. The breakfast was really good actually, but I think the coffee out at cafes is better. The lounge area is cozy and they have all the good travel guides you can read up on. The laptop with free internet is also a nice touch, as is the free WiFi all around.The location was great. Only 5-8 minute walk from the train station, 2 minutes to the Duomo and it's really centrally located. The shoppingis on your doorsteps and the sights are only 5-10 minutes away. I really can't think of any downsides to the place. I recommend this hotel wholeheartedly and it's nice for a quiet romantic getaway!
