{"text":"honeymoon the resort is exactly as you see it in the pictures, beautiful. food: the food was great, the restaurants are all set in an elegant atmosphere. the portion size is perfect, after you get through the appetizers, main course, and dessert you are stuffed. we especially liked the Mexican and Asian restaurants. the best place to eat lunch is either the World Cafe(buffet style) or the bar next to the pool. the great thing is is that if you do not like your food you can always order something different or go elsewhere for another meal. I do not recommend using the room service, it takes about an hr and the food is nothing special.rooms:the rooms are very nice, they are cleaned in the morning and the beds are turned down for you at night. we did not spend too much time in our room so getting an ocean view or poolside would have been a waste of money. there is a safe for all of your valuables and a fridge that is stocked daily with beer, water, and pop. beach: the beach is beautiful, it is combed every morning, there are plenty of chairs for everyone and shaded areas to lounge under. the ocean was a bit rough but we still spent time in it everyday. it was red flagged everyday so the only water sports we did was boogey-boarding. hostesses take drink orders on the beach. to the left of the resort are vendors selling jewelry,tee-shirts,etc. Make sure to not pay anymore than 1\/2 of the price. i would suggest buying from them, you will get a cheaper price than if you buy from the vendors on the resort.pools:the pools are great, there are two, one has a swim-up bar and the other is a cascading pool. there are lounge chairs and beds all around both pools along with several bars. the only downfall is that the pools close at 6:00. drinks: some of the drinks offered - cocoloco,miami vice,sammy sosa, bahamamama, cuba libre, and santo libre. the drinks are not very strong so if you want more alcohol just ask.excursions:we went on the safari, you don't really see any animals but you get to visit a home and go into the mountains. if you want to see how they live this is a good trip.entertainment:there is not a whole lot to do at night, there is a show every night at 10 and they have a dance club from 11-2, thats about it. there is a schedule of daily events posted by the front desk with listing of all the activities. this resort is great for relaxing, if you are looking for something else you might want to look elsewhere because you would be bored.
