{"text":"Zero ambience but it's an OK 2.5 star This hotel has zero ambience and needs a good sprucing up. The lobby looks nice, the staff is fairly pleasant and make an effort to add some kind of personality to the place, but the rooms are from about 1987 and need a good coat of paint and some new decor\/furniture. The carpeting (in my room) was old and worn.The bathroom looks like something out of a dorm and has awful flourescent light. But it is clean and has basic accomodations. The bed was good and hard (my pref.) and there was an extra pillow and blanket in a zippered plastic case in the closet. No fridge - ice bucket only. Vending machine downstairs. Laundry facilities on each floor w\/ice machines. The free continental breakfast was ok but it would be nice if they had more tables in case you'd like to stay. Free USA Today papers.The ac is adjustable and I could open my window about 1 inch. Cable TV w\/about 20 stations.The hotel\/former conf. ctr. is connected to a parking garage and on a side street behind Boston's tall Hancock tower. Kind of hard to find but not impossible. There is a Dunkin Donuts on the front street and a gym on the opposite corner. Very close to Copley Sq. and about 3 blocks to the train. It's around the corner from the hotel Jury's.I booked through Hotwire and paid $105 per night - very low price for 4th of July wknd in Boston. If you can handle a no frills experience and your looking for a central place to crash, this is a good bargain. But if you are looking for a pleasurable stay and fancy digs you can brag about, this is not the place for you.
