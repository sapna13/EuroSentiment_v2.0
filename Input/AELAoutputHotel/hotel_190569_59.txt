{"text":"Awesome location, nice rooms, spotty service We stayed at the Westin Palace for 5 nights that included New Year's Eve. The location could not be better in Madrid, a true walking city. Steps from the Prado, a brief walk to rail road station that gets you to any other point you desire and with in a few steps of other nice properties such as the Ritz. The hotel is certainly grand with lots of nice places to lounge. The glass domed restaurant and lobby lounge is beautiful. The service requires strong eye contact! The hotel is largly non- smoking with all but one floor being non-smoking, a definite plus in a country that still is very much a smoking place. Most restaurants allow smoking. Some have a non-smoking section, but really is meaningless when there is no physical barrier.They have a really nice roof top gym with a good assortment of fitness equipment. There is a hair salon and a Loews shop on site as well as an art store -- also there is a Starbucks that is ALWAYS packed! Hilarious!We had a couple of opportunities to eat in the hotel -- breakfast was included in the room and was held in the domed glass lobby lounge buffet style. Very, very good. The biggest surprise was how exceptional the Asian restaurant on site is. .. it is beautiful and the food is sensational as is the service. If you don't smoke.. get there early. The bar lounge is very active, but comfortable with service staff who are whizzing by. We also had New Year's Day brunch at the hotel -- it was really great. There were hundreds of tiny single dish apps that must have taken an army of chefs hours upon hours to create. Just magnificent. A great selection of local foods were also presented.The draw back of this hotel -- the concierge service is awful, unfortunately. They want to send you to the touristy spots only -- I tested this theory a couple of times and sadly, they really did not seem to care one iota about guest needs. They seemed not to have ANY clout in getting tickets or reservations --even when the request was made a month in advance of the visit. They were not knowlegeable about what was open when or take the time to check -- the answer was always it is possible -- oh well, yeah thanks!!!The preferred guest floors were full but we did get a very large room with seating area in a quiet section on a non-smoking floor. The only difference with the room we booked was free coffee near the elevator and the type of amenties (Molton Brown was offered on the preferred floors). There is no club level here although they say there is when you book!The reception desk was ok -- the guy who checked us in just seems miserable in general..all other staff including all waitstaff etc. were very helpful. It could be just this time of year, I suppose but this property is a Starwood Luxury collection property ... so five stars should mean something.The bathrooms were very large, robes need to be retired -- the bed is heavenly... as is promised by the Westin.Stay at the Westin for the location and forgive the one or two grumpy staff -- the rooms are clean, large and very comfortable. We might opt for the Ritz next time, but wouldn't cross off the Westin it was overall a pretty pleasant stay.
