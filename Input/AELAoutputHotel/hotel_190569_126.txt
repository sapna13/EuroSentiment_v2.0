{"text":"Westin Madrid. Worn but decent I just returned from a 4 night stay using my Starwood points for a room at this property in Madrid. I am a platinum Starwood member and try to use points at the nicer properties because they are so expensive and especially in the European locations. What I liked best about this property was the location which is excellent. The Prado was next door as was the modern museum of art on the other side of the square. There is a Starbucks located in the same block for decent coffee and a pastry. There is a Spanish version of Dennys called VIPS which you can get food cheaper than most restaurants but it is not very interesting just filling.What I did not like about the hotel is that they gouge you for everything. A small bottle of water was almost $7. The rollaway was $50 euros a night and a cup of coffee in the hotel was almost $5. Stay away from the overpriced and not very interesting breakfast buffet which is 22 euros. The concierge made lousy restaurant recommendations where the Tapas food was not only terrible in quality but high in price. We made a point of returning to let him know that it was a poor recommendation and he thanked us but the next day I returned for another reason and overheard him giving out the same recommendation to another customer. Typically this means they are getting some sort of kickback to steer you to certain places to eat. Avoid the concierge for anything but directions. The rooms walls were thin and we heard everyone√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ door open and close as well as the room above us. We were in a superior room which was spacious but a bit worn. Rather so-so. The rate for this room was over 500 euros a night and I would have fled after the first night but we were using points to stay there so I did not mind. It is a decent hotel to stay in if you can use points and absurdly overpriced for the prices they charge for the accommodations you get. Our queen size bed had seen a better day since the springs tended to squeak when we got out of the bed. We faced the square which was kind of cool but the constant street noise meant you kept your window closed.In the end it was fine because we were using points but this hotel is not worth what they are charging for a room.
