{"text":"Appropriatly Named...Excellente! This was our first trip to the Dominican and we had read a lot about the Excellence Resort. Most was positive and so we were very excited. We were not dissapointed at all. It was one of the most relaxing vacations spots. We did not upgrade to the Excellence Club and we don't feel like we missed anything. I don't say that just because we didn't. I say it because we were treated royally regardless. I can't imagine how we would have been treated any different if we did.The service is terrific. The staff are happy and seem to enjoy what they are doing. We tipped generously (US $$ not pesos) but never felt that it was expected but much appreciated.Our room was wonderful and we recommend opening the balconey doors which automatically turns the AC off and enjoy the warm breezes and the sound of the ocean and wind at night. It lulls you to sleep. Amazingly the bed is hard but we slept well and awoke comfortably in mornings. We have never seen such a spotless resort. It seemed that 24\/7 they were cleaning something. They even take the shades off the lamps and wash them and dry them in the sun!! Food was good and what you should expect for an all inclusive. Better then others I have stayed at. They do have a silly dress policy but when in DR!.. We were not there for the cuisine but we were fed well whenever we were hungry. Our favorite places were the outdoor restaurants the Lobster and Grill (had lunch at the Grill almost every day). The only inside restaurant we went to was the Asian and it was fabulous. We ate there twice and recommend the Mahi Mahi. Pedro was our favorite staff member. We stayed away from the others indoor restaurants because we like casual dining and wanted to be outside as much as possible. You can understand if you are from New England like us. The French and Spanish sites were inside and overlit, fancy stuffy I call them and not islandy. Night life was great. There is a wonderful outside bar on the beach and by the pool that we sat at every nite. You can enjoy most of the entertainment from this venue (or the bar at the theater it opens to the outside bar) . We tried our luck at the tiny, but fun, casino. The people watching in the casino was the most fun not the gambling. The nightclub is mostly the younger crowd but we got our share of the dance floor and had fun. The nightly shows were ok.Things you must do;Grab a float in the pool and puruse the gounds on a leisurely swim the length of the pool...stop at the swim up bar and relax. It is heaven. Order breakfast in your room. (We had ocean view so it was glorious!) You can get most of what is offered in the buffet but much more relaxing and romantic.At least one afternoon secure one of the lean-to beds on the beach. After swimming, a lite lunch and a few cocktails spend the end of the day with a nap and the warm breeze floating across your body and the wonderful peaceful ocean serenade.Do spend as much time on the beach and relax. Someone is always offering you a drink. Later in the afternoon they bring around pizza. Actually it is tasty and I am fussy about my pizza.Walk the beach, ride the waves, have fun! It is wonderful.We can't wait to go back.
