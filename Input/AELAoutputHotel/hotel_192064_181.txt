{"text":"The Chesterfield was just right! I stayed at the Chesterfield for 7 nights just last week. My double room was perfect for me - not gargantuan, but I didn't expect that. But superb bed, comfortable chair and table, pristine, elegant bathroom and storage galore! As hard as I tried, I couldn't fill up all the closets and drawers! :) Quiet is very important to me - nothing annoys me more than voices, TV, music through the walls - and I might have been alone on my floor (but was not!).Make sure you get a rate with breakfast included - it's a deal - was my main meal of the day and couldn't have been more delicious or the service more impeccable. I was greeted by name in the morning after the first day or so. You order anything cooked you want off the menu, as well as help yourself to beautiful buffet with anything you could want as far as fruit, cereal, juice, pastries, cheeses and meats, etc. The best Eggs Benedict I have ever had and I've had 'em everywhere!I had room service every evening after my long (great) days of sightseeing and it always (7 nights out of 7) arrived before they said it would, and was graciously served and just right.Had a martini each late afternoon in the fabulous bar - comfortable seating, great munchies and people watching supreme - you get the feeling that this is one of the most popular gathering spots in Mayfair for local business people - oozes class, but very warm.I could go on and on. Reception and door staff friendly, kind and helpful. You can't pass an employee in a hallway without a courteous hello.You simply cannot go wrong. Only place I'll ever stay.
