{"text":"Uber modern, great location We have just returned from a weekend at the Movenpick in Berlin and thought that the hotel was very stylish and trendy. We got a good deal on the room rate which made it excellent value and although breakfast wasn't included we felt it was well worth the extra cost - huge choice and kept us going until 6pm. If you fancy a change or a later breakfast Cafe Josty at the Sony Centre do a buffet brunch from 10 -2 upstairs with as much bubbly as you can drink for 14.50 euros.Unlike other reviewers we felt that our room (559) was rather small and this was mainly due to the fact that we were on the 5th floor and the room was in the eaves. The sloping ceilings really ate into the space in the room and made things difficult for my 6ft2in partner. However we had asked for a quiet room and it was certainly that. Like others we were surprised to find no tea\/coffee making facilities and I was shocked that there was no bath. I don't think that is acceptable for a 5 star hotel and my aching limbs missed it after a hard days sight seeing. We did have a fancy walk in shower in a wet room, however, the floor did not slope towards the drain and so our bathroom was an unpleasant swamp most of the time.The hotel design is very attractive if you like the industrial look, which we do and the dining room ceiling is a great feature. It has a lot of character and the staff were all very friendly and helpful. The reception staff particularly were excellent - check in and check out were very fast and efficient, and I have never received an iron and ironing board so quickly. They also allowed us to use their own internet access to check in on line for our flights. Twice they called us a taxi and it arrived in just a few minutes. There is also free juice and water available at reception.We ate in the hotel several times and found the food to be excellent, if rather limited in choice. The staff were again lovely, but at both breakfast and dinner they seemed understaffed and we were often kept waiting. At breakfast we had to ask for cutlery, napkins, cups, coffee and then no milk was brought so we just went and got our own from the buffet. It was very busy, but more staff were needed. The same applied in the bar where the lone barman was producing complicated cocktails, although another waitress did arrive after 20 minutes. Apart from the wait this was one of the best hotel bars I've been in - it was more like a trendy club.The hotel is well located near Potsdamer Platz with its bars, restaurants and shops. Tourists beware though that many of the shops shut early on Saturdays and don't open on Sundays - we couldn't even find a shop to buy crisps and water at 6pm Saturday. At Potsdamer Platz there are several open top bus tours available which cost 15 euros and cover all the sights. We spent most of Saturday riding around on the bus. If you fly into Schonefield Airport as we did, a taxi from the airport will cost about 27 euros, so including the tip it is about √ä√£¬¢20 - not too bad if you are sharing. Certainly an easy option late at night!To sum up we had a great stay and on the whole loved the hotel. If they got more waiting staff and sorted out a few design flaws it would be nigh on perfect!
