{"text":"Great location, just a bit too small Having stayed in Best Western hotels before, we thought this would be the best option in a city that none of our party of four had visited before.And while it was alright, it wasn't exactly the greatest hotel. The location was fab, right on the edge of the Amstel and in the centre of the city - with all the places of interest within walking distance.But the rooms were the pokiest we had ever seen and the bathrooms just a joke. Of the two rooms we booked one had a bathroom not much bigger than an airline wc. The toilet actually faced a wall, and took a great deal of manouvering, along with knocked ankles and squashed knees - very similar to going to the toilet in a cupboard.The carpet in one room was very dirty and stained, and our friends using the other room had to bang the door open with their shoulder when the door stuck. The keycards never seemed to open the door the first time round, and had to be continuously swiped for the green light to come on.Downstairs there seemed to be an awful lot of wasted room, with a beautiful wooden reception area just wasted, in favour of a stark lit, white and red desk at the back of the hallway.Reasonable priced and if you're planning to stay out a lot (which you do in such a great city) it's a great place to stop. If you're after something a bit more plush, look elsewhere. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1146,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":1141}]}
