{"text":"Clean  I stayed 3 nights here at the end of April while visiting extended family in Hong Kong. My uncle, a local travel agent, recommended this hotel as a reasonably priced hotel that was conveniently located.  We were satisfied with our choice, though not terribly impressed. The room was small, really barely fitting two twin beds, a desk, and a night table, leaving very little room to walk around, or to store our large suitcase. The cleaning staff was friendly, and attentive. (we had to call them right away to move the twin beds together to make the 'king size' bed we'd been promised on check-in - they came within 5 mins) The bathroom was clean, but did not have a hairdryer (you have to call the front desk for one). Our view was of the back of the next building - not very pretty.  Location is close to central, about a 10-12 minute walk to the MTR, and a 5 min walk to the trolleys. Times Square is a huge shopping center, with a large food court, which is only 5-10 minutes away (current street construction makes the way difficult to find though).  The most convenient part of the hotel is the airport shuttle you can book from the lobby. It's about $20 one way and drops you off directly at your terminal.  Overall, hotels in Hong Kong tend to be very expensive, and this hotel was reasonably priced, clean, and in a safe, convenient area, and that is all we needed. It was on par to a nicer Holiday Inn in the U.S. ","annotations":[]}
