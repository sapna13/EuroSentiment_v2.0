{"text":"Beautiful Resort I was at the resort from January 20th to 27th.The place is beautiful! The staff, the food, the drinks and the beach were all wonderful! The staff was always smiling and always said hello when they saw you. We even saw one guy hanging on a bench from the roof of one of the buidings painting, and he waved at us when we said hello. It was a crazy sight!The hostesses in Windows are right there to seat you breakfast lunch and dinner. They make sure you have what you need. The staff in Windows make sure you have a coffee or tea ASAP and also at night a lunch or drink, whether it be a beer or a pop and the glass doesn't stay empty for long at all. The beach did have quite a bit of seaweed that washed up this time, but the grounds keepers did the best the could to get it off the beach quickly. The beach huts went quickly so you had to be down at the beach early to get one. My only complaints about the resort was that the toilet in our room wasn't working towards the end of the week, the fridge didn't work but I enjoy room temp water so it wasn't a big deal, and the giant spider we had in our bathroom one morning. We called thr front desk and they sent someone up right away to dispose of the spider and to fix the toilet. Overall it was a great experience and I would go back!
