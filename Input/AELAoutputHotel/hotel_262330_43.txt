{"text":"Nice NY Option Walking into a hotel room and seeing earplugs offered by the management, with an apology letter is not usually a good start, but this is New York and any room near the street has some noise issues. The 24-hour cacaphony is part of NYC. Asking for the highest room available is wise if you have problems with noise.The rooms all seem to overlook Ground Zero, which is undergoing massive construction, but the contruction is presently at street level. Thus, a birds eye view of Ground Zero and a good view of the East River. The rooms are brand spanking new (newly renovated). They are large for NYC. The beds are wonderful. There is Internet access (I guess for a fee, since I use WAN). I found staff helpful and efficient.Various subway routes are within very easy walking distance. The terminus of the E train is here, but others pass through. Because this is Wall Street area, there is not a lot going on at night. Best options seem to be to walk east along the south side of Ground Zero and across the pedestrian overpass. Along the river, there are various options. The better bet in the evening is to take the subway north to Union Square, Times Square, etc., where there are more options. In the morning, you will see the Wall Street workers streaming from the subway like lemmings, all headed the same way.The gym appeared decent, with various machines. I did not eat in the building.Overall, this hotel is ideal for a businessperson who will be doing business in the Wall Street area. Though it is out of the way for most tourism, the subway makes everything proximal in NYC.This area is a bit far from airports. You could take the A train from Kennedy and be very close by. From LaGuardia, you would ideally take the E train, but you have to get to the train stop by taxi ($15) or bus. From Newark, you would need to go to Penn Station, then a subway south.
