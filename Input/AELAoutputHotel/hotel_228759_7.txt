{"text":"Love the Hotel Mayfair We've stayed here twice, both times in late June\/early July.Positives - The location is great - half a block off the Rue de Rivoli - very close to the Tuileries Gardens and Concorde Metro Stop, yet tucked away enough to not feel touristy. Also, many restaurants are in walking distance.The interior is nice - there is a lounge area which we never used, but might be nice in the cooler months. The breakfast room is very light and cheery. There is a circular staircase with an old elevator in the middle - feels very European to me - and a more modern elevator on the side as well. We would take the elevator up and elegantly descend via the staircase.The first trip our room faced the street, which was exciting when France won a playoff game in the World Cup and everyone went crazy. This trip, we had an inside view, which was a blank wall, but down below we could see the patio behind the breakfast room, plus the room was very quiet which made up for the lack of view. In both cases, we had large windows that opened in.The room was modestly sized but very elegant - decent mattress and lots of pillows, contrary to one review below. The bathroom was just redone, and was very nice for Europe. The room was always made up for us, even though our schedule was irregular.The staff were all very nice - always a Bon Jour or Bon Soir from everyone. The front desk always humored my questions in a mix of rusty French and English, and were always able to answer in English if needed.The breakfast staff was especially professional and nice, learning how we wanted our coffee, etc.Negatives - We seem to only be able to afford to stay here if we book the hotel as part of a package, which fortunately we've been able to do.The Wi-Fi was 10 euros per 24 hours. With this cost for a room, Wi-Fi should be included.Finally, two years ago we had to pay extra for the difference between the continental breakfast and full breakfast (cheeses and ham), while this year it was included. Don't know if this is for everyone or depended on our package.We hope to stay here again!
