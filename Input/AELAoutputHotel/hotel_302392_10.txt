{"text":"Classy Bali The Oberoi is simply lovely. There are criticisms about it not being modern or smart enough and indeed if your definition of 5 star is plastic wicker furniture and lounge music it may not be the venue for you. However there is a fine line between being old and scruffy and classy and elegant - the Oberoi is firmly and unequivocally in the latter category. It has been said it is understated and this is true. The entrance is unassuming and we were a little disappointed at how ordinary the lobby felt. We arrived before check in time but it was no problem to have lunch which was excellent freshly roasted chicken with salad and a glass or two of wine. We had booked a villa with sea view √à√\u2020\u2022?the expensive option - as we were on a special trip. Without any hints from us we were upgraded to the Hibiscus Suite which is the nicest room in the hotel. We booked our holiday through Diane Embree ( dianee@michaelstravel.com) - as recommended by other posters on TripAdvisor √à√\u2020\u2022?and we suspect the upgrade came as a result of the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨mbree Effect√à√\u2020\u2022?. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ really need or use the second bathroom or the kitchen but the main advantage was the aspect as the room √à√\u2020\u2022?while retaining privacy √à√\u2020\u2022?overlooked the lovely gardens and on to the ocean simply perfectly. The sala with dining table enjoyed this view and we basically lived there for our entire stay. Thank you Oberoi for this as it gave us so many lovely photos and amazing memories.Breakfast was a treat √à√\u2020\u2022?no nasty buffets but everything cooked to order with fantastic choice. There was also plenty of choice for lunch and dinner. Would say the main restaurant was fine but not spectacular however we weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ wowed by the food in any of the hotels we stayed in, in Bali, and it stood up to the competition. The secret is to stay simple.The staff were a delight, the gardens a dream, the gym adequate (while small I was there on my own the three times I visited) and the location the best on the beach.On a general note the beach is wide and has crashing waves √à√\u2020\u2022?great for surfing √à√\u2020\u2022?but it is not the Caribbean or Thailand and is a sporting beach rather than a romantic one. Personally when I left the Oberoi the only thing I was happy about is that my ears were empty again as the ocean really is loud √à√\u2020\u2022?this is true of all beachfront hotels on this beach. If you are staying longer term it may be helpful for you to know that it is an easy walk up the beach to Ku Da Te which has all the lounge music you could wish for and excellent food, The Legion which felt very cramped and resort hotel-like compared to the Oberoi but served the most splendid beef carpaccio and hamburger and the Samaya which has plastic wicker furniture till it comes out of your ears and a lovely ambience and great menu (did not eat there).The Oberoi felt like you were in Bali √à√\u2020\u2022?in the other places you could have been anywhere.
