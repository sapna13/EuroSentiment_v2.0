{"text":"Fantastic hotel in NYC! We will be back! The Library Hotel was everything I hoped for and more. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. Our flight got in earlier than expected and we went right to the hotel. Although our room was not ready they told us we could help ourselves to their fantastic free breakfast! One of the BEST reasons to stay at this hotel is the free breakfast and evening wine  cheese. You're already going to spend a ton in NYC so why pay more for breakfast! Fresh bagels, fruit, danish, yogurt, cereal, juice, coffee ... what more could you want! You're going to eat at some amazing restaurants in NYC so there is no need to fill up at breakfast anyway! Ok, enough about the breakfast! We went with their largest suite and it was well worth it. The bed and linens are amazing ... many afternoons I wanted to take a nap because it was so comfy! Our room was on the 7th floor overlooking Madison Avenue and I thought we might hear some street noise but it was very quite. In the evenings they offered wine, cheese, nuts and crackers. Yum! They have a great selection of books in your room and throughout the hotel too. The location was fantastic! A very short walk to Grand Central Station, Times Square, Fifth Avenue and the Empire State Building. We took cabs everywhere else we needed to go which is so convenient. Our cab ride to lower Manhattan was only $10.A few things I would recommend in NYC include the Top of the Rock tour, Empire State Building, a sail boat cruise with [--] and Curtains on Broadway. Some of the best restaurants we visited included Brio Restaurant [--], Osteria Doge [--] and Katz's Deli [--]. If you're from Chicago like us don't bother with pizza at Lombardi's. It's said to be NYC's best pizza but we really didn't care for it. The adventure and fun was walking to the place which took us through Washington Park, Soho, etc. We came home wanting some Uno's Pizza! Enjoy your trip to NYC! Again, stop driving yourself crazy searching for a great hotel and make your reservation at the Library Hotel!Sorry no hotel pictures. Who has time to take those anyway! It looks just like the website.
