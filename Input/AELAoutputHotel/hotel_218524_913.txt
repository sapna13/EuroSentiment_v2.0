{"text":"Excellente, Taki, Taki, Waki, Waki We celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary at Excellence Punta Cana, August 21-26, 2007 and found everything to be √à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u2022¬ÆXCELLENTE√à√\u2020\u2022? The food was very good (no stomach problems); the drinks even better and the staff the very best. Both the wedding anniversary √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√±reakfast-in-bed√à√\u2020\u2022?and √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Üpecial dinner√à√\u2020\u2022?were a very nice touch. Horseback riding on the beach was a highlight and Domingo, the sax player knows how to play. He is much better live than on his CD he offers for sale.As most of the previous posters have mentioned, the ride from the airport is an adventure to say the least. Certain portions of the roads are not riddled with potholes, they are riddled with craters! I have to give credit to the van and bus drivers who have to deal with the road conditions and crazy motorcycle and moped drivers everyday. The only three negatives were the following:1)The hit and miss maid service. Some days our room was cleaned in the morning, while other days our room was not cleaned until the evening. One night after 10:00 p.m. the maid knocked and wanted to turn down the bed. When our room was cleaned, however, it was spotless. This was the cleanest resort we have stayed in.2)The missing wash cloths and hand towels. Some days our wash cloths were not replaced; while on other days the hand towels were not replaced. Remedy: go to the rest room outside of Toscana and lift a few freshly cleaned wash cloths√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>3)Although the mosquitoes ate my wife alive the first night, she loved Excellence so much that she wants to go back as soon as possible√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√áring bug repellent. While all of the Excellence staff members worked very hard, here are some staff members who really impressed us:Concierge\/Host Department√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√¨¬£iordaliza GuzmanChez Isabel Waiter√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√¨¬∞duardo Activities Staff Member√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√¨¬±osemery Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ-Kafe Bar√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√¨\u201AÑ¢enny  Jose ","annotations":[{"endOffset":385,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":381}]}
