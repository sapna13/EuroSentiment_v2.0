{"text":"Very Basic Hotel (it has beds), Good Location We booked 2 family rooms (each with 4 beds) on Expedia for 2 nights. When we got to the hotel, they downgraded one of the rooms to 2 beds even though we had paid the supplement on Expedia. We wanted two large rooms as we were travelling with my parents and we wanted to have flexibility as to where the kids were going to sleep.The service at reception was minimal, and when we got out of the lift we were presented with a building site with thick dust in the air and cardboard on the floors. The one family room we did get was in a great place on the front of the building with two balconies overlooking the Ramblas. My parents got a tiny room at the back of the building.The pictures on Expedia are much grander than the real thing. This hotel is nothing more than a basic hotel and I don't know how it gets it 3 star rating. The breakfast room is not big enough when the hotel is busy and we found that we had to hang around to find a spare table. On both days we had to squat at a dirty one until someone came and cleared it. On the second day there was a shortage of staff (and food) and the manager seemed to be more worried about replacing the broken light bulbs (when the restaurant was bursting full) rather than feeding the guests.When I asked for the key to the minibar at reception, I got told I couldn't have it because of the Expedia rate I was on. I didn't understand the logic here as I've yet to come across a minibar that is all inclusive - so we went out and bought some water instead!The hotel is in a good location but that is about it. Would not stay at this place again. ","annotations":[]}
