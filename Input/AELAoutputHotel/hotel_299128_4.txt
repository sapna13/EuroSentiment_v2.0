{"text":"Perfect in every aspect We stayed at the beginning and at the end of our Bali\/Java trip. It was one of our best decision in our travel history. We have chosen this place among such a big offer on Bali based on the reviews here on TA. And everything positive we read was true and even better when experienced on our own. Its true that this hotel is huge, but you never feel it. We easily walk alone through the lagoons or found anytime free loungers in the gardens. Smiling service is also available around. And you believe that these people do enjoy the job. We loved the beach where you can walk while no one is disturbing you. The view is on open sea and you have airport in distance on one side and green hill on the other. Though we booked Club level all above is available to everyone. The Club itself is however a different story which I believe gave our stay additional dimension. Airport assistance at the beginning, private car transfer and lounge with relaxed checkin to start with. Club offering has been also described before and its really amazing. It is the best IC club lounge we have experienced till now! Rooms are newly renovated in modern balinese style and were the best for us, even staying at Four Seasons during our trip. We have got when staying on first leg a duplex suite over two floors and during our second stay hotel allocated to us Bukit suite with three rooms and huge bathroom with jacuzzi. Better end to our Bali trip I could hardly imagine. To summarize I strongly recommend this place at all levels of accommodation and it is just pitty that Bali and this resort specifically is so far for us from Europe and its probably impossible to find something of its kind closer.
