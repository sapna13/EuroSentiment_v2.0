{"text":"Nice staff, very noisy I recently spent 2 nights at this property after 2 nights at the Full-Service Marriott down the road.The Good: The rate for a 2 night midweek stay wasn't bad..103 per night which was substantially lower than other places around.*(The Marriott wanted 200 a night for mon and Tue after I spent 2 wekend nights tehre at a lwer rate....they wouldn't budge and the place was only 50% occupied).The staff is very nice at the FFI and for the most part the shuttle to SeaTac was quick. Only once did I wait LONG...30 minutes. Apparently one of the van drivers is a bit of a pest and he made the person from the adjacent HI Express come get me. He told her his pickup was cancelled but she had one. Whatever....long story short, she was mad at him, he seems to do this often and I complained to the manager.The hotel will also drive you to restaurants and shopping within a one-mile radius which is great. They drove me to Safeway. I walked a few blocks to a couple restaurants. Dave's Diner was decent. The portions could have been a little bigger but it is very well priced so I can't complain. Service was not so great.\/..the lady never came back to check on me til I was done. Also never got an Iced Tea refill. But if you want cheap eats...most things are less than 10 dollars and sandwiches are around 7 ucks, then this is a god spot.And, all rooms have a little fridge and microwave. Rooms are average size, but the bathrooms are TINY. The sink is outside the bathroom and the closet is a little alcove with no door or curtain.Beds are standard comfy Marriott beds....not as ig and fluffy as full service Marriotts, but the standard Marriott select-service variety.Also, the FFI has a LOT of cable channels if this is important to you. I like a large array of stuff to watch and this was good.Now the bad...the place is NOISY. Get a room on the 4th floor. Otherwise, it sounds like an audition for Dancing with the Stars. I swear, there are on walls or ceilings, just carpet and wallpaper suspended in med air. If someone's phone rings, or there is a knock on the door, you will think it is YOURS. I will most likey not return here because it is sooo noisy, unless I just need a place to lay my head for a night while flying into or out of SeaTac.
