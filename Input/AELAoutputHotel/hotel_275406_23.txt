{"text":"Pleasant Stay, but very Pricey My boyfriend and I, both in our mid-20's stayed in the Amsterdam Centre the first week in August. As a warning, there are many NH hotels in Amsterdam named similarly and we found ourselves at the incorrect hotel(NH City Centre) hotel at first. After seeing the unbelievably tiny rooms and feeling the heat from the broken A\/C we promptly requested a transfer to the Amsterdam Centre. The hotel was well kept, clean, and the staff had an overall friendly demeaner. While we found Amsterdam extremely expensive, this hotel was no exception. We ordered a coffee and a tea for breakfast one morning, recieved them 45 minutes later and were charged 8 euro(about 10 US dollars). Needless to say, we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel again. Also overpriced was the internet usage fee- 15 euro per day. We instead opted to use free internet cafes, which were plentiful around the city. We chose to pay a 25\/euro a night fee to be upgraded, and it was worth it for a larger room on the side of the hotel(away from the noise of the trams and street traffic). The bed was extremely comfortable and a variety of pillows were available upon request. The only complaint was an un-cooperative consierge, whom incorrectly informed us how to purchase a ticket for the Talis(the high-speed train to Paris). After first asking, he informed us it would be approximately 135 euro per person. He checked the prices, and said it was 250 per person. He then told us to buy internet usage to book the tickets ourselves. After we pleasantly asked him to book for us, he told us the tickets were sold out and we should go to the Central Station at once to try to get a ticket. An hour later, we arrived at Central Station to find an hour and a half wait to purchase tickets. We were very disgruntled. The next day, we inquired with another consierge. He promptly told us booking online was not possible, and he could arrange for a reservation so that we would not have to wait in the always long lines at the station. This trip for us was last minute, for we were not aware a 4 hour train ride would take us to Paris. If you have the chance, I would most definitely book this train for a wonderful trip.In general, we found Amsterdam food to consist of bread, cheese, french fries with mayo(at EVERY meal), and a fried-croquet type of dish. And of course, lots of beer. Be prepared to eat these odd dishes, or go hungry. We stopped at their grocery stores(Albert Heijn's), but could not decipher the labels on the food items. Travel around the city is primarily by bike or tram. Tram cards can be purchased at the Albert Heijn's for a lower price than on the tram itself. Be aware of the bikes, for they don't yield for anything!If you have any questions please contact me!
