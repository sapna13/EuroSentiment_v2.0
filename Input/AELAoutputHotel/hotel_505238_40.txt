{"text":"Lovely hotel Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel over the Easter weekend for 3 nights. Its a lovely modern hotel. The check in staff were polite and helpful when we checked in and we could go to our room right away at 12noon. The room was lovely and clean. I will list the bad points of the hotel first:- Kingsize bed was infact 2 single beds pushed together, very annoying as if you lay in the middle this split apart and you fell down the middle- No plug near a mirror, meaning if you had hair straitners or tongs etc you had no mirror to sit in front of (there was a hair dryer and shaving plug near the mirror though)- The shower was a nice shower but never powerful, it only went powerful if you had on scorching hot- The lifts were very slow, waited 10 minutes for a lift, and there are 3 of them!!- Breakfast was cold- Room service food wasnt niceGood points:- The selection of the breakfast was marvellous and even though it wasnt really hot, it was still good- Staff very polite- Very clean and modern- Free minibar, dressing gowns and slippers- The view from 26th floor is amazing, even if you dont stay on it, take the lift up for photos- Its right by a metro stop and next to a lovely shopping centre- Electric black out blinds, they were wonderful- Bar downstairs is very nice and relaxingThis hotel isnt in the centre of the city, but i would always stay here again as was 10 mins from the centre and in the centre its a lot of hustle and bustle and i liked that when we left the city we could escape that and relax.I loved Barcelona but thought the Spanish people were not very friendly to tourists, many did not speak English. One taxi driver chucked us out of his taxi because we did not speak Spanish even though we gave him the name of our hotel, the road name and the shopping centre name, he started shouting at us and the few words i know in Spanish i knew this to be shouting abuse at us. was very scary.
