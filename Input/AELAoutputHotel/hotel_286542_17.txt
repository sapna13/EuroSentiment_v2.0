{"text":"Roomy and Relaxing Spent a week here on a time share exchange the week before Xmas and enjoyed every minute of it. It was dark when we arrived, but the resort was colorfully decorated for the holidays. Check-in took less than a couple minutes and we were on our way to our 2-bedroom unit for some much needed rest.The suite seemed very new and was spotless. Each bedroom had a king bed, comfortable bedding, and lots of storage space. The main bedroom had a large soaking tub along with a separate large shower. The suite had three flat-screen TV's each with a DVD player. Lots of channels along with a few HBO and Encore channels. The kitchen is functional with full-size frig (there's a small one in the guest bedroom), microwave, full stove  oven, dishwasher, and washer\/dryer. They give you enough dishwasher soap, but you'll need your own laundry detergent.A nice touch was a water feature on one of the walls which added to the relaxing ambience. We were on the first floor so we were only steps from our car in the parking lot. The property itself is quite large. To the east (which is the direction our villa faced) is a golf course and the JW Marriott is probably less than one mile away. To the north is some more of the golf course and some desert landscape. To the west over a wall are some homes, but you hardly notice them. To the south, they've begun construction on the next phase of the resort so I would imagine the villas at that end will be somewhat noisy in 2008. The hotel provides a regular shuttle to the JW Marriott and Desert Ridge Marketplace. The small gift shop really has very little in it. There's also a nice pool area with two waterfalls, whirlpool, large scale chess set, outdoor barbecues, playground, grass volleyball court, pool table, and ping pong table. There is something scheduled at the resort every day for every age group so you can choose whatever you might be intrested in.Being so close to the Desert Ridge Marketplace was a big plus. We ate there, shopped groceries there, saw movies there, and did a little last minute holiday shopping. The resort is close to the freeways, but still feels like it's in a very quiet area which was nice. We all really enjoyed our stay and I'd strongly recommend this place.
