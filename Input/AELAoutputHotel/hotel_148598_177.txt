{"text":"Nice, but pricey. Much preferred our time in San Juan I arrived early with my wife for a conference the first week of December. We enjoyed the hotel -- lovely facility and grounds, nice comfortable rooms, sufficient work out facility. We're not big beach resort people and were glad we rented a car in San Juan (although driving in Puerto Rico traffic is not for the timid!). Food: Count me with the reviewers who say that pricing was brutal. $25 for the breakfast buffet (and good luck getting out for under $20 per person ordering off the menu)? $90 for unsatisfying dinner for two at the Japanese place? $130 for decent (but nothing special) Italian cuisine at Palio? Eesh! They make it hard not to spend money. The last morning we grabbed breakfast at the bakery\/hole-in-the-wall at the entrance road\/Route 3 and got a ton of food for under $10. Wish we'd seen it sooner . . . My wife would not have been comfortable journeying into the five-minute drive away part of Rio Grande, though, so I'm not sure what options are there. Bargain eating on site? The casual place at the golf club was good and resembled non-resort prices. The ice cream\/sweets kiosk was a good deal and tasty, but they closed it our last day to re-open it as something else.Nickel and dime: $14 bell hop fee that we learned of upon getting our bill at the end. Tip for housekeeping? Already included. Learned about THAT one at check out, too. $15\/day to self-park . . . Really enjoyed our rainy trip up to El Yunque. Also had a ton of fun in our two trips into Old San Juan. Next trip to San Juan? Will either splurge to stay at El Convento in Old San Juan or pck one of the hotels on the strip in San Juan and rent a car to day trip into the countryside.
