{"text":"A nice little stay! I just stayed at the Clarendon November 5th and 6th for a conference I had in Phoenix. We arrived and check-in was smooth and welcoming. We took the elevator to our room on the 4th floor. I did not realize it was the type of hotel you enter your room from the outside. All of the rooms face in to a center courtyard where the pool is. The room was cute and trendy. I was a little disappointed by the carpet which was office\/industrial like carpet. The bathroom was clean, the large plasma was nice and the bed was VERY comfy. We were helped the first night by the front desk staff in finding a place to have dinner. She made a great recommendation and printed out directiosn for us (Barrio Cafe on 16th is very good!) We also sat on the rooftop to have a drink both nights (although it was pretty cold). I must warn you, that you have to go up a flight of stairs to get up there as there is no elevator to get there. The view was nice and the seating and ambience was nice however the bar selection was quite limited and there were no heaters which I would have expected since it was so chilly and they really advertise the bar on the roof. We did not eat at the restaurant at the hotel. Our AC worked fine although it was a little loud and the shower was clean and the water was nice and hot for me. The wifi was spotty at best and it was disappointing because I had a lot of work to do. The staff was very friendly and we had a nice time. I don't know if I would stay there for a relaxing weekend trip but I would stay there if I had a business trip again. I would not suggest it for kids or families though.
