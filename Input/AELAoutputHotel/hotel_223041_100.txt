{"text":"Beautiful hotel I stayed at the Hotel Elan Modern for 2 nights. Check-in was fine, and the staff were very friendly towards me. They gave me any help that I needed and suggested places for me to go and see. The hotel is very handy if you want to go shopping in the big malls, as there is one, just about a block away, with Macy's etc in. Parking is valet, which as it was my first time, took a bit of getting used to, but it was very safe, and there is also a petrol station about 100m away. Breakfast is in the price and consists of a range of yoghurts, fruit, pastries, bagels, and went from 6:30am till they said 10:30, but I wasnt around to notice when it stopped. They lady on the desk rang for a taxi for me one of the nights, and discussed eating places too. I was told about there being a wine thing in the early evening for guests, but I wasnt around to see it. I expect this did happen, though, so would have been nice to have a sit after the days sightseeing and discuss where to eat that night.The room was big and light, with high ceilings, tv\/video, 2 phones, i had a patio onto a small courtyard, but the rooms higher up had balconies too. The rooms were nice and quiet, and were very clean. I put on my do not disturb sign when the cleaner was coming round, and she didnt come in, but later on in the day, she did another round, of the ones missed off, which means you can still sleep in, and have a change of towels! The interenet was free (in the business room) and there was a safe in each room too.
