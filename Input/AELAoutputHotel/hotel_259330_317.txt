{"text":"Grand Paradise Bavaro Was a Paradise..... I stayed at The Grand Paradise Bavaro from March 18th - 25th. We arrived at the hotel and I was in awe.....beautiful hotel, big, spacious  clean. The check in was quick. We ended up in building # 5 with a side view of the beach which was nice to see in the early morning. Yes, you do have to wake up early to get your little hut and beach chairs or else you are stuck in the hot, hot sun all day. The rooms were clean I did not see any bugs anywhere. The food was really good. Being a picky eater I actually did not starve. My hats off to the waiters and waitresses....they served you hand and foot at all times. The pool or should I say pools are nice and big. The beach, what can I say about the nice white sand, warm water  lots of HOT DOMINICAN MEN!!! WOW !!!! The shows at night were great. The animators go out of their way to do a great performance. They really know how to dance let me tell you.....WOW!!! The animators are really friendly and they try to get everyone involved with the games. A big hello the italian animators Matteo, Paco  Massimo.....they are hotties!!!! A big hello to Antonio (one of the animators) he's really funny...... All in all, my week vacation at the Grand Paradise Bavaro was unforgettable. I would go back in a heartbeat. Thanks to my travel agent who suggested this hotel. I have nothing but good things to say about this place.....Try it.....you'll like it!
