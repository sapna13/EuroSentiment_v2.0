{"text":"Not really a Marriott We stayed there for 2 nights. I have to say, the hotel is ok, it's clean and relatively nice but it does not meet the Marriot standards. The room was very small, we had some problems placing our bags somewhere. The bathroom was also very very small, a taller person could not take a shower standing properly. Breakfast wasn't that great, they should really offer more choice. We also took a Sunday brunch in the restaurant which was actually good and for a reasonable price. The staff at the reception was relatively friendly but did not speak enough English in my opinion, it was hard to communicate with them and they didn't really make you feel very welcome somehow. The location of the hotel was perfect, in the middle of Ginza, there were 2 subway stations in walking distance. We didn't eat dinner in the hotel, we always tried other places. We also had a small incident where the staff proved very unhelpful not to say rude; while walking around town we were stalked by some older man, which was VERY uncomfortable, especially on the first day in Japan. We talked to the staff about it, wanting to know whether this happens often etc. The guy at the reception kind of laughed at us saying that it was probably nothing etc...not really the kind of answer you're hoping for, no advice no nothing. Overall i'm pretty disappointed by this hotel even if those are minor things, they should rethink the strategy and adopt the real Marriott quality. ","annotations":[]}
