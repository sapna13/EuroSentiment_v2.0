{"text":"Can't wait to go back! I can't begin to describe how wonderful of a stay my family and I had over Presiden't Day week. From check-in to check-out, we were treated to the best possible service and the accomodations were beyond expectation. We booked the trip late 2006 and decided to go with the standard garden room. Upon arrival and after mention of the celebration of a birthday, we were instantly upgraded to an oceanfront lanai room! Imagine my surprise when after being in the room for less than 10 minutes, a special birthday cake was sent over especially for me. My 5 year old daughter adored the property. From the fun-filled Keiki Club to the DolphinQuest swim to the awesome pool and beach - she was definitely happy! My husband and I spent many leisure days by the beach and\/or pool. The environment was very relaxing and calm - a huge difference from our last stau at the Outrigger on the Beach. It felt very private and secluded. There was always an attendant to help us set-up our chairs and towels and the pool-side serice was quick and efficient. Employees referred to us by our names by the 3rd day. The concierge was wonderful. She assisted my husband in planning an unforgettable birthday celebration. Breakfast at Plumeria's was an awesome way to start each day. The buffet had a great selection and the service was friendly and prompt. Dinner at Hoku's was exceptional. The seafood tower is a must! Excellent presentation! I realy enjoyed the Veranda's Lounge in the evening - listening to the piano play - who had an amazing voice. The only disadvatage is that since you are away from Waikiki, it is tough to grab a few snacks and a cheap drink - as there are no ABC stores in the area. Otherwise, I would rate our vacation to the Kahala an A++ and are looking forward to our rip back in December.
