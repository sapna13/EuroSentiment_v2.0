{"text":"Great Hotel, Location, and Hosts!! My husband and I spent 8 nights at Hotel Maxim. We absolutely loved the hotel for several reasons. #1 Our Room. Everything in our √à√\u2020\u2022?st Floor√à√\u2020\u2022?room (the 2d floor in American vocabulary) was immaculate. All that we needed for a most comfortable stay was provided, along with daily maid service. The all tile, squeaky clean bathroom was complete with toilet, shower (with very hot, strong water), large sink, heated towel rack and hair dryer. There were two coat\/hat hooks next to a full length mirror as you enter the room. The room itself had a tile floor, a large bed, two side tables, and a large free standing closet for our clothes. There was a desk with a large mirror above it with a small fridge concealed within the left side. There was a large, tall window and the lighting throughout the room was very good. A television with 30 or so channels offered BBC and CNN channels which was great for catching up on the news. We asked for a quiet room and got one overlooking a small patio - it was very quiet. #2 Location. The location is absolutely central to all of Florence. It is a 5 - 10 minute walk in all directions to any of the sights. #3 Our Breakfast. The breakfast was a great start to each day, consisting of fresh fruit (we had yummy kiwis), canned fruit, croissants, hard rolls (even whole wheat ones), cheese, jellies, jams, honey, etc., three types of cereal (including a delicious granola which I fell in love with), coffee, warm milk, espresso, cocoa to make hot chocolate, and juice. #4 The Owners. The Maxim is a business run by the Maioli family (Paolo, the father, Sylvie, mother, Chiara, daughter and Nicola, son). Their friendly professionalism and assistance was what made this such a special place. They spoke near-perfect English and were always available to help with making reservations, calling a cab, or finding a particular restaurant or store. #5 The Extras. The hotel provides a computer room with two high speed computers which we found extremely convenient. Miscellaneous travel books, reading books, magazines, a small table, a bathroom with shower, and a television were also in this room. Another computer was also available in the third floor lobby. Next to the computer room was a small bar area, with alcohol beverages to purchase, and another television.  I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Florence. It is an excellent value in a magnificent city!!! Ask for a first floor room for the most modern accommodations.
