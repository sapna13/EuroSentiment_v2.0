{"text":"Great Experience Hotel de filosoof We stayed at Hotel de Filosoof in Amsterdam....what a great experience. (We had made a booking through an agency for a different hotel and through a mixup of the booking agent, our rooms not only weren't reserved (had been prepaid), but the hotel was full! Luckily, the staff got us rooms at the Hotel de Filosoof which turned out to be our good fortune!) Though there are rooms located in the hotel proper, our rooms were actually located across the narrow street from the hotel and were brand new....all new carpeting, new, modern tiled bathrooms, new mattresses which the staff said were from an ergonomics store...and they were so comfortable! Rooms, at the reasonable rate we paid, can be very small in Amsterdam, but our twin rooms had ample space. The street was very quiet, next to Vondel Park and within a few minutes' walk from the Museumplein; lots of restaurants and the trams on a cross street made the location perfect. The hotel has a nice sized lobby area with comfortable chairs and a bar...we enjoyed a drink and conversation after a busy day of sightseeing! The breakfast room is very nice....several areas in fact in which to have breakfast including a windowed porch. Breakfast was excellent with fruits, cereals, assortments of delicious breads and rolls, eggs, meats, cheeses, coffee, tea, etc. The breakfast staff was very courteous. Also, there is a very nice garden in the back of the hotel proper....various areas to sit with tables and wicker chairs, very quiet and quite lovely. There was a computer on which to check email....very convenient.The staff was truly exceptional - very friendly and kind, giving us tips on transportation, restaurants, etc. They recommended an excellent restaurant in the Jordaan area, Luwte on Leliegracht, a street that is around the corner from the Anne Frank House. We highly recommend this hotel for good value, great staff, comfortable rooms, great location.Kathy and Mike ","annotations":[{"endOffset":388,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":381},{"endOffset":388,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":381},{"endOffset":989,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":985},{"endOffset":1301,"mention":"breads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1295},{"endOffset":1341,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1335},{"endOffset":1346,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1343},{"endOffset":1419,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1415}]}
