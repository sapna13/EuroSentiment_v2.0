{"text":"Superior Service, Clean Quaint Rooms, Walk to Sites On a work -related trip to Italy, my mother and I spent a few days in Florence before and after a private bike tour with Per's Bike Rides of Florence. For one night before the bike tour, and for two nights following the bike trip, we made reservations at Hotel Giglio. This family owned and run hotel provided outstanding service. When we first arrived, we were too early to check-in...but that was okay, we were provided with a nice cold refreshment from the small hotel bar and the staff were happy to store our luggage while we headed out to shop in Florence! Upon our return to the hotel, they had graciously moved our luggage into the room. Our room was nicely decorated, had a TV, a very large bathroom and if one desired, air conditioning. A perk for the traveling professional was also access to a computer with free internet located near the front desk. All of the staff and owners were very helpful with providing maps, suggestions for activities in Florence and directions. The breakfast each morning was delicious...with choices of hot drinks, FRESH croissants and pastries...and FRESH fruit (not just canned)! The hotel is located about a 10 minute walk from the Duomo and other major attractions in Florence. But after eating so many great meals in Florence and indulging on gelatto each day, we actually appreciated the short walk back to the hotel. To get an overview of Florence and Fiesole, we also took one of the double decker, jump on -jump off bus tours of the towns....and tickets for this tour were sold to us right at the front desk. When we checked out to catch our train to Bologna, we asked for a taxi to be called ...but one of the brothers who owns the hotel graciously informed us that he would be driving us to the train station in his van! Thank you! With all of our Florence purchases we appreciated this extra help...and also the opportunity to chat with you and learn more about your family and business. On any return trip to Florence, I would have no hesitation in staying in this lovely small hotel again.
