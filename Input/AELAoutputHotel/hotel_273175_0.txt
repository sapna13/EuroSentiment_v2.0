{"text":"May as well have spit in my face at check in! If you like a cranky old man who appears to be ready for a fist fight when you check in....this place is for you!The lady who took our reservation was very nice, offering us a room for one night when there is usually a 3 night minimum.Apparently, Senor Big Cheese didn't agree and almost came across the reception desk at me when I asked about it. The room rate and actual room reserved (canal view) did not match what we were originally quoted, nor what we were given.He showed me an email with an agreed upon higher rate (didn't match confirmation) which I agreed to as long as I got the canal view room. He refused and was seething mad. And charged extra for the 5th person.A long climb up very narrow stairs resulted in a sufficient room with a loft and decorated in a nautical theme. Clean, spacious enough for four or five CLOSE family member and a decent bathroom made for an okay room; but not what we paid for.Later he wouldn't allow us to use the computer in the parlor area so we couldn't access the printer to show him the electronic version of the confirmation so we had to access the internet at a coffee shop. Not exactly the ideal solution when it's you and your 15 year-old son. Breakfast was standard Netherland fare and was acceptable, but the cranky old man syndrome doesn't work too well for repeat guests. It's a quaint setting over the canal...if only we could have seen it.Won't be returning here until the old man croaks and new customer service is established.
