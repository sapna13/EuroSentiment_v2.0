{"text":"Honeymoon Filled with Disappointment I don't even know where to begin....We booked this honeymoon at Barcelo Dominican Beach through a travel agent. The flights were fine everything went well then we arrived at the resort on a Tuesday, were we stood in line to check in for an hour and half once we got to the front of the line they spoke broken english and told us oh you are with apple vacation you need to go over to that line .And in that line was another 3 couples waiting in line. So it took us roughly 2 hours to check in. once we arrived at our complex we realized we were on the 4th floor and then we realized there was NO ELEVATOR!!!!! Once in the room we put our passports, portable dvd player, and money in the save, but the save door would not lock so I called down stairs were no one spoke english and told them our save wouldn't lock. I waited about 10 minutes then I walked down to the front desk and asked for them to come and fix the save they kept saying ten minutes and walking away. Several phone calls and walks down to the lobby later,in all my husband and I waited for 3 hours for someone to fix our save. Then we quickly realized that it was not just the staff that did not speak english, all of the other guests were not english speaking. Also we were not allowed into most of the restaurants because my husband did not pack pants! AND I AM SORRY IT'S 90 DEGREES and HUMID my husband did not pack pants! I mean the list of terrible things go on and on...Our toliet ran the entire time, the rooms were dirty, and I can't stress enough how much the staff not speakiing english really ruined our time. However imagine a vacation were you can only talk to one person because no one else in the whole resort spoke english!!!!! ","annotations":[]}
