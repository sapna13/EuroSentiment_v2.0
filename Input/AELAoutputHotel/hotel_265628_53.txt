{"text":"We had a Blast!! We went on a family vacation. There were nine of us, 2 family's worth. The children ranged from 6 years old to 18 years old and we also brought along our 66 year old Mother. We had so much fun. The rooms were nice and clean (but you really do not spend much time in them anyway) and the grounds are spotless! The food was incredible in the main dining halls. The only problem we had was the sit down meals, the ones you had to make reservations for. They were quite dissappointing, from under done meat to tasteless desserts. Which really didnt bother us all that much because we just went to the buffets afterwards and had our fill!!The pool absolutely ROCKS and the bartenders are super friendly. If you are a tipper, usually a buck or two makes them very grateful and they always remember your favorite drinks! Bring your sunscreen!! I had Neutrogena SPF 55 and I stayed nice and protected the entire time. The moment I ran out and went to another brand and lower SPF, I burned. The ocean is a little rough there so if you hate sand in your suit then dont go there, but I suggest you just deal with the sand because the ocean waves are so much fun!They have really good tours as well for a pretty good price. Everything is in US dollars so dont forget to get yours. All in all, a fantastic vacation spot that has made me a travel addict. Thanks to all the staff, especially Juan Carlos, my favorite bartender!! If you go, order a Sirenis Special for me! Trust me, you'll be glad you did! The best drink around. ","annotations":[]}
