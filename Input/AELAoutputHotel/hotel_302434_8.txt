{"text":"Too remote for Hong Kong I booked the hotel direct and as I was staying for more than 21 nights, I got a great deal, averaged 105 dollars\/night incl. breakfast, for a family of four. The hotel is relatively new and very modern. Beautiful minimalist architecture, very classy, none of the gold-gilded decor that is so common in Asia. The room was spacious and immaculate, flat-screen TV, rain shower, etc. The fitness room, small but adequate, nice overflowing pool. Speaking of pool, it sits next to the terrace of their continental restaurant, therefore you provide the show for nightly diners. The restaurants in the hotel are pricey and really nothing special. The breakfast buffet was ok but I have seen better for Hong Kong. Recommend going to the mall across the street to find cheaper and better eats, 10X cheaper!I really would not recommend this hotel to someone who is coming to Hong Kong for the first time and not well-versed in the local dialect, Cantonese is the first language here, not English! This hotel is far from everything that you would want to enjoy in HK, shopping, eating, night life. There is a bus depot right behind the hotel, with one express going to Central, but good luck with the others if you don't speak Cantonese, of course, cabs are never in short supply in HK but will eat into your shopping budget after awhile and there is not much around the hotel except for the movie theatre at the mall, even the mall seemed desert.  If the crowds, craziness and pollution of Hk is getting to you, then this would be place to sit and have a drink at the beautiful bar and take in the view with those dazzingly lights at bay!!
