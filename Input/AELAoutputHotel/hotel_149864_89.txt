{"text":"Nice property with some draw backs Overall not so bad....some glitches..... First off....what a beautiful sand bottom beach! Turquoise clear water and very well maintained grounds. Palm trees galore!!! A very large village. We stayed in a garden view room which had a patio. Nice. Very LONG walk from the main pool\/restaurant area to the room so if you have any disabilities request a closer room to the front lobby area. Beds were foam....surprisingly comfortable. Room was air conditioned but would only cool the room to approx. 74 degrees. The front desk was called and they stated that is the normal because groups from Europe complain it is too cold and groups from the US say its too hot. So they leave them running around 74. Well it was hot and very humid. The room was roomy but older. Also there are only stairs to get to the second and third floors of the various buildings so if you cant do stairs, request a ground level room. There were two restaurants which are both buffets. I don't have alot nice to say about the food. By the end of the week 3 out of the 4 of us had diarrhea. There was fresh fruit everyday, cereal, yogurt, breads (the white chocolate bread was to die for) but the rest of the meals were not so good. Lamb, duck, raw fish, salmon, pork dishes etc. Not very good. They had pasta everyday but the sauce looked like tomato soup. If you are looking for basic plain dishes....good luck because everything is too fancy and overdone. Many of the dishes were unrecognizable. The bar on the other hand used many top shelf liquors and were generous with the alcohol. Limited beer selection Bud, Bud light and Presidente (a local favorite). Bathrooms were very clean and staff was very helpful. Entertainment was good. Pool was too warm for my liking but the ocean was wonderful. Palapas for shade only available around the pool and none on the beach so if ya want shade I bought one of those portable beach umbrellas which worked great. They let me carry it back on the airplane too. Otherwise you find yourself chasing the shade from the palms as the sun moves. Bring alot sunscreen because it will cost you a pretty penny in the boutique. As far as shopping goes....skip the Bavaro shopping trip. The locals hound you to shine your flip flops and the products they have are manufactured in China. Not worth the trip.No local goodies. We took a taxi into the town of Higuey where the goods are cheaper but its a 55 dollar cab ride and an experience you will never forget. The poverty is brutally evident in the local cities and you need to sharpen up your Spanish if you plan to venture into the cities. They do not speak English hardly at all. The island is absolutely beautiful. The beach at club med made it worth the trip. Snorkeling off the beach was great...starfish, puffer fish, shells galore, and manta rays! Getting through the airport at Punta Cana was no big deal...very modern facility and clean and organized and only 5 minutes to club med. Overall a good vacation minus a few problems. I would return to the Dominican but probably try a different resort because of the food. Good luck!!!
