{"text":"A 'warm' welcone for the whole family We stayed at the H10 Marina during the October school holidays a short city break. Prior to departure I decided to check a few review, and a came across a review that implied the hotel was not family friendly, but I found the opposite to be true.I travelled with my two children on my own and was anxious about our visit, having read the review. From the moment of our arrival until our departure to the airport we received the very best service from all the staff; the staff were very child friendly and made us feel at ease. We stayed for four days and we made requests for warm milk and hot coco, both requests were swiftly met and in the evenings the staff were apologetic at having to apply the room service charge for such an inexpensive item.At the reception desk and in the internet\/office support facilities I found the staff always helpful, knowledgeable and attentive.The Hotel is located close to the Marina, zoo, beach, shops and places of interest. We found most were within a 'child's' walking distance, which was great. The location is slightly quiet; so if you need to be in the throng of Barcelona then perhaps this is not the hotel for you. With it's spa in the basement the hotel gives you the best of a city break and a weekend retreat combined.It is my intention to return in April, hence the posting of this review. Our family had a good experience and I am looking forward to our visit minus the children. It is as important to share both good and bad experiences. Ultimately you will make up your own mind, I did.
