{"text":"My best friend and I loved it I stayed at La Playa with my best friend for six nights. I had heard about the hotel from a friend of mine who went to PR but did not stay there. Anyways, we gave it a shot relying only on advice and the information on tripadvisor. Its location is fantastic,right on the water. We spent most of the time at the bar in the terrace overlooking the ocean. Our room was clean, and I am very finnicky about these things. Their food is good, mostly fire-grilled items. They dont have breakfast, only continental, but there is a Dennys a short walking distance. Parking can be a problem if you are renting a car, like we did. You may end up parking a couple of blocks away. Puertorricans were very friendly to us, and are very festive. We stayed in a room with no view the first couple of nights, but then the manager personally moved us to one of the ocean front rooms. He wanted to make sure we were pleased, and we were after the change. If you book there, ask for an ocean front! The bartender is the sort of person that memorizes the names of the guests. It gave the bar a feel of a Cheers at the Beach! She even got to know the story behind my divorce. My point being, I felt very comfortable at the hotel. I would recommend this hotel to couples, and small families. If you do go, tell Margarita that Diane says hello. ","annotations":[]}
