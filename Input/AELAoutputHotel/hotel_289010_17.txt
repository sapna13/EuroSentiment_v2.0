{"text":"Great Hotel for a good price I stayed at the Agon Opera for 2 nights and chose the hotel from the reviews on this site. I wasn't disappointed. The hotel is extremely easy to get to from Tegel Airport. All you do is catch the 109 from outside the terminal and it is 12 stops and takes 20 minutes. The bus annouces each stop so it is easy to know when Olivier Platz is coming up.The reception staff are really nice and speak excellent english, which I needed as Heathrow had lost my bag. They chased the airport for me and were extremely helpful. The free internet in the reception was also useful for checking opening times etc of places you want to visit. The location of the hotel is good, although you are a long way from East Berlin, but as I preferred the atmosphere of West Berlin I was happy with the location. The 109 bus runs up the Ku'damm all the way to the main zoo station interchange where you can get buses to all over the city. There are lots of cafes and restaurants around.The room was spotless and had a great view of the Ku'damm. The bathroom was nice with a really deep bath and powerful shower. The breakfast was something else. There was a choice of absolutely everything including yoghurt, cereal, meat, cheese, bread, fruit and even salad. You could probably make up a good packed lunch from the breakfast things (as I certainly don't like eating cucumber for breakfast!)I would definitely stay at the Agon Opera again and have recommended it to my friends and family.
