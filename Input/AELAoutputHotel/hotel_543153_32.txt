{"text":"Different! This property suited our family very well. We are a family of 2 adults and 2 teenagers and having been travelling together for a month we all felt the need for some time apart. The unusual arrangement at Casa Camper, where each room has a separate living room across the hallway, provided exactly what we needed. The 'living room' has a tv, desk, couch and hammock, all of which were useful. The bedrooms are comfortable and quirky. There is no enclosed wardrobe, just open shelves and a line of Shaker style pegs the length of the bedroom on which to hang things - even the TV and hotel information hang from pegs. The bathroom is not enclosed and looks out on a wall stacked with aspidistra in pots. It is all stylishly executed and practical enough. The living rooms face the street while the bedrooms overlook a small courtyard so are very quiet.What really sold our 2 teenagers on the hotel though is the excellent lounge\/breakfast\/snack room on the ground floor. Not only is the buffet breakfast complimentary but drinks and snacks are available at no charge throughout the day. They loved being able to help themselves whenever they felt like it. The food was also very good.The staff here were very welcoming and friendly, with useful recommendations about where to go and where to eat. The hotel is small and has quite an intimate feel to it. It is also very well located , just off La Rambla in the Raval area. The Museum of Contemporary Art is just around the corner. ","annotations":[]}
