{"text":"Awesome location, great price This hotel is smack dab in Union Square, which is a perfect location for a tourist to San Fran. Although the room is very small, it is cozy and well decorated in soothing greens and browns. The room overall is very functional, with a very large closet so your bags don't overwhelm the room. The bathroom is also tiny, but well decorated in small tiles and a deep soaking tub. The place overall was extremely clean, and so relaxing and charming (it is a very old\/historic hotel). It was so fun to roll out of bed and be in the middle of it all, and the staff was accomodating and very friendly. The cleaning crew cleaned in the afternoon unless you put a sign up requesting early cleaning, which was very nice.Although the place was wonderful overall, it was slightly noisy since you are right in Union Square, and during our stay there was some construction right across the street. We were never bothered by the noise, though, unless the windows were open. The walls are slightly thin, and although not generally a problem because it attracts a pretty quiet clientele, we did have to ask the person on his cell phone next to us to keep it down at 4 a.m. The bathroom is not well-ventilated, so they ask that you keep the window open while you shower, which is slightly awkward to get to and has no curtain. The window is small, however, and tucked back over the toilet. There is also no heat in the hotel, so you must use a stand alone radiator, which works okay, but not great. This was only a problem a couple nights since we had unusually cold weather. The lobby also smells slightly moldy, which several people noted during our stay. These were the only cons about the place and were honestly very minor in comparison to how great the place was.For the price, this place was fantastic and I would recommend it again in a heartbeat!
