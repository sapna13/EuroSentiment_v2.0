{"text":"Excellence - Best there is Ok, first to dispell all the rumors. The busride is not that bad. Those who complain about the busride will complain about anything. We stopped along the way to get an El Presidente, go to the bathroom, take some pics and really kind of enjoyed the ride. Was it bumpy? Yes. Was it the worst ride ever? No.On the ride to the hotel you will see some countryside. Is it as nice and clean as the U.S? No. But remember you aren't in the US anymore and you will be staying at a nice clean resort so who cares what the rest of the country looks like.Alright, onto the specifics. The resort is HUGE. I can't think of another resort that I have been to that is bigger. It is beautiful well taken care of, clean, and the welcoming was very nice. The pools are very nice, lots of chairs, could use a few more rafts, pool bar is great, lots of pool activities in the afternoons.(pool v-ball, water polo, water aerobics, etc.) Food - GREAT!!. I love the food at this place. Lots of restaurants to chose from, great variety of food, and all restaurants were very nice. The only meal I didn't enjoy was breakfast and that was only until I found the pancake and omelet station. Beach - BEAUTIFUL. The beach was amazing. People - other than the slight language barrier everyone was great. Always willing to say hola, como estas. In short this resort was true to it's name!!
