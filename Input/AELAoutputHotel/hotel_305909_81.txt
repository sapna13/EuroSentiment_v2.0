{"text":"Perfect location! My husband and I stayed at the Royal Plaza for 2 weeks in March. We had previously stayed at the Hotel Concourse (now the Metropark Mong Kok) so were familiar with the area. We decided on the Royal Plaza because it seemed like a good deal for a great rate. We were not disappointed.We travelled from the airport to Kowloon station via Airport Express (approx 20 mins) and then took a taxi to the hotel. I think there are buses available but this was the most convenient option. I highly recommend the Airport Express.The hotel is located in Mong Kok near Nathan Road. This area is less touristy (so you may see fewer Westerners around) but you do see how Hong Kong people live. It is very close to Ladies Market, Flower Market and Goldfish Market too.We loved the location as it is right on top of Grand Century Plaza shopping centre and the KCR station. The back entrance of the hotel leads into the shopping centre. The hotel is also connected by a covered raised walkway to most of the local attractions and Prince Edward MTR station (a couple of mins walk). The hotel room we had was located on the non smoking floor. We were very impressed with the size of the room considering this was Hong Kong. It was very spacious. The bathroom was also very nice and the power shower was great. The room was very quiet (I'm a light sleeper so this is important). The view of Flower Market wasn't great but that didn't bother us.There was a complimentary copy of the South China Morning Post delivered every morning which was great. The TV also showed quite a few channels including about 3 devoted to football which pleased my husband! I couldn't get away from English football even in Hong Kong.Our room rate didn't include breakfast so we made a trip to a local bakery most mornings for fresh Chinese cakes  buns (Jimmy's in Prince Edward). We only ate in the restaurant once for an evening buffet (La Scala). It was good but the Langham Place Hotel's buffet in Mong Kok is superior for a similar price. There are so many places you can eat in the area you are spoilt for choice. We would recommend the food court in Langham Place shopping centre near Mong Kok MTR. At the end of our stay we took a taxi from outside the hotel entrance directly back to the airport. It was quicker as we had an early morning flight. We would not hesitate to recommend the Royal Plaza hotel and are looking forward to staying there again soon.
