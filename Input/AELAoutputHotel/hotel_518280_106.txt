{"text":"Good, Unique, Low-Frills Option I stayed at the QT over a cold weekend in February and it was a great choice. I booked the cheapest available rate, $199\/night, through the hotel website, and when checking in was given a complimentary upgrade. The room, on a high floor, had a bit of a view of the lights of Times Square. It was small but perfectly arranged, with a small table, a very small TV, and a large king size platform bed with one of the most comfortable mattresses I've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on. The bathroom was minimal with a rain-style showerhead, overall lighting could have been better, and in the extremely dry NY winter a small bottle of body lotion would have been appreciated. The pool\/bar area was a bit overwhelming on check-in. It's right there by the elevators and was full of good-looking, cavorting youths when I stumbled through after my long flight. But the next afternoon, after a freezing walk around the city, I came back and sat in the steam room, took a swim in the little pool (actually more like the size of 4 hot tubs) which was all deserted, and felt like a new man. Who these people are jumping in the pool at 2am, though, I have no idea. The lobby bar is cute and a great place to arrange to meet friends. Just a half-block from Times Square, the location is almost too central, and the area is very touristy, thus it's a bit tough to find a cheap breakfast or whatever. But, that's New York. The subway isn't exactly right downstairs, but Times Square entrances are just a couple blocks away. It was a good compromise between downtown clubs, midtown art, and uptown friends. For 200\/night, it's a great, hip place with a fun, unique style, and if you dont' care about people watching you, a jump in the pool can hit the spot. ","annotations":[]}
