{"text":"Good, but could do better I came to the Krasnapolsky with my wife Jessica to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. The good points of the hotel are that the room size was generous by European standards, there was plenty of storage space in the room, there was a separate bath and shower in the ensuite bathroom and the proximity to the Central station , trams, bars, restaurants and shopping precincts. Also the front desk staff were friendly and helpful. In addition to this, the view overlooking Dam square was special and the breakfast in the Winter room was fantastic. Of course at √à√\u2020√ü?24 per head, it's not cheap, so Jess and I had our first breakfast there and spent the other mornings at one of the many places that sell a good breakfast. The bad points of the hotel are that even on the fourth floor, noise from Dam square could clearly be heard in our room at about 6.00 am. Also, on our first night we lost electricity in our room after switching on the kettle. This ties in what others have said about the hotel needing refurbishment. But on the plus side, the kettle was replaced quickly and without fuss. I agree with what others have said in that this is not a five star hotel. In order to achieve this status, the hotel needs to add extra value. These would be perhaps bathrobes, branded toiletries and free shuttlebus to the airport. At the moment this is √à√\u2020√ü?2 per person.Overall Jess and I enjoyed our stay here because thanks to the reviews here we knew what to expect. If you want a peaceful stay in Amsterdam, go to a remote hotel. If you want a decent hotel in the heart of Amsterdam then enjoy your stay at the Krasnapolsky. ","annotations":[]}
