{"text":"A Super Hotel Just back from 7 nights in this hotel. We selected the Privilege on TripAdviser scores. It lived up to its excellent reputation. Small (18 rooms, I think) but giving above average space to each room. It seems ideal for adult couples, being too small for large group bookings. Superb location on River Arno, it is out of the very busy and very noisy central area, yet is within easy walking distance of all major sights. Our room faced inwards to the small courtyard and was pefectly quiet. River-facing rooms might get more traffic noise.Spotlessly clean, elegantly decorated and much-loved by the owners, it was a delight to stay here. Hotel breakfast was excellent - fresh, generous, unhurried. The owners were happy to speak English and to help with our halting Italian. Very helpful with advice on museums etc, and especially with suggestions for restaurants. Do go to 'Ristorante del Fagioli', just 400m from the hotel - the best value (eating out is expensive in Florence) and most helpful service we found anywhere.Other tips: Trains are outstanding value and the best way to visit Sienna, Lucca, Pisa etc. Pisa Airport to Florence is best by train. We used the Terravision bus to return to airport: it worked well. Electric buses in the city are great value and endless fun. Museums are an organisational and curatorial disgrace, but staff are charmingly helpful. March is good: the city must be an overcrowded, over-heated nightmare in the Summer. The AA 'CityPack Guide and Foldout Map' (√ä√£¬¢6.99) worked very well.
