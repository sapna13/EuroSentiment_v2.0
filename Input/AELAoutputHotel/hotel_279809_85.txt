{"text":"Bad choice The resort was the worst out of two previous we have stayed in (Copacabana in Riviera Maya and Riu Jalisco in Puerto Vallarta). In our room, three out of five power outlets did not work, including the one in the bathroom, which they replaced after our third complain. The same story was in all other three rooms where our friends stayed. When we first entered the room, instead of a king size bed we got two full size beds. They put them together and said that this is their standard room. Again, the same situation was in two other rooms. The bathroom door was with a see-through glass √à√\u2020\u2022?crazy, I was able to see the toilet area right from the hallway where our closets were. There was some mold in the bathroom on the ceiling. The toilet would not flush in our friend√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ room on the first day. They only make up our beds but did not change the linens all seven days.There were four √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∫¬\u2022estaurants√à√\u2020\u2022?√à√\u2020\u2022?one √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºea food√à√\u2020\u2022?where were four options on the menu only one of them was a fish, others were pork, beef, and something else, all other sea food was on a separate menu and not included in the all-inclusive package (lobster cost was 30 USD); the second restaurant was a pizzeria and couple salads buffet ; the third restaurant was a small buffet with a very limited choice of food; and the last one, the main buffet, had the SAME selection of food the whole seven days stay (Other resorts we have been to had a different cousin every day). I would not recommend this resort to my friends. It was a bad choice.
