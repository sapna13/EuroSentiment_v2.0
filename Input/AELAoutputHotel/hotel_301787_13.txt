{"text":"Service!! Service!! Service!! My wife and I including another couple have just come back for a 7 night stay at Laguna. It was our first time in Bali and getting out of Denpasar airport and going through the towns to Laguna was an eye opener. Was under developed from what i have imagined. Traffic rules were none existent except for the traffic lights. We went through 2 vehicle security checks before reaching our resort. One was at Nusua Dua entrance and there was another one at Laguna. As we stepped out of the taxi, thats when it all started. Such detailed service that we have never experienced anywhere we have stayed so far. Each passenger door was opened for us and greeted with a warm balinese smile. A Gong went off and music and dancers started as we were making our way to the hotel lobby to reception to check in. Breakfast was great, each day, lying by the pool or beach, they would come with fresh cool towels, fruits and\/or juices which were complimentary. The room was spacious and i dont think you could ask for anything more. Starwood preferred guest are invited to the Mayang resort from 3pm-4pm for complimentary light refreshments every day. Everywhere you walked through the resort, from cleaners, to baggage handlers to gardners they greeted you and smiled.The only thing i would like to suggest is they should encourage the daily activities and have more variety and round up the guests if they wish to particpate. Activities board was by the main pool however if no one went up and asked they wouldnt have it.But overall one of the best resorts i have stayed in, thank you to all the Laguna staff for making us feel special.Gabriel ChangSydney ","annotations":[]}
