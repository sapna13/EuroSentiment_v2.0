{"text":"Beautiful Landscaping and Beach We were at the Palladium Bavaro December 9th-16th.It was a beautiful destination, everything you could ask for in an All-Inclusive. It is huge, beautifully landscaped in every corner, had many pools to choose from, restaurants were plentiful, (we ate at the ala cartes every night, and of course the beach is fabulous. One day we walked for an hour to the left of the resort. We walked al the way to the Iberostar and then the Riu and then an hour back. It was well worth the walk the beach is so pretty.I had e-mailed the resort a couple of weeks prior to our visit and requested two rooms close together and centrally located. They honored my request and when we arrived I questioned the room choice and the man at the front desk personally gave us a wonderful tour showing us the differences of room choices. I really appreciated that.I would agree with most of the reviews about the resort. Everything is well organized, the fool was very plentiful with a lot of variety, mostly of very good quality. We ate at all the ala cartes and loved the Spanish and Mexican ones best. The Arricefe Restaurant had the best food, but the wait staff was not very good. The steaks are all very good throughout the resort. My husband enjoyed that. I am a seafood girl myself. That was good too. We saw the Michael Jackson show. That is a must see. We saw it the night of the Tropical Storm Olga and it was a highlight of a very rainy, dreary day.All in all, I don't want to make this excessively long.I would recommend this resort to anyone, however be forewarned that Americans are in the FAR miniority at this resort, maybe 2-3%. Mostly Germans, and other Europeans. I really didn't mind and enjoyed seeing all the nations of people together. We unfortunately had a very untypical rainy week because of the storm. We did have many nice sunny times also peppered between the raindrops. This is very uncharacteristic of December weather in the Dominican from what I understand talking to others on our plane that come every year. O well, you can't control the weather. We just made the best of it. The covered walk ways were great. I walked around the resort for hours through the storm.A few things that I didn't care for that kind of rained on my parade, pardon the pun, were as follows.1. The lack of communication at the resort. Information is NOT plentiful at this resort. Even through the storm we had to rely on other guests with laptops to tell us what was going on. Finally the resort posted a paper at few places telling us of the storm and to stay away from the beach but nobody would tell us anything more. That was frustrating. Our Apple representative was never around except the first day.2. The staff all did there jobs but were VERY impersonal,not just to us but with everyone. I left money and Snickers candy bars and nice notes in Spanish for the maid every day. She was nice, thank you Sophie. However the rest of the staff including the Animation Team were very lethargic with the activities. The wait staff at the restuarants were not friendly either despite our tipping and patience and respect. That made me kind of sad. Maybe the rain put a damper on their spirits. We have never had this response at any other resort even in the Dominican. In fact we have found our last trip to the Dominican the complete opposite. The resort workers at the Sunscape Casa del Mar were all happy interacting with the guests and amongst themselves. 3. Other than walking the beach, you really are confined to the resort. Unlike Mexico, I really didn't feel safe leaving the resort, there aren't many excursions. I Loved Soana Island last year from La Romana since the boats left from our beach but would not recommend that trip from the Bavaro beach resorts since the bus trip is so long each way.Would I return? Yes, I would. it is a beautifut resort and a beautiful beach. The water is a magnificent color, walking the beach is wonderful.
