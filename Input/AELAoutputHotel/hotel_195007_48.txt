{"text":"Great location! We don't usually stay at American chains overseas, but my Starpoints got the family(Mom, Dad and 17  20 year old sons) in here free. So, it was a no-brainer. Location is a couple blocks from the city center, maybe a 10 minute walk, not bad. It's right on the river, walk out the hotel across the street to the views. Rooms are nice, not huge, but for Europe very adequate. Staff was very attentive and curteous, especially the concierge desk. They had all the answers and recommendations for us regarding Florence and surrounding areas. I even contacted them in advance of our trip to obtain timed tickets to the Academie, Pitti, Boboli and Uffizi so we would not ahve to wait in line. Not only did they do this, but did so without charging me until I arrived. Only drawback was the cost of their restaurant. Unlike most European hotels where breakfast is included, it is not here. A bowl of cereal or a single pancake or a single slice of french toast was 7 Euros, nearly $10! Since we got the rooms free, I could not complain too loudly, but there is no reason to gouge the guests. There are a couple of wonderful little bakeries just up the road toward the train station, and for about 10 Euros, all 4 of us ate yummy croissants and cakes with juice. Ask the concierge, he'll direct you there. Ponte Vecchio is 10 minutes, Train Station, 10 minutes, Central Market(highly recommended) 15 minutes, Uffizi 15 minutes, tons of restaurants within 5-10 minutes.
