{"text":"The Excellence Punta Cana Dark Days of Night The Excellence Resort (Punta Cana) was very nice but the service was not all that I thought it should be. The star rating varies from 4-6 and it is definitely a four star resort. The Excellence was extremely dark and scary looking at night. The lights on the grounds other than the major thorough fares were all cut off at a certain time (i.e. eleven, midnight, etc.). I spoke with the night manager about the darkness of the resort at night and he basically told me he would try to move us from the back room and I never heard from him. In the future they need to warn young ladies that are traveling without males that this is a dark place to be and that the focus is on couples. The garden level was pitch black on the terrace at night and anyone could walk up to your door. They might want to consider putting females on the second level of this resort. It might also interest you to know that we experienced a very difficult time trying to get American money and maybe people should try to bring as much as they can before they get there.....Additionally, I am also not sure if I experienced bedbugs because I have all of these little bites on my legs and ankles. The positive part of the trip is that the food was good and the resort workers were very friendly and nice. The Concierge was excellent and since I was with my friends I managed to have a good time, however, this is not a place that I would like to visit again or recommend anyone else to visit. Thanks for everything and I hope this feedback is taken with the positive nature in which it was sent.  Note: The Excellence advertised 24 hour service but you were unable to get liquor or any food (other than hotdogs and hamburgers) late at night. Also, the fact that the grounds were dark at night says to me that they don't want people to enjoy the resort at night so what does that mean? Is it dangerous at night for some reason....because I would think having people stumble around in the dark trying to get to their rooms is really foolish and dangerous.
