{"text":"Westin is great for Starpoints Just got back from Easter week at the Westin Rio Mar. We booked the hotel on points thru Starwood which was great. I used Trip Advisor hints extensively, so I wanted to report back on how it went.We rented a car from Avis at the airport for about $200 for the week which gave us flexiblitiy and savings. This was cheaper then using hotel transport which is $75 pp\/each way. When we got to the hotel we used the open air staff parking across from the basement self park of the hotel. Again this saved us $10 a night for self park or $20 a night for valet park. When we arrived at the hotel at 2:30 our room was not ready, as we knew to expect from previous postings, so we had bathing suits and flip flops available, changed in the bathroom and hit the beach. By 4:00 we really wanted to check in, so got back on line. (this hotel does not have a starwood express line as it should) We were told our room still wasn't ready. When I pointed out that check in was supposed to be at 3, I was told that they have a window from 3 to 5. As I found this unacceptable, I announced that we would now wait at the lobby bar with complimentary drinks from them and that when the room was ready they could call us at the bar. The clerk said just one moment - went into the office for a minute- and came out announcing that our room was now ready. We asked for and received an upper floor with ocean view. The room was a little shabby, with cracked floor tiles and chipped tub, not as modern as the Westin in Cancun. But it was scrupulously clean and perfectly acceptable. Especially as it was free. The safe was still locked from previous guests, the refrigerator I had requested was not there, and the room key did not work. I stopped a passing security man, who apparently made a call for us and all was fixed within a half hour.We had stopped at Rodriquez' market on the corner of 3 as you turn to go on the road for the Westin as recommended on this site. This worked out well. We stocked up on soda, juice, chips, cookies and milk. This rounded out the hotel meals and meals out.In the room is a snack\/drink frdge that is locked. We never unlocked it as I had read that the prices were ridiculous. There are 2 kinds of water in the room, large bottles with a private label from a local spring water company. These are free and I asked the maid to leave us extra each day which she did. I stored these in the fridge, and brought them down to the beach along with my insulated mug full of ice. This This worked out well. The bar refilled my mug with ice whenever I asked. Tere are also small bottles of water labelled Westin in the room. These are $3 each which you are not told. Most people were walking around with the Westin water - I think they wrongly thought that was the free one. There was a coffee maker with supplies (free) in the room as well as bathrobes.The hotel was full, and preferred seating at the pool and beach was hard to come by. There are two pools. Only the quiet pool has chairs with cushions. This was my biggest complaint. It is hard to sit all day on fake plastic wicker beach chairs. So by about 9:00 the best chairs at the pools (under umbrellas) and at the beach in the shade were already reserved. My husband went down at 7 each morning to put towels and magazines on the chairs in the shade that we wanted. At 8 you can wait on line for a worker to set up an umbrella on the beach for you. People who came down at 11 were out of luck for chairs or umbrella's. We saw a lot of angry people. However, I will remind you that this was Easter week and probably if you go at any other week it wouldn't be so cutthroat.
