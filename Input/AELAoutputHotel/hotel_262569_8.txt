{"text":"French Indulgence without going to Paris ! Stayed at the Wentworth for a significant birthday and wanted somewhere special. We had reserved a Club room and on arrival were upgraded to a Junior Suite (but in hindsight the Junior Suite was facing the rear and a construction site with noise so would have prefered the Club room). Check-in staff were very courteous and whisked us straight up to the Level 5 club where you have a seperate check-in. We got a quick tour around the sofitel club as well as afternoon teas, evening drinks and breakfasts are all included here.The room was excellent with two TVs, well appointed bathroom and all facilities you expect of a five star hotel. The bed and pillows were the highlight and easily the most comfortable we've ever experienced and 'triangle pillows' appeared in our room within minutes of the request. On the negative, there was a welcome note for another guest with a piece of old fruit on the desk that had not been removed.We loved the club experience as we spent most of our time at the hotel. The Lenotre afternoon teas were delicious and tempting and so petite that you didn't feel guilty indulging. We drank enough fine teas over the 4 day stay to sink a ship. The canapes and two hours free drinks that come with club access were another highlight and the canapes were of a very high standard and it's amazing how many glasses of champagne you can drink in two hours ! Staff in the club were exceptional and clearly of a standard not seen in Australia. Most were European, several French and we only noticed one Australian. Agree with other reviewers that paying the extra for club access is almost essential here as our review would be different if we had not. There is not much the hotel can do about the building site with construction noise (and we could have requested a move) but the noise is disconcerting and quite loud. Dinner at the Garden Court was incredible with a price to match but the standard of service and quality of food was extr emely high. My wife said she's never tasted oysters so good, We had an accor card so got half price food but even with that Dinner for two and a wine flight came to $140. Bottles of water were charged at $10 eachThe recent renovations are obvious and the public areas and rooms all look wonderful. If you want a view or a a swimming pool in your hotel then go elsewhere but if you want a high quality experience in the heart of the CBD this will do the job. We had a great stay and next time will know to request a room away from the construction site !
