{"text":"Nice room, good housekeeping, no Internet We stayed at the Kabuki the weekend before Christmas. We booked the executive sauna suite at what we considered a very reasonable price. We love the location of the hotel right next to the Japantown mall.The room was beautiful, modern, and spacious, with comfortable furniture. The bed was one of the most comfortable hotel beds I've slept in and it didn't bounce around like a lot of hotel beds, so I could turn over at night without disturbing my partner. My partner liked the sauna. The living area and sleeping area are separated by a translucent screen, which is what might be expected of a Japanese style room but isn't what we were hoping for, because one of us likes to go to sleep early in a dark room and the other likes to stay up late with a light on.The bathtub wasn't quite what I was expecting (it was similar to a typical Western bathtub, but the sides were a bit taller, and there was no bathing area outside the tub). My partner asked to see a room with a soaking tub setup, but the room was a lot smaller than what we had, so we didn't move.The hotel advertises free wireless Internet, but it rarely worked in our room. No wired Internet was available as far as I could tell. We didn't get the advertised welcome tea service. That was OK with us.We had good service from the housekeeping staff. One day we asked them to clean our room right away because we were leaving and coming back shortly. They did. Another day we didn't want any housekeeping, so we left the Do Not Disturb sign up all day, and they honored it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä√Æ√±hey just left a card saying If you want housekeeping, phone. (These days most hotels will bug you even if you leave the sign out.) My partner had trouble hooking his laptop up to the TV, and they reasonably promptly sent a service person up who helped figure it out.We had some minor issues with bell service. A bell person was not available when we arrived. We had loaded our own luggage onto a cart and were heading to our room when one appeared and followed us to our room, perhaps hoping to get a tip for not actually doing anything. We had planned to use valet parking, and we used it for a couple of hours on our first day there, but after we got back for the evening, the lot was full and we were directed to self park in the Japantown lot. Not so terrible, it turned out - the Japantown lot is cheaper anyway (which we knew), and has parking directly under the hotel (which we didn't know). We didn't get charged for the few hours of valet parking we had.Maybe I'm behind the times, but I expect the staff of a hotel of this class to be willing to call a taxi when requested. My expectations were not met. The first time we requested a taxi, the bell person got us one but acted like he was doing us a big favor. The second time, he said it would take less time if we went out to the taxi stand in front of the hotel and hailed a taxi ourselves. That was a bit uncomfortable because one of us is mobility impaired and we had to stand there for a while.We ate at the hotel restaurant twice for breakfast. The coffee was good and promptly refilled. The food was OK-to-good. One time we had to wait a long time for a table even though the restaurant was almost empty.
