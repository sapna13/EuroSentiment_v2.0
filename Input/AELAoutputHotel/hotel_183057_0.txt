{"text":"Great value for money We stayed in a deluxe suite at the Cambridge Suites Hotel 28-31 December 08 at a rate of approximately √ä√£¬¢70 per night. Although the decor, fixtures and fittings aren't to the standards of a flash new hotel, we thought the extras that were included more than made up for this.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful throughout. The suite was made up of a lounge\/kitchen area with a desk, bedroom, dressing room and bathroom (with bath and shower). The kitchen had a microwave, full size fridge, mini bar, coffee maker and various utensils and items of crockery. The bathroom contained complimentary Aveda products and a powerful hairdryer, an iron and ironing board. In the lounge and bedroom were two huge plasma screens. Wifi was provided at an extremely reasonable rate. The hotel offers a free grocery delivery service and the room service plate fee was far cheaper than most hotels. Each day we were provided with a free newspaper.The 'guest services' book in each room was extremely helpful and although the hotel had a bar and restaurant (which we didn't get chance to use but they looked inviting), they allow local restaurants to deliver, ie pizzas, etc. There is also a boarding pass printing service in reception.The location is just off Yonge Street, the main street going through Toronto, and extremely close to the Eaton Centre, which is a massive shopping mall with fast food restaurants. It is a 20 minute walk to the theatres and a bit further on to the CN Tower. The hotel also scores well with their green credentials by allowing guests to elect not to have bedding and towels changed every day.I'm sure I've forgotten something but all in all, a really pleasant stay in a comfortable, friendly hotel in a great location.
