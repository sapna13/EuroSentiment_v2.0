{"text":"Loved the Iberostar Bavaro This was my 4th all-inclusive vacation. We have stayed at 3 Iberostars in Mexico, this was our 1st trip to the D.R. This was the best Iberostar that I have stayed at so far.Check-in went very smooth. Only took about 10 min. Got king bed, safe, 1st floor and away from contruction near the pool on upon my request.Grounds were amazing. They have plenty of walkways, but slip off your shoes and walk on the grass a little. It is better than the softest carpet you have every been on. The workers are constantly working on the landscaping and it shows.Rooms were really nice and clean. Bathroom was very nice with seperate shower and tub. Lots of hot water. No musty smell. Mini-fridge was stocked everyday. Living area very nice for room service and TV watching while my wife got ready and NBA playoffs.Pool was within 30 yards of our room. We stayed in 2506. The pool was a little cool, but felt great after you got used to it. The swim up bar is a must. Well worth the extra money to have the swim up bar at the Bavaro. The other 2 Iberostars that share the property do not have a swim up bar. There is a deeper area to the pool for swimmers and water polo.Beach has the best sand I have ever walked on, like powdered sugar. There are some rocks\/coral in the water, but just look for the clearings in between the coral outcroppings and you will be fine. The ocean water is also cool and calm. There is a reef about a 1\/4 mile out that shelters the beach from big waves. There are some small waves, but mostly wakes from boats going back and forth just outside the no wake zones.Food was the best of all. Breakfast is always good at any of the all-inclusives. We always ate lunch by the pool. No need to walk all the way back to the front of resort for lunch. Save room for the a la cartes. Make your reservations right after you check-in or as soon as you can if the desk is closed. We stayed 7 nights so we got 3 reservations. We got 3 more by checking at the desk on the other days. Does not hurt to ask for extra ones. We ate at the Japanese. It was really good, but the did not cook right in front of you. We ate at the Cajun 2 times. It was good too. We had the Medditerrean once it is good for seafood. The best is the Gormet and we had it twice. Do not miss it. First class service there.Shows were better at this resort too. Make sure you go on the nights they have the professional dancers. They are great. Also, if you like to dance, they have dancing for people before and after the shows every night. The bar by the theater is a don't miss too. Introduce yourself, shake their hand and make a friend. Some of the nicest people we have ever met on a vacation. Shout out to you Hector and Daniel Salas. Tip these guys because they will treat you right. There is so much more I could talk about. If you have any questions what so ever, feel free to ask me. We explored the whole property.
