{"text":"A pleasant surprise! My family and I (wife, 17 year old son and 70+ year old in-laws) spent 2 nights at the Hotel David last week. During our Italian vacation, we stayed in Milan, Rome, Florence and Venice and we found the Hotel David to be the best hotel of the bunch!The hotel is on the southern side of the Arno River, so you are a little away from the heart of Florence, but it was very easy to get around as a taxi stand was just outside the hotel. The hotel sits on charming lot with a small, shaded garden terrace just outside the main floor. There is another elevated terrace on the back side which is much sunnier. The lobby area opens up to a very comfortable living area with books, magazines, newspapers and a chess board. The entire hotel is decorated beautifully and its overall charm makes you feel very comfortable.The rooms were spacious and very clean. The bathroom was surprising large with a nice high-powered shower. The beds were comfortable and the linens were clean and soft.For the price, this was an absolute gem. But the best part of the stay was the very friendly and helpful staff. Every member of the Hotel David staff was extremely welcoming. They made us feel right at home and even went out of their way to ensure our room was fine -- they allowed us to look at a couple of room choices before we settled in.If you want a small, charming, clean, quiet and comfortable stay in Florence -- choose this hotel. Once you arrive, the staff will make sure you made the right choice!
