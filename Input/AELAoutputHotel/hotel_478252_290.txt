{"text":"Huge place..great pools...but bugs The place is beautiful to look at. It is absolutely huge so if you have little children be prepared to take the trolley that the hotel provides to get people from the reception area to their rooms. It is at least a 10 minutes walk from reception to the beach area. Food was good. I actually liked the buffet restaurant the best because that gave a great selection of local Dominican cuisine. Beach is gorgeous and goes on for miles in both directions. The problems of the resort are as follows: 1) Smell of sewage around the outdoor theater 2) Construction going on from very early morning right next to the bungalows. 3) Bugs in the rooms - not just mosquitoes - but small roaches and ants. Rooms are clean so maybe it is just from the humid climate. 4) Rooms were not made up till between 5 and 6 pm even though we had left the room at 9 am every morning. 5) Because the resort is so huge there is constant small diesel truck traffic going on inside the resort on the walkways. These trucks are a constant source of annoyance if you are trying to walk and the diesel fumes are gag-producing. They also drive very fast and if you have small children, I would make sure that that they stay near to you when walking. 6) Very limited activities going on and if there was stuff going on, it either started late or not at all. 7) There is one internet cafe where they ask you to buy a code that entitles you to one hour of internet that is usable for a 5-day period. It cost $12 US. The internet connection is extremely slow so it takes 10-15 minutes just to get your mail. After the 3rd day, I still had 20 minutes left on my account but was told that they had reset all the parameters the day before so I had lost my 20 minutes. After complaining the gentlemen told me I could have 20 minutes back but that I had to use it RIGHT now. Other people complained as well. I thought this very cheap and annoying. I don't think that we will go back to the Gran Bahia Punta Cana but we love the Dominican Republic and will probably go back to the Club Med instead.
