{"text":"great vacation We stayed from 4-15 to 4-22.Arrival was easy and smooth. Breezed through the airport. Ride in wasn't bad about 1 hour as we were the last drop off. Check in was fast was given keys and the bell boy took us to our rooms.Room: Beautiful room. Prob the best we have stayed in. We had a king bed sunk in living room spacious bathroom. We went vip had the perks in the room cigars rum bathrobes. The room is spotless and kepted that way all week always had clean towels. We tipped $3 a day with a candy bar and a present for the day maid and $2 and a candy bar for the night. We always got extra for our fridge. We were in building 5 had a view of the pool and could see the ocean. Resort: It was well groomed and beautiful small enough so you would walk to the lobby or resturants and bars nice if you want to make a quick trip for something. Staff is the best the bartenders are very good and fun. We met a couple the first day who were a blast and made our vacation. My husband and hers got up at 5 in the morning and they went down and got the beach huts and spent everymoring at the beach bar gearing up for the day. the beach bar is open 24 hours and the bartenders there are great. The food I thought was fair. All others in our group thought it was horrible. Out of all the resorts I have stayed in, it was the worst. But the pasta station was good ala carts were good. La Cava was really good. Drinks were really good. We had access to Cribe\/tropical but really didn't go there. We took a short walk in there but basically stayed at our resort.We did one tour Saona Island it was alot of fun and worth the trip even with the long ride I am really glad we did it. It is not a snorkle trip though. The island is absoultly beautiful meal was really good and was fun.We had a prob the last day we were waiting for the bus at 11:30 and after a 1\/2 hour I asked the bell boy if he know when the bus was due. He said sometimes they are late and to give it some time. We waited for another hour then I had the front desk call the apple rep and there was a mechinical prob with the plane which didnt leave boston and would be a 14 hour delay. No problem so we threw our bags in our friends room went to the beach it was cloudy all day no sun but was still nice. We were picked up at the lobby at 9 pm never flew out till 3 am. There were a lot of angry people at the airport but there is nothing you can do about it and I would rather be delayed on the departure then the arrival and we made the best of it.Beach: Best yet. Have to get up early to get a hut. we didnt use the vip beds but they are really comfortable. There are vendors a short walk as you look at the ocean go left. Good buys. We walked the beach each day and it really is beautiful.Weather: Had a nice week but had about 3 days where it rained for 3 hours or so mostly in the later afternoon which was ok as the sun is really hot and we came back with super tans.All in all we had a great vacation with the exception of the food. We went to Pureto Plata in 05 and prob will not come back to this island. If any one has any question pm me and I will be happy to answer.
