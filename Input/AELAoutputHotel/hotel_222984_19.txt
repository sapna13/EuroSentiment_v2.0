{"text":"Very Nice Hotel My husband and I stayed at the Summerfield Suites on Feb. 1-2, 2008 before leaving on a cruise. We called the hotel to request the free shuttle pickup and after a short wait we were greeted by Alberto the driver who was very friendly. Since our flight was arriving early I had requested early check-in and when we arrived at the hotel we were checked in and Alberto helped us with our luggage to our room. Unfortunately when we walked into the room it smelled of cigarette smoke which was unacceptable to us and Alberto called down to the front desk, got our room changed, went downstairs to get the key for our new room and moved our luggage to our new room which was smoke free and very nice. It was a one bedroom which was very clean. It was great having a kitchen with a refrigerator that we could use to store water and soft drinks and a microwave to heat up leftover food from the restaurant we ate at. There was a TV and DVD in the living room area and a TV in the bedroom. The breakfast was great and had a nice variety of items to chose from - scrambled eggs, french toast, bacon, sausages, bagels, english muffins, toast, danishes, yogurt, fresh fruit, cereals, juices, milk, coffee and tea - much more then we expected from a continental breakfast. The shuttle was also available to take us to the shopping center which was nearby and picked us up. Alberto asked us if we needed a ride to the cruise ship dock and he made the arrangements to have the shuttle pick us up and take us to the ship for a nominal charge.The hotel staff was also very nice and helpful. Our overall experience at this hotel was very good and we would definitely stay at this hotel again if we have to stay in Miami again.
