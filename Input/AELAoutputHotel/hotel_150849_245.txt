{"text":"Wonderful Vacation As with some of you, I was a bit concerned about some of the negative reviews, but I just want to say we had a wonderful time. We arrived at the hotel around lunchtime (husband, 11 yr old daughter and myself). Check in was a breeze. I had requested a room on the 2nd floor about a week before we arrived, but when we were given our room key it was on the first floor. We asked if they had anything on the 2nd floor and they changed our rroom immediately and without a problem. The maid was just finishing up our room. It was very clean and we did not have a problem with a musty smell. Our room # was 912. It is one of the furthest blocks but it was very quiet and peaceful.Beach was amazing. Plenty of palm trees and chairs to be found all day. It was windy the first few days, so the beach had a red flag, which meant no water sports. By the third day there was parasailing, snorkeling, banana rides, boating, etc. Pools were very nice. Unfortunately if you want a chair at the pool you had to get up early and save the chairs. All the chairs were saved by 8:30. Weather was beautiful. I was kinda worried because before we left the weather forecast called for a chance of rain everyday. Well, it never rained our entire trip. Yeah!!!There was plenty of food all day long. Some days better than others. Never went hungry. The staff at the hotel are very friendly. Anamacion team is exceptional. Everyone works very hard to make sure you have a good time. Never had a problem communicating with anyone. Although the anamacion team work their butts off, the shows were not the best. But, I really didn't go down there for the shows. We did a couple of excursions thru VIP (they are the funjet rep at the hotel). We did horseback riding on the beach at the Pat Ranch. Amazing. It is an hour horseback ride and most of it is on the beach. The other one was call Caribbean Festival. It was snorkeling and then swimming with the nurse sharks and sting rays. Again, we had a blast. We wanted to do Sanoa Island and the Santa Domingo tours but we didn't want to spend that much time away from the resort. Overall, we had an amazing time. We would go back to the Dominican in a heartbeat. I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to have a great time. Would I stay there again? Absolutely.
