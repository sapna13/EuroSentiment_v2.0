{"text":"Couldn't have been a better experience The Royal Park was something I lucked into. It happened to be the first on my approved corporate list and I know why. To get there, I got off at Narita and walked up to the Airport Limousine desk and asked for the bus to Tokyo City Air Terminal (TCAT). 10 minutes later I was on the bus being offered tips by an returning ex-pat Japanese. Less than an hour later I arrived at TCAT, read the little map there (there's a direct-connect phone if you need help) walked around the corner and was in the hotel in 5 more minutes. The staff was gracious and I was whisked to the executive check-in. They got me a drink and checked me in while I relaxed. The ONLY thing that bothered me was that the girl who checked me in was adamant about taking my bag which was probably as heavy as she was. She refused a tip showed me the hotel room (which included a full computer, 200 channel cable radio including a station that plays ONLY the Rocky theme), free internet, nice desk, comfortable bed and the world-famous toilet seat in the pristine bathroom.The views from the top floors are great, I didn't eat in the restaurants, except for the included breakfast buffet, which is OK. However, there's a little dumpling place just down the street - take a right out of the hotel, go a block, look for the yellow standing sign on the sidewalk, excellent goyza dumplings - that I ate at several times. Several convenience stores around for late night \/ early morning drinks, rice balls, etc. made it ideal for me.Other than being mortified about a young lady carrying my bag, everything about my experience here was excellent.
