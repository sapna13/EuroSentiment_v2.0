{"text":"What a ride! Just returned last week. First time ever in Europe. Selected this hotel based on reviews. Stayed 7 nights. Location was quite central and lots of restaurants nearby. Hotel personnel and service was excellent. Like another reviewer, I found the American buffet tiresome but was good quality with decent selection. The scramble eggs were unusual. Not sure if it was cooked the Parisian way. Way too much milk and a bit undercooked. The front desk was quite helpful in recommending local restaurants and transit to the major attractions. However, they did lack some knowledge when I inquired on where to buy the RER\/Versailles combo pass that I read about in Rick Steve's travel book. The rooms were quite clean and odourless even though I was in a smoking room. However, sometimes I could smell smoke coming in through some of the vents. The only other complaint I had is the shower. It was very very slow to drain. I believe another reviewer mentioned this as well. The hotel is definitely not handicap\/people with limited mobility friendly but then again neither is Paris. Overall I was quite pleased with the hotel. Being a first timer to Paris, I didn't realize the alarm clock is built into the TV. I regret not thanking the staff on my last day as the pickup service to the airport was early and I had to rush out. I just want to take this opportunity to thank all the staff. I had a great experience at your hotel and looking forward to going back in the very near future. ","annotations":[]}
