{"text":"Lousy Club Room How can this property be rated as a Category 6 by Starwood?I have stayed in Starwood properties on over 30 occasions this year, and have been in the top tier of their frequent stayer program for more than 10 years now.This is one of the most over-rated properties I have stayed in. The foyer and checkin staff met expectations - it looked good, and the staff were helpful, polite, and very friendly. The room was just okay. It was more consistent with a Category 3-4 hotel - very basic furnishings, bland decor, poor quality window covers, and not that much better than an average to superior motel (some Holiday Inn Express properties have better looking rooms).The view was quite poor. The higher floors get great views from 3 sides only - so 'bad luck' if they allocate you a room on the side looking towards time square, as you can't see much past the buildings next door!! Maybe a higher floor would have helped, but we were on a floor in the high 20's.Our biggest problem was the Club room at breakfast and evening drinks time. They had clearly booked more people than the space, amenities, food, drinks, and staff could cope with. At breakfast time we had to cue for 20 minutes for each breakfast item we needed. It was mind boggling to see that they had two toasters for 50 people in the room! A long time to wait for those bagels to toast! There was insufficient seating, and we had to wait a considerable amount of time on each morning. If we stay again, we would prefer to go somewhere else for breakfast - it isn't worth the 1 hour trauma to get two bagels, juice and coffee.When I provided the duty manager with feedback on our last morning, she did apologize, informed me that it was because they had so many people booked for Easter, and offered us another breakfast in the main restaurant. A better response might have been for the hotel to manage its bookings so they could meet demand and\/or increase the space for its Club amenities if it wants to cater for so many people.If you're looking for a 'reasonable' hotel, with no particular frills, in a great location - then its pretty good. If you're expecting something special - particularly for a Category 6 - then you are likely to be disappointed. If you're used to the Westin hotels of Europe, Australia and Asia - then give this a miss and try the much more stylish W at Times Square.Peter and AnnMelbourne, Australia ","annotations":[{"endOffset":10,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":6},{"endOffset":10,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":6},{"endOffset":1006,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1002},{"endOffset":1354,"mention":"bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":1348},{"endOffset":1363,"mention":"toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Toast"],"startOffset":1358},{"endOffset":1584,"mention":"bagels","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bagel"],"startOffset":1578},{"endOffset":1602,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1596},{"endOffset":1602,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1596},{"endOffset":1957,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1953}]}
