{"text":"A Jewel on Kuhio This is a great boutique-type hotel that is part of the Outrigger system.Conveniently located on Kuhio between Lewers and Royal Palm, about 1 block from the beach in Waikiki, Wyland Waikiki is an excellent value. We paid $129 per night, booked ourselves via the internet. The hotel's main entrance is on Kuhio, near Lewers. There's a small but friendly bar on the main level, as well as a sandwich shop and the concierge. We asked the concierge a couple of questions re: Diamondhead, and she wasn't the mostly friendly or informative person, but we managed pretty well with our guide books. There's also an Italian restaurant on the premises, but the only time we went for a meal there, we ended up walking over to Giovanni Pastrami instead, due to lack of service. (We waited 15 mins., and though the wait staff were aware we were there, they ignored us -- and we're a nice, middle-aged couple!). Aside from that, the hotel itself and the staff are fantastic. Very friendly and happy to help you out: we were originally booked into room 255, but it smelled like an ashtray. I called down to the front desk, and within 5 mins., a bellclerk showed us to a different, much nicer room. No cigarette smells at all.The hotel grounds and walls are basically covered with fishy art by Wyland. It's tasteful. The rooms are like mini-suites, and had a microwave and coffeepot and under counter refrigerator. The bed was firm and new. Walls were freshly painted. Sinks were surrounded by granite counters. Nice pools (2) and jacuzzi.The International Market, designer malls and plenty of really good restaurants are all within a 5 minute walk of Wylands. If you were a family member, I'd tell you to stay there, and eat elsewhere.
