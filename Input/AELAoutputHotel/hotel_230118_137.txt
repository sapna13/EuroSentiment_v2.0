{"text":"Fascinating hotel We saw all the negative reviews but we were staying there for a conference so had no choice. The key points are as follows -  - Pros - Fantastic service from the front desk, restaurant staff, the doorman and even the cleaners. Everyone amazingly friendly and willing to helpRestaurant was great. Breakfast (included in rate) was extremely generous.We had a problem with our tv, and the speed of service from the front desk and engineer was commendableThe bathrooms seemed recently refurbished (over last couple years) so were quite comfortable.Location was unbeatable. Close to up-market shops, park, trams, cool restaurants (especially the Indonesian one at street level) and night-life.- Cons - All rooms were 'tired'. From the lobby, to the restaurant, bar and actual bedroom. Carpets ripped and stained. Furniture very shabby. There is no way this could be considered a 4 star on this planet. And this was after we were upgraded (another trick?) to their Executive suite\/floor.Weak back office systems. Like many other reviewers, we had our reservation confused. While we were (trying to?) check in, next to us, a US hip-hop group (Dilated Peoples?) was struggling to get their reservation sorted. Even the final bill had a couple errors plus a surprise tax. Look over your paperwork carefully. ---Overall, this was a decent hotel in a fantastic location. The pros definitely outweigh the cons. These guys are trying hard. But the hotel owners are obviously reluctant to invest in some refurbishment. Hopefully if they understand the impact that poor reviews have on their bottom-line, commonsense will prevail.
