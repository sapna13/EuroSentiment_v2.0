{"text":"Magic in Puerto Rico We've been to this hotel at least 4 times over the past decade. The first few times, we went as a couple. I will never forget escaping a freezing cold NYC, arriving late at night and getting out of the long car ride to warm Caribbean air and the sound of a million Coquis. It was Magic.Many things have stayed the same over the years. The food is still banal and high priced. It is also distinctly not very Puerto Rican - I don't mind so much because I don't really like PR cuisine (No flaming please! I lived in Viejo San Juan for 6 months and tried hard to keep an open mind. Just don't like it!) Some things have improved: the boats to Palamino are bigger, more steady and faster; the health club is bigger and better. The biggest change for us was the addition of our son during this last trip. He was 2 1\/2 at the time and the waterpark had just opened. Watching his eyes light up as we tried to track down Coquis, floating down the Lazy River, dipping our toes in the ocean, spashing around in the pools, trying his hand at mini mini golf (they have really small clubs at the towel counter on Palamino!) -- it was Magic all over again!For this trip, there was one annoying thing: we had gone out of our way to arrange through the concierge for a driver to pick us up at a residence in Condado and transport us WITH A CARSEAT to Fajardo. We spoke at least 3 times to specifically make sure that the CARSEAT would be the right size, etc. Well, at the appointed hour, the driver showed up in an enormous vehicle - the kind that shuttles you to a car rental office from the airport! - with no carseat whatsoever. In fact, not even so much as a seatbelt. All for much more than the price of El Con's normal airport shuttle.On the plus side, we stayed at the Casitas. Like it there, as it offers more space for families, plus extra access to a few small pools.
