{"text":"Great Bartenders Lousy Service Otherwise My wife and I decided to stay here because of our great experience we had in Costa Rica last year at a Paradisus property. What a mistake that was. We finally got two of our friends to join us on a vacation. We promised them it would be worth the money as well as to pay the extra money for the royal service. The hotel should have paid us to get the so called royal service. Upon arrival the check in process was very smooth and the lady was very pleasant in the concierge. After that the service went downhill fast and I mean very fast. Any time I needed something ex: tee time for golf, reservations for dinner, massgae for the girls it seemed like it was a hassle for them. Nobody smiled or greeted you with a hello. The only staff members that were great were Lizardo at the royal service pool and the bartenders in the front lobby bar. The food was good not great except for the seafood place(awful). The grounds were well kept, rooms were average(somewhat dirty), pool was nice and the so called private pool in royal service was nice. They allowed anybody in this so called private pool even if you did not pay for the upgrade. The beach was beautiful. Overall, I felt bad because my wife and I travel once a year and our friends do not. They still enjoyed it but the service levels were not what I promised them based on our great experience at another Paradisus. My suggestion is look elsewhere. ","annotations":[]}
