{"text":"Pleasant stay We had a great stay here recently and it is so well situated just near Grand Central and within walking distance of so many of the sights. The staff were excellent, especially the poor bell boys who handled our luggage (a lot). I did have an issue with one staff member (see below) but on the whole had a good stay.I was with a friend for 2 nights and then alone for 2 so had 2 different rooms. The first was the junior suite which was very roomy and well appointed. We did use the sofa bed which took up quite a bit of room but we were only in the room to sleep. It was noisy as it fronted Madison ave but ear plugs worked a treat - I even slept through a major accident right outside apparently.The second room was a full size petite and it was small but still enough room for me get around. It fronted 41st Street and was again noisy but the earplugs dampened the noise.The complimentary wine and cheese at night was lovely and a really nice atmosphere to just relax and chat in.Breakfast was good - lovely staff where nothing was too much trouble - and a good selection of things. Little touches like the next day's weather forecast, complimentary water and chocolates on the pillow at turn down were lovely.The hotel restaurant is excellent too and you can have a full meal or just a snack at the bar. Nice for after the theatre.I had only one real issue and that was with the dark haired girl at reception. I do feel she should seek an alternative career path as she has serious attitude bordering on just plain rudeness.When I checked in a gave a credit card to guarantee the account. My friend checked out after 2 nights and I stayed a further 2 nights. When I went to check out I gave another credit card to put the charges on but was told that the first credit card had been charged when my friend checked out. I asked why they did this and was told it was it was because I changed rooms!!!! I hadn't left the hotel just changed rooms. She was exceedingly surly and quite rude. I also have checked my card, the one I gave to guarantee payment, and have found that the original charge is still being held. I have been back for a week now and I would expect this to have been released.On the whole a good hotel and I would stay there again.
