{"text":"wonderful hotel but the breakfast buffet guy is a total racist Well, this hotel is wonderful except for the racist breakfast buffet receptionist.The rooms were spacious enough and had well equipped beds and cabinets. The bed was wonderful and was a real comfort for our backs especially after an intense day of touring Sydney.The TV had enough channels and we didn't get bored with it. The furniture was also adequate and things went well.All in all, this hotel was wonderful- the housekeeping was superb and the room was really cozy for us. oh yeah, i forgot to say so but the hotel's location was really fantabulous! It was near Paddy's ( the flea market open only from Thursday to Sunday) and the attractions of Chinatown. if you stay in this hotel, food wont be a problem because of all the restaurants and kiosks just a few blocks away.BUT, here comes the pinch, as i've said several times already, the breakfast buffet receptionist was a TOTAL RACIST. He's a middle-aged Chinese guy and this is how he does his discrimination. When the guests are Caucacians (especially the blonde guests and the guys) , he's really nice and hospitable and he's like an angel. He gives the Western guests pleasant greetings and really speaks to them in a polite manner and he really hides all the rudeness in him. he's like this: Good morning sir\/ ma'am! =)How are you today? having breakfast on your own or with your friends? Anyways, let me show you to your seat. =D But, when it comes to us, the Asian guests, he gets all bossy and mean plus he gets so impolite. He's like this: Hey you! X( What's your ROOM NUMBER?! COME WITH ME!!!!!!! Here!We felt that he's a very impolite receptionist because it's his job to show every guest to their seats PROPERLY and he should'nt just choose to whom he should he be polite to. And, the fact that the people he chose to despise were of the same race as him, we felt that he was very unreasonable.The most discriminating part of that receptionist's attitude was that when we were at the juicer station at the buffet, there were Caucacians sitting at the table near the station. There were three of us from our party who were helping out in making the juice so it was quite crowded that the only space i could stand on was beside the teble of the Caucacians and when the receptionist passed by, he just suddenly pushed me from where i was standingso when he could've just said 'excuse me' or asked me to move!If you're a Caucacian, you'd have fun at breakfast because he'll be all over you and he'll be really hospitable. But, if you're Asian, it'll really be annoying to deal with this receptionist.This is a good hotel, but I suggest that everyone have breakfast somewhere else instead (even if the food at the buffet is good) so that they won't experience racism at breakfast.
