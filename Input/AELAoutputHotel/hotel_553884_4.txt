{"text":"Nice room, good convention location, lousy housekeeping Stayed at the Marriott Convention Center New Orleans for four nights on business. My first time in NOLA. Overall comments; the room was nicely appointed - I was assigned a handicapped accessible room. I decided to stick with that room because of the size of the room, but the downside is that there's no bathtub; it's just an open shower. The bathroom is bigger as well. Bed was very comfortable; there's no mini bar. Internet access is $15\/day.The biggest downside for me was the housekeeping; they kept taking my soap and not replacing it, and taking towels and not hanging them back up with new ones. I later learned that there are towels stowed in the cabinet that I could use, but didn't realize that for a couple of days.... Also, while the size of the bathroom is nice, there is no vanity area to speak of (this is a result of the handicapped accessible bathroom). So - good size, but couple details were missing that I didn't come to appreciate until I actually spent a morning there. For a guy like me, no biggie - but a female may not be happy with it.Room service - prompt and accurate. Note order via the breakfast pamphlet rather than the menu itself, the combos are slightly more reasonable (notable word is slightly). Also, Starbucks on premises is very nice. If you want to cheap out on breakfast you can, they have big bowls of cereal and milk in the sundry shop, along with nutri-grain type bars. Don't forget to get a spoon from the restaurant though.Gym - clean and sufficient. TV monitors on each of the cardio equipment.Location - great if you're at a convention, it is right across the street from the convention center. 4 blocks from Emeril's, a pretty cool bar called Lucy's (I think), and other good eats are close by. Bourbon Street is about a 20 minute walk away; it's few blocks to Canal street, then another few to Bourbon street. I'd stick to the main streets, although none of it seemed too sketchy to me.If you're primary purpose is to vacation, however - I might stay a little closer to the French Quarter, although the quiet area around the Marriott is nice at night. If you're at the convention center, though - after a long day of conventioneering, it's great to pop across the street and relax in the hotel room, and it's only a 5 minute cab ride to the French Quarter if you don't want to walk.Restaurants - K-Pauls, Redfish Grill, Mr. B's, Jacques-Imo's, Emeril's. All outstanding. Be sure to order Redfish at least once, somewhere. Overall, not a bad experience. If I go back, I'll probably stay at the Westin or the W, which seem to be a little closer to the FQ.
