{"text":"Does Not Disappoint! I stayed for 5 days at the White Swan Inn during a business trip this month. Though there were plenty of accomodation options in San Francisco, I was so thoroughly impressed by previous reviews of this hotel and decided to give it a go.I arrived by BART at approximately 2100 and walked the short distance to the hotel (about 10 minutes). The clerk was very helpful and welcoming upon check-in. The lobby was very warm and inviting; a fireplace crackled with a fire and a jar of cookies was tempting. I was given the keys to Room 31 and made my way to the second floor.I was so pleased to find the room was large, warm, and inviting. Romantic would be a good way to describe it, had I been there with my spouse. The bed was very large and comfortable with many various pillows to choose from. The fireplace created an inviting ambiance, and the books, wallpaper, and antique furnishings made it very comforting.The breakfasts were very European in distinction, with small pastries, frittatas, cereals, and fruit. The coffee was excellent! The evening wine and appetizers were delicious, elegantly displayed, and thoroghly satisfying. It was a pleasant experience to visit with other guests at the hotel.The hotel is located on Bush street, and is within walking distance to all things San Francisco. The only dollars spent for transportation were on the BART to and from the airport. It was 10 minutes walking distance to shopping and Chinatown and 30 minutes to Pier 39. There are numerous restaurants in the area.I was very impressed with the friendliness of the people in San Francisco. It seems to be a city centered on the arts and its people. The liberal reputation of the city was not completely overt to me.I would absolutely stay at this hotel again, and am hoping to return in the near future with my spouse.
