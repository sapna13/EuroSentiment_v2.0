{"text":"Hollywood Style at its Finest - Excellent Location, Service  Excellent hotel, The Renaissance Hollywood Hotel is one of the hotest hotels in LA and captures Hollywood style at its finest. The hotel is right in the center of the Hollywood and Highland Complex. If you want to see Hollywood, this is THE place to stay. Indeed, it is the hotel where stars stay before and after the Oscars, movie premiers and the like. Indeed, we learned that the Governor's Ball for the Oscars is held at the Renaissance. OK, so on to our review. We checked in late after being caught in traffic and were able to have the car valeted very easyily and were warmly greeted at the desk. The lobby is a popular spot where the everyone feels comfortable and you might see a star or three. The desk clerk was genuinely welcoming and made us feel at ease and relaxed after our long commute. Our room (on the 19th floor) had a commanding view of LA and out to the Pacific. We could also see the roof of the Kodak Theater (reccomend the tour) and Grahmann's (highly recommend the tour), the Disney Store (also recommend). The room was modern and very comfortable. There are plenty of dining options in the area, and we really enjoyed Mel's Dinner (right down highland). If you are not familiar with the institution, it was featured in American Grafitti and many other movies. Good food, good service and the like. The rest of our stay at the Renaissance was wonderful and it was a great place to come back from sightseeing of just to hang out. I stay at dozens of hotels every year and this one is one of the best run that I have seen in a while. Rooms are hard to come by at this property for good reason. We had the chance to stay at the Four Seasons Beverly Hills are are glad that we stayed here. If you want to experience LA and Hollywood, you must stay at the the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel!
