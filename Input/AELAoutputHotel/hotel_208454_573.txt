{"text":"Absolutely Perfect We stayed at this hotel for 8 nights in July, after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor, and were not disappointed. This hotel was absolutely perfect for our first trip to New York City. I booked with the hotel direct as I wanted to make sure we had connecting rooms for my family. We stayed in two deluxe rooms, we just closed off the end of the corridor with an additional door to make them connecting. We were on the 21st floor and rooms were so quiet and comfortable - the beds are wonderful. The hotel itself is in a wonderful location, just a short walk to Times Square or 5th Avenue. All the staff were incredibily helpful and friendly, especially the doorman. The lobby\/lounge area was beautiful, and my sons took full advantage of the free internet access from the pcs which were provided for guest use. Our only small complaint would be the cost of breakfast in Gabys restaurant, quite high for a family of four. This did not prove to be a problem, we had the Red Flame Diner on 44th Street or Starbucks, or Manhattan Cafe on 45th Street. New York City was just fantastic, even during the heatwave! Would recommend visiting Top of the Rock, much better than Empire State which was very commercial and crowded. fWe also took advantage of the 4 oclock check out for Sofitel Privelige Card Holders. I cannot speak too highly of this hotel and can not wait to return.
