{"text":"still a youth hostel The Arena Hotel was not my personal choice but was booked by my Dutch colleagues. Having read the reviews on Tripadvisor in advance I was a bit suspect about the place and I have to say many reviewers were right.The Arena is a very confused hotel. It does not know what it tries to be: a boutique hotel or a student dormitory. The lobby is very much eccentric boutique style hotel and reminded me of the Belfast Malmaison. That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ however were the upmarket feel ended abruptly. The staff at check in were disinterested and surly and despite requesting a smoking room gave me a non smoking room. After having to walk all the way back (and the corridors are long) I finally got the room I wanted.The room, a so called large double, was strange indeed. A long and narrow tall room with a small lounge area and an ancient TV with cables all over the place and an upstairs open plan sleeping area. The in room booklet about the hotel made a big thing out of the history of the building: it once was an orphanage and then a youth hostel which, according to the owners, was restored to a stylish hotel. Nothing could be further from the truth. The room had very much a hostel feel to it. Gloss painted walls (easy to wash off), not very clean floors and the worst bit bed linen with holes in them and pure polyester. Overall a very basic outfit. The upstairs √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áedroom√à√\u2020\u2022?did not feature a TV so any notion of resting on the bed and watching TV was out of the window. No other amenities could be located either: no mini bar (there is a vending machine on the corridors charging very high prices for drinks) or luxurious toiletries or bathrobes. Definitely not a boutique room. Another downside of the room was the fact that you can hear each single neighbour of yours, people walking in the corridors, the guy in the room next door having a shower or the couple above having [--]. Not my idea of a relaxing stay in a hotel.Breakfast is being served in the bar (again not very clean) and was very poor. The scrambled eggs were cold and the selection of cold meats and cheeses very poor. Even as a smoker I thought having the smoking section right next to the buffet is a very odd choice. At night time the bar is quite a happening place and the staff were friendly however the restaurant was another let down. When I tried to get a reservation I was told there was no way, but when my Dutch colleague (who was not staying in the hotel) tried we got a table (plenty of other tables were empty). Just to underline the youth hostel feel a large group of young men were having dinner and were throwing their cutlery and napkins at each other but of course the staff were not bothered by it. Service was very slow and the food was good though nothing special.In summary the hotel is not worth the price it charges. My room was √à√\u2020√ü?150 a night and for that price I expect (and usually get) much more than what the Arena Hotel was offering. I assume the fact that it also has a club and bar means it does not bank on repeat customers. The Arean is still the youth hostel it once was.I would not recommend this to anyone (unless you get a room for √à√\u2020√ü?40).
