{"text":"Very big and nice but not great. Very big and nice hotel. Fantastic lobby. My room was good with a nice view. All staff were friendly, from the maid and up. But I had a little problem when i arrived. They had to reserve money from my card (S$400) if I used any of their services (breakfast, roomservice, minibar etc.). But I had a debet card so It was a little trouble, if I didn't use any of the services I get S$400 in cash when i checked out! We talked for some minutes and agreed on a S$200 reserve. He had to call the VISA people also because he had swiped my card not knowing it was a debetcard, not a creditcard. So they had to cancel the reserve. But why couldn't I pay IF I used any services when I checked out from the hotel?! With this in mind I felt like I HAD to use some money in order to not get any cash back when I was going to Europe again. Because I don't want any Singapore $ in Europe. So it was a little trouble before I came to my room!Other than that it was a nice stay.The room was in good shape and nice but maybe a little tiny. The view was very good. But the aircondition didn't work properly. I set it to 22 degrees and fell asleep, but when I woke up it was freezing! And the bathroom floor was cold. I want a warm floor there!The location was good, just 5-10 mintes walk to centre of Singapore.I asked the maid if she could remove the top matress because it was so warm. But that was not done.The breakfast was not included in the room price. It was many dishes to choose from but some of the dishes didn't have the quality of a 5 star hotel! But all in all the breakfast was good.And I manage to spend all the money reserved and much more. I used the minibar, breakfast, washing clothes, room service (ordered a Tiramisu but this was no good! Served in a glass with awful crackers!! No, buy Tiramisu in an Italian restaurant not this hotel) and taxi to the airport. Taxi to the airport was a good ride, but expensive (BMW 730 Li) but worth it. :).The new Terminal 3 airport was amazing!
