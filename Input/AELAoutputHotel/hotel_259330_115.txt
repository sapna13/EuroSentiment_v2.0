{"text":"Good Hotel First off, let me start by saying that if you want the Ritz, then you'd have to pay for it... This hotel was truly great... the staff is extremely friendly and went out of their way to help us with anything we needed....as many of these reviews say, most of them do not speak English...but for those who complained about it, I don't see how you expect to go to a Spanish-speaking country and have everyone to speak English...it just does not work that way....that being said, many of the employees did speak English, in fact, most of the activities and shows are presented not only in Spanish but English, French and even German...Well, the beach is absolutely beautiful...there are 3 pools and a hot tub....the pool by the club has a pool bar so it was nice to relax in... The specialty restaurants are very good...especially the italian one...but be sure to make reservations early because they run out of room very quickly....At night after dinner they have kids time and children love it because they get to dance and play games with other kids... They also have the kids' club which is free....and they have activities for children and watch them for you...my 8 yr old sister loved it and would look forward to going to play with other kids...The shows are very fun...there is even 1 night when they have battle of the sexes and it is extremely funny....it's even fun for kids....nothing inappropiate for children....This hotel is nice if you are a simple person like me...we didn't spend a lot of money and had a blast....the hotel really is nice....we all felt very safe there and really had no reason to leave it....The only only thing I didn't like was the check-in...it took ages...our rooms weren't ready when we got there....and just 1 more tip, be sure to ask how everything works when you get to the front desk....
