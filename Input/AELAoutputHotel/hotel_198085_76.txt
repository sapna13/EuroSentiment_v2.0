{"text":"Great hotel with Character I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe stayed at this hotel at least 15 times on business and think it is one of the nicest hotels in its price range in Paris. It is located in at the non-touristy end of Montmartre, about a 10 min walk from the Metros at Abbesses and Clichy. The area has a great village feel. The hotel has recently been refurbished, all the rooms are individually designed but with a general theme, which tends to be a bit chintzy. The arrangement of the bathrooms in some rooms can be idiosyncratic, but again clean modern and characterful. The new restaurant is great and during the summer you can also eat on the open terrace on the top floor, which has fabulous views over Paris. The hotel has a range of rooms, which do vary greatly in size, the ones at the front are very large and have the great view of Paris, the ones at the back can be quite small (although not unusually so) and look over the rooftops of Montmartre. I think this view has just as much character, but I can see how you could be disappointed if you were expecting the panoramic view, so I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° ask to see the room first. Strangely the prices don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ seem to reflect the size of room. We have also stayed there as a family, and the suites are great; they have siding doors dividing them into a bedroom and living room. The hotel will put two beds in the living room giving two interconnected rooms, both of which have access to the suite√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ bathroom and toilet. ","annotations":[]}
