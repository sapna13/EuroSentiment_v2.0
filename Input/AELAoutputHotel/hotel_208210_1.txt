{"text":"fantastic arrived at the hotel for our 3 day break slightly before the check in time. The lobby is absolutely beautiful when you enter the hotel. The reception and concierge teams were very helpful. As a special treat we had upgraded to the executive floor (which is well recomended) , we were invited to have a drink in the lobby whilst our own concierge came to meet us. We were given a tour of the hotel and some knowledge of local area and history. We were invited to the executive lounge which is only available for use for people staying on the executive floor. There was a complementory bar serving tea, coffee and most importantly, alcohol. The concierge team dedicated to our floor would not let you lift a finger and always helped with any requests with a smile on their faces. Also in the exec lounge there was fresh food out to sample (or fill your face) which was refreshed every 2-3 hours. There was also a bottle of champagne on table at all times for you to drink free of charge.The hotel room was beautiful, ours had an amazing view of camp nou. The hotel was very pricey but you come to expect this from a hotel which is listed in the worlds leading hotels. The spa which we used one day was excellent and a wonderful way to unwind from what was becoming an extremely busy break. It would of been nice to be able to share the facilities, but it was also nice to get away from the mrs for a couple of hours. The only downside of this break was that las ramblas is a little shadey of a night time, you have to be wary of pick pockets etc. This is not normally within our price budget but the room upgrade is recommended and made this experience a whole lot better. Would love to go back to this hotel again someday.
