{"text":"Very pleasant stay in a great location We just returned from a 3 night stay (over Labor Day weekend) in Seattle at the Mediterranean Inn. I will definitely stay there again the next time I find myself in Seattle. I thought the rates were reasonable, the location is fantastic, and the rooms are great. As for location...it is right in the heart of the Queen Anne district. There are several restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops within a couple of blocks. There is a Safeway just across the street as well as a movie theater. It is also just a couple of blocks from the Seattle Center (the Space Needle, Key Arena, as well as other venues\/sights.) If you are going to the Bumbershoot festival, you can't get a better location. We did walk to Pike Place Market. It took us around 20 minutes, so I know that won't be for everyone. There is a city bus stop a block up the street and the front desk staff were very helpful with public transportation instructions. The Starbucks in the lobby of the hotel is very convenient. We got our morning coffee at Starbucks and went straight up to the deck to enjoy the view  the gorgeous weather. As for the room...our room was on the 3rd floor of the hotel, not facing the street. It was clean except for a couple of stains on the carpet. The bed was comfortable and the shower was excellent. The room had a fridge and microwave. They provided 2 bottles of water, coffee, and a bag of microwave popcorn. We did not have air conditioning, but there was a ceiling fan and I noticed that some rooms had oscillating fans so I guess you can ask for one. Our room stayed comfortable since it didn't really get any sun and the nights were cool. We slept with the window open; it was quiet since we didn't face a street. I guess if I had to come up with one complaint, it would be that the parking spaces were really small. I have a compact car, so it wasn't a problem but I would have a hard time parking a big car. Parking was $12 per night, under the hotel in a very secure garage. All in all, it was a great stay and I would recommend the hotel.
