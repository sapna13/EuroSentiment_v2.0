{"text":"Great Hotel - couldn't fault it at all We stayed in this hotel last weekend and I have to say it was a great experience. It is a small hotel located about 10 minutes walk from La Ramblas which was perfect. The room was small but spotlessly clean and the free toiletries in the bathrooms are a lovely touch. Our room was also cleaned every day while we were there. The thing that made this hotel that little bit extra special were the guys on reception - they could not have been more friendly or helpful. Whether it was recommending traditional tapas restaurants or giving us directions, they went out of their way to be helpful and polite which came in handy as we were first time visitiors to the city who needed guidance to find our way around.The breakfast is also very good, they have most things you could want and its a buffet so you can have as much as you want. You can also have breakfast brought to your room.Overall I was extremely pleased with this hotel. The location is excellent, you are close to everything but also away from the hustle and bustle of the Ramblas. I got excellent rates directly from the hotel's website so I would recommend that you do this.If you are looking for luxury then this might not suit you but if you want a reasonably priced, comfortable and spotlessly clean hotel in a central location then I would highly recommend Apsis Splendid!.
