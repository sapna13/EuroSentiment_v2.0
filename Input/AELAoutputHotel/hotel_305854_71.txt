{"text":"A 4\/5 star hotel witrh 6 star staff As always, it's people, location and comfort that makes a great hotel. This one is nicely located, atop a pleasant shopping mall in the Hung Hom area of Kowloon. All the staff are extremely friendly and helpful: Nothing is too much trouble. The rooms and beds are very comfortable, with every amenity. The rooms are on the small side, although not as small as the pokey cupboard I was shown to at the much-vaunted Algonquin in New York! There is an accurate picture of a standard room in candid travellers photos on this site.There is a frequent shuttle bus every twenty minutes to and from the sister Kowloon Hotel on Nathan Road, which takes eight or nine minutes. That hotel is more expensive, and having looked round it, I wouldn't want to stay there.I recommend you pay a bit extra for a Harbour Club room which allows you use of the club; a panoramic bar with free broadband, breakfast, snacks, afternoon tea, canapes and cocktails between 6 and 8 pm. There is a great view of Hong Kong island and the harbour, but sadly, as I write this I can barely see across because of the smog. They blame China's coal fired power stations! There is a large pool with attentive attendants and a little bar cart, great for sun bathing (smog permitting). Various restaurants here, and in the adjacent mall. All looked OK, but I didn't try any of them.I will stay here again.
