{"text":"Not what I expected Well we arrived with our hopes up that our stay at a 3 and a half star hotel would be a great experience. We stayed their for 5 days and 4 nights. Our room was a standard size room with a king bed. Room was ok bath needed some remodeling. My wife saw a roach the first night in the shower. We dont have roaches in our own house why should we put up with it while on vacation ?? Called the front desk immediatly spoke to a woman who stated that she was going to check for another room with a king size bed and would call us back. She didnt call back then after 2 calls she said that she had found a room for us. The room was 2 floors down and had 2 full size beds instead of a king. Called desk again and spoke to a male who apologized for her mistake and stated that their were no king size standard rooms available in the hotel call back tomm. Why didnt they tell us ? Next day my wife was told that we were going to be upgraded to a junior sweet on the 16th floor. Sounds great but the 16th floor is a smoking floor. Neither of us smokes why would we want to sleep in a smoking room ?? The smell was unbearable from the time we stept out of the elevator. Later the day they found us a king size regular room. Finally it was the 2nd day into our vacation and we could finally fully un-pack. Room service forgot to clean our room our final day there I guest thats there way of saying thank you come again ??
