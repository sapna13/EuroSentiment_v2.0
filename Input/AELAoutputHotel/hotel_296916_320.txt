{"text":"Two Days at The Jazz Hotel I returned to Barcelona after a 20-year absence, bringing my wife, her two college-age children and my two teen-age children. We booked three rooms at the Jazz Hotel, two through bookings[] and another through expedia[], because the bookings occurred at different times. I booked us this hotel for three reasons: Convenient location, stylish and thoughtful presentation and expectations of good service at a new hotel (it only four years old). We were not disappointed -- at $160 ($125 euros) per night per room, we could have gone to a less expensive hotel. But we were pleased with the service, the cleanliness and the rooms themselves. The pool on the roof is small but the view, while not spectacular, is still worth heading up for. My wife was especially impressed by the quietest AC system we'd ever had in a hotel room anywhere.Jazz Hotel is a block from Plaza Catalunya and the Ramblas, and there is a very good Tapas restaurant (D'Or Restaurant) across the street, which we went to, on a recommendation from a Tripadvisor post, on the first night. The beer on tap there is great, and I suggest you ask Felipe, the waiter in the back of the place, to serve you a tapas sampler. Really great.Americans and Anglos generally will like Hotel Jazz for its capable service -- all desk people spoke English well -- and the easy access to everything.After reading this site I was concerned prior to our visit that the tremble of the subway would keep us up after our long trip to Barcelona. We definitely felt the rumble a couple of times -- we were all on the fourth floor -- but it didn't wake me up from sound sleeps, and generally did not detract from the experience. I think those posting complaints about the subway rumble must have been on the lowest floor (3rd) or were hypersensistive.I highly recommend this hotel for a two or three-day stay in Barcelona, especially if you plan to eat out, as we did. The hotel bar is rather limited, and the breakfasts at 14 euros apiece we didn't spring for. Still well worth going for.
