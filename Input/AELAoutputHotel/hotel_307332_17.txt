{"text":"Loved the Dai-Ichi Hotel Visiting friends in Tokyo we booked a five day stay at this easily reached hotel, since from Narita the Airport Limo Bus stops at the front door of the hotel. Return to the airport with departures every 15 minutes can be arranged at the bell desk. Greeted with a smile by very friendly, efficient, very well English speaking, and ever helpful staff, check in was dispatched in no time. Our quiet room on the 18th floor offered a partial city view, and occasionally below the bullet train would drive by at a slow speed. Noise from the trains was all but imperceptible. The room with the most comfortable king size bed was well appointed with 48 flat screen TV, Tea maker, mini-bar, in-room safe, PC hook-up, a comfortable seating\/table group, and a desk, Pictures with Japanese scenes as well as lamps with porcelain bases decorated in traditional Japanese designs made for a pleasing ambiance. The closet held everything from shoehorn, cloth brush, sewing kit, slippers to daily changed kimonos. The marble bathroom and shower were simply luxurious and stocked with soft towels and an ample assortment of toiletries. The electric toilet took some leaning before it would not ambush one with a spray at the wrong moment. As is to be expected in a 5-star hotel in Japan food in the hotel restaurants is exceptional but expensive. An alternative is offered in the little streets around the hotel and the Shimbashi train station where from Mc Donald's over soup kitchensto fine dining something for every taste and pocket book can be found. Shoppers are able to walk to the near Ginza main shopping street, pedestrianized on weekends. Lastly, Shimbashi JR-train and subway station can be accessed from the hotel lobby via a marbled underground way. A special experience was being able to observe Japanese couple after couple getting married in front of a picturesque wall hanging in the lobby. All in all, the Dai-ichi lived up to its promises and we certainly will stay there again.
