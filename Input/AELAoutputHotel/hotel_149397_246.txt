{"text":"Beautiful but beware!!! Ok , so I am not picky at all. I can pretty much have fun anywere But when the food and drink made all of our party of 6 ill, it pretty much destroyed our vacation!! So here are some more details:The grounds are beautiful, the best beach I have ever seen. Also JC in activities is awesome!! So is Rueben at the pool bar!! The fun we did have on our trip was because of them!!The beer is ok, but WATCH, the beer is not all Presidente. Even the help told us they serve a cheaper beer in some of the bars trying to make it seem as if you are drinking Presidente. But this beer is disgusting!! The mixed drinks were not very good also. Previous resorts I have been to made the drinks with fresh fruit and they were made to order, not out of a slush machine. The food- we were all up to trying new things but we all paid for it. I am not talking a little sick I am talking vomiting\/diarrhea\/in bed two days sick with upset stomachs still after we got home. The room was ok, our bathtub was rusty and the outside of it was peeling off but we were within walking distance to the beach so we didn't complain.The servers in the reserved restaurants were awful, they never offered you anything but water. Like another review said I have never drank so little on a vacation!!I do want to say all the staff that works the beach\/pool during the day is awesome, we did tip them several times through our trip.Won't go back, EVER!!!!
