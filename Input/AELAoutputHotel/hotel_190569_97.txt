{"text":"Nice but not as nice as the urban I had some problems booking this hotel, on phoning reservations I was told quite abruptly that there were no rooms available. I had just checked online and there were rooms available, so I continued with the online reservation no problem?? Didn't get the corporate rate but the availability was there. Check in was smooth although no help was offered to get my case up the flight of stairs leading to the lifts. The reception area is very nice and spacious and has a luxurious feel.The rooms themselves are nice, ornate and old fashioned in their decor.. The bed was extremely comfortable, the bathroom was fair sized and there was a small balcony overlooking the fountain. The room service menu wasn't great for business travellers, after a long day at work you don't want partridge pasta or squid with ink sauce, just a healthy filling meal. A supposedly well done burger was more what I'd describe as rare, red throughout and at √à√\u2020√ü?4 a pop you can't afford to make mistakes! They ran out of chips at one point too which I find incredible in a hotel that size with 3(?) restaurants and it's not possible to get garlic bread to accompany pasta dishes. Mind you there are plenty of places you can eat nearby. The location is great, easy to walk to the shopping area, museums and main square. The rooms were well soundproofed so traffic noise wasn't a problem. This is a nice hotel but for the money I'd recommend staying in the Urban just up the road. It has all the advantages of location with much friendlier and more attentive staff.
