{"text":"absolute perfection! the komaneka resort is absolutely magic. my husband and i go to ubud every year and we stay in upscale places, and this choice was the best ever! it is right in town, yet when you go into the hotel and into your room, it is in privacy and seclusion. it overlooks the rice paddy field and it was a hollywood production, watching the workers in the field. the pool villas face this view and it is awesome.the first night we stayed in a normal room and it was total magic too. the tub was filled with fresh plumeria flowers and the bed was decorated in hearts and flowers too.the staff is so sweet and so helpful in every way. it is a real treat to be there! when we came home after some time out and about shopping, we did not want to leave again. we stayed in and had dinner outside under the stars! the food was the best too.we were looking and looking around on the internet, and making ourselves crazy with so many options, and i want to say, make it easy now on yourselves and look no further, this is it. it could never be better than this! the room and the villa was decorated in the finest taste and everything is pristine.we also stayed at their other hotel outside of ubud, less than 15 minutes away. it was also a dream! there was a car with their drivers that would take you in and out so easily! if you are really looking for seclusion and romance, stay here. it is wonderful.
