{"text":"Loved Royal Service!!! I stayed at the Melia Caribe with my fiance for 10 days in August. We had a Master Suite in the Royal Service part of the hotel. I fully recommend Royal Service ... not sure if I would stay in the regular part of the hotel.Royal Service is just amazing! Our room was massive, with a jacuzzi and two plasma flatscreens. The buffet breakfast and lunch at the Gaby Restaurant (the Royal Service restaurant) is wonderful and MUCH better than the buffets in the main part of the hotel. The food is better and fresher, with more selection. The Royal Service pool is a giant step above the regular pool, with private huts abound and a nice little pool grill whipping up fresh food whenever you want (they even have a soft serve ice cream machine that is addicting!). You get pillow service every night where you choose the material and scent of your pillows. Royal Service has room service included, main part does not. There is also a bath butler who will draw your jaccuzi for you, with a flavor of your choice, and decorate it with flower petals. There is free internet in the Royal VIP Lounge (although it was down a few days). There are Royal Service golf carts all over the place to drive you around the hotel. One of the most convenient aspects of Royal Service is that you pretty much get whatever restaurant you want for dinner. Regular guests have to call at 7 am, and try day after day to get in the better restaurants which are always full. I never had a problem getting any restuarant (including Hokkaido, the best restaurant that is VERY tough to get a reservation at for the other guests ... we met people who had been trying all week).Some restaurants are better than others. Our favorites by far were Hokkaido (Hibachi style Japanese) and Ma Maison (French). The American Grill is horrible - everybody we spoke to agreed. Stay away! La Gondola (Italian) is not very good either. Capri (Seafood) is pretty good. La Hacienda (Mexican) was so-so. We didn't do the other restuarants because we ended up going back to Hokkaido and Ma Maison multiple times each! Everything in the Gabi is great as well.My fiance enjoyed the spa and the prices were reasonable for a resort spa. The beach is so-so. The water is a nice temperature and the sand is white, but there is quite a lot of seaweed compared to other Caribbean or South Pacific beach vacation spots. We took a fishing trip booked through the Scuba Caribe guys that was quite cheap ($80 pp). We caught a bunch of Mahi Mahi and almost reeled in a White Marlin. Sailing is free and it is fairly windy so it is fun. Tennis courts are nice and they'll give you rackets and balls. Didn't play golf but heard the course was nice, just extremely difficult to play in the heat.We thankfully avoided any bad illness or stomach problems. I had a horrible bout of stomach issues that passed in less than a day so I guess I was lucky. It wasn't pleasant and some other people definitely were sick, so its something to keep in mind. My fiance had no problems and the vast majority of the people we met were fine.Bring down LOTS of sunscreen and some medicine as they jack up the prices big time. If you need to buy stuff, go to the Tropical store ... it is a lot cheaper than the Caribe store.The shows at night are horrendous. We would just have a few drinks at one of the lobby bars after dinner, maybe go to the casino, then call it an early night and wake up early for the next beautiful day!So all in all, we really liked the hotel. The grounds are beautiful and it is very relaxing. But we would hesitate to stay in the main part of the hotel because of the difficulty getting in the good restaurants, the pool is loud and crowded, the buffets are not that good and the staff's English is much worse (although still not great in Royal Service).Hope this is helpful!
