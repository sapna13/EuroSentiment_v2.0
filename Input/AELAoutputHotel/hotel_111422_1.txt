{"text":"The Doubletree didn't disappoint. For our first venture into Boston, my boyfriend and I chose the Doubletree Guest Suites because we loved the idea of being on the Charles Esplanade, and we figured it wasn't far from all the hot spots.We were sort of right. This Doubletree is closer to Harvard than anything else. Harvard's campus is beautiful, especially in the fall when we visited, but it's a pretty far walk to anything else in the area. If you're looking to experience the actual city of Boston, I'd recommend staying elsewhere.The best thing about this Doubletree, in my opinion, is the complimentary shuttle that goes to various points around Boston. A taxi isn't expensive by any means (we never paid more than $15 to get to and from downtown, Back Bay, and southie), but it's really nice to not have to drive (because Boston traffic was pretty terrible!).When we first checked in, the girl at the desk didn't really seem like she wanted to be there (and didn't care if WE were there, either). Other than this first forgettable encounter, the rest of the staff was really helpful with arranging reservations, taxis, etc. Lots of kudos to the concierge.The rooms are just beautiful - if you can get one with a view of the river, by all means do it! The beds are typical, wonderful Doubletree beds, and the bathrooms are pretty spacious. Absolutely no complains about the status of the room whatsoever.We didn't make it to the jazz club inside because we forgot to make advance reservations, and we overslept the breakfast buffet a couple times. The menus look intriguing though, so we'll probably get to them next time we're in town.It was a good stay overall. Not spectacular, but we would probably go back - as long as we're headed for Harvard.
