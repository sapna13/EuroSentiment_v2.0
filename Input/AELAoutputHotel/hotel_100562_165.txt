{"text":"nice room but hard bed We stayed here for a conference and it was very convenient to the convention center, plus all the tourist attractions in Seattle. The staff were generally gracious (the late-night clerk could have been a little nicer), but definitely ask for a room in the new tower b\/c the beds in the old tower are HARD! My colleague got lucky and managed to get a club level room on the 34th floor with a much softer bed, better robes, and a jacuzzi tub for the same price as what I was paying for my regular tub and hard-as-a-rock bed. This was especially interesting since I am a Starwood preferred guest (and she is not), and we checked in at the same time, yet she gets the upgrade instead of me? Umm, okaaay.....Also there was a screw-up at the front desk and they gave some random dude the key to my friend's room! The guy walked into her room while she was enjoying her Jacuzzi tub, and when she yelled Hello? he said sorry and left, but then continued to call the room looking for his wife! When we called the desk they apologized and brought new keys, but they didn't even offer a discount or anything. As women travelling alone we of course thought this was totally inexcusable, even though the manager explained that my friend's room had been originally booked as part of a suite, and the man who 'intruded' was the husband of the woman in the adjoining room. (Needless to say we will be writing to Sheraton-there is just no excuse good enough for that!) Also, don't pay for club-level, the extra price is not worth the 'lounge' and the pool is kinda yucky. If\/when I go back to Seattle I will stay at the Mayflower--we visited a friend there and the ambience was way cooler than the sort of generic feel of the Sheraton, plus the martini bar is FANTASTIC. The Sheraton wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't spectacular.
