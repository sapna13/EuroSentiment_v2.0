{"text":"The name is biger that the Hotel When I think about a Hotel named PARK PLAZA I think about Greatness, New York, something amazing. Well, not this time.If you read my other reviews you can see I'm not a very negative person and I always try to leave a positive feedback. I really tried with this hotel, but I could not.The Location is great. The check in is always very nice and the staff at the front Desk is friendly. Let me first say this is not the first time here. For work reasons I come here several time a year. Some of the rooms are Small, but any other Historic hotel in Boston will be the same. Many room are full of stains and they look not clean at all. They need big time renovation. The carpet is just disgusting. Last time , my Internet did not wok and I call to change the room or just for someone to fix it. I waited for more that 40 minutes until I called again. Whoever it was who awnser the phone was so rude. Finally some one came and give me the key to another room. Guess what!! The room was so bad. Smaller that the other one, and Internet did not work again. I was so upset, and I decided to fix it myself. I went under the table and re-connect the cables. Maybe the maids are not very careful when cleaning. Once again there were stains in my carpet and this time also the walls. I stay at many Boston Hotels, including the Hyatt, Omni Parker House, Embassy Suites, Double tree, Holiday Inn, Sheraton, and many others, but I have never experienced anything like that.I understand it is an old Hotel and really needs renovation, but if you add a rude staff to that it just make your stay very uncomfortable.I may try to convince my Company not to send us here anymore.
