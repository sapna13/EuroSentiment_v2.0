{"text":"Suprisingly Good! I have just returned from a long weekend in Barcelona and we stayed at the Fira. The hotel staff were very accomadating and polite. We got to the hotel before check in times, but they were happy to keep our luggage in a store room whilst we wondered around the area. There were three of us booked into one room, the rooms are very clean and spacious. The room we were in had two double beds and a sofa bed. But there is no need for the sofa bed as the double beds are big in size. the bathroom was clean with a shower unit and also a bath tub. The showers were good and the water pressure is high and the side jet pressure is a bonus.It is a bit out of the town centre but the hotel is less than 5 minutes from the main bus stops, metro and turistic bus stop. it takes 5-10 minutes to reach La Rambla on the Metro. The best way and cheaper way to come to the hotel from the airport is via the aerobus (3.50 euro) or the local bus 46 (1.25 euro). the first stop with the aerobus is Espanya, which is where the hotel is located. Overall the hotel was very nice, the staff were pleasent and the rooms and beds were good. If you want a bit out of the Ramblas then this is a good hotel to stay in. I will probably not stay here in the future as persoanlly i think staying up in Passage Garcia is a better choice. ","annotations":[]}
