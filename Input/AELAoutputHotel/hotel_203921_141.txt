{"text":"Charming Oasis in Bustling Florence We spent three nights at this cute, charming hotel located on a gated property. Everything about the hotel was excellent. We were given a good-sized room with a wonderful terrace. Though our room faced a very busy thoroughfare, the windows and shades (which are drawn electronically) insulated us from any street noise. We slept very comfortably. The air conditioning was excellent. The bathroom, very smartly decorated and immacuate, was a bit on the small side as it had limited places to put things. No big deal though. The shower was really excellent. Lots of constant hot water, good pressure from the shower head.The front desk service was truly extraordinary. Everyone was extremely friendly and exceedingly helpful. They made excellent restaurant recommendations near the hotel as well as in the downtown area. If you don't enjoy walking, but want to be near the Duomo, it is a bit of a hike from the hotel (maybe 40 minutes). This could be a problem if you want to go back and forth from the hotel. It's not that far to the Ponto Vecchio (about 20 minutes each way), but after a long day of walking, going back to the Duomo area for dinner can be daunting. A cab ride from Hotel David on a busy Saturday\/Sunday night can be 18+ euros one way. Fortunately there are a lot of good neighborhood restaurants that the hotel can recommend, many of which are located just down the street from the hotel or about a 5-7 block walk outside the old city walls. You can also take the city buses to and from the Duomo. Hotel gave instructions on how to do this.Overall, Hotel David is an excellent value. I highly recommend it and would most definitely stay there again. ","annotations":[]}
