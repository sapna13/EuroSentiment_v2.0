{"text":"inconsistent We just returned from a three night stay in Florence where we had two rooms at the Albergo Firenze. The one on the fourth floor was in the new section and large and modern and comfortable. The one on the second floor was not nearly as nice. Both rooms suffered from noise intrusion- sound bounces around the courtyards and closely spaced buildings and comes throught the poorly sealed windows, and lobby noise bounced up the stairs and down the hall and through thin doors on the second floor (that's third floor to us). Both rooms were spotlessly clean. One had a large shower with sliding glass doors, the other had the teeny shower base with curtains that stopped six inches off the floor- big flood- at least the floor has a drain. Knowing what to expect from a european breakfast, we were well pleased with the offerings and the staff couldn't have been nicer. Like everybody says, the location is great. We lucked out and got there during art week when everything was free admittance- the only down side was we pushed harder to see everything, so having a hotel so convenient to rest the dogs for a bit was the best. It was also quite warm during our stay (May 19-22) and there was no working air conditioning in either room . We could have opened a window, but the late night\/early morning partyers were too noisy to sleep through. Some of the desk attendants must have come from hostels, they had such a relaxed attitude about things, but they were nice and fairly helpful. Note of interest: because of a strike our flight out of Florence was cancelled and we had to catch a train to Bologna and a flight the next day. Bologna was a wonderful and beautiful surprise, we were actually glad things turned out that way. ","annotations":[]}
