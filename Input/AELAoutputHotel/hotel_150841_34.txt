{"text":"Bavaro excellence - September 28th, 2008 My husband and I recently returned from Staying at the Iberostar Bavaro. Two years ago we stayed at Riu Palace just down the beach and we had geat time and a friend recommended to stay at an Iberostar. I am so glad we followed her recommendation. Two weeks before we got there I emailed them and told them it was our anniversary and could we have a room close to the beach. Not only did we get a room right on the beach, but it was also right next to the pool. Room 2336. We couldn't have asked for a better location!Our room was beautiful. We found out how to turn down the air conditioning, the dial was hidden. Yes, it was a little bit musty, but everyone who has been to the Carribean knows this is very common. The only thing is I was disappointed in the tv channels. We had peacocks on our patio.The food at the buffet was great. There was a different main coarse each night and there was plenty of choices. The pickles were to die for! We had lobster on Friday night and it was unlimited. Felix, our waiter most the nights, always had my champagne ready for me. The Japaneze was very good. We canceled our Gourmet, but I wish we hadn't. Everyone said it was the best!The Broadway show at night was very good, the rest were just ok.The drinks were much larger than the Riu's, so you didn't have to ask for 2 at a time.I will go back to Iberostar again and I would recommend it to anyone who just wants a vacation to do nothing but relax. It was one of the best vacations we have been on. Now, the flight back was a different story! It took us 2 days to get home when it should have taken 6 hours.
