{"text":"Nice little getaway We stayed at the Tapatio Cliffs resort for one night after Christmas as a getaway from the family and it was very worthwhile overall. We called ahead to ask for and received an early check-in, which allowed us additional time to make use of some of the resorts' facilities. This was a very nice touch, since check-in is usually at 4 PM, which limits how much you can enjoy a place on a one-night stay.We thought the room was quite spacious and clean overall, with warm, yet modern decorative finishes. The bed was wonderful. There was only one vanity for the bathroom, which was located across a hallway from the water closet itself. The light switch for the water closet was on the outside wall, which was little awkward. The separate living room was fine, but the sofa was stiff and there was no coffee table to set a drink on. It would also have been helpful for the room to have a refrigerator separate from the mini-bar like some other resorts have been known to provide. (We'd heard mixed reviews about the Different Point of View Restaurant and decided instead to stay in with food  wine from the AJ's Fine Foods store located north of the resort at 7th St.  Thunderbird, which was an excellent store and turned out to be an excellent choice! No fridge meant meant creative use of the sink and ice bucket for our wine, cheese and sushi. Ce la vie!)Although it was in the 50s-low 60s the day we stayed at TC, we decided that it was still worth a trip to the water park\/ pool. (When you come from the 10s  20s, 50s  60s is quite a warm-up!) This area is pretty well removed from the vast majority of the guest rooms and almost needs to be driven to because of the lack of walks along most of the interior drives. The pool facilities were very nice and very welcomed and the Cascades bar was also good. There is a smaller pool\/ spa\/ workout room in the center of the main guest room area, though it looked largely closed while we were there.One area I would caution guests to was the Point in Tyme restaurant, which is located near the main pool area. We went for breakfast before checking out and it was a disaster. The service was abysmal and the food neither worth the wait or the price (45 minutes and $13 for huevos rancheros!). This was noteworthy because it was definitely not high season when we were there, so I can only imagine what a treat it is in peak times.Overall, I would recommend a stay at Tapatio Cliffs. My wife and I would definitely have stayed another night if our schedule would have allowed and hope to get back for another stay the next time we're in Phoenix. I should note that the resort is in the final stages of a renovation project, which currently has the main lobby gutted and moved to temporary quarters elsewhere in the main building. Some of the parking around the main building was torn up or used as staging, but it wasn't a big deal overall and I wouldn't let it dissuade you from staying at the TC.
