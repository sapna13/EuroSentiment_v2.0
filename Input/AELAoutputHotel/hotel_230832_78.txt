{"text":"Great hotel in great location For the price and the location, this hotel is great value considering some of the hotels you could end up in near the Ramblas but I would advise booking on the NH Hotels website for a good rate. The room wasn't huge but you had plenty of room, which was my initial worry when I booked as we were staying here for a week. I didn't have a problem with the staff at all, one of the receptionists even booked a restaurant for us one night and the rooms were very clean and well maintained. You can't fault the location either; at the end of the street is one of the main shopping streets in Barcelona. A 2 minute walk in one direction takes you to The Ramblas, in the other direction it takes you to the Cathedral and 5 - 10 minutes walk is the up and coming Born district which has lots of nice boutiques and restaurants too. One of the major finds was the Barcelona guide book supplied in each room of the hotel. We managed to eat VERY well thanks to this book and I would really recommend a glance if only to avoid all the over priced places in The Ramblas. Well worth a try is the restaurant VISIT which is in the Pulitzer hotel c\/Bergara just off of Plaza Catalunya - everything about this restaurant was excellent! Also there are a couple of great restaurants along the seafront by Port Olympic such as Shoko  Bestial  they are only a 5 minute taxi ride (√à√\u2020√ü?) from the bottom of The Ramblas.Barcelona is a great city, it was my 3rd visit here and I still love it - don't let talk of pickpockets put you off. That can happen in any city!
