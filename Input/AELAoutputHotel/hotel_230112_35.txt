{"text":"great food My girlfriend and i booked the hotel on expedia based on the hotels website and other reviews on this site. It was as i was expecting in terms of location and rooms. yes they are small but one look at the outside of the building and you can see why, the old design has left very little room for large rooms without changing the entire lhotel . they were actually fine for what we wanted; clean, comfortable, bright and quiet. despite the fanatstic location on the dam the rooms were silent unless you opened the windows.our room was on the second floor facing the department store on the corner of the dam-tip=a great place for lunch or breakfast is the stores own cafe on the 4th floor which overlooks the hotel-our room had a small balcony with full size patio doors which was great to look out over the crowds and take in the sights and sounds (and smells) of Amsterdam. the airconditioning was a great help too as it was quite humid at night when we were there. the shower room is also small and quite dated in style but there was a notice in the reception saying they were updating these so that is not a long term problem. the restaurant was fantastic-we ate here on the first and last night of our stay. the food was so much better than you could imagine for the cost- a two course with drinks cost us 65 euro total-and believe me for this food and service quality you would be way over 100 GBP for anything close. mixed in with the very welcoming staff who were polite, friendly and helpful at all times,( we arrived at around 9 am and expected to just leave our bags with the hotel till check in, the receptionist first checked to see if we could get a room there and then and as one was ready we were able to check in straight away, by the time we had confirmed our details and reached our room the bags were already in and we could start our holiday by 9.30 am!) -the whole experince was a very good one and would recommend this hotel.A couple tips for Amsterdam-use the train to and from the airport-fast, clean, and cheap-for the Ann Frankhuis go early or late as groups of school kids during the day can make for long queuesFor rainy days-visit the heineken experience-free drink and gift included in the entry fee of just 11 euros-also worth a view is the Amsterdam dungeon and madame tussaud.
