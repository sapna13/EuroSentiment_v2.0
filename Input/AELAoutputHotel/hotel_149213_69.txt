{"text":"Wonderful Beach Front Just returned early this morning through SunWing. Left April 13th returning April 20th 2007Had a good time at the Barcelo resort. Would definitely go back. $ in US dollarsResortIncluded 5 HotelsBeach, Caribe, Golf, Casino, and the Palace (premium)Guests of the Beach, Caribe, Golf, and Casino can visit each others buffets and restaurant. Need to pay extra if eating at the Palace's restaurants. I walked everywhere, the landscaping was just amazing.There is a shuttle that looks like a train (I think 3 or 4) that is continuously running through out the day.I would say the average time to walk from one hotel area to the other is about 8-10 minutes depending on how fast you walk.The shops are expensive. Bring everything in your check in luggage if possible. For example. lip balm is 6 bucks at the beach store and 9$ at the resort store. And it was 7$ for a bag of chips, 5$ for a chocolate bar.The nightly shows were good, the usual make fun of the tourist shows. There was a big show every night that started at 10:30pm at the Casino hotel, I did not attend this show. High speed internet was available at the front lobbies of the hotels. 15 min for 3$, 30 min for 5$ and 60 min for 8$BuffetI ate at the buffets the whole week.Food was average.Breakfast rarely changed, the usual, bacon, eggs, toast, some form of potato, fried banana, cereal. Good variety of bread products. You can have a freshly made omelet made for you.Lunch and dinner usually included some variations of fish, pork, beef, and some kind of poultry. A pasta bar is also available. Good selection of fresh produce and dessert.There was a Grill that served pizza and hot dogs from 12 noon to midnight. The menu included a price but the pizza and hot were included in All Inclusive. Beach 3 km of powder sand Kept cleanLots of activities to keep busy withWater is beautiful when the sun is shining.You can walk to other resorts along the beach. There are shops in one area of the beach where you can barter for your trinkets.The animation team were kept busy during the day. There are photographers running around on the resort.Plenty of chairs available, no need to get up early to pick your spot.As well, plenty of trees to provide shade. If you want peace and quiet then stay away from the beach front area in front of the main lobby. Most of the activities happen in this area. WeatherFirst 1\/2 of the week was sunny and very hot.Probably averaged 105 F with the humidity.The second 1\/2 half of the week was okay. We had spots of scattered showers that didn't last too long. Room in Block 2 Room was standard, starting to show it's age along the ceilingSmall ants would pop up time to time in the bathroom area, but no big deal.Mini-bar was kept full.Room was cleaned everyday.20 US for extra TV stations for the week or I think 5 US a day.Safe in room, digital. you create password on first use.Bathroom include all the necessities. eg. shampoo, conditioner, hair dryer, An iron appeared on the 4th day of my stay. I left tips for the cleaning staff each day along with a gift from the dollar store. CasinoOpen 24 hours. It wasn't busy at the times that I went. I actually left with 75$ that I won on the slot machines.I hope this helps you out when choosing your resort in Punta Cana. I chose the Barcelo because of the activities and because of it's size.
