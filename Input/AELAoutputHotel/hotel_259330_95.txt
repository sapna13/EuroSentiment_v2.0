{"text":"The best resort thus far... Me and a friend who i haven't seen in 20 Years decided at the last minute to stay at this resort,,,We were treated like Royalty.We arrived from the Airport, came to the front desk passed the guy 40.00 for the safe key for 2 weeks, and gave him another 500 pesos(15.00) tip, this secured any problems we might endure during our stay, we had a couple with lost cards and were put to the front of the line when this would happen. Get 2 cards when you are staying in the room by yourself, 1 for the Room and the other put into the slot for the AC,,,tip the cleaning staff (100 peso's about 3.50), and she will leave the key in the AC slot, and the room will stay cool the whole day. Remember to take Showers at night because the majority of the guests take it in the morning(cold water we take for granted, down there don't , it doesn't last long) Remember to bring shaving cream, razors, toothpaste, antacids, ect....the Lobby stre is expensive and if you need something they don't have ,,,they call the store in town and you pay for delivery, (it cost me 40 american to deliver 50 antacid tablets).You want Royal service beyond the usual drink and food item,,,Tip the staff that services you the most,,,,We tipped the Cooks in the Buffet and Fish restaurants, we tipped the the bartenders and servers, We tipped alot of people,,,,the reason became evident when we were given special treatment, from the start,,,we were going to go to the fish restaurant, but they came to us at that beach bar, Shimp, Lobster, champange, red table cloth, a friend of ours was leaving on the last day, and he wanted to get something to eat before the plane, the buffet would open in 2 hours for dinner, but we told the chef and he made lunch for him while everybody was still eating Breakfast,,,,,On the last day we were there we had a meal of anything we wanted,,,,oh and we didn't eat in any of the restaurants , used no vochers, and they came to our bar table and asked what we would like for Lunch, Dinner , and Late night,,,The Bartenders were Great, no complaints,,,Fresh Banana Mamas, Blended in a blender, fresh fruit, and no ice for us, wicked,,,,Maria, Sandy, and Benardo Pie Rock.It was a great time and it only happens once a year for me for 2 weeks, and my friend gets 3 weeks a year,,,,,and now for the question that you want to know......How much for the Tips?Here goes.....Bartenders about 500 pesos a day each(1000 a day( 40.00), Cooks (about 750 aday each), all in all about 50000 pesos(1500 dollars), we did't care because it is 2 weeks of relaxing and never having to dress up for dinner, we loved them for that and we will go back in a heartbeat,,,,Oh and if you have kids your taking down, the beaches have women with no tops at times,,,,just to give you a heads up...Have fun and Peace out ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2193,"mention":"Pie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pie"],"startOffset":2190},{"endOffset":2198,"mention":"Rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":2194}]}
