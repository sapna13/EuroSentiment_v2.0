{"text":"Good value hotel We have just returned from a week's stay at the Adagio hotel and just wanted to say this was a great find in a great location. No, it wasn't luxurious or anything but provided good value accomodation in the heart of this busy area.All the staff (reception, cleaning staff, breakfast staff) were friendly and helpful. Rooms were basic but adequate, the double glazing helped tremdously on cutting down the noise. The area is noisy so don't expect a great night's sleep, but lets remember it is a city and the area is popular for bars and eating places.Ask about the safe (not in room) at reception, the secure boxes are in a secure room and can be used for 3 euro per day.The breakfast was a buffet which offered meats, cheese, bread rolls and cereal, a machine provided the coffee (which was a little disappointing) and also water and juice. All fine with us and kept us fed and watered easily up till lunch and sometimes till evening.The rooms have a balcony (ours looked out over a side street, I notice some reviews say this is a problem, we didnt find this at all and in fact it meant it was a slightly quieter room than being on the main street)In terms of area you are right by a metro line (great to hop on and off, especially with a ten trip pass), you are near to La Rambla (great for wandering, keep tight hold of your bag though), but for me the best thing was how close we were to the Gothic quarter and all the sights that bringsAll in all we had a great week in a busy bustling city (that got very hot while we were there). This hotel for me was a great find, cheap(ish), great location and provided a useful base for all our jaunts around this great city.
