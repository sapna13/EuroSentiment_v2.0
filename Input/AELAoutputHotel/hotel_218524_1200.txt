{"text":"A very nice resort We travelled from March 24-31. I got great value out of reading other reviews posted on this site so I thought I'd better do the same. Just the facts:Resort-Immaculate. The staff are constantly working to upgrade the place and keep it clean. They we also very repectful of the guests when they were doing any work arounfdthe pool. They actually surround themselves with a wood work area to keep the debris and noise down for the guests.Service- With few exceptions very good. The staff work extremely long hours (same server at breakfast was at the show at 11pm the same night) and in the heat all day so given time I wouldn't move at top speed either.Food- Good. Favourite restuarants were the Lobster House and Chez Isabelle although we didn't have a bad meal anywhere we went. I got sick for one day but was pretty adventurous with trying some of the local fare so that might have had something to do with it. My wife was fine. Great buffet breakfast eveyday including fruit smoothies and omlettes. Food is also served by the pool by the staff at the lunch hour. Hot dogs, hamburgers, pizza (delicious) and nachos if you didn't want to leave the pool to go one of the resturants.Maid service- Excellent. Twice daily which was nice since we often need towels in the evening to clean up for dinner.Mini Bar service- We were Excellence Club members and this wasa nice surprise. Mini bar included V8, Red Bull, Gatorade, Water, Pop, Bud, Bud Light and two kinds of the local beer Presidente. Also you would get the odd chocolate bar thrown in. This was refreshed everyday. If there was some things you would like more of we just left a note and a couple greenbacks and it was accomodated everytime.Tipping- No expected at all but very much appreciated. Made no difference in the level of service we experienced.Rooms- Everything was fine. We requested an upper floor room but was given a swim up room. We were right next store to the Excellence Club lounge which was nice (Room 10001) to duck in to use the computers or an afternoon snack. We paid for Ocean View which it was but you really can't see much from the first floor because of the trees and pool cabanas etc. Still a nice room and very close to the pool to access the room throughout the day.Entertainment- Not my thing and from what I saw they were OK.Recommendations:Pay the extra for the Excellence Club, particularily if you have a late check out. The extra perks and better situated rooms are and we didn't leave the resort until 5:30pm. We were able to stay in our room until we left for no extra charge ($10 per hour otherwise). The private concierge was also nice.Good game of beach volleyball everyday at 11am.The self serve soft serve ice cream by the Kafe Bar. A nice afternoon snack. We didn't discover this until 3 days before we left.NotablesYou are a long way from everywhere at this resort so we opted out of any excursions. Too much travel time takes away time from the magnificent resort.There was some concern over the surf before we left. Not an issue. Use common sense and you'll be fine. Calmer areas of the ocean can be found just off the resort property. The staff also keep a close eye to anyone in the water.Enjoy. We would go back for some R  R anytime.
