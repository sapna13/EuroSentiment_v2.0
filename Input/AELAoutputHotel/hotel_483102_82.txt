{"text":"Excellent stay! I was a little concerned after reading some of the reviews here but decided to take a gamble and booked anyway. It was a good thing I took this gamble - the H10 was great! Yes, rooms are not as big as similar-class hotels in Las Vegas or California but they are not smaller than those in the UK and definitely larger than those in Amsterdam, Paris. Just remember to ask for a high floor (I requested for 6th floor and above) and ask for the rooms facing the main street as rooms in the inner core of the hotel (I think, rooms 4, 5, 9, 10) are small. Nevertheless, the furnishing was good, beds were comfortable, bathrooms were welcoming and the street views from the balcony are great. The hotel staff spoke reasonably good English, albeit with a strong Spanish accent and were very friendly - they even took pains to call, re-call, confirm, double-confirm my flights back to London (this was during the heavy fog and most flights were cancelled). They arranged for me and my friends to have adjourning rooms even though we didnt book for it and even gave me a discount on the spot! I will head back there again. A piece of (unrelated) advice - the H10 Universitat is in a good location being 5min from Las Ramblas, the Aerobus stop, restaurants and the FC Barca shop.. Their sister hotels, in my opinion are either too far from Las Ramblas or right smack in the centre of it, with the endless crowds. Think I shall stop writing now cos I am sounding like a H10 advertisement. =) ","annotations":[]}
