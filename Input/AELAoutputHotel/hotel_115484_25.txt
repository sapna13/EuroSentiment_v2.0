{"text":"A great setting, great architecture, failing on some details The hotel's claim to fame is its√à√\u2020\u2022?architecture, being done in the prairie style of Frank Lloyd Wright, and the hotel remains true to that vision. If you like Wright's work (and I do) there is plenty of eye candy for you to look atCheck in: Easy, went well, no issueParking: We used the valet...tho they did charge $25\/day for parking which I thought was rough.Food Bar: I did not eat at the hotel. The bar was good, staff friendly and of course, the drinks were overpriced.Room: Neat, well kept, clean, and remained true to the theme of the the hotel. I also liked the showers.Now for the complaint; the resort has several pools...the main pool was, in a word, filthy. The water was so cloudy that one could not see the bottom of the pool. There were several contributing factors to this. First, it had rained, and I was told by the hotel staff, rain water tends to overwhelm the pool's sanitation system. Secondly, there is a swim up bar which serves food, not a great idea if you want to keep your pool clean, and finally, the pool was really crowded.Aside from the cloudy water, I noted some refuse in the pool as well.Aside from the pool problem (which I am sure could be fixed with a little attention) the place is great. Good setting, nice staff, etc.Oh! One more thing, the concierge service was fantastic; helpful, nice people who really seemed to care.
