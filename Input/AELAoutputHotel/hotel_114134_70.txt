{"text":"An Exceptional Hotel - We Will Definitely Be Back My mom and I stayed at the Lenox for a long weekend. We were amazed by this place. We used to travel all over with my dad's company, staying in some very high-end hotels. The Lenox, with its incredibly personalized and attentive service, stands out as one of the most memorable hotels we have ever experienced.The staff went above and beyond to make sure my mom and I had a wonderful stay. Everyone was exceedingly professional and friendly. My mom and I love to try non-touristy local restaurants. We called the concierge a few weeks before our trip and she made excellent recommendations for all of our meals. She even made all of the reservations and we found ourselves at the best tables.The hotel itself is a historic property that has been impressively updated. It feels both classic and sleek. Our room, with two comfortable queen beds, was spacious and very clean. The bathroom contained products by Aveda. The hotel is quiet. We never heard any noise from neighboring rooms, the hallway or from the street. The hotel's location is perfect, with easy access to the Copley Square train station. If you like to shop, Newbury Street is just a block away. It is also very close to the Convention Center and the Prudential building. Boston is really not that big; we walked from the Italian North End through Boston Common to the hotel in just about a half an hour. We highly recommed this hotel and definitely plan to go back.
