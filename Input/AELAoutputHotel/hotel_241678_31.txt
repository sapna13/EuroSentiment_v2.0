{"text":"Good hotel, nice location and great price! I agree with the previous review. The rooms were spacious and clean and service was prompt and professional. Our rooms on the 24th floor had fantastic views of the city. We found an online deal for about US$80+tax\/for a room with two beds. We stayed there August 8-14, 2007.Everyone at the reception and concierge spoke excellent English - and every employee made a good effort to communicate with us. The hotel is in a great location for seeing all the downtown\/Zocalo sights - I agree, walk, don't cab to the Zocalo.I had a fantastic hot-stone massage at the spa and would highly recommend it (note: the workers in the gym\/spa spoke limited or no English). The gym and steam room are great too - check if usage is included in your reservation (you may need a Starwood membership); there's a 115 peso charge (check rates in advance, I might be wrong on the exact price) for a day's use.Breakfast in the restaurant at the lobby was very nice but over priced compared to local places - and it was always packed so you'll need reservations (they'll offer coffee and pastries while you wait). The coffee was mediocre, food ok. Their hot chocolate however is in a league of its own with special spices! My friend had an omelette with ant eggs and raved about it. Compared to other food I ate in the city, my squash blossom omelette with green chile was rather bland - surprising in a country with so many strong and tasty flavors. It's clearly 'a place to be seen' in Mexico City. Avoid the second floor restaurant of the Sheraton (Los Dones?) which is open from 7-11; it's a tourist trap and over priced (international cuisine) - but if like us you're tired and just want a quick meal, it's convenient - and service was impeccable.Try the food court next door for a quick bite (they have a Starbucks if you want something familiar, although personally I like to go-local for a cheaper and more typical coffee). There's also an HCSB branch and ATM there.A secure taxi to the hotel from the airport costs 127 pesos (around US$12), however, a taxi from the hotel to the airport costs 240 pesos. Since it's not advisable to order a cab from the street, you basically have no other option. Taking taxis from the hotel is expensive but you never have to wait for one, and they guarantee you're safe. (This is typical to all hotels in the city). Don't be affraid to take the metro\/subway - it may seem overwhelming at first, but it's dirt cheap, very fast and safe (watch out for pick pocketers). Do not however use it after dark - while the subway is safe, the streets may not be, especially if you're out on your own in the dark - use it only during day light hours. (Most museums and sights close around 5-6pm.)We couldn't try the pool as it was closed.General comment: If you're a smoker you'll love Mexico City. If not, check in advance for outdoor or non-smoking sections when making restaurant reservations.
