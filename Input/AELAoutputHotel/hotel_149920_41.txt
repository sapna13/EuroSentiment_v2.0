{"text":"Gorgeous Resort Hotel The San Juan Marriott is a beautiful resort hotel in the Condado section of San Juan. It has a stunning bi-level pool and direct access to a broad public beach. Our room was large, clean, and comfortable, and had a widescreen LCD TV -- as well as a wonderful broad shower head with dozens of tiny holes for a wide spread . We had a full view of the pool area and a partial view of the ocean. The hotel staff were all extremely courteous and helpful, and we kept them hopping with many requests, such as for additional towels and glasses.There were 2 minor problems with the room: a burned-out light bulb in one of the lamps -- replaced within 5 minutes after we called to complain -- and a noisy air conditioner vent. We considered moving to another room, but by the second day we were used to the noise and didn't notice it anymore.The hotel has 2 restaurants: La Vista, a casual cafe; and Tuscany, a high-end Italian restaurant. There are several excellent restaurants within an easy walk of the Marriott, and numerous dining choices in OSJ. Food in San Juan tends to be expensive, but it's almost always cheaper to dine outside of the hotel. For a quick, inexpensive breakfast, there's a coffee bar in the hotel lobby, and a Starbucks directly across the street.The bus to Old San Juan stops at the end of the block that the Marriott is on, and takes about 20 minutes to reach Old SJ. The usual bus fare is 75 cents, but all buses were free when we were there. Buses stop running at 10 PM, and a taxi back from OSJ to the Marriott costs about $15.All in all, I would recommend the SJ Marriott - Stellaris to anyone.
