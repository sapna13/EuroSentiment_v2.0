{"text":"Stay Away from Gran Melia Puerto Rico I stayed at the Gran Melia Puerto Rico from June 26 - July 1, 2007 as part of a convention and I was in the overflow hotel since the rest of the attendees were primarily at the Rio Mar (I WISH I COULD HAVE STAYED THERE!). You need a rental car as the resort is remote, and I rented from Budget. $10.70 to park at the resort. they had a local PR group of 600 from ECONO Supermarket that took over the whole hotel - NOISY AND I COULDNT FIND PARKING. Food is overpriced and I ate breakfast buffet at 23 bucks daily but I HAD IT FREE because it came with my room. I ate dinner once at the Toscano and it was COLD, NO SERVICE. My room at check-in was not ready at 3pm and it took 40 minutes to check me in when it was ready at 3:30pm. NO BEACH AT THIS RESORT. I went to the beach at the Rio Mar and it was GREAT! The hotel staff here at the desk is slow and couldn't answer questions. The hotel operator couldn't tell me how to get from the Budget car rental to the hotel and when she transfered me to the concierge, the phone rang and rang and I hung up out of frustration. Budget Car Rental saved the day and told me how to get there. I ate at Don Pepe's which is close to the Rio Mar and was good. I took my own tour of the Rain Forest (YOU NEED YOUR CAR OR HOTEL CHARGES A FORTUNE TO DRIVE YOU TEHRE). I went to Old San Juan with my car and it was easy. I am from Los Angeles and the drivers in PR are just as nuts so HAY NO PROBLEMA for me to drive. TINY ANTS INFESTED MY LUGGAGE AND ARE IN THE WALLS OF THE VILLA ROOMS. I WAS GIVEN RAID TO FEND THEM OFF - MOTH BALL YOUR LUGGAGE WHEN YOU GET HOME TO GET RIDE OF THESE FLEA SIZED NON-BITING ANTS.
