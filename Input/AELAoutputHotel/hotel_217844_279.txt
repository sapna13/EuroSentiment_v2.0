{"text":"Excellent location; a few quibbles Travelling with a teenage daughter taking college tours, this was our splurge hotel. She had never been to SF and I was returning after 20 years. The location is absolutely the best and must be figured in with every other deciding factor. We had a wonderful time, easily walking from the hotel through Chinatown, North End (Italian) and then finishing up at and immediately turning back from the touristy Wharf. It was interesting, almost disheartening, for her to see that there are repeat performances at all tourists areas throughout the world (d.j.s, fast painting, same restauraunt chains, same hustle) and that it is important to find the unique aspects (sourdough bread) in each city. SO, back to the hotel. We arrived with a rental car which we eventually returned early . Parking was a total drag. The hotel admonished us to watch out for towing, asking us to remember to fill the meters up until after ticket time, etc. and always segued by encouraging us to use their extremeley expensive valet service. Well, this can be taken both ways I expect and they were just trying to (in my most optimistic mood) keep us from getting towed, but I do live in a major city, know how to read meters and so on. Bottom line is a happy one: you don't really need a car if you are staying in SF! We actually drove to and from Santa Clara, returned the car to the airport, took the BART train back in to town and used BART again to get back to the airport. Further to the hotel, as promised..The bed was remarkably comfortable. We had no view but it did not matter. Daughter liked the Aveda products. Our tub did not drain well (7th floor) and water was nigh calf high after the two of us took back to back and not excessively long showers. Admittedly, I neglected to mention this until our last day, however this issue is rarely encountered at even the most budget oriented hotels. I was not able get online (directed to an 800 number for which I had not the energy to deal) so instead used the very accessibly computer right at the reception desk. Was able to print out boarding passes, quickly check email, etc. We were too tired to use the movies, but it was a nice idea.As to breakfast, and having read the earlier reviews, I really cannot imagine what else on earth one could want unless it is total table service with warm food being served by request. No, there is no Devonshire cream, made to order pancakes, soft boiled eggs on toast crusts. Isn't that the not included breakfast concept where we get to order a specific breakfast? We were thrilled with the choices: fresh (not sugared!) yogurt, fresh fruit (lots of it ) toast, and so on. There were numerous choices, in our opinion. We even took some bananas and apples for the road when on our way back. I am not a business traveller for this review, however, if the getting online in room problem could be fixed, I would highly recommend this hotel for that purpose.
