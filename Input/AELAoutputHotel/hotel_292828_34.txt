{"text":"Form defeats function We have gone to Barcelona during one of the biggest conferences in the city, so we were pleased to be able to get a room. But for the amount the hotel is charging one would expect everything to work and for the service to be well-nigh perfect. The so-called advanced audio system never worked, nor was fixed while we were there; the lighting system was an ordeal to figure out and the shower a near disaster. To design a shower head that can only be adjusted by the water-pressure, invites regular flooding of the bathroom at every shower. What difference does it makes to have lovely bath-salts, candles and etc. if they are dissolve in water all the time? Then the 'best' that happened with us at any hotel room so far - one night my wife just closed the bathroom door, when the WHOLE FALSE CEILING IN THE ENTRY HALL FALLEN OFF! Sounded like a rocket boom, but no one seemed to care. I called the desk - the chap, who was there all by himself lumbered himself up, looked at it, said not the best design, I think, then said that he cannot fix it, we'll have maintenance fix it in the morning which they did. All through this and even upon leaving the hotel, not one soul could be bothered to say even as much as a simple 'sorry'. Also, be very careful of the free internet service: when we were there the machine had a trojan; a couple of sites I was working with was attacked after I logged off. A couple of pluses though: the cleanliness is exemplary, the breakfast food and service staff are excellent and the AskMe people are great, knowledgeable and helpful. But overall, for the price, you will find better value elsewhere. ","annotations":[]}
