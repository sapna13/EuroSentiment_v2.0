{"text":"Excellent Hotel We booked about 5 months earlier but it was worth it because we got a very good deal. I had been looking for hotels in Amsterdam for literally years but had been put off by the expense. The Radisson's prices seemed to be a little cheaper than other 4-5 star hotels in Amsterdam.We stayed over Easter this time. I am not sure but I think we may have been upgraded to a nicer room since the price quoted in our room for price per night was far more expensive than the rate we actually paid when we checked out\/on our online booking form. We had also requested a room on a high floor with a good view and we got both.Staff gave us a very warm welcome. The room was lovely, really nicely furnished, big TV with plenty of channels, good storage, nice modern, marble bathroom with good hot powerful shower and lots of nice toiletries. The room was not huge but big enough for us. There were free little chocolate eggs in bowls scattered round the reception area which my boyfriend enjoyed helping himself too. The bar in the lobby area looked nice although we didn't have time to stop there and the lobby looked very impressive with a water feature and two computers offering free internet access. One computer was not working during our stay but there was not a big queue. There is also free wifi in all rooms.We did not eat at the hotel restaurant or have breakfast there (24 Euros seemed a little steep) but there are plenty of small cafes within a minute or two's walk from the hotel which do really nice breakfasts for a fraction of the price.The location is amazing. Right in the centre and just round the corner from the red light district although this is not obvious at all unless you walk from there. It is also far enough from it to not see it at all unless you want to go looking for it or get lost. The area surrounding the hotel is not at all sleazy. There are plenty of amazing pubs within walking distance of the hotel and it is bang in the centre of all the main sites. The hotel was busy but it never felt overrun with tourists and staff were always friendly.
