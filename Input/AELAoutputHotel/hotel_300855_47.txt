{"text":"Lovely - (and a pink Xmas Tree as well !!) Stopped off at this hotel for 3 nights en route to Australia. Was recommended by our travel agent and a good value deal to boot.We stayed in an Executive floor room. Theseoccupy the top 2 floors of the hotel. Separate check-in desk at Reception followed an individual guided tour of facilities by a member of staff dressed in traditional Singapore dress. Nice touch ! Breakfast served in an exclusive room on the floor itself. Also evening drinks and snacks served between 5pm to 8pm. Light refeshments available at any time of day up to 10pm.Rooms were spacious with lovely amenities. Large LCD TV and usual branded toiletries in a well laid out bathroom.Free internet access also available in the Exec lounge to catch up on home news, check-in for next flight and so on.The hotel is situated directly opposite the Convention Centre whcih hosts all sorts of exhibitions. Flower show and a Sony exhibiton were on when we were there. Also within the Centre is the Hippo Bus Tour terminus. The daily tourist bus that gides you round the city. Great value for a ticket that lasts for 48 hours. Interconnected to the Centre and the Hotel is a huge shopping complex with every type of shop imginable. It also leads into Singapore's unique underground warren of tunnels between buildings. Great to get out of the humid atmosphere outside.For first time visitors (as we were), the hotel is also only a 5-10 minute walk from Raffles Hotel. An absolute 'must visit' to sample the delights of the original birth place of the Singapore Sling in the Long Bar. These poor guys that work there have the patience of saints with all the questions they are asked about the drink but they do it with courteousness and a smile on their face. An experience not to be missed.
