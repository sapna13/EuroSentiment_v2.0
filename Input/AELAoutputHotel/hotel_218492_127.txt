{"text":"an awesome vacation - loved it there First of all don't believe all the negative reviews you read. we just got back from a fantastic 1 week trip and loved our time there. We went from April 8th -15th. First all the beach is absolutely beautiful. The water is warm and clear and the sand is white. You will always find a place to lounge in at the beach. Our favorite place to lounge at though was the adult pool. If you are lucky enough to have Nico as your bartender then you will be in for a treat. Our favorite drink was the Chocolate Monkey and he truly makes it good, we had everyone in the pool drinking it at 10AM to start the day! We never had any problems with the food, we always found something to eat and everyday it was a different theme night at the Windows buffet. The service is good and fast and you can always find a place to sit down. We always had the same waiters and they automatically know what you want to drink and have it at your table before you sit down! That is service with a smile. We were in building 5 and it was close to everything, the beach, the pool and of course the buffet restaurants. The rooms were comfortable and Rosa our maid was awesome. She would always put flowers in our room and make sure our room was very clean. We had an amazing time, I would gladly go back in a heartbeat. Remember to tip when you are down there, its not expected but I know its truly appreciated by all whom work there. We are planning our next trip down there for the fall. We made wonderful friends from all over and our one week went by way too fast. Don't believe the negative talk you hear about the resort. If you go with an open mind you will enjoy yourself. Remember its not the Ritz so don't compare it to that or even go expecting that! Would I recommend this resort to my friends, absolutely I already have!
