{"text":"Bahia Principe Rocks !!! Hi Everyone, I first have to say to all the naysayers, blah and sppshhsspp. The Bahia Principe was wonderful. Upon arriving we discovered there is a gold and diamond club. Ceaserino, you rock, after a small request and innocent looks, got us into the gold club, in a great room, by the beach, We did pay the differance. The location really did not matter as they have a real cool transport system. Never waited more than a couple of minutes to go anywhere. Getting your paperwork and keys on the bus is terrific, no wasting time at the counter waiting in line. We got there, tagged our bags and went to the beach. When we did get around to going to our rooms, our bags were there, too easy. The rooms are okay, large and comfortable ( Although I like the Iberostar Bavaro rooms better, differant layout) I liked having the HBO movie channel, as we like to settle in around ten or so, it is nice to watch some cool movies, Although the spanish channels are just hilarious to watch. The food, yummm, and I mean yumm. I am a Canadian from Alberta, the beef capital of the world (true LOL), and the steack house just blew me away, japanese mmmmm, italian mmmmm get the idea Ha Ha. The staff, all I can say is the staff rocks, they remember your names from previous visits, this is remarkable as there are literally thousands of visiters. The pools especially the gold and diamond ones are great alternatives to the really big pool. We found the management rocks, and all the staff was cool. We are learning Spanish and tried hard to speak in spanish to all the staff, sometimes is was just hilarious. Thank you to all of the staff that so very patient with us. So, in conclusion the Bahia Principe ROCKS !!! For all you people who find things wrong, lighten up, you are on vacation. Have fun. We are going again in March for two weeks and looking forward to FUN FUN FUN in the SUN SUN SUN WAHOO!!!FUN CANADIAN COUPLE ","annotations":[{"endOffset":195,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":191},{"endOffset":216,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":212},{"endOffset":216,"mention":"rock","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Rock_candy"],"startOffset":212},{"endOffset":285,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":281},{"endOffset":285,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":281},{"endOffset":1055,"mention":"Canadian","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Molson_Canadian","http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Canadian_Club"],"startOffset":1047}]}
