{"text":"Better than expected Went to Frankfurt over the Christmas holiday with my family. Before booking, I was between the Hilton, Westin or Intercontinental. I went with the Hilton based on TripAdvisor reviews. I must say I am very pleased with how things worked out.The location of the hotel is great. Easy walking distance to plenty of shopping and food, and easy access to the train system. We took the train to the airport for our return trip, and it was very simple. Took about 30 mins, and only cost about 5 euro (vs 30-35 euro for a taxi).The hotel itself is very nice. I found the rooms to be bigger than most in Europe, and the bathrooms are far above average. Very large with a separate glass shower and whirlpool tub. Everything in the hotel was very clean and well kept.The staff at the hotel was OUTSTANDING. The front desk service (ask for Jennifer if you can find her) was as helpful as we could have asked. They helped arrange day trips, train schedules, and dining options. All of their choices were on the spot. I can honestly say you would be hard pressed to find a more helpful staff than what we experienced at this hotel. Few negatives: Everything you eat or drink in the hotel is EXTREMELY expensive. Think like 5 euro for a Coke, 29 euro for bacon, eggs and toast. My advice is just go out. So many places that are so close. Also, as you may have previously read, internet access is very expensive. Use it sparingly. All in all, this hotel was great. Check on the big sites, as they have pretty good rates available (under $150). I will definitely stay there again when I am in Frankfurt, and will recommend it to all my friends and family.
