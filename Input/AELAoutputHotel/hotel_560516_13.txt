{"text":"Far from 5 star We spent the week of 5\/31 thru 6\/7\/08 at the Cayena Beach Club, the timeshare portion of LTI Resort. All amenities to LTI are open to Cayena vacationers but not vice versa. Thanks to the beautiful beach and ocean, the overall experience was relaxing, but there were some issues encountered that made the week not as advertised or projected.First, the room was far from ocean view, although technically it was oceanfront. The ground floor room, #105, had a completely obstructed view of the beach and ocean, overgrown with vegetation, but a wonderful view of the wall of the neighboring resort. When we requested a new room we were told none were available. The sliding glass doors leading onto our patio were a waste and kept closed all week, we never bothered with the fenced in patio area. I can stare at plenty of walls at home.The restaurants were not open as listed, which in our opinion devalued the week tremendously. The main attractions were the two specialty a la carte restaurants, LaTrattoria  Estrella del Mar. Instead of being opened for dinner daily as scheduled, they were alternated nightly, therefore reducing by 50% the premium dining options. LaTrattoria never opened for lunch as advertised the entire week. Likewise the El Bucanero restaurant wasn't always open for their buffet dinner. Unbelievably, the sheets on the bed were about 8 inches too short, leaving your feet exposed to the bare mattress. The shower curtain was also undersized, not reaching the tub, causing wet floors. The dankness of the room was a sinus buster. The tiny room refrigerator was stocked daily with two each of beer, soda and water; incredibly they ran out of beer one day. Towels supplied were insufficient and it was like pulling teeth to get any additional. A wall tile, near the ceiling over the toilet, feel down and shattered on the bathroom floor. Luckily no one was in the room at the time.The Bow Bar is the only bar opened evenings that was exclusive to Cayena guests. It was shut down on Friday night for repairs. The small Cayena pool had an inoperable hot tub, which amounted to nothing more than an extension of the pool overflowing into it. The time-share guys were relentless and at times annoying, and by the end of the week resorted to pleading, informing us they were paid by commission. On the plus side, all the employees receive a 5 star rating, well, except for maybe the timeshare sharks. Special thanks to Leonardo, the egg guy; Pascaul at Cayena's Elcano restaurant and Aldolpho at the Cayena pool. Even with the restaurant closings there was plenty to eat, just not always the premium options, which we felt was a major detraction since there was a noticeable difference in the food. I would love to visit the Dominican Republic again, but with so many alternatives, I doubt it would be Cayena again without trying a competitor first.With this decrease in amenities, at the very least, the all-inclusive rate should have been adjusted. If the Cayena Beach Club wants to be thought of as a 5 star resort, which I wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ anywhere near convinced they are, they have a long, long way to go to compete with the likes of Cancun√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Royal Resorts and others.
