{"text":"Old Hotel right on the expressway We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights from 13th January to 15th January 2007. The room was a good size with a king size bed and balcony overlooking the pool and car park area. The room has no fridge or microwave but has an ice bucket and coffee maker. There is only in room dining for breakfast. They have sports bar downstairs named Cassidys that looks inviting but when you go in there is plenty of tables chairs and TV's but they don't sell any alcohol as they don't have a licence to sell alcohol. We couldn't believe it. They would lose such much money with guests going elsewhere. The pool is indoors and open 6am - 10pm. The hotel also has a fitness centre and business centre which offers free internet. The room ahs a reverse cycle air conditioner. The bathroom is a bit small but functional with an extra bench with mirror located just outside the bathroom. Good for us women to get ready while hubby is in the shower. There is a McDonalds, Popeyes chicken , KFC and Pizza close by or a 5-10 min walk. Hotel is old and elevators are very slow. they have a coin operated laundry.The bed was comfy. We ordered feather pillows from housekeeping which helped us sleep.The hotel is right on the expressway and the noise of traffic and sirens kept us awake all night. We wouldn't stay here again as the hotel did not make our standards that we are use too.
