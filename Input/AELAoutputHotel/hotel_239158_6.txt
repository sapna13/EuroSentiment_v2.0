{"text":"Better than we expected. I had previously booked a hotel in the Gothic area for a one night stay, and our dates changed, so I had to ring Expedia to select another hotel and cancel the other one.I booked this one solely on price, as we'd managed to get a 76E deal on the other hotel, but this one was 80E, and we didn't really want to pay any more.Once it was then booked I then read the reviews and was very worried, as they didn't rate it well. So I was surprised when we arrived, with the help of our Tomtom on our motorbike.Firstly they have parking, at the cost of 18 euros a night, which for the city centre isn't bad, but we parked our bike around the corner, in a little plaza, which was perfectly safe and not tampered with. The room was very clean and quite quirky - with a slightly slanted ceiling. The twin beds were large ( we tend to usually go for twin beds now as doubles in hotels are sometimes really small!).The bath was the small spanish variety, but a little hard to get into if you have problems stepping in and out as it backed onto the toilet - but I expect they would have let us change rooms if this had been an issue.The area itself wasn't the best in the world, but I did know this when I booked it. But it is only a 5 minute walk to the Ramblas, and if you go straight across to it, rathe than down and aross then you avoid the smellier areas - only one street we went down smelt like a toilet.All in all it wasn't as bad as I expected from other reviews....I would stay there again, I have stayed in better locations but for us the price was right that night.
