{"text":"Annual Girls Trip I have been staying at the Outrigger Waikiki for 5 years now. My girlfriends and I come here every year for Jack Johnson√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Kokua Fest in the Kapiolani Park and my Husband and I come every year for the Pro Bowl. This Hotel is extremely convenient to all of what Waikiki has to offer from the amazing shopping to the concerts at the Waikiki Shell√à√\u2020\u2022?br\/>All is within walking distance. Duke√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ restaurant is located on the lower level of the hotel. Henry Kapono plays almost every Sunday night which is very popular with the tourist and locals---Make reservations if you plan on dinner. In addition to Henry, Duke√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ has live music almost every night making it a fun √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥ne more and that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ it√à√\u2020\u2022?place before bed. The Hula Grill is located on the 2nd floor of the hotel which is great for breakfast. The food is wonderful but the service seems to be on √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√≥awaiian Time.√à√\u2020\u2022?The pool and beach area is crowded. I recommend reserving chairs as soon as you wake up in the morning to secure a spot for the day. Hotel is clean--granite counters in baths, Hawaiian decor, etc....Two catamarans are located on the beach outside the hotel--approx $20 for 1 hour cruise along Diamond Head coast....this is a must do.The only downside to this hotel is that the walls are paper thin! You can hear everything! You better have enough drinks at Duke√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ before bed to make you sleep sound or else you will be up all night. In the AM, the elevators can be crowded and take a while for you to access. Other that these two downsides, the hotel is great. ","annotations":[]}
