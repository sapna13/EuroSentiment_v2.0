{"text":"Best Hotel Experience--Ever My mom and I have traveled to Europe extensively and have stayed in wonderful hotels, but the Atlantico takes the cake. We had never been to Madrid, and the location could not have been better. Every attraction was within walking distance--we didn't take the metro once. If you're a shopper, you're in the midst of great shopping. There are fabulous restaurants everywhere, and the staff has plenty of suggestions if you're curious. We arrived at the Madrid airport around 7 in the morning, and were pleased to find that the hotel shuttle did indeed come to the airport around nine (just as expedia had said). The ride in to the hotel was free and so convenient. Our room was not quite ready when we arrived, so we were told to go up to the breakfast room fo coffee and breakfast (at no charge). When are room was ready, we were thrilled to see that our room was just as lovely as the beautiful marble lobby. We had two twin beds, a gorgeous (and large) newly remodeled bathroom, and french doors that opened onto a balcony which gave us a nice view of the Gran Via. The staff could not have been more helpful--at one point we went to the Royal Palace and discovered it was closed for a government event. After a day of seeing other parts of Madrid, we asked the staff if they new if the Palace would be open the next day. They immediately called the Palace--when the line was busy, the desk clerk joked that the king must be on the phone--and when the clerk got through, he let us know when the Palace would be open again. The front desk has wonderful little maps that are much more detailed than your average travel book map--I definitely recommend picking one up. Also, ask for restaurant suggestions. The hotel will make reservations for you and you will be treated like royalty when you arrive at the restaurant. Other than the first morning, we didn't eat breakfast at the hotel. It was 9 euros, and we found it cheaper to pick up rolls and fruit. However, it looked like a lovely buffet with lots of fresh meats, cheeses, fruit, cereal and coffee. Don't miss the ninth floor, either. It is a lovely lounge area with a bar, but most importantly, if you are able to go out onto the balcony area, you will be greeted with the most spectacular panoramic views of the city. The room was always spotless and ready when we came back for our siesta each day at 4. Finally we couldn't have been more impressed with the way the hotel handled a potentially serious problem. On the morning we were set to leave for the airport (along with 10 other passengers), the van arrived on time, but once we were all loaded in, the door to the van wouldn't close. The driver spent about 10 minutes trying to get it closed, but many of us needed to leave immediately to get to the airport in time. A member of the hotel staff had been trying to help the driver fix the van, but when it was clear that the fix was going to take time, he called six cabs. The cabs arrived within 2 minutes and a desk clerk came out and paid each cabbie. We couldn't believe how well this was handled. We had already paid our 12 euros for the van ride back, and the hotel paid another 25 euros to cover the difference. We have recommended this hotel to everyone we know, and will definitely stay there again. We have always avoided staying at chain hotels when abroad, but the Best Western Atlantico was a five-star experience at a two or three star price. The hotel was so well managed...don't hesitate to stay there...your trip to Madrid will exceed your wildest dreams.
