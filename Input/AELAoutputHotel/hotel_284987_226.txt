{"text":"A terrific resort Our family stayed at the Paradisus - Puerto Rico for a week in mid April 2007, and had a wonderful time. The grounds are lovely - beautifully landscaped and well maintained. The rooms are spacious and nicely furnished. (The bathroom is large with marble floors and countertops, large mirror and terrific water pressure). The AC works well - actually a bit too strong for my taste - so the ceiling fan was fine. There was a musty odor when we first got to the room - which seems to emanate from the AC unit. As soon as we turned it off, and used the fan, the odor was eliminated.Negative comments about the staff should simply be disregarded. From the reservation desk, to the poolside bar to the activities center - all of the staff with whom we interacted were friendly and helpful. Everyone we encountered greeted us warmly and with a smile. As long as you are friendly and courteous, you will receive the same in return.The beach is not what most envision for the Caribbean - it is rocky with seaweed patches. But all you would need are aqua shoes and you are set to go. The water is warm and clear - actually warmer than the pool on some days! There are kayaks and boats to use or just a long stretch of coast to walk and find shells.During our trip, the Paradisus was still an all-inclusive. The choice of restaurants was fine. We had breakfast each day at Caribeno - a wonderful assortment (eggs, fresh omelettes, pancakes, bacon, oatmeal, fresh fruit, blintzes, muffins, bagels, juices, and Puerto Rican specialties etc.). It also has a lunch buffet that was great. We had lunch at Mirador grill since it was closest to the pool. The lunch there is average, but one could always find something to satisfy the appetite. The dinner choices (beyond Mirador Grill) were Romantico (adult only, so since we have a teenager and 8-year-old we did not try it); Bamboo (a Japanese hibatchi-style restaurant - very nice, tasty - John Carlo was our chef and was terrific); Avocado (typical steakhouse - make sure to have the shrimp at the buffet - they are large and delicious); Toscano (rather pedestrian Italian fare). All in all, the selections were numerous, the entrees were well presented, and the staff at each restaurant was attentive and pleasant. Keep in mind, this is not a resort know for gourmet food. However, there is something for everyone, and in general, the food was above average.A few tips - check-out is at noon. Be sure to check out at 8:30 to avoid the rush. You can then leave your bags in a locked room near the front entrance, enjoy the remainder of your stay at the pool and then shower and change in a fully-equipped salon next to where you leave your bags. Don't book trips to El Yunque rainforest or Old San Juan through the hotel. The costs are exhorbitant. Instead, rent a car from the Avis representative at the hotel (Gina was ours - she was great). We rented a car for a day ($70) and went to the rainforest (20 minutes away), Luquillo Beach (another 10 minutes away) and then drove back west to Old San Juan. If we had booked the tour through the hotel, this would have cost more than $500 for the 4 of us. We'd go back to Paradisus tomorrow. It was wonderful.
