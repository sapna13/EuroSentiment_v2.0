{"text":"The Dominican Lovely The Hotel Good  We arrived at the Barcelo Dominican on 16 Oct 08 staying for 1 week we were a party of 6. On arrival reception was real slow at booking us in and 1 room wasn't ready so we had to wait, it was a bit of an inconvenience after a 9 hour flight and 45 min drive hopefully the next day would be better after a good nights sleep the next morning getting out of bed my husband caught his leg on something when we lifted the bedsheet there was a lovely big curly spring peering at us out if the side of the mattress things then started to get a bit better we booked a parasailing trip on the beach with alexis which was great we all had a good time. Things were starting to look good so we booked another trip this time with a tour rep actually on the hotel grounds so 4 of the party went off Quad biking it was a disater the rep didnt explain that we would need to pay out more money on the day for bandanas photos etc be more prepared wish we had booked through alexis on the beach. As the week went on we had a few more problems with the room the fridge broke the plug sockets were hanging off the wall and the safe locked us out with all our belongings in it. we reported these problems 3 times and still we waited for someone from reception to sort it out, our son was the one who got the safe open for us the other problems were never sorted the best was yet to come when we went to check out we found we had never been checked in properly (with the room not being ready) and the room was still registered to the previous occupents who had cut out leaving a bill we did have a laugh and half a good holiday would definately go back to the Dom Rep but not to the barcelo Dominican.
