{"text":"Good hotel,Great location We stayed at the Apsis Splendid for 5 nights at the start of September. The hotel has a great location very close to the Universitat metro stop. If arriving by bus from BCN the aerobus 1 stops at Placa Universitat and the hotel is a short walk away.Our first room was a double and was quite small but it was clean and nicely decorated. We were wakened at 7:30 on the second morning of our stay by water dripping from the ceiling in the bathroom. This was in no way the fault of the hotel as the above floor is not part of the hotel. We were immediately moved to a twin room on the same floor which was actually a much bigger room so we were happy with the result. The hotel is about 5 mins walk from Placa Catalunya and Las Ramblas but is far enough away so that a good nights sleep should be no problem. There is an open top tourbus literally around the corner and tickets can be puchased at hotel reception. They are √à√\u2020√ü?0 for 1 day or √à√\u2020√ü?4 for 2 consecutive days. This is a great way to see Barcelona's main attractions and would be recommended if this is your first visit to Barcelona.The best way to get about Barcelona however is by the metro. A single journey will cost √à√\u2020√ü?,25 per person but there are multiple journey tcikets available. The one that we used was the T-10 ticket. This gives the user 10 journeys for a price of √à√\u2020√ü?,90 euros and can be used by more than one person.We didn't eat breakfast in the hotel as there are loads of cafes close by. I would recommend this hotel to friends and family and would stay here again if travelling to Barcelona. I would also recommend booking as far in advance as possible as the hotel went up in price three times whilst we tried to decide on a hotel. ","annotations":[]}
