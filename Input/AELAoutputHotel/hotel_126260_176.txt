{"text":"Mother Daughter trip to remember I have sat down to give my opinion of the New York Palace. First off I would like to say this is my first review. I am only going to talk about the hotel and do another review on the whole trip in the forum.We arrived at the Palace at 11:30am check-in was quick and efficient very kind. Our room was not ready but told us it would be ready by 1:00pm. Arrived back at the hotel at 2:00 room was ready. Ah my god, the view is amazing, we each had our own little palace bed which we slept like princesses. We had club level rooms which are well worth the price had breakfast, wine and dessert there everyday.Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes, french toast, alot of different fruits and of course pastries. It would have cost a fortune to eat that good every morning. And every afternoon we arrived my daughter and I would go up and have a glass of juice for her and glass of wine for me.Desserts were strawberries and whipped cream and all sorts of little petits fours. Rooms were very large and clean, the service was twice a day (morning and turn down).We didn't eat at the restaurants but one night I ate the hors d'oeuvres at the Club and my daughter ordered the chicken fingers and curly fries which were from the kids menu but there was like 4 chicken fingers and alot of curly fries (very good). I could go on but the only thing I have left to say is you get what you pay for. We felt like royalty the whole time we were there never felt like we didn't belong.If I would go again I hope I can next year with my other daughter.
