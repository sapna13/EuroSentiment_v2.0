{"text":"Is this really a Westin? We arrived tired and a little edgy after flying in from Hong Kong, via LA. I was confident we would be looked after; my Starwood Gold card would look after us, right? Wrong! We were given what is without doubt the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in, in a developed country. The room was on the 9th floor, which, as it turned out, is also a convention and meetings area, where the few rooms are clustered together at one end. The room smelled musty, the plumbing was extremely noisy, and the fit out of the room reminded me of the 1970s. The piece de resistance, though, was the view...of a plant room some 10 feet from the window! The promised city view had not materialised, though if I stood on the bed and looked up I could just see the sky. We asked for another room, but were told there wasn't one. In the morning, we were woken by the rattle of trolleys, provisioning the conference and meetings area for the day. In short, a disaster, and one which caused me to wonder what standards are applied by Starwood to ensure its properties under the Westin brand are uniformly good. I have stayed at first class Westins in Shanghai, Auckland, Melbourne, and Sydney; they bear no resemblance, other than the name, to this place. Thankfully there was a first rate steakhouse on site, and the door staff were most helpful...without that I would have demanded my money back...and I wasn't paying! ","annotations":[]}
