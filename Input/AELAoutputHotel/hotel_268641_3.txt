{"text":"Wouldn't Stay again if they Paid ME!!! No where near the beach as claimed, hotel staff seemed to spend more time in the parking lot talking to others than actually in the hotel. Was booked for two nights - room was changed 3 times and only one night was actually spent at hotel. Here is the list of what we experienced in 24 hours at this dump ~1) Bugs in rooms2) No lighting in room except wall light near door3) Of two beds one had 1 sheet and a blanket, the other had two sheets and no blanket4) TV didn't work in one room5) TV remote didn't work in another room6) Bathroom had mold growing in all three bathrooms7) Bathrooms all had less than half a roll of toilet paper - no tissues and one room only had one set of towels8) Uneaten food found in nightstand with bugs having a buffet9) Housekeeping put out Do Not Disturb sign rather than tidy the room or change the linens.10) Front desk wouldn't fix any problems, would just offer to change our room11) Phones didn't work in rooms12) Safe didn't work in rooms13) Parking lot was always blocked offOverall I wouldn't wish this hotel on my worst enemy. Not sure when the remodel occured but they missed a bit of the hotel...the hole in the marble baseboard of the elevator would be one area. If anyone would like a nice close up picture of the bugs in our room I can be sure to send. Pretty sure this review won't make it to the website though.
