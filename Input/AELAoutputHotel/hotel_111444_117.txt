{"text":"A lovely night I spent an absolutely lovely night here last week and recommend it highly.I had booked through Priceline, and it was the first time I had ever used their service. I was only staying one night, I was arriving late, and I was willing to take a gamble. Smart gamble it was indeed! The drawbacks were these: I was given the smallest room at the hotel, but it was still extremely comfortable for one and beautifully appointed to boot. There were no views as it faced buildings on both sides, but since I was only staying one night, I didn't care, and it was blissfully quiet. There was no dresser and thus no drawer space (although again, one night, who cares), the bathroom was small (but it was comfortable and had good amenities), and one of the two phones in the room didn't work. On the plus side was absolutely everything else. I arrived just before 11pm. The hotel was still fully staffed, and every single person that dealt with me, down to the room service attendent, was absolutely lovely. The restaurant had closed so I called for room service at 11:30. It arrived in less than 15 minutes, piping hot, and, surprisingly, was actually extremely good. The mini bar was well stocked, and a half bottle of a wonderful red wine that is one of my favorites at home was among the choices. The room was beautiful....almost like a small luxury hotel in Paris. The wireless internet worked perfectly even though the hotel only guaranteed wireless in the lobby. They graciously allowed me a late check out even though I was leaving on a Friday that was the start of a busy holiday weekend.I would stay at this hotel again in a heartbeat....although I would choose a larger room if I were staying longer than a couple of days or if I were to be more than one person. Let me just reiiterate though that I was in the smallest room the hotel offers (because of my price choice) and that their average double rooms are probably more than comfortable for two. I liked everything about the Fairmont Copley....the location is perfect, the hotel itself is quite beautiful and has a lot of old world charm, and the staff are just terrific. Of the many places I've stayed in Boston, this is so far my favorite.
