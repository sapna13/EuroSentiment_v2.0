{"text":"Loved the City Inn, Westminster Had excellent 1 night stay at City Inn, Westminster last weekend.Hotel very modern, with modern rooms, including wonderful iMac system which controls CV, hotel info, interesting London websites and free internet broadband (!). CDs and DVDs are available from reception. Bed very comfy. We had a club room (slightly more expensive than standard room) which meant we could have early check in and late check out, and a free drink in the bar. We also had 2 complimentary newspapers of our choice. Free mineral water and fruit bowl and mini bar with basket of items such as London guide book, snacks etc. Bathroom goodies from The White Company. Bathroom bit short of storage space, but didn't bother us as we were only there for one night. We were on the 12th floor with excellent views from the floor to ceiling window, sideways on to the Thames. Window also opened slightly, but safely, which was a plus. Room and all hotel areas spotlessly clean.Hotel bar very nice. Ultra modern and very scarlet in colour with red ceilings and lighting, but welcoming to all ages (we were there with elderly parents). Restaurant also very nice for breakfast and dinner (we had both as we were on a package deal). Tasty, modern food for dinner. On site parking was good at only √ä√£¬¢20.00 for over 24 hours, although it is literally a 5-7 minute walk to tube and about 5-8 minutes to Houses of Parliament etc.Staff very friendly and only too delighted to assist.All in all, an excellent hotel in London at a very good price. We have stopped at the Apex Hotel London previously, and we will find it difficulty to choose which of the 2 to stay at in future as both on a par.Highly recommended.
