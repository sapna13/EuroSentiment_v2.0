{"text":"Good but expensive We chose this hotel due to the downtown location and the lack of availability in other hotels. This hotel is located in a commercial area across the street from Lake Union and we paid $154\/nt in October over a 3-day weekend.This is a good location although you will need to take the hotel shuttle (5 different spots) or city buses to go to the tourist areas except the Space needle which is a 15 minute walk mostly uphill. It has a rather expensive ($13 for buffet breakfast) restraurant for breakfast and dinner. it also has one of the nicer exercise rooms with gym quality treadmills and stack machine. The beds lived up to the commercials and were the most comfortable we experienced on this trip. There is onsite parking in a gated garage under the building for a fee or free public parking across the street. I choose the free parking which worked out fine. Bbut be careful, upon leaving Sunday morning I noticed piles of car glass in 4 spots that wasn't there three days earlier. The rooms were nice, but the neighborhood is pretty active (noisy) on the weekend nights. The staff was helpful providing suggestions, maps and directions.There are several restaurants located close by. For breakfast there is a Starbucks in the ACG building and Tin Cup coffee (lunch too) on the far corner of the Jillians\/Outback\/Fishbone block. The restraurants on the lake are expensive ($15 burger!) and cater to the Yacht crowd docked in the Marina. We also found the Neptune Deli on Dexter St. three blocks behind the hotel. This is a popular area on the weekends so make reservations if you plan to eat at the nicer restraurants.
