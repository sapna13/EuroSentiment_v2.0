{"text":"This hotel is a Gem ! Well, what a pleasant surprise. This place is a gem, quite inexpensive compared with other hotels in San Francisco.As many reviewers have said, the hotel is currently under renovation. I was there last month in February, and it appears the renovations are near completion, sometime this month in March, I would say. I was not inconvenienced at all because of the renovations. The hotel is very clean and well kept, throughout the entire building. The rooms are spotlessly clean, the beds were very comfortable, relaxing. Yes, my room was a bit small, but not cramped for me. I had a room with 1 queen sized bed. The hotel gave alot of complimentary freebies in the room, nice shampoos\/conditioners\/moisturizers, free in-room coffee\/tea, and even a free travellers pack of advil and cold lozenges, etc. Nice touch.The breakfast was okay, a continental style type of breakfast: pastries, muffins, fruits, coffee, tea, orange juice. It was basic, but still okay. Enjoyed it.The service at the front counter was excellent, on check-in and check-out as well. They were very friendly, kind, helpful and even addressed me by my name. The guest feels so welcome in this nice hotel. Also, during my stay, I needed some ice for a drink, and did not see an ice machine anywhere in the building. I called to the front desk, and they kindly had a bucket of ice brought up to my room, free, and with a smile too! Great service.I won't repeat all the other good things reviewers had to say, but if you want a clean, respectable, comfortable hotel and don't want to pay a King's ransom for it, then Cartwright is your best bet !In closing, the hotel is perfectly situated for the traveller: 1 block from the cable cars and about 5 blocks to the BART\/Muni subway station. Easy walking distance, ","annotations":[{"endOffset":697,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":693},{"endOffset":906,"mention":"pastries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pastry"],"startOffset":898},{"endOffset":915,"mention":"muffins","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Muffin"],"startOffset":908},{"endOffset":931,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":925},{"endOffset":936,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":933},{"endOffset":1188,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1184}]}
