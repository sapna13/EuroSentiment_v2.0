{"text":"10th Time to this Hotel in 6 years, just keeps on getting better  We have recently returned from our 10th trip to this hotel and we would like to give you a different view of this hotel, walking in off the coach into reception seeing the smiling faces from the staff, we get the same great feeling as we did the 1st time, feels like our second home.I would like to point out that this island is Spanish speaking therefore should you wish English as the spoken language may we say you might wish to go to Barbados, Jamaica, Antigua etc and pay double the price for a similar hotel. The staff are very friendly, work very hard and try their utmost to help but they are not dealing just with English,Canadian or American's but French,Spanish, Portugese,Italians, German, Swiss, Austrians, Polish and Russians, remember these are bar staff, waitresses etc and not multy linguists.Upon arrival you will get an ID band depending how many times you have been to the hotel. Blue is for 1-3 holidays, Yellow is for 4-9 visits and 10 or above is Silver ( we qualified for this this time )which classifies you a VIP with extra small touches like bathrobes, slippers, bowls of fruit and bottle of rum on arrival. I mention this because we met 10 couples this year we see every December all with yellow bands, we cannot all be wrong, I am sure you will notice plenty of yellow bands as well.Food is still first class in La Catedral restaurant with an enormous choice of show cooking as well as prepared dishes. Best night for our favourites are Friday ( Gala ), Saturday ( Spanish) and Sunday ( American). A la Cartes are El Quijote ( Spanish) for the Salmon and Bamboo ( Asian ) Sweet and Sour Pork. Finally the fried chicken is just like Kentucky fried on Thursday's ( Dominican ) night.I would like to mention in all the time we have been to the Palladium we have NEVER EVER got a tummy upset, people always try and blame the food anywhere this is always easier than saying I drank far too much or pool water got into my drink by kids splashing around at the swim up bar. Remember when eating fresh coconut or drinking the coconut milk that they are both laxatives along with the local rum, lastly on this subject you will perspire far more in a hot country use plenty of salt on your food. In the Villas maid service is every day and the bedding ie sheets are changed on a daily basis and the fridge is restocked every other day, again if you want more water go to any main bar and they will give you as many as you want. At the pool you will have waitresses coming around all the time, asking if you want a drink, you have not to go to the bar at all.At all the lobby bars you can get, international whisky, gin, vodka and vermouth if you ask for them by name example 100 Pipers whisky and Coke, you get what you ask for. Best Bar without doubt is Hemmingways, this is situated between the lobby and the swimming pool, here they do more international brand drinks than anywhere on the resort, they even do Baileys, Cointreau etc and even Champagne by the glass, yes these are all part of your all inclusive, no charge. Drinks are NOT watered down at any bar either.I think that living in a smaller country in europe we do travel more often embrassing other cultures trying there foods etc,should any one wish McDonalds, Wendys, KFC or the same oil to cook the French Fries or good old Mom's Apple Pie, stay at home with your creature comforts and let the genuine traveller enjoy a fantastic hotel in Paradise.Guess what we will return, cannot wait as usual to get our next Silver Band.Finally our thanks to Octavio DH. Supervi C of Fiesta Hotels who turned our usual great holiday into a superb, fantastic time.
