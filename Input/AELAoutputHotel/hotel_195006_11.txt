{"text":"Best Boutique Property in Florence From the very start, The Ferragamo group√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Hotel Lungarno ranked immediately among the best hotels I have visited in Europe. Its location along the river and subsequently stunning views of the Arno, the Ponte Vecchio and points beyond might have been in itself enough to vaunt it to the top of my list, but the food, service and quality of the rooms were just as impressive. The building itself melds perfectly amidst its neighbors along the south bank of the Arno and the semi-private entrance provides a welcome sense of exclusivity. The public areas on the ground floor are bright, cheerful and intimate, with a spacious check-in desk, a well-appointed bar and a lovely dining room overlooking the river. The check-in experience itself was virtually seamless, and the staff could not have been more pleasant or hospitable. Our room, which was modestly sized, though perfectly adequate, faced the river and boasted a small balcony. The classic interior was a perfect reflection of the public areas downstairs; dominated by the bright blues and cream-colored trim that are this property√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ signature. The bathroom was a typical European affair with a deep tub, white marble floors and brass fixtures. The double sink was a welcome amenity. This was my third visit to Florence, and my first stay on the south side of the river. I cannot recommend this location more highly. While the idea of staying √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√£n the heart of it all√à√\u2020\u2022?is understandably tempting, I generally vacation in the summer when the crowds are at their peak. This location, close to Piazzale Michelangelo, the Pitti Palace and its adjacent Boboli Gardens is a calming respite from the throngs of tourists teeming amidst the Uffizi and Il Duomo across the way. Mine is clearly not the first glowing review of this property, neither shall it be the last. The Hotel Lungarno sets a high standard for boutique hotels in a city known for its charming accommodations, and in my opinion, this standard is unlikely to be matched for some time.
