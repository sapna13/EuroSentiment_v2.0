{"text":"Very good hotel in an excellent location Barcelona has no shortage of hotels, yet decent accommodation can be very expensive. It is easy to pay a lot of money for a rubbish hotel, even one sporting four or five stars. NH Hotels is an expanding Spanish chain with more than 300 hotels in Europe and Latin America. They are generally 3+ or 4 star properties with modern, elegant quasi-minimalist interiors and slick bathrooms. I've stayed in a number both in Europe and Argentina, and have always found the service to be first-rate. The NH Duc de la Victoria is no exception. The building looks a little like a Florentine palazzo from the street. Its location is a great feature: in a quiet, pedestrian street between Las Ramblas and the cathedral, the hotel is within easy walking distance of the metro, buses, the downtown sights, as well as restaurants and the joys of Barcelona shopping. Rooms are comfortable though not large -- it is worth paying a little extra for a superior room -- and bathrooms have deep tubs and powerful showers. The restaurant serves reasonably-priced if unadventurous meals, although most guests will be eating out at the hundreds of restaurants in the area. Staff are multilingual, unfailingly polite and attentive. My only criticism of the hotel is the pricing of the lobby internet terminal, which after a free 15 minutes rockets up to √à√\u2020√ü?0\/hour! In-room Wi-Fi is available on a daily tariff that is much more reasonable. If you haven't brought your lap-top and don't fancy paying through the nose for the lobby terminal, staff will direct you to a nearby locutorio where you pay √à√\u2020√ü?.20\/hour. I really liked the Duc de la Victoria and would happily stay there again: it's comfortable, reliable, in a terrific location, and reasonably priced for Barcelona.
