{"text":"Both Bad and Good to Say My stay at the Intercontinental Hotel San Juan was for 2 nights on September 14, 2007, for a pre-cruise stay. I arrrived into San Juan in the late afternoon, took the fixed rate taxi to the hotel, and was greeted warmly by the bell staff as they did each and every time I entered or departed the hotel. I was effeciently and pleasantly checked into my room #1123 by the front desk clerk. This very nice service is what I had remembered from a previous stay at another San Juan hotel, but, unfortunately this is where the friendly service ended at the Intercontinental San Juan. My room, although small, was cheerfully decorated and the bed was fluffy and comfortable with the bottom sheet completely covering the matress. The small balcony overlooked the street area and airport landing traffic (no problem with noise). I immediately noticed that the room contained nice bathroom amenities and plenty of towels, but, none of the usual Room Service Menu\/Service Directory\/Writing Paper portfolio. The room also had an ironing board but no iron. In calling for these items, I was told that the iron would be sent up but I would have to call the Business Center for the portfolio. Okay fine. Business Center says call Housekeeping, each time being asked, Anything else I can do for you? To me, this is the most frustrating situation with Customer Service. If you haven't been able to fullfill my request, don't ask if you can do anything else. I decided it was not that important to get the portfolio. As it turned out the iron was broken, but, was replaced quickly the next day. After a very long trip, I went to bed early but was awakened by loud voices in the hallway, mistaken phone calls and knocking at the door. After falling asleep again, I was awakened again by the 3 false fire alarms mentioned by a previous review. The next night did go much better with no alarms! My room was made up the second day very promptly after leaving for lunch and the Housekeeping department was quiet and unobtrusive.As mentioned in previous reviews,the beach at the Intercontinental is very nice and the hotel has great service for guests who wish to be served while in the sun. The pool is also very nice and security is tight, making it difficult for anyone who is not a regestered guess to be admitted. The gym is well-equipped, adequately air conditioned,and has a nice view of the beach, and is open 24-hours. The ice machine on my floor worked well and always had plenty of ice.As I stay in hotels about 12 nights a month, I have to say that the young lady at check out gets the award for the worst in the world. She was curt, rude, and did not even offer to show me a list of my charges prior to charging my card. She had no change in cash to accommodate my request for small bills acting as if this was a strange request for a hotel cashier. No thank you's or offers of assistance with bags from her. All of this after waiting 5 minutes for other clerk on duty to finish her personal conversation with a co-worker.All in all, this hotel is quite a blast from the past. I fully expected to see Lucy, Ethel, Fred and Ricky pass through the lobby while on their Puerto Rican Adventure. Truely a place where my Mom and Dad would have spent their honeymoon. Not a bad thing if staff could be brought up-to-date on current standards of service in the hotel industry.
