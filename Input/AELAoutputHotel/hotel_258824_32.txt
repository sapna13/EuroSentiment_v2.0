{"text":"Good location, clean, nice stay My husband and I stayed at the Mediterranean Inn in mid-May for 4 nights for an anniversary. We were very pleased with it. After reading all the reviews, we knew what to expect - nothing fancy, but clean, safe and in a great location. We were there during that heat wave, and temps were reaching the 80s, but we were out most of the day seeing the sights, so had no need to the A\/C. Our room only had a ceiling fan, which was sufficient enough while we were sleeping. The only thing was when we slept with the windows open for some air circuation, we could hear our neighbors across the courtyard chatting. Nothing very loud at all and I just put in some ear plugs. Perhaps if we had gotten a room facing the other way, we would have been faced with street noise too.The front desk staff was helpful, one guy told us to get breakfast at the Mecca Cafe right down the street in Queen Anne - yum! We also liked how the business center offered free printing - great for planning out bus trips and printing out routes. We did plenting of busing and walking during our trip to Seattle. The hotel is conveniently located along major buslines going downtown and also lines to Ballard, Green lake, etc. Loved that it is walking distance to the Seattle center - we walked there every day.The bathroom looked like it had new fixtures and was very clean. I didn't mind that it was basic, cleanliness is the most important thing to me; no mold or anything to be found in the bathroom.We loved having the kitchennette w\/ fridge and microwave and coffeepot. Nice to have Starbucks downstairs and Safeway across the street as well. Nice little hotel!
