{"text":"Amazing place....don't look at the bad reviews!! Anyone who writes a bad review on this resort should just stay home in North America....obviously they are just looking for an American style holidayWe have been to many different resorts and this is, by far, the best.....the bus trip is 55-60 minutes and is bumpy BUT you get a feel for the area of the island and see the way the local people live.....so relax and enjoy, it is NOT a problem and they are continually doing construction so it will get betterThe check in\/check out and the service in ALL ASPECTS are all wonderful.....the rooms are great (people say small but how long do you spend in your room).....the food is the BEST we have had in the all inclusive resorts.....if you cannot be happy with this food you should stay home and eat more hamburgers and friesThe pool area is the best.....it gives you many different looks and now that they are addressing the seating problems it is great.....All the staff is friendly and helpful....I see people complaining about language barriers but we ARE VISITORS.....maybe we should try harderIf you enjoy beach walks you can go for miles to the north west (left).....the resort is about 2 kms along the beach from the nearest resort that way.....there is a run down\/hurricane damaged resort just to the south (right) but, otherwise, you are isolated......there are no difficulties with beach vendors....there are a FEW around but they don't bother youAll in all.....it is a great spot.....don't be afraid and ignore all the bad reviews (those are written by people who must be VERY PICKY......)....if you have young kids this IS your place to goGood luck......we will go backJohn and Erin ","annotations":[{"endOffset":813,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":803}]}
