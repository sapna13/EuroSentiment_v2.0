{"text":"Affordable but definitely not luxory I did not have a bad experience at the Ocean Bavaro, but I would like to share my trip to the hospital with potential guests. I became very ill on my fourth night at the hotel. I still don't know exactly what caused it, but I ate at the Spanish restaurant that night. My best guess is that I got a parasite from the garden salad served with goat cheese. The doctor at the hospital said it was common to get sick from unclean lettuce. I had a chicken dish as well. I guess it could have been that too. My advice is to avoid cold food that would have been cleaned with the local water. As for the doctor at the hotel, he was extremely kind and helpful. The hospital was very clean and I received very good care. After one night on iv antibiotics I was released with about two weeks worth of antibiotics and other anti-nausea medication. I was completely back to normal after about a week and a half. I also brushed my teeth with the local water which could have made me sick as well. So, be extremely careful not to ingest any water that is not purified. On our last night we paid the extra money for the lobster dinner on the beach. The service was great and it was very romantic. The food tasted good, but it did not sit well with either me or my date. It was the kind of meal you really wished you hadn't eaten about 5 minutes after you finished and for the next two days. I would not reccommend spending the $40 per person to have this meal.The rooms are satisfactory considering how affordable this hotel is. However, if you have a problem with average cleanliness, this is not the place for you. The tub and shower is extremely small and very old and not so clean feeling. Having a private balcony was a very nice point to the room.The entertainment is very fun, and the beach was just amazing.There is another buffet besides the main one. It is on the Italian side of the resort and it is 100 x better than the main buffet. I definitely reccommend it.
