{"text":"Great Choice! Wow- what a way to end a week long vacation! We flew in to San Juan and drove to almost every corner of Puerto Rico. Our last 2 nights we stayed at the Lazy Parrot, As one previous post said, the outside of the hotel does not give you any idea how nice it is once you get inside. We tried to avoid the chain hotels and tried out several locally owned properties which was a good choice. I am a clean freak and I can honestly say that this hotel was by far the cleanest and most comfortable place we have stayed in a long time. The only down side for us was that we didn't realize that lots of restaurants and bars close up completely in the off season which apparently is just before Labor Day until October or November. The restaurant in The Lazy Parrot was closed There was a basic continental breakfast available after 8:00 am, but since I am an early bird I had to go next door to the bakery for early coffee. We drove to 2 different restaurants by the beach for dinner and both were good. The layout of the Lazy Parrot and the grounds are beautiful. The fixtures in the bathroom were all new and very attractive. Plenty of hot water and air conditioning was great. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We arrived late (after the office closed) and they actually left our key on the bulletin board for us! Not too many hotels would make the extra effort to do that. I can't recommend this hotel enough, even though we came at a bad time, it was a truly wonderful place to stay. One tip though- it is not near the beach or downtown Rincon. You definitely need a car to stay here. Enjoy! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":926,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":920}]}
