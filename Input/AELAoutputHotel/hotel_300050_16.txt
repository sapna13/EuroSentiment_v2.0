{"text":"Needs work Ok, I was expecting the worst after the reviews here. We booked this for 65 a night on Priceline. Yes, we usually stay in better hotels when traveling, but this was a quick trip when we were not going to be in our hotel much. The hotel is ok for 3 stars. There were things broken in out room (the shade, the shower drain, etc) but livable. it was clean and the lobby and restaurant were fine. the halls REAKED of smoke, but our room was fine. Also they have laundry machines on the floors which is always nice when traveling. The gym was fine, 6 new machines and some free weights. Yeah, you will get a better gym at a nicer hotel, but you won't be paying 65 a night.However, the service was terrible. i don't expect a ton but I expect a clean room and responsiveness. One day we left the hotel at 11 and the maid was still on our floor. We came back at 7 and our room as not clean so we called the front desk and decided to go out to dinner while they cleaned. Well, they came in and changes our sheets (well they forgot the top sheet) and threw some towels on the TOILET. Nothing else. Didn't clean, didn't empty the trash, nothing. We were pretty upset when we got back at 9 30 and saw this and went to speak to the front desk. they were unbelievably rude and said we had been in the room all day with our do not disturb sign on. Not true. And even if we were, you don't speak to hotel guests like that-you apologize and go clean! I have several more examples, but you get the point. Not sure I would stay there ever again, even for the low price. ","annotations":[]}
