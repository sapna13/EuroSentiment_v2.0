{"text":"Great boutique in central Manhattan This hotel is perfect if you want a trendy, clean boutique hotel with no frilly nonsense, in a great location for the tourists sights of new york. The positives:The rooms are defiantly minimalist, but its a style i like, although i can see how some may find the room's plain. The size was great and we stayed for 6 days - the lack of room dressing helps maximise the space. And they were spotlessly clean. The bed was the comfiest thing I have ever slept on - so much so i'm looking into buying a mattress for my home. The sheets were crisp egyptian cotton adding to the comfort. The radio with ipod dock was a great touch for playing some music while getting ready to hit the town of an evening. And the dvd and flat screen great for chilling the morning after. Location is fab and very central - times square is under a mintue away.  Transport is great, with subway less than 5 mins away, but beware getting a cab to get downtown on a friday or saturday night can be tricky - we actually ended up jumping on the subway. The breakfast was simple but very nice and who cares if their cutlery is plastic? Its what goes in your mouth that counts and the fresh bagels and muffins rocked. Plus the coffee was great!The bar always had a lively atmosphere, the drinks were spot on and the party kept going late into the night without disturbing our stay. The front desk provided some good tips on trendy bars\/restaurants and gave us some complimentary passes to certain clubs. The pool and sauna looked cool although we never found time to use them! The negatives:The front desk seemed to have an issue with taking a holding deposit on a UK chip and pin debit or credit card - between me and my partner we tried several cards unsuccessfully. In the end they kept locking us out of our room each day, which was a little rude when we kept trying to pay them! To be fair this is an issue we found in restaurants and shops across NY - so no real fault of QT - and if my business was owed over a 1000 $'s (we stayed for 6 nights) i'd get a bit twitchy! The shower in our room could have done with a little more water pressure!The gym is tiny to say the least, but hey there is enough equipment to work up a sweat. The location although great from the tourism side is a bit far from the happening night life of NYC - we struggled to find any cool bars or restaurants nearby.But overall this was a great hotel i'd have no problem with recommending to friends and returning to myself.
