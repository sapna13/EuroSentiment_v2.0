{"text":"Good hotel in central location We have stayed in the Omni San Francisco before so it was the natural choice for a return visit. The staff in general were helpful particularly the door men - it is nice to get the door opened for you! We had a few probs - the keys issued to our party did not open the doors and we were left standing on the corridor with our luggage whist the security checked our ID again before they could re-issue our cards - no proper apology from the reception desk as I would have expected. Also we had one of our rooms booked for three but only one king bed !- they sent up a rollaway - at no extra charge - I would hope so as we had paid for 3 people!We had booked a suite and a bedroom and they put us in the corner suite area which was very handy - suite was quite spacious - flowers in bathroom and fruit were supplied - nice touch. Beware double beds are tiny and really do not fit 2 people. Thet now charge for use of their internet business room - so take your laptop - it is free for 'select guests ' in the lobby - you can print airline boarding passes for free for a restricted number of airlines - but would be better if they had access to international ones as well! Overall a nice hotel - though like many hotels in San francisco it is quite pricey - SF hotels are pricier than NYC or Boston Breakfast is expensive for what you get - much better value in the Omni in Boston! - which is hard to beat for breakfast!
