{"text":"Pool areas are fabulous! Stayed with another couple in September. Have been to Bali many times normally staying around Kuta\/Tuban area but wanted somewhere different and quieter. Views from the lobby area are magnificent. The lobby is on the 15th floor then all the rooms are generally below as it sits on a mountain side. We had a room facing some rubble area on the side that they are eventually turning into another hotel. We didnt like that view so we upgraded to a pool view room for US $10 a night on the 3rd floor and it was worth it. Great views of the pool area and we could see the ocean as well, the balcony was huge! Room was spacious with a king size bed and had all the amenities you would expect.Breakfast was great - good choices, that changed daily and the serivce was superb, especially from Subrati. She would even come out to the pool area around 1 ish and offer guests free fruit skewers. Anything we wanted for breakfast, even if it was not available that day - we would request it and they would have it the next day for us. We had dinner a couple of times in the hotel and the food was more expensive by Bali standards but very good.The pool areas are the best attraction. You can play basketball in the pool and volleyball and the pool boys are great fun, especially Swarma who went out to buy CDs of the music we liked to play on the sound system for us. On hearing that my husband was a golfer they even arranged a very entertaining golf game and got all the guests involved. They have a range of pools including a beach sand pool and a great water slide too!Food by the pool was great as well.It is in a secluded area of Nusa so you will need to arrange transport into Kuta - cost us 70,000 rp one way. They do have a free shuttle bus that takes you to DFS Galleria but we just used to share a taxi. ","annotations":[]}
