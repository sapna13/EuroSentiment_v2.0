{"text":"Clean, cheerful, convenient Three of us females were looking for a nice but not expensive hotel close to the city centre of Berlin and struck gold at the Hotel Mercure. It's a minute's walk to Checkpoint Charlie and the rest of the city, very convenient. There's a lot of building work going on outside, but little or no noise. The receptionists were friendly and helpful, giving tips on places to go, helping with restaurant bookings etc. Nice touches in reception like bowls of apples...and jugs of cold tea (horrible, I thought it was apple juice and got a shock). Funky decor, with lots of art on teh walls for sale. The bar is tiny, more like an alcove off of the hall. There is a marquee for smokers (there was a lot less indoor smoking in Berlin than I had hoped) but the marquee had rugs and heaters and comfortable tables and chairs so was nice. The breakfast\/dining room was respectable, good selection of cereals, breads, yoghurts and juices for breakfast as well as a decent cooked breakfast. The rooms were surprisingly large, or rather, long. Mine had a separate WC from the shower room, the other girls had full shower rooms. Plenty of wardrobe space, mirrors etc., small minibar and plenty of towels and toiletries (which were pleasant and not skin stripping). We all got little packets of jellies on our pillows on the first night...but not the second. Comfortable bed and squashy pillows.We downsides were that we had booked online and the hotel had taken full payment for the rooms in advance...which, as they were only 80 euro a night, were cheap at the price but we discovered on checkout that this hadn't included breakfast. That's about it though !We ate in restaruant Margaux on the first night, very fine dining...tiny portions so we filled up on the fantastic petits fours...but they were very helpful in perparing wheat free food for a gluten intolerant person in the group. The second night we found a restaurant under the railroad tracks so that we could have wurst and saurkraut...and it was delicious...and very cheap. Plenty of lucious chocolate consumed at the KaDeWe and the famous chocolate shop in Berlin that I can't remember the name of...but you'll find it !
