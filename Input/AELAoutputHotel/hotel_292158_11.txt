{"text":"Awesome as always! My husband, son and I stayed at the G.P. Punta Cana the first week of December. This is my 4th time at this hotel in the past 2 years and I was once again impressed with the service and the facilities and accommodations. I have stayed at other hotels in Punta Cana (including the Gran Bahia Principe, the Majestic Colonial and the Tropical Princess) and I must admit that the Grand Palladium far exceeds my expectations especially with regards to service. Particularly, the service at the Reception is what brought me to book again at the Palladium: it is friendly and efficient! We did encounter a problem with the room we were first assigned and we therefore asked for another room (the seal on the patio doors was broken and moisture had accumulated inside them making it difficult for us to see through them and enjoy the beautiful view of the pool). Rafael, the manager at Reception is extremely efficient and immediately re-assigned us to another room and gave us VIP bracelets to compensate for our troubles. Rafael then later checked on us to make sure that everything was ok and that we were satisfied with our room. Now that is what I call personalized, friendly service! Rafael certainly helped make our stay a very enjoyable one. The service at Reception is very important to us because we realize that not everything can be perfect (at any hotel) but that if you have Reception staff that are attentive to your needs and are ready to rectify any problem that comes up, it makes a big difference in being able to enjoy a stress-free vacation.As for the amenities, the rooms are spacious, clean and well furnished. The beds are a bit hard, but comfortable enough. The fridge is stocked every day. The water pressure and temperature is very good. The food is delicious and well assorted. There is a different theme every day. We ate mostly at the main buffet restaurant (Belhique) and the beach restaurant (Uva). We did not try any of the A la Carte, so cannot comment on them, but overheard other tourists making very favorable comments. I am a very picky eater, but I always eat very well at the Palladium. The choice of food is very good, and the bread is very delicious. The service is always very friendly and efficient. Some of the waitresses and waiters actually remembered me from previous stays! Again, the personalized and friendly service is remarkable!The pool and pool area are very clean and very beautiful. But the beach is really what brings us to Punta Cana. It is absolutely gorgeous and paradise-like! I personally prefer the G.P. beach to the one at the Gran Bahia Principe because it never has any build-up of sea grass in the water. (The beach at the Gran Bahia Principe where I have stayed twice sometimes has huge accumulations of sea grass in the water that makes it unpleasant to swim on certain days. But I have never encountered this problem at the G.P.) . As for reserving lounge chairs early in the morning, this is true of any of the hotels I have stayed in Punta Cana, including the G.P. However, this seems to be less of a problem at the G.P. (you can still usually find chairs past 9:00 a.m.).Overall, our stay at the G.P. has always been very enjoyable and I highly recommend this hotel, especially for its friendly service, very clean amenities and well-designed layout . And also, you get a lot of value for your dollar at the G.P. compared to other hotels that are more costly, yet not really nicer or better. I have already sent quite a few of my friends to the G.P. and they have all come back with very positive feedback as well.
