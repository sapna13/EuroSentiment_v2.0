{"text":"Totally Excellent Experience! Having just got married in Fiji we arrived in Hong Kong for the start of our honeymoon. I had chosen the Langham Place Hotel from the reviews on Trip Advisor. I booked my accommodation direct with the hotel and was very impressed with the efficiency they showed with my booking\\enquiries. I can honestly say this hotel throughly deserves it top rating on Trip Advisor!Both my new wife and I were extremely impressed with the service, the room and everything else about the hotel. Everything from the efficiency of the booking process to the warm welcome we received from the 'Pink Ladies' made our stay in Hong Kong extremely pleasant.Having worked in 5 star hotels myself, i can honestly say this hotel definately lives up to its 5 star status. We had a room on the 26th floor which has the most wonderful view looking back into the main city of Hong Kong. Located in Mong Kok the hotel is close to the ladies market as well as the best place to buy electronics. Pay no attention to any feedback about Mong Kok not being a nice looking place. Remember that you are not in 'Kansas' anymore as i felt like i was experiencing the 'true' Hong Kong. The hotel is excellently located to the MRT which we used everyday. The MRT is even better than the cheap taxis that are prevalent around Hong Kong as it is fast and cheap (although quite crowded at times but thats the wonder of Hong Kong!). Food outside of the hotel was cheap and abundant. Walking around we felt completely safe although you do tend to feel a bit worried when the stall owners chase you down the street when you dont buy thier goods (if they are really keen on selling you something they will keep offering you a lower price and hound you until you cave in but its all done in a very friendly manner).Price wise this hotel is very resonable. The money we saved on accommodation we spend at the stores! Due to our wonderful experience both my new wife and i will be returning to Hong Kong and we will definately be staying at the Langham Place Hotel again!
