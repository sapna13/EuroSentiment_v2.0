{"text":"Great hotel - well worth the money I stayed here with my girlfriend recently and thought the hotel was great. We paid √ä√£¬¢77.50 per night altogether which included a large buffet breakfast every day which was very impressive. There was everything you can think of, both hot (omlettes, bacon, sausages in particular) and cold (croissants, many pastries etc) and coffees, espressos etc. This was easily the best choice of breakfast I've seen yet and much better than the 4 and 5 star hotels I've been to have to offer.The bedroom itself was alright, nice decor and a decent size. The bathroom was good, especially the large shower wet room which had a powerful shower. We stayed on the 4th floor so had to use the lift and there was no problems with the lift.The location was also quite good, a couple of minutes walk from Clot metro station which takes you to places such as Sagrada Familia, Nou Camp and Placa Catalunya within minutes. I would say the area is alright and fairly safe but always be aware of those around you just like in any other major European city and use your common sense and you'll be fine. The metro in the city is excellent...you can get to the beach fairly easily also.The hotel can get fairly noisy at times mainly because the floor is marbled for instance when people are coming in at night but don't let you put this off staying there as every other hotel I've ever stayed in have been the same. The walls are quite thin also but I think this is just common in hotels...we hardly stayed in the hotel so it really wasn't a problem for us so don't let it put you off, the positives easily outweigh the negatives.I would highly recommend this place especially for couples, friends and families.
