{"text":"Loved it! I stayed here for 3 nights with my boyfriend to celebrate our 3 year anniversary in Barcelona and the hotel exceeded out expectations. Having heard that city centre hotels are not as clean as those on the outskirts, I was a bit wary but I needn't have worried!The staff are friendly and helpful. Check-in was swift and hassle-free. It literally took us 5 minutes to check-in. Maid service was excellent. The hotel is spotlessly clean with modern decor and I have no complaints at all about the room or en suite.My only 'whinges' (which is an overstatement) are:(1) The pool is on the small side and rather shallow.(2) The rumbling noise which the lift makes - this may not be heard from other rooms situated away from the lift.All in all, our stay here was extremely pleasant and the location is excellent too - about 1-2 minute walk to Placa de Catalunya and the same to La Rambla. I would recommend restaurants in the Barri Gotic and the squares just off La Rambla also. Look out for Les Quinze Nits (found in a large square off La Rambla) - cheap and yummy food. We were particularly curious when we saw a huge queue of people stretching across the square! La Taller de Tapas is fantastic for tapas with lots of coverage in newspaper articles. You can take the Aerobus from La Placa de Catalunya to and from the airport costing 4 euros max which takes about 40 minutes but the queues can be long. If you take the taxi option, it will set you back around 20-30 euros depending on how much luggage you have. I would also recommend going on the Bus Turistic to do your tourist sight-seeing.Enjoy!
