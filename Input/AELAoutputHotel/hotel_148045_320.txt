{"text":"El Conquistador Resort-An Oceanfront Paradise! The trip to the El Conquistador Resort was both enjoyable and relaxing. My husband and I just returned from an 8 day stay (9\/21-9\/28). The resort sits perched atop a cliff with expansive ocean views from almost every location within the resort. The grounds are absolutely stunning. Once you turn into the resort you feel like you have entered an ocean paradise!We got a great Travel Zoo rate of $90 a night for a garden view room with a $100 resort credit with a 3+ night stay. I booked this directly on the El Con website. Just click on specials\/promos at the bottom of the reservation page. When we checked in they upgraded us to an ocean view room in the La Vista wing at no charge.Yes, they are in the process of renovating the resort. When you approach the main entrance you see some construction. This is the new conference center and ballroom. All other current improvements are hidden from the guests. Currently the Las Brisas wing is closed for renovations. They have plans of the renovations posted in the lobby. The new rooms are modern and luxurious.It is currently low season and we felt like we had the resort to ourselves. The pools were not crowded, the private island\/beach was almost deserted, and the staff could not have been more helpful or friendly.Yes the food is pricey but not overly outrageous. The pricing is consistent with other islands in the Caribbean. FYI, all of the restaurants are not currently open. Isabella√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ is being renovated into a new steakhouse. Stingray Cafe down in the Marina was open. The food there was fabulous. The veal medallions, sea bass, and tuna were all excellent. You must try the chocolate souffl√ã√\u2022√ñ. Otellos, the Italian restaurant was exquisite. The food was absolutely wonderful and full of flavor. The veal chop, lamb shank, beef filet, swordfish, and lamb chops were all out of this world. The Tiramisu and chocolate mousse in the hazelnut basket were both worth the calories. We also ate dinner at Blossoms the Japanese\/Chinese\/Sushi restaurant. The Chinese food was good and reasonable. The Bella Vista Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ overlooking the pool and ocean has great pizza that can be shared by two. This made for a very reasonable lunch. For breakfast we ate at the Las Brisas buffet next to the pool or at Dave√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ cookies across from the casino. We went to the local supermarket for snacks and drinks. They do have these available on site if you do not want to venture off.If you want to venture off site I suggest renting a car at the airport and driving to the resort. It will take approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes to reach the resort. I highly recommend the Eco-Tour kayak trip to the bioluminescent bay and the Castillo catamaran snorkel tour. Both are a 5-10 minute drive from the resort. We also ventured off on our own to the rainforest. Having the car saved a considerable amount of money on hotel transfers\/cab fare. You have the freedom to explore at your own pace. Yes the resort does charge $15 for self parking or $20 for valet parking. I suggest the valet since the self park lot is a distance from the main entrance and you need to take a shuttle to\/from your car. My husband and I both enjoyed massages at the Golden Door Spa. The facility is beautiful and the staff is top notch.If you are looking for the nightlife and excitement of San Juan this hotel is not for you. If you want a laid back relaxing vacation far away from the hustle and bustle of town this is the resort you are looking for. A trip to the Casitas Village infinity pool is a must. This pool is for the private use of the Casitas guests but with the low resort attendance you will not be stopped.We will definitely go back to the El Conquistador once all the renovations have been completed.
