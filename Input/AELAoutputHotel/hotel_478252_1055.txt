{"text":"Travelled extensively and the Bahia is one of the best My 12 year old daughter and I spent the first 2 weeks of July at the Bahia and loved it. One of the last places we stayed at was the Paradisius in the Mayan Riviera and the Bahia is very comparable to it.Yes the hotel shop was expensive but what do you expect.The food and availability of the 9 gourmet restaurants was fantastic. You could book up until 3 o'clock that afternoon.We were part of the Gold club and loved that we were so close to the beach. Also when it came to the trolley service we were at one end and never had to wait more than a couple of minutesThe one thing that totally impressed me was that the main buffet was air conditioned and therefore not in open air. Also with all the travelling that I have done I have never seen so many times that lobster tails were served in the main buffet. We also had roasted turkey that they were carving in front of you. They also had sliced prosciutto one night with various cheeses. I have never seen a more extensive buffet before. Being part of the gold club we had our own concierge and any minor problem we had it was remedied immediately. We also recieved house coats and slippers in our room which was an added bonus to our package. I have been all over the Caribbean and I will be back to the Bahia Principe in Punta Cana ","annotations":[{"endOffset":463,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":459},{"endOffset":463,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":459},{"endOffset":463,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":459}]}
