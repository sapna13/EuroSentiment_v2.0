{"text":"Classic rooms with a friendly staff, great breakfast I had a stay for several weeks at the Mayflower. Cost and location were my deciding factors. My first room was overlooking Bush street. LOTS of sun, light, people watching - I loved it. I was not dissapointed and was pleasantly surprised with the easy feel of the place.Regarding the bathrooms (and kitchens) - they are old but the owners seem to be retaining a lot of the original feel of the original features. There are original porcelain floor and wall tiles and design details in many instances from many many years ago. When they have had to cut into a wall to modernize, I noticed someone paid a lot of attention to carefully matching modern tiles and grout such that the average person may not notice. In my opinion, this kind of bathroom is more interesting than what you would find in any modern hotel. I like to see the patina of wear and appreciate the fine craftsmanship that set all those little porcelain tiles so many years ago. Cleanliness was not an issue.I found the rooms very clean and of good size. The street side room became quite an issue by the third day as at night the street noise started to bug me. (they have to retain the old originial windows on the facade) On the third night I requested a quieter room which they showed me to in the back of the hotel. It was great - until they started remodeling the room next door. No matter - they offered to change my room again but I declined as I was out in the city during most the day. Otherwise this room near the back was very quiet at night. Someone made homemade goodies for breakfast too. In addition the the regular cereal, bread and such, cookies appeared some days and breakfast cakes on others. Gotta try the cinnimon bread toast with butter - yum. The clientele in the morning was a nice mix of Americans, some foreign travellers, and some retired folks. There was a small kitchen with mirowave  refrigerator in my room. It had minimal items to make lunch and a simple supper. There is a great market right downstairs and to the left with groceries and some prepared items. A medditerranean flair to the food and they stocked Champagne too!
