{"text":"Probably not again... After vowing never to stay at the Inn again, we decided to give the hotel one more chance. We were travelling with my family in February and we decided to stay at the Inn for 2 nights before heading to Vegas. The previous 3 nights were spent in Anaheim at a fairly new hotel so that had set the bench mark.Upon arrival at the Inn our rooms were not ready (as usual) so we stored our bags and went out for the day. We returned back and checked-in. I think we were given the oldest, most rundown rooms in the place. We were on the top level in rooms 316, 317 and 318 I think? Our room, 316 was so old and musty. The heating didn't work, the toilet leaked, it was very noisy. We had to have someone come to our room at 10pm at night and spend an hour to try and fix our toilet. We then had to have someone come back and try and fix our heating - which was never fixed properly. The rooms are very run down and are extremely noisy. I could hear my dad in the next room when he took a shower or went to the bathroom. The noise from the fountain in the courtyard is OK during the day, but at night it becomes a bit annoying (they do turn it off, but not until late).On a positive note, the location is sensational and the walk to Santa Monica is great. The breakfast the Inn provides is adequate and they don't mind if you take some snacks with you for the day. The staff are wonderful, they are always helpful and greet you every time you come back to the hotel.We won't stay at the Inn again, however we would recommend this hotel to budget travellers who only need a place to lay their heads.
