{"text":"OK for business - but not pleasure I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in early 2008 for a business trip to Sydney. I have stayed at many Novotels - and can only assume that the 'Rockford' label is the generic name of the branding.The hotel has all the requirements of a business hotel - is nice and clean and conveniently located in the heart of Sydney - though not (strangely for a business hotel) in the business district. This didn't bother me too much as I am a former Sydneysider anyway.The room was of a decent size - though the housekeeping left a lot to be desired. The all inclusive rates did not include car parking - so the astronomical fee for valet parking was a joke, especially considering they required 45 minutes to bring up your car!!! Being opposite the Sydney Entertainment Centre does not help the situation either - if you don't like hearing thousands of people carrying on outside your window all hours of the morning. I was (un)lucky enough to stay when the Centre was hosting an international boxing match - the two thugs in the ring were not the only ones looking out for someone to punch! On the plus side, the reception staff were extremely friendly and always smiling. This almost made up for the pricy and not very appealing buffet breakfast. I felt urged to eat and leave quickly - due to some convention being held at the hotel. Not my worst experience (by far) but not a truly memorable one either. ","annotations":[]}
