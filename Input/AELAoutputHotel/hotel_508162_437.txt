{"text":"I would not recommend this resort to my friends Rooms: They gave me a room with two double beds when we asked for a King bed. It took them so long to move us to another room. For some days, they didn't clean our room so we were out of towels. We had to call them numerous times to have our room cleaned. Bed  pillows weren't that comfortable. Furnitures looked old, cheap and dirty. Not worth what we paid for.Food: Horrible. I've been to many cruises and all-inclusives. This one is the hands down worst. Too many flies flying around in the restaurant and on your table and food.Beach: Okay but too rocky. Nobody got into the ocean b\/c it was too rocky and dangerous. Seeweeds everywherePoolside: Good and relaxing. We stayed most of our times here.Bars: They don't know how to make cocktails. But services were good.Casino: Most horrible experience we had during any vacations in our lives. Nobody spoke English at the casino. All the dealers seemed mad or upset at something. They spoke Spanich among themselves constantly (speaking ill of the guests). The casino manager would not say anything to that. They all need to be fired if they want to keep this resort open. On our 4th night, every guests in casino left at once b\/c the casino employees were so rude and everybody got so angry. We almost got into a fist fight. This should not be happening at a vacation resort.I would never ever come back to this resort or any other dreams resort nor recommend this hotel chain to any of my friends. ","annotations":[]}
