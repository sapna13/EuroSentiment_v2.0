{"text":"Nice hotel, great experience (with only a couple complaints) We chose this hotel based on the reviews on Tripadvisor and careful research of the area. A choice I am happy with, only a couple of service oriented issues arose during our stay.As other reviewers mention, the decor and ambiance of the hotel is great, the 1920's theme is very well done, and consistent throughout the hotel. The room we booked (through priceline) was, yes, small, but not uncomfortable small. BUT... there was no air conditioning, I was not aware that all of the rooms in the hotel did not have air conditioning. The person who assisted us with our luggage said that it gets rather cool in the evening so we should be okay.Upon entering the room, it was very stuffy, we were able to open the window and a small fan was in the room, however this did not offer much relief. The room was in the back of the hotel, and no breeze or air flow came through the window, even though the temperature in the evening was cooler outside. Besides the temperature issues, the room was very nice and clean. I did not hear a sound from any of the other rooms at any point during our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful, with one exception. We had a rental car which I chose to valet ($35 per day w\/ unlimited in\/out privledges), slightly expensive but worth not having to deal with parking, etc. Here begins my 2nd and final complaint; The day we checked out we had to leave rather early, around 5:30am, I called the night before to inquire about the process to get my car that early. The person working at the front desk was definitely not friendly off-the-bat, and said that the valet is not available that early, and I would have to retrieve my car myself, gave the impression that there were no alternatives. Ok, I understand I'm leaving earlier than the average guest, however, from a customer service standpoint this person did not offer any alternatives. Perhaps they retrieve my car that evening and park on the street in front of the hotel, I'm sure I cannot be the first guest to have this special request. In any case, I thought this was a poor representation of the hotel, and again I'm paying for a valet service.The morning of check-out, the person working the desk was very nice, I mentioned having to get my car, and she asked if I made arragements the prior evening, I explained what happened and she did apologize and said they should have moved my car and had it ready for me this morning. I did appreciate the apology, but I still had to retrieve my car myself (a block away, uphill). Upon my return to load the car, the front desk person came outside to tell us that she put on a fresh pot of coffee if we'd like to grab a cup for the road. I thought that was a nice gesture to end our visit on an up note.Overall, I would definitely stay here again (requesting a room with A\/C), not a bad experience by any means, just a couple little annoyances which can be avoided in the future. I do recommend Hotel Rex.
