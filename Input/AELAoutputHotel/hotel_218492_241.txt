{"text":"Grand Oasis? Property does not meet its name We arrived at the Grand Oasis the 22nd of December for 7 days. We were a party of 18. Fortunately, we booked a room in building 7 and obtained a room on the 3rd floor with an ocean front view. The room was large with a king size bed and sitting area. 2 jacuzzi tubs- 1 in the room and 1 on the outside deck. The room was clean except the pillow cases smelt like mildew and the maid service was late in the afternoon around 4 pm. One day, no one came and we had them clean the room while we were at dinner. The rest of the party stayed in building 4. The halls were dirty, rooms were old (needs updating) and the hot water was not plentiful.Internet - Not that you go to a resort to work, some of us have to - If you stay in building 7, there is a room opposite the elevator that has a large t.v., couches and 2 computers with free internet access. We were originally told that we would have internet access available in the room; there is none. The property has an internet room between the lobby and casino with only 2 computers that is for a fee for service. The front desk will not let you know of the free service in building 7 when you check in. I had to ask for the manager until the front desk finally told me about the room in building 7. The front desk help is good at deflecting requests.Food - The food is terrible. We have been to the Club Med in Punta Cana twice. While Club Med food is not spectacular, it was 5 star compared to the food served at the Grand Oasis. While there were multiple choices, I do not want to see another hamburger for a while after 6 straight days of eating them at lunch. I had a hot dog the final day. These were the only things that were edible. For Dinner, stay away from Windows cafeteria and make reservations in the Italian or Tex Mex restaurants. You order off a menu and are served. The Italian restaurant requires men to wear pants. I could not understand if i could eat in shorts at Mortons in Puerto Rico, why i would have to wear long pants at a restuarant at a resort that was no where near the quality of an Olive Garden.Beach - the water was dirty with debri washing on to the shore. We went on a fishing trip on the Atlantic side of the island and the water was clear and appealing to swim in. There was plenty of seating. The saving of seats was just as obnoxious as any other Carribean resort i have stayed. On 2 occaision around 9 am, we had to wait for towels. I would never return to the Grand Oasis unless they made great strides in the food. I could deal with the other issues. It is a trade off, if you want a cheap vacation to get a sun tan the place may be for you. If food is important, try another place.
