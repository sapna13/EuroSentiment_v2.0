{"text":"The best of the best I've stayed everywhere in Sydney (not to name names but literally everywhere) and The Observatory was one of the very few hotels I have yet to try. So when I found out that another high end client was coming in and I had to make another trip up, I decided to give it ago. When I checked it I was greeted not only by the receptionist but the hotel manager came out to personally welcome me with a hand shake and spent a few minutes with me just before I was taken to my room. This is the first time any GM or HM has ever taken the time out to introduce himself and I was taken back by the attention to detail he and his team has shown.My room was impressive (can't remember the room number but it was a corner room with a nice balcony that gave me both city views and harbor views). It was perfectly sized and beautifully furnished with little note from the GM along with a few sugar coated strawberries at its side. Mind you, it take a hell of a lot to impress me and by this my mouth was getting sore because everywhere I looked it always seemed to drop to the floor. By far the best rooms in Sydney.I wanted to freshen up before my meeting and I was told by the lad who brought my luggage up that their was a spa downstairs so I decided to check it out. I didn't have any spa treatments (although I was tempted) but I did have a sauna and a steam along with a quick dip in their beautiful pool. All in all, very pleased with the spa and the service the spa provideI took my client to their main restaurant, and we were both very pleased. A bit rich in taste but still very good. Again, service was spot on. If you are to experience The Observatory Hotel, make sure you take some time and enjoy your room. In my mind, the best thing about their property. Their spa. restaurants and service are all just added bonuses. I left feeling better than I arrived and I can't wait to come back and do it all over again.Thank you.
