{"text":"Central Location and Free Extras! Recommended. The railway station is only really a few metres away and I must say that the background noise bugged me at first but I then got used to it. There was also disturbance from coaches in the early hours or the morning, and this was a nuisance but bearable.I took a taxi from the airport and it cost around EUR24, both coming and going. I was at the hotel\/airport within 25 minutes on each occasion.Although the hotel and the rooms are clean it does require a refurbishment in my opinion, someone simply decide that a facelift was required a few years ago and painted the walls doors and ceiling with a combination of magnolia cream and whte acrylici or emulsion paint. I think this historic building deserves better than this! The room doors look terrible, appear to have five or six layers of paint. The elevators were very efficient but even these, unfortunately, got a paint makeover and aesthetically they are really horrible, a four star hotel deserves better, for sure. Hotel should also invest in a card access system, instead of the existing simple key system.The bathroom was clean but fittings in the bathtub\/shower were broken and the whole room including the tiles and sanitary ware need replacing. Nice clean fluffy towels were supplied and all usual items\/accessories also there.Extras...extras...extras...I found a complimentary basket of fresh fruit on arrival and a chocolate on each pillow, which I thought were nice gestures. All minbar items are free and this normally contains two orange juices, two softdrinks and two beers - no chocolates or other edible items though, just liquids. I would recommend Monopol include a TOBLERONE bar of chocolate.The bed and the pillows in particular were very comfortable. The room had no wall mounted or ceiling airconditioning unit, there was a radiator heater which we switched on during one of the nights when temperature was unbearable. The reception staff were not particularly friendly, although they answered every question asked, they hardly ever smiled or showed any genuine interest. On one particular occasion when we asked where best to go shopping ...one of them simply stated Zeile...zeile.... (duh! not really we've never been here before....so be nice!). We got to the Zeile (not sure how you pronounce this) and it was a wonderful shopping experience. We also found time to visit the Grotehaus and Musem of Modern Art, both come highly recommended. One hour for each location is more than enough.Another freebie offered by Monopol ...free coffee and snacks all day in the lobby. The breakfast offers a good choice of cereals, meats, yoghurt, jams, cakes, eggs, fruits and fruit juices. The Monopol has pontential to offer more and instead of the freebies should seriously consider upgrading certain features\/facilities. Having said this I was pleased overall with the cleanliness, service and location, so I would consider booking again!
