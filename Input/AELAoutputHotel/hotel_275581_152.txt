{"text":"Top Hotel Just returned after a weekend break at the City Inn. A treat for my mum's 60th Birthday 5 girls (mixed age groups) went and could not have asked for a more perfect hotel. The check in, guest services, bar, restaurant and rooms were all top class. The hotel is in a fab location wherever you wish to go. We used the Original Tour Company bus which stopped at the end of the street. We hopped on and off over Saturday and Sunday (special deal in Feb) and visited most of the sites along the route. The City Inn is neighbours to Westminster Abbey and the Houses of Parliament which was a fantastic site to see each time you walked out the hotel.The staff were very pleasant and could not help us enough. We had a minor set back in the bar after ordering sandwiches. They never arrived however the manager could not fall over us anymore to help and gave us our round of drinks (√ä√£¬¢25) free. Something he did not need to do but a very very nice touch.The bar was very comfortable and trendy with fabulous music. Just made you want to sit there all day and night !We were not lucky enough to be on the 13th floor with the views however the rooms we had were superb. The decor is very modern with all mod cons cd player, dvd, web access etc. One of our rooms slept 3 and had more than enough room to accomodate us. The mini bar prices were also very reasonable.The breakfast was delicious. So much to choose from and something to please everyone. I suppose some people would say √ä√£¬¢17.50 is expensive for breakfast but the freshness and choice makes it all worth it.I would definately recommend this hotel to everyone no matter the age group and cannot wait to return.
