{"text":"Landmark Art Deco Hotel This circa 1942 hotel is not for everyone. Although its swimming pool sits between the hotel and the ocean, it's possible to stay at the Normandie for a week and not even realize it has a swimming pool, not to mention a beachfront location. This hotel looks inward, not out to sea. The hotel's view is the atrium lobby itself, seven stories high and capped by an enormous skylight. Like a Hyatt Regency, all rooms are accessed from hallways that overhang the perimeter of the atrium. In this case the guard rails are designed to recall the exterior deck rails on an ocean liner, specifically the S.S. Normandie (the Puerto Rican builder of this hotel met his French bride aboard this ship). The hotel has achieved national historic landmark status, so the authentic architectural details are here to stay, although the polychromed colors are gone, now favoring pastel blue grays that lighten the effect considerably.Other reviewers complain about the lack of restaurants in the area, yet the Caribe Hilton next door boasts no fewer than seven restaurants in all price ranges, poolside as well as indoors. The adjacent Escambron public beach has a sea-front restaurant that specializes in Puerto Rican cuisine. The Normandie is a five minute taxi ride to Old San Juan's music venues, bars, shops and restaurants (tourists staying in Isla Verde's resorts pay double the cab fare and waste 25 minutes each way to\/from Old San Juan).All that said, the Normandie is not a resort, nor is it a hotel for families with children, who would get bored quickly. It is an incredible bargain (booking directly through the hotel's web site yielded a rate of $135 per night per room during Thanksgiving week -- other hotel booking sites were quoting $179 or more) for a first class hotel. The hallways are a virtual gallery of original art. There is a hip club on the second floor that attracts classy locals. A la carte breakfasts are delicious (forget the lackluster buffet) and imaginative. The rooms are large and supremely comfortable. The small sitting rooms with desks or day beds were obviously once outdoor lanais, since their floors slope downward (drainage would have required that). Furnishings are high end -- even the ergonomic Herman Miller desk chair retails for $450. The bathrooms are spacious, functional and clean but lack the glamour of the room's interior furnishings.As for the complaints about location, if you want to stay put at an all-inclusive resort, go to Jamaica or the Dominican Republic. It would be a crime to go to San Juan and not visit Condado, Isla Verde and Old San Juan (located miles apart) -- so budget some taxi money or learn to use the absurdly cheap public bus system. I have stayed at the El San Juan Hotel, Intercontinental Resort, El Convento, Water Club -- as well as the charming At Wind Chimes Inn. For my money, the Normandie is the best bargain of them all. I'm staying here again on my next visit to San Juan.Note to those who booked by Priceline and mentioned a $10 per night surcharge for utilities -- that's an absurd practice that should be reported to Priceline. No such fee was added to my bill -- only taxes amounting to approx. 10%. Also, because this hotel does not have a casino, the extra 10% charge assessed by casino hotels does not apply.Terry Sisk ","annotations":[{"endOffset":764,"mention":"landmark","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Landmark_London"],"startOffset":756},{"endOffset":764,"mention":"landmark","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Landmark_London"],"startOffset":756},{"endOffset":1831,"mention":"gallery","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Gallery_Hotel"],"startOffset":1824},{"endOffset":1868,"mention":"club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1864},{"endOffset":2811,"mention":"Water Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Water_Club"],"startOffset":2801},{"endOffset":2811,"mention":"Water Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Water_Club"],"startOffset":2801},{"endOffset":2811,"mention":"Water Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Water_Club"],"startOffset":2801},{"endOffset":2811,"mention":"Water Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Water_Club"],"startOffset":2801}]}
