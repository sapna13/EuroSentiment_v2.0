{"text":"Derag Hotel Berlin I booked this hotel via the Derag website. They were running a summer special for 55 Euro a night. After reading all the previous reviews I decided to jump on it. What a lucky find!When you first enter the hotel you are struck by how beautiful the lobby is  how modern  stylish the hotel is too. We booked a double room which very nice  we especially loved the art work. My only complaint about the room is how oppressively hot it was the first evening. I know it isn't common in Germany for hotels to have A\/C, but I had hoped that since this hotel was newer this would be an exception. We left the windows open each night to sleep  it made it tolerable. We were also impressed by the superior customer service of all the hotel staff. On the day we checked out we ask for them to keep our luggage since we had a late flight  they had no problem accommodating. The biggest plus about this hotel is the proximity to the U-Bahn. The hotel is right outside of the Markishe Museum stop. It is also very close to a lot of the important monuments  museums if you choose to walk. We purchased a 3 day train pass at the Berlin Information Center that allows you to ride all of the trains  buses in Berlin. We saved ourselves a lot of money by doing this as well as purchasing a 3 day museum pass that allowed free access to all museums on museum island  as well as other museums.We would definitely recommend this hotel to others.Just a side note to anyone who is a cheap as me. lol I found a free walking tour that takes you to all of the important sites. The only thing that is asked is that you tip the tour guide at the end. It is a wonderful tour that starts at the Brandenburg Gate, then to Reichstag, Hitlers Bunker, Berlin Wall, Checkpoint Charlie, etc  then tour ends on Museum Island. ","annotations":[]}
