{"text":"Still a classic, but not what it used to be My fiance  I stayed here for 3 weeks in December, while renovations on our flat were being completed. We've lived in HK for 10  12 yrs, respectively,  are loyal fans of the Mandarin. We chose specifically to stay here instead of the Four Seasons because we love its character  old school charm; we're also frequenters of its FB outlets. However, after our stay, we couldn't help but feel it's missing the exceptional service it had pre-renovations, which came from having staff who genuinely cared about service  the hotel's guests. While we still got this feeling from some staff, many other staff seemed to be clueless that they were representing the legendary Mandarin service. In fact, I think the Mandarin London's service now beats that of the Mandarin HK.I would still recommend this place, especially to anyone who is tired of the soulless marble  glass flash of hotels across Asia. The room renovations are thoughtful, with deep bathtubs, a good lighting system  closet space, HDTV, a nice mini-bar,  very useful computer cables  butler's door (a la the Oriental Bangkok). Our room was quite dark (some would say cozy),  we missed the old balconies, but the rooms are now larger. Dealing with some of the room service operators was painful,  the food was forgettable, but the room service waiters were impeccable, as were the housekeeping staff. Requests were dealt with quickly.Two negatives need mentioning. First, in-room internet access cost $1000\/week, which I thought was exorbitant given many hotels around the world now offer wifi for free. The hotel blocked outside signals so it was impossible to use my laptop in the room without using the hotel's service. Second, after waiting 15 minutes in the taxi queue on a busy Friday night, the doorman gave my taxi to a man (referred to as sheik so-and-so) who cut in front of the line, clearly expecting to not have to wait. At the indignant cries of everyone standing behind me, the doorman said, But he is a VIP. And what were we, other paying guests - sub-VIPs?? You can imagine the response that got from those in line.... I was completely shocked  disappointed at this.I would finish by saying that the mince pies  mulled wine, as well as the roast chestnut man, who appeared in the lobby  at the front door for a couple of weeks before Christmas (as they do every year) almost brought back the old Mandarin feeling. Not quite, but of course they're still a nice touch....
