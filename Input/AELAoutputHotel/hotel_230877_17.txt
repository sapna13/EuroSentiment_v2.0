{"text":"Very comfy beds!! Me and my wife stayed at the Nova Hotel in Amsterdam from the 14th until the 17th December 2007. We loved our stay there. The Hotel is located very close to the Dam Square and the trams 1,2 and 5 pass the hotel so easy to get to. There were however some steep stairs to to our room (205), so unless you are reasonbly fit this should be no problem. So ask for a suitable room when you book there as one part of the hotel is serviced by a lift and the other has stairs and this may be daunting with suitcases! However I must state not all the rooms are serviced by steep stairs.The breakfast was excellent and we could not fault it! The staff at the hotel are friendly.Our room 205 was spacious, quiet and warm and a fridge which came in handy. The beds are very comfortable and we did not like getting out of them first thing in the morning.The bathroom was ok but was cold as there was no heating in our bathroom (no radiator). The toilet tissue was not replenished which meant we had to get our own. Furthermore the showerhead hinge was defective which meant we could not take a shower either!I did inform reception in the morning on the next day of our stay. When we returned in the evening the showerhead was still not tended to....what a pity because this is not a bad hotel....all it needs is an improvement in service..... ","annotations":[]}
