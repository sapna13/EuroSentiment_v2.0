{"text":"Great value - Much improved fitness area We have stayed at this Silver Cloud before and returned because it is great value for what you pay. The view over Lake Union is spectacular and worth the little extra we paid for it. Parking is secure and if you have a van or SUV you can park it on the upper level where the parking spaces are larger and actually designed for these larger vehicles. If you have stayed at a Silver Cloud hotel before you will know that they have a very good breakfast each morning that is included in the cost of your room. The breakfast area is very family friendly as is the whole hotel. Great place for families with kids.This is a 100% smoke free hotel which we appreciate. Also, it has been two years since we stayed at the Silver Cloud Lake Union and the biggest improvement I noticed was to the fitness area. They moved it from a tiny little room on the first floor to an outstanding room on the 3rd floor. It has lots of first-class equipment and three TV screens to watch while you are working out. My only complaint was that the mats in the fitness area were very thin and not very useful. I guess you could use two or three at once when you're doing your stretching. Aside from the mat issue though this was probably the best hotel fitness area I have seen in a long time. The hotel is also in a good area for runners or walkers and I noticed quite a few runners out by themselves which is always a good sign from a safety perspective.The shuttle service is also included in the cost of your room and will take you to downtown Seattle. We are a family of four and the shuttle service (a 10 or 12 passenger van) took us to Seattle Center, then picked us up later when we phoned for it. I'd suggest tipping the driver a couple of dollars as they do save you a lot of hassle by navigating the Seattle traffic on your behalf and save you having to pay taxi fare.The hotel is located just a few minutes from Interstate 5.
