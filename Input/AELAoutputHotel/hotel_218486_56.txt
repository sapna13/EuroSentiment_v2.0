{"text":"Nice place for the money. I agree with the reviews I have seen hear that say it is a nice place for the money. We got a good deal on an extended weekend trip through Apple Vacations. There were very few deals that left on a Thurday and returned on a Sunday from any of the vacation websites but this one came available so we gave it a shot. My family travel as a group of 8 with teens and seniors. My mother-in-law is in a wheelchair so I can say if you are traveling to the Dominican Republic, make sure you bring some strong people with you if you can not walk. The airport is small and you have to walk up and down steps to get on and off the planes there. We have traveled to most of the popular tourist places in Mexico and this place was a lot like them. It is not handicapped accessable in the same way things are here. A ground floor room was pretty much what they considered handicapped. My mother-in-law stayed in building 1 and the rest of the family was in building 7. Her building was completely enclosed so her room stayed a lot cooler than ours did. Our halls were open on the ends and the heat was so much during the mid day that the air conditioner just could not keep up. It was comfortable enough at night though. I won't go into too many details since my review is about like the rest of them here. I would say it is a you get what you pay for kind of place. It was a great price for a weekend at the beach I think. It is not a place I would spend an extended vacation of a week or 2 at. The beach was nice and we could always find a chair. There is a reef around the island so there are no big waves to hit you in the face. The water is moving enough to have fun bouncing in though. We could always find a pool chair when we wanted one too. The water in the pools was kind of warm and I think they shoudl do somthing to cool it down but the sun is so strond there I don't know how they could do that. Take lots of sunscreen with a high spf. We used a 70 and still got burned. We have stayed in lots of cruise port kind of vacation spots before and this place does not have that kind of shopping near by. There are lots of little trinket places but nothing like what you find in a port town. If you are coming for the shopping you may be disappointed. It is a beach vacation kind of place.About the hotel: I can't say much for the food since we only ate in the buffet while we were there. It was good though. I did here other people say they likes the other resturants on the site. We had the pizza by the pool and that was pretty good too. Not like American pizza but good. Drinks are stronger at the bars than in the dinning room. The dinning room staff was nice, friendly and helpful. I think they only know enough English to do their job. They just smiled when you asked them a question that did not relate to what they were there to do. We know very little Spanish but got on ok. There are people staying at the resort from all over the world which was kind of fun. My husband went scuba diving and really enjoyed it. We did not use the company that is on the hotel grounds. It was somthing I found on the internet. If we were to do it again, I would book at the hotel. It is very difficult to get from hotel to hotel unless you walk up the beach. They will not let you enter another hotel's grounds unless you have on their bracelet. Not much else to say I guess. Like I said, we had a good time. Could have been better but not bad over all. You can email me if you have any questions.
