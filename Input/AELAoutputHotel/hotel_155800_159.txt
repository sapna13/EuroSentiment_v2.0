{"text":"Nice time, but wouldn't go back This was my first stay at the El San Juan, as well as my first trip to Puerto Rico (although I am a frequent traveler to other destinations). I did a lot of online research to determine where to stay and I think that the reviews on Tripadvisor are pretty accurate. We went for a long weekend from Boston (3\/23-3\/26) and so I wanted to stay somewhere nice that was also centrally located. As other reviews have mentioned, the pools are great and the lobby is lovely (it has an old world Cuban feel, with a tad bit of cheesey Las Vegas added in because of the casino and shopping galleria). I didn't love the beach, but it was fine.We stayed in a renovated room. The furniture was pretty cheap (like it came from Ikea) and I agree with another reviewer who said that the shower was odd (no door so water got on the bathroom floor). There was no full length mirror and there was no place to hang a wet bathing suit (strange for a hotel on the beach). The walls are paper thin (like no other hotel I have stayed in). We awoke to a party at 3am one night (security had to break it up) and then heard tv\/music in the other room anytime they had it on. I also know that other guests had similar experiences. Otherwise, the room was fine. We were also at the El San Juan when they had their Coors Light party that took up the area around the two main pools. The attendees at this party were generally not the paid guests of the hotel. I overheard a lot of people expressing their disappointment that the hotel was more interested in revenue from Coors Light instead of making sure that their guests were happy. The party went from noon until midnight and I can't imagine that anyone with rooms near the pools would be able to get any sleep until this ended (not a problem for most people, but a real problem for the families with children, I would imagine). Overall, I think that the hotel should decide if it wants to be a luxury hotel or if it is aiming at those in their 20's who are there to party. Everyone in Puerto Rico went out of their way to be nice to us. However, I wouldn't say that the service at the El San Juan was special in any way. Everyone was nice, but no one was exceptionally friendly or helpful.Overall, we enjoyed ourselves but I would not go back.
