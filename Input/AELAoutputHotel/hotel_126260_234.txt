{"text":"A True Palace! A return visit for my boyfriend and I to New York after a fantastic time Christmas\/New Year 05\/06.We arrived at The New York Palace around 4pm on Thursday 28th December 2006 to be greeted by the very friendly and welcoming door men. Our luggage was taken care of and we were directed to the main reception area to check in. Though extremely busy, the service was spot on and everything was taken care of straight away for us, our email before hand had been worth while, (I recommend this to ensure a magnificent view!) as we were given a room high up and looking over St.Patrick's Cathedral which we had requested. We were briefly shown around the absolutely wonderfully decorated hotel and then taken up to our room. The room was immaculate, very nicely furnished and surprisingly big for a city hotel. The view was breath-taking especially at night, St.Patrick's Cathedral, the fwell known yellow taxi's beneath us and Sak's to the left - what more could you want! Room service was excellent, we quite often bought some wine to drink in the room as the prices downstairs were quite steep, so ice buckets were requested and were with us within minutes, always by a friendly member of staff!Location wise, we couldn't ask for anything better, minutes walk to everything uptown and if not, the subway was just around the corner. A truely FANTASTIC hotel, we were very sad to leave. A deffinate on our return list, it`s a must!! A true Palace!!
