{"text":"Holiday In Paradise Where do i start everything was fantastic. The hotel grounds were beautiful. Everywhere you looked there were gardeners keeping everything trimmed and tidy. There was not one piece of rubbish on the resort everywhere was clean. The rooms were very nice but i wouldnt say they were 5* standard. We had a room with one king size bed and had a connecting door leading to a room with two double beds as i had two teenagers with me. The rooms were big and spacious, with a\/c, Minibar, TV, Jacuzi bath and shower, Fan, Sofa bed, Telephone, Table and chairs, Coffee Maker and Balcony or terrace. The maids were fantastic the rooms were cleaned every day and clean towels every day. Every bathroom had a basket with shampoo, bath gel, sewing kit, shaving kit, and shoe shine. This was restocked daily. The minibar was also restocked daily which had Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, 7Up, Tango, Cans of Beer and bottles of water.  There are 3 lake size pools. two are next to each other and the other one is on the beach which is the main one. each pool has a swim up bar where you can get any drink you can think of. the two swimming pools that are next to each other are quieter than the main pool at the beach. The pool near the beach alos had a swim up bar and also had 4 snack bars surrounding it. The sun bed are all taken by 10:00 am so you have to be up early to get a bed.  The beach is beautiful the sand is like white dust and the sea is warm. Some days the sea was a little choppy which brought a little sea weed. The beach had bar where you could get any kind of drinks from. The entertainment was run by the annimation team who were fantastic at entertaining you. Everyday they had arobics on the beach along with vollyball, football and much more. Then on the afternoon they have water arobics and games which entertained every one. The buffet was beautiful it had a wide range of foods to choose from. (salads, pizzas, pastas, burgers, meats, seafood, deserts, childrens selection and much more.) Every night was a different theme. The waiters wer excellent. sometimes they would be to quick to take your plate away. as soon as you had finished your food they would take your plate away within a second. There were lots of other Restaurants to choose from.  There is a selection of shops in Pueblo principe where you can buy T-shirts and Souvenirs. Theres also a casino and a night club in pueblo principe which is open on a night.  The is a lots more things there but you cant write everything because there is to much to write.
