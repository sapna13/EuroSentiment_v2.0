{"text":"GOOD LOCATION- take your eye covers THis is really a great property with excellent facilities.We stayed in the Kent Street Tower in a 2 bed apartment.There was an ensuite bathroom to the 2nd bedroom ( 2 singles).This was small but functional.And there was also a main bathroom for the apt as well- this one had a tub in it as well as a shower.There was a BIR in the second bedroom.Good kitchen facilities and laundry facilities in the apt.There was a DVD player and a balcony.Downstairs at the cafe on Kent St there is free Wifi if you buy coffees etc.The hotel does have internet facilities at a charge.Excellent location- 2 blocks downhill from the Town Hall train station so you can come in from the airport and walk down with your wheely case.Also about a 5 minute walk to Darling Harbour..My only complaint and also of my friend is the blinds.They have no block-out ability so once the sun is up, so are you.I am not sure if this is in every apartment but it was definitely an issue after we had been on the razz the night before and wanted a bit of a sleep in!! I kid you not, the existing blinds may as well not be there...I thought there would be another blind or something to block out the light..... so take your eye covers from the plane if you want a bit of darkness!Otherwise--- this is a fabulous property and good value.I would only recommend this based on location and as I am an agent, I would be looking at other properties in the area.
