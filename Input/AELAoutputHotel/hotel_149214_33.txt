{"text":"Unexpected Excellence Revisited This visit - February 10 to 17 - was the second year running we visted the Punta Cana Resort and Club so we had a basis for comparison year to year. How did we do the second time around? Very well indeed. Transport from the airport by hotel car was on time and excatly where it was supposed to be. Because our rooms were not ready (they never are), we had a gratis Planter's Punch at the reception desk while we went through the paperwork. Then, lunch at Franco's Pizzeria, poolside, and the rooms were available.What has changed in a year? Not much. A new room card key is being used instead of cash at all the venues. If anything the food quality has improved in all of the restaurants we visited; La Choza (good hamburgers and excellent fish), La Yola at the Marina (anything is superb and rather expensive and the best Pina Coladas in the area); Mamma Venezia (excellent Italian fare and a most reasonable quality wine list - glasses of very fine red and white house wines are $5-$7 each; and Anani with Carribian specialities in a spectacular room and a most outstanding dessert - Dolce di Leche in a large almond (fortune cookie type) shell. Rich, glabrous, delicious, like molten toffee. The basic buffet restaurant, La Cana stll puts on an extensive display of fine foods for breakfast and dinner. Note - all at the restaurants, drinks - with the exception of coffe and tea - are extra and world class wines are available at very good prices. La Cana offered roast suckling pig (which my wife enjoys) our first night there, so the room business was forgiven.If you need amusement, shows, gambling, etc., the Punta Cana resort and Club is not for you. If you play golf, tennis, the sundry water sports or just want to work on your tan, quietly, this is the place. Couple of advisories: The pizza at Franco's Pizzeria is still the worst in the Carribean. Towels for the pool are now available at the pool - you don't have to shlep them from the towel place on the beach. If you have T-Moble cell phone service, check with them to make sure their partner Orange (in the Dominican Republic) is running at Punta Cana. We had no cell phone service with Orange during last week. Watch out for the bargain cigarettes at the duty free shop at Punta Cana airport. The Marlboro cigarettes seem to be locally made and have no Virginia tobacco.We again loved the Punta Cana Resort and Club and will be making plans to visit it again next year.
