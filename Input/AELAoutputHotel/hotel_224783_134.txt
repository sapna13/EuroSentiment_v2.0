{"text":"Great Stay at the Grand Hyatt in Seattle I recently stayed at the Grand Hyatt in Seattle, Washington for four nights. The purpose of the trip was for business. Upon arriving at the hotel, I asked for a nice room and was told that it would cost $30 extra per day for such a room. Considering that I did not want a room on the lower floors where I would be staring at a concrete wall of another hotel, I agreed to pay the extra money. I was told the room would be ready in 15 minutes so we went to dinner at the Cheesecake Factory that was on the next corner. Two hours later, we returned only to fnd the room the was still not ready. We went up to my coworkers room and the front desk called to state that the room was still not ready but I would be upgraded to an executive suite. The hotel quickly recognized that an issue existed and immediately fixed it by providing an update.  If you ever have the chance to stay in the executive suite, please do it. The view from the 27th floor was breath-taking as you are high enough to see out over the water and you can see the Space Needle. The execute suite is actually two rooms with two bathrooms. One room consists of a sitting room with TV, wet bar with refrigerator (note that in other rooms, you have to pay to use the refrigerator), closet and bathroom. The other room was the bedroom with TV, desk, walk in closet, bathtub, separate glass enclosed shower, and bathroom. Note that there are doors separating the rooms which means less noise from the hallway when you are sleeping. Plus, the hotel has curtains that operate from a switch on the wall. For those that like sleeping in total darkness, these curtains will do the trick. Once you press the switch, the curtains come down from the ceiling and cover the windows. The suite was exceptionally clean and well maintained. And considering that the suites are bigger than the rooms, there are less people on the floor. This meant that it was quieter than what my coworkers had on their floors below.The hotel is within walking distance to a variety of attractions. The Space Needle, the Market, Convention Center (where we had to attend a conference), Pike Place Market and lots of clothes shopping are easy to get to. Also, the Pike Place Market has the infamour Pike Place Fish Market so for those familiar with it, go check out the staff working there. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.
