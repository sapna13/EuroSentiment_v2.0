{"text":"Good Hotel This hotel is large and it appears suited to the business traveller. We booked a Grand Club room and this included breakfast and evening drinks. This was very good value and the Club Lounge has a nice ambience. The staff here were quite friendly. The breakfast was continental and exactly the same each morning. There was also a service desk so accounts could be settled in peacful surroundings. Internet access was free in the club lounge so checking emails was easy.Our room overlooked Scotts Road. It was very spacious as we had a bedroom, bathroom and a spacious lounge with a nice area for working. The furnishings in the lounge were begining to look tired and the carpet required cleaning. The room was serviced twice daily which was nice. The bathroom had two showers the hand held and the rain shower which was lovley. Also great mirrors. I am never sure who uses the bathroom scales but I guess it is a nice touch if you are weight consious. The toilet was seperate so that was good.Two Tvs and 49 channels if you can't find anything better to do. This hotel had the best security I have ever experienced in a hotel. No chance here of intruders getting near your room. The Oasis by the pool was a good place to have lunch and a drink . The gardens around the Oasis were quite beautiful and it difficult to imagine that I was still in Singapore. Mezza9 gets rave reviews and whilst the food is excellent the service and atmostphere were lacking. it was like eating in a giant cafeteria. However it was very popular so I guess it is all a matter of taste.Scotts Bar was lovley for an evening drink. Brix the nightclub was also OK .I visit Singapore regularly and I usually stay at the Marina or City Hall district. I must say I prefer this area to Scotts Road which is too frenetic for me. I also prefer the Ritz Carlton becuase of their more personal service and rooms to die for. However if you are a shopper two minutes from the door of the Hyatt is Tangs and the rest of Orchard road. It is also in a great location for the MRT.
