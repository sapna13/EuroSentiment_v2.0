{"text":"Would stay there again! We rocked up at the Barcelona train station and the Information Office at the terminal booked this place for us based on the criteria we gave - which was walking distance to the central shopping district as well as the beach, around the 100 euro mark - and they got us just that! (NB: we did go in 2006 so the price may have changed). It's located in a central location and is a really modern looking hotel! The first room we received was clean and modern but in the summer heat of Spain, the air conditioning unit wasn't doing much, so we advised the reception desk  they moved us to an even bigger room which had a bathroom the size of a normal hotel room! I'm not sure if you can request the room size but definitely ask for the larger room! Must say, both rooms were spacious but the larger just felt like it was a 5star place!The staff were just lovely and very accommodating. The hotel looked brand new and yes, the location was in an alleyway but most of the hotels near the beach were - and it didn't feel dangerous at all. We were two girls walking down the alleyway at 4am in the morning and felt fine!However, on another note - I feel it is it important to tell other tourists that La Rambla (the main shopping street) is fairly dangerous late at night, mainly for males who often get harassed by the local prostitutes who get violent if the males take up any of their time without payment (even just talking to them!). My advice would be to pass them quickly without making much eye contact to avoid any trouble with them. ","annotations":[]}
