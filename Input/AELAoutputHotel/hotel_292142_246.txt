{"text":"Fine some positives some negatives I recently stayed 6 nights at the Affinia. In summary it was acceptable\/fine even if not fantastic:Goods points:- Suite included full kitchen which allowed me to eat in if I wanted to- Free fruit at front desk, papers delivered etc- Housekeeping was good, room was clean (I honestly can't say I noticed any unclean areas as mentioned in earlier reviews during my stay)- Pillow menu is a novel option and my requests were bought straight up upon calling- Reception was responsive (eg on check in I took trip advisor's advice and asked for a room with a view and was given a room on level 36 with view over the harbour\/wall street area, they also promptly fixed up a maintenance issue I had whilst I went out for lunch)- Comfortable bed, big desk to work at- Shop around and you can get a range of prices, I used gta hotels site and got a much cheaper deal than other sites offeredBad\/not so good points:- Older style rooms, don't go there and expect luxury, it is a 3 to 3.5 star hotel- Noisy aircon\/heating in my room, made it difficult to sleep with it on but it could just have been my room.....- location, for a first time NYC visitor I felt it was a little out of the for walking or buses (I didn't use the subway so this may be more convenient), I still felt safe in the area even though it wasn't particularily busy at night. - Barking Dog cafe didn't really impress me ","annotations":[]}
