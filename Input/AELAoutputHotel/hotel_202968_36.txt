{"text":"Great hotel and good location! I booked the Hotel Pierre , not having been to Florence before. Now that I have been there I realize that the location was absolutely perfect - in the center of things, but quiet , a quick walk to the Duomo, Uffizi, steps from the Piazza Repubblica which was a great plaza full of restaurants and cafes, street peddlers with quality wares and on the weekend wonderful free entertainment ranging from opera singers to dancing. The hotel itself was very clean and well kept. The room was comfortable and nicely furnished and featuring hardwood floors, and the bath marble , spacious and clean. Laundry service was reasonable and fast.  The breakfast was above average for European breakfasts, offering yogurts, croissants, pastries, cheeses, cold cuts and fruit. Eggs are available at a small cost. The concierge was unusually helpful , assisting me in unusual requests as I was settling my daughter in for a year of schooling in Florence (and as a result came up with some unusual requests like the best company for a cell phone, somewhere to find a computer printer, and where to purchase scissors). The fellow called around for me, advised me of the best prices and places, made sure I went when the stores were open (Florence = nothing open on Monday mornings!) and was truly a godsend. I would definitely stay here again. I might add that I ended up a few nights at the Hotel Baglioni, also a nice hotel but lacking the personal attention and concern that Hotel Pierre offers (the concierge wanted my room number before she would call a cab for me...) and it is also near the main train station, which, while convenient ,does not have the same ambience as the area near the piazza republica. So, when I go back to Florence, I will be back at Hotel Pierre.
