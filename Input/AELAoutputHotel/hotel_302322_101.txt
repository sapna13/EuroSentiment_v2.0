{"text":"Excellent hotel, enjoyed our stay at the Harbour Plaza Just returned from spending New Year in Hong Kong, staying at the Harbour Plaza. It would be difficult to find fault with this hotel, beautiful views and all the staff were polite and helpful. We took the airport express to Kowloon and then the free shuttle bus to the hotel, all well sign posted and no waiting, from landing to reaching our room took about 90 minutes. It is worth buying an Octopus Card at the airport, public transport in Hong Kong is very easy to use and cheap, we toured Hong Kong Island, took the Peak Tram and the ferries to outlying islands, used the metro and over 5 days it cost us √ä√£¬¢15. On arriving at the hotel the check in process was smooth and we were upgraded to Harbour Club Class on the 19th floor, do pay a little extra for the harbour view, this certainly made our stay. A ferry pier is 5 minutes from the hotel and you can go to both Central and Wan Chai from here, the only drawback is that these routes stop running about 8pm. This did not cause problems as the hotel runs a free shuttle service ( but do get to it early to get a seat) or public bus No 6 runs past the hotel, if all else fails it is a 25minute walk along the harbour front from the middle of Kowloon. For us the position of this hotel was not a problem, the quality, service, view and price were well worth any slight inconvenience. Loved Hong Kong and would stay at the Harbour Plaza again.
