{"text":"Wonderful family vacation I just returned from a week at Club Med, Punta Cana with my family; we were 15 people, including my wife and I, our 3 children and their spouses, and 7 grandchildren ages 7-12. We were delighted with all aspects of the vacation - the accomodations were excellent, the GOs who run the place were pleasant and very helpful, and there are so many activities that every one found ways to stay happily occupied all day, if they wanted to-or could relax by the pool or beach, when that was the preference. Our grandchildren took advantage of the Mini-club some of the time; but they were also happy to be on their own, going from pool to beach, or other activities such as archery or circus - sometimes with the rest of our group, sometimes on their own. The place seemed so secure that we allowed the children to be on their own part of the time, and that worked well. Meals were terrific - quality, variety and abundance - and we enjoyed the Hispaniola restaurant where the meals are served. The bars and snack bar were also readily accessible and provided good food and drink in the middle of the day. The only negatives were the constant wind - which kept it cooler, but made it more difficult to do sailing or windsurfing unless one is experienced - and occasional maintenance issues which were generally handled promptly. We have not gone to Club Med before; we enjoyed it so much we are planning to go again next year.
