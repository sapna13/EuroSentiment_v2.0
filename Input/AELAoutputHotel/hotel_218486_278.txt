{"text":"Don't go here We stayed here Oct.8 to Oct.15. 2006.We booked with 18 people.They came with me to celebrate my 10 year wedding anniversary and watch us renew our vows. I called the resort and emailed before we got there.Ocean Bavaro never emailed me back.I went to guess services upon arrival and they printed me out a package written in spanish that I could not read but for the $900.00 U.S.I told them again that I did not need a package deal just 10 min. of thier time on Oct.10 on the beach at sunset.They told me for 3 days to keep coming back and every time I went back they told me to come back again.A friend of mine ended up saying our vows to us because the hotel didn't want to be bothered with me.I was willing to pay them 150.00. The resort was nice but the beach was littered with plates,cups,straws,and cigarett butts.My bathroom ceilng leaked when it rained it rained 3 times when we were there.At least my room didn't flood like others.We were bugged all the time by time share people who could not take no for an answer. The food was bad for the most part.By wed. all 18 of us had the diarrhea and not from drinking the water.The servers would take your plates and drinks away before we were done with them.You could not go back up for seconds at the restaurants they would tell you no more.Depending on the girl taking your request whether she understood any language that day is whether you got in the restaurants or not.I got the feeling the did not like americans just our money.I understand that ocean bavaro is a 4 apple and how I don't understand. I've stayed at other 4 apples and was treated far better .Ocean Bavaro should be a 1 or 2 apple based on service alone. SAVE YOUR MONEY GO SOME PLACE ELSE! ","annotations":[]}
