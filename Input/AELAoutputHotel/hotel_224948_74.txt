{"text":"A few glitches - but nice My wife and I decided to take a long weekend, including a Monday off work, and spend it in San Francisco. We chose the Omni based on its reputation and location. Both lived up to expectations but for one glitch - the internet was down our entire stay.First the good. The location is perfect; in the heart of the embarcadero and financial districts and on the outskirts of China Town. You can easily walk to the farmers market (Sat and Tues), Coit tower, China Town, North beach or Union Square. The hotel staff were friendly and efficient and the Hotel was a pleasant level of old school; clean, comfortable and well cared for. We booked a signature room, which was a good size and high up on the 16th of 17 floors. Our package included parking and internet for $239 a night. Ask for this package when booking. The restaurant bar in the lobby, Bob's Bar (not the steakhouse) had great food and drinks and seems to be where locals and local business people hang out - it was fun.Now the minor bad - which left a bad taste. The internet, which they charge for in standard rooms and even the business center, was out all three days. Each time we called, the front desk gave us a differnt explanation and a different timeframe for its solution. We wanted the internet to search for restaurants, events and attractions. We also needed it to access our offices to justify a last minute day off. I asked if we could use the business office internet and they said sure, swipe your credit card Internet was free in our room but we had to pay - not cool.
