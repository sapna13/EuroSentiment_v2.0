{"text":"Lovely Hotel in a Wonderful Location My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights in September. We booked the Bilderberg Jan Luyken after much searching on the Internet - and what an excellent choice! The staff at the hotel were friendly and efficient and very welcoming. For an extra √à√\u2020√ü?5 per night we upgraded to a larger room, which was definitely worth it to have a little bit more space and comfort. The room was clean and had all the amenities we required.The hotel is a perfect location in my opinion. From Central Station take the no 2 or no 5 tram and get out at Hobbemastraat \/ Rijksmuseum stop. The Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh museum are just around the corner and around the other corner is the Hoofdstraat - Amsterdam's premier shopping district. There are not many restaurants\/bar in the area but Liedesplein is only a 10 minute walk and the trams run until about 0030. A nice bar for a cocktail or beer is Momo and is only about 10 minutes walk away from the hotel (head towards Liedesplein).A few tips... I would definitely recommend booking your tickets for the Anne Frank house online - saves the queuing. If you are into your cocktails and trying something a little bit different visit the House of Bols opposite the Van Gogh museum. Not only do you get a cocktail you also get to try some of the Bols liqueurs. The Canal Bus is an excellent way to see the city and you can hop on and off as you please. Pick up one of their timetables as well and you'll get discount coupons for restaurants\/musuems etc. And finally, watch out for bicycles - they're everywhere!!!
