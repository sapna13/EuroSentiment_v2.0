{"text":"Top Location, Quaint  Firstly, the Colon is not one of the designer boutique hotels that Barcelona abounds with, so if this is what you're expecting you'll be dissapointed. It's a traditional European style four star, with all of the typical facilities that you would expect - a concierge to take your luggage at the door, a well decorated lobby, a beautiful bar, and excellent room service. I stayed in a single room - definitely the biggest single I've ever experienced. The integrated TV was also a bonus as I hadn't brought my laptop, however the mouse on the keyboard was a little frustrating. The reception on the English language TV channels is also poor (and there are only news English language channels - CNN  SkyNews - I would recommend introducting at least the BBC world service). But the room was extremely comfortable (especially the bed), the bathroom was large and spotless, and the room's quaint decor was a nice oasis to retreat to. The hotel's location is of course it's real selling point. Directly opposite the Cathedral in the Venetian-style Barri Gothic, once you step out of the doors on to the square, it's obvious that you're on holidays. The Cathedral square is a fun place to people-watch, with plenty of bar terraces, and there's often live band entertainment in the evenings. This area is also a lot less seedy, safer, and more well-lit than the areas where many of the other four stars are located in Barcelona. On my return to Barcelona, I'll definitely be heading straight back to the Colon.
