{"text":"Lovely Hotel in Excellent Location - but breakfast prices are exhorbitant. The Radisson Plaza in the heart of Sydney's CBD was a great place to stay on a weekend visit to Sydney. The location, just a short stroll from the Central Quai and a few blocks from the George Street Shops and the touristy Darling Harbour, was ideal for pedestrian travellers. It will be our first choice on a return visit to the city.Booking via the internet was efficient and easy.Our room while on the smaller side, was perfect for the two of us. It was excellently maintained, and extremely comfortable.All of the staff we met from doorman to concierge were extremely courteous and helpful, and we could only praise their professionalism and their service. It was much of the same calibre as boutique hotels in which we have stayed, and there is a very comfortable small hotel feel to the Radisson Plaza.Our only complaint was with the buffet breakfasts. The buffet trays were not always kept full, and the choices were somewhat mundane. At thirty plus Australian Dollars per person, we felt the prices exhorbitant and after one breakfast, we walked across the street to a cafe. There, waiting for our order to arrive, we sipped coffee and juice, enjoyed the passing parade and talked to each other. We did not have to wait in line for a short order cook who was trying to catch up on the bacon tray, stand in line for toast to be cooked, wait for the juice container to be refilled, and hope that there would be hot hashbrowns or pancakes ready when we finally got to that section of the buffet. . It actually took less time for our restuarant ordered breakfast to arrive, and it cost significantly less ($7.00 Au) per person. . A significant difference in price.We noticed in booking, that the prices for the rooms dropped as it got closer to our anticipated date of arrival. We paid quite a few dollars less than the rate that was initially posted for the room by waiting until shortly before our arrival date to reserve. If we excluded the breakfast experience from our review, we would have rated our stay as excellent, and we recommend this hotel highly.
