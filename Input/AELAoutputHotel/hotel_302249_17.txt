{"text":"Overall, Great!!  Without a doubt, this was a very enjoyable stay. We booked it for 4 nights for the end of June and when we arrived we were pleasantly surprised at how many Javanese families were staying at the hotel. As it turned out, the vacation period had just begun for Indonesia. The feel of the hotel became lively and always interesting. Some families enjoyed teaching us some Indonesian phrases. My wife and I truly enjoyed the private beach and the salt water swimming pool, (no kids under 12 years old allowed without an adult). It was well worth the 148 steep steps down the side of a hill to get there. Unfortunately, we were unable to go swimming in the waves, for red flags were posted each day we were there. However, this was not a problem for they have a salt water swimming pool that gives you the illusion of being eye level to the ocean, although you're about 20 meters above it. Serinity at its finest. There were a couple of negative situations that should be mentioned, but didn't ruin our overall stay here. The breakfast wasn't very good and limited in selection. We had to compete with the fruit flies, for food for the buffet area was out in the open and not in an enclosed area. There were also birds flying around in the bread area. We didn't stay in the Club , so it may be better off on that end. Also, on our first morning of our stay, we arrived at the breakfast buffet area at 7:30am and were told that they didn't have any available seats for two and we would have to wait for 10 minutes. This was fine, for it gave me ample time to go to the front desk and complain personally to the manager that my newspaper hadn't been sent to my room , as had been requested. I was also able to tell him my first impressions of the breakfast buffet area. The manager was Goood. He had a way of defusing me and letting the steam out of my kettle to the point that I had forgotten why I went to see him. Needless to say, the missing newspaper situation never happened again, and I had a better attitude when seated for our buffet breakfast. The other situation that should be mentioned was their overpriced restaurants, and the low exchange rates offered by the hotel for USD to INR. In the evenings, my wife and I would take a taxi to the Intercontinental Hotel down the road, to exchange money (Close to\/the same as posted by Bloomberg), and also to enjoy their reasonably priced sunset dinners. This other hotel also had a regular shuttle to the DFS in Kuta.  My wife told me I shouldn't concern myself with the the price of things at the Ritz, for it IS The Ritz. However, in my mind, you should get what you pay for and nothing less than that. Other than these two situations, our overall stay at this hotel was wonderful. The great people that worked there, and the diversity and friendliness of all the people we encountered on our 5 day stay at this hotel will always be positively remembered.  On another note, a few European guests took us in as students in the sport of soccer, or football as the rest of the world calls it. We spent a very pleasant evening watching the Euro-Cup with these lads and their families. They even allowed me to wear my New England Patriots football shirt. I think they appreciated the effort from this American soccer student.
