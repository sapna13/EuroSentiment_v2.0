{"text":"Very Different! My boyfriend and I traveled to Amsterdam and where a bit worried that the hostel we picked would be dirty and well, what all 1st time travelers would think about a hostel.With that said, we where pretty pleased!It was very easy to find and if you take the train into Amsterdam it is not a far walk at all (about 5 mins if you know where you are going and 10 if not). We where driving from Paris, which was a bit of a problem as there is no parking. The lady at the front desk was very helpful on saving us money and showed us where to park outside of the city to take the train in.The hostel is in a great spot as it is not deep in the red light and is in a very quite spot. There is also a police station right around the corner from it. We only had one night where there were people in the streets yelling and someone came out and told them to shut up as no one wanted to hear it. The downstairs is a bar and is very clean and friendly. We had a private room including private bathroom. Each room in the hostel is different and ours was no expectation. We walked into the room and went down a long hallway, and then stairs that went down to a king size bed in the middle of the room with the craziest walls ever. The room was a very good size, with lots of room to move around and a table with two chairs and also a TV with cable. The only problem we had with the room itself was the fact the shower was missing the door and the drain was clogged so the water would just build up. Also there was no where for toilet paper. The bathroom would get a 2 in my books. We did have clean towels every day and where never bothered!You can come and go from the hostel as much as you want, you leave your room key in at the front desk and they give you a card you have to show to get your key back when you return. At 1st we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care for leaving our key but nothing was touched in our room and if they needed or wanted to get in there im sure they have extra keys! They lock the front door at a certain time and you have to ring the bell and wait for the guy to let you in. Out of all the hostels we walked past I would prefer to go back to this one. Besides the fact it was clean, each time you stay you will have a different room and that it self was a winner in my book! My boyfriend would say his favorite thing was the girls in the windows behind our hostel; they always seemed to be the best looking girls in the district, the VIP bunch! ","annotations":[]}
