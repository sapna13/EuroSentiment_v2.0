{"text":"Mixed Feelings Stayed here for a week in January. The hotel is gorgeous, though the walls around the guest rooms are extremely scuffed and in need of repainting. First the negatives: Unfortunately, my room looked nothing like the luxurious photos on the website- it looked like something you'd find in an old Best Western and the furnishings probably date to the 1960s or 70s. The room looked out on a dreary alley complete with hanging laundry. The outlet in the bathroom did not work, and the box of tissues was not replaced after they ran out on the 3rd day. The safe did not work after several efforts to program it. The walls are very thin- we heard everything in the room next door, and despite being on the 3rd floor, the late-night noise from the 1st floor bar and live singer was loud enough to wake us. The bed was also rock-hard, so if you like a soft bed you will be disappointed (though my back felt great after sleeping on it). Internet access was more expensive here than I've paid elsewhere.On the positive side, the room was very large by European standards. The bathroom was also large, with a double sink, a very nice touch. It could be hard to navigate around the hotel as each floor seemed to have multiple levels, but I thought it made the place more interesting. The breakfast selection was fantastic. The front desk staff was very accommodating and made excellent recommendations for dining. Most of all, this hotel is in a prime location- walking distance to the Duomo, Uffizi, Ponte Vecchio, and all of the best shops. Overall, I had a very positive experience. The room was a disappointment, but the staff and services were great. I would definitely stay here again, and request an updated room on the opposite side of the hotel from the lounge!
