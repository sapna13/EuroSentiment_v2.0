{"text":"Not what it used to be i've stayed at this hotel many, many times, from the week after opening, until my most recent stay last month. I feel I am therefore in a position to say that the service has gone down a notch or two. The service at the front desk is not as effortless or as friendly as it used to be. During the first two years of operation I felt that the Ritz-Carlton was the best hotel in Singapore hands down. However now, whether it's due to cost cutting or otherwise, the staff is not up to their own previously set standards. The reception staff is often distracted, juggling several tasks at once. On two seperate check in occasions the staff was brisk in replies to the point of being discourteous.In the past I sent my clients, family and friends to this hotel. The emergence of several excellent boutique hotels and serviced apartments in Singapore make the Ritz Carlton a less attractive proposition. If a premium price is to be charged, the serivce had better be up to the level. It isn't. As a result I cannot recommend this hotel as a first choice. If I pay a premium I want premium service, it's as simple as that. The interior upholstery fabrics, carpets, and lighting scheme could use a refresh as well; they're looking tired. The Ritz-Carlton is still better than average; it's just not as good as it used to be.On a plus point, the bathrooms are still the most romantic and breathtaking in Singapore. And the sashimi served in the small Japanese restaurant is amongst the top three in South East Asia.The hotel still deserves an above average rating but in terms of value for money it is distinctly average.
