{"text":"Extreme relaxation I have to say that I was really scared about going to this hotel after reading many of the reviews. It was my mother's 60th b-day so I wanted a relaxing place for a girls weekend get away. I have to say, that from the time we arrived the place was breathtaking. The girl at the front desk was extremely polite and answered all our questions ( i think her name was Isabel) The place is quite and very relaxing. The grounds are enchanting and during the evening the place looks magical. With that said it is not a place for someone who wants to experience alot of nightlife. I booked a spa day for my mother I and although I thought that the robes could have been nicer, it didn't take away from the great massage that we received. The dinner at Cafe Soleil was exquisite,we had a stuffed snapper with huge fried plaintains and I was still full the next day. The food was a bit on the expensive side but delicious!!!! Luckily I has become a member of the Sol Melia hotel chain( free) you show your membership number to the waiter and 2 people get to eat for the price of one, this only applies to breakfast, but a full buffett costs around 25.00 dollars for 2 people, in my opinion it was worth it. My mother and I loved the place. The staff was attentive and very friendly. If you want a place to relax and unwind this is the place. ","annotations":[]}
