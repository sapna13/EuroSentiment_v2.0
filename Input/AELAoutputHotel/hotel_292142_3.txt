{"text":"Huge room, quiet location We stayed here based on the reviews on Trip Advisor - it's a great place, but I feel like it's a bit over-hyped.The rooms are massive - loads of empty floor space - and they have proper kitchens and large bathrooms. There's about 20 light switches, all with dimmers, which I found fascinating because I have the brain of a 4 year old. There's a spacious fridge and an actual gas oven in the room, though ours was busted (couldnt get the pilot light to come on - we didnt need it so we assumed it was off for a reason and left it).The hotel lobby and corridors are cramped, which makes the size of the rooms a nice surprise. The 2nd floor seems to be dedicated to the spa and gym - we didnt use those, but we did nose around it a bit... I queued for the lobby ATM surrounded by the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, which was great (the hotel is big on its fitness - they even have a menu of pillows that do stuff to you in your sleep).Internet is through the TV - shockingly, the only non-HD TV I saw out of 4 American hotels on this trip (not even widescreen, I was aghast...) - and cost $10 a day, so I stayed away from it. Also, the keyboard was broken, and we had to get an engineer to fix it.Food comes from the next door Barking Dog restaurant, it's not proper room service food, but it's cheap-ish and very large portions. Nice place for breakfast.Careful with the bathroom taps - my girlfriend turned one too far left and it broke, nearly flooding our room... the engineer who fixed it was cool though, seems it happens often...Location-wise, the hotel is strange. It's on the same street as the Empire State and Macys, yet somehow feels out of the way. The subway is 2 blocks away, which isn't too bad, and there's a lot of places to eat nearby. I felt like it was oddly quiet, being so near the touristy stuff...Overall, the hotel was a joy to stay in - hugely comfortable, well located, quiet and with average staff (they were a bit dismissive, but not offensively so...) - it's not perfect, but it is a good luxury place to get away with your boy\/girlfriend...
