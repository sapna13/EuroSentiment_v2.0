{"text":"Beautiful, some problems with service This is a very beautiful hotel in a superb location. Ours was a standard room on the 3rd floor. Check-in was effortless. The room was huge and gorgeous. It was also very quiet despite facing a major street. The bathroom was very large--larger than our bathroom at the Shinjuku Park Hyatt, but unlike our room at the Hyatt, there was no window in the bathroom. It was hardly a big deal, though, considering how luxurious it was. We had dinner at the Ekki Bar and Grill one night. The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the atmosphere was quiet and elegant. The service was not quick but well-paced to allow us to linger over wine and to chat. The food was first class.We had a few problems with the service, though. One morning the waiter forgot to put in our breakfast order so we had to wait over 45 minutes after ordering to get our food. There were only about 5 other tables at the time, so it was hardly busy. The next morning, the wait staff apologized. The servings of the 'breakfast entrees' were far too large, but the food was delicious. Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. The next morning the waitress forgot my coffee and I didn't get it until I was almost finished eating, despite asking for it twice. Also, housekeeping took my nightshirt -- the only thing I had brought to sleep in -- out with the linens when they changed the room. The shirt was returned the next day with a card from the housekeeping manager containing an apology along with some chocolates. The front desk staff, though, were knowledgable, friendly, and very professional.The location is hard to beat. It's within easy walking distance of three metro stops, Ginza, the Marunouchi Building, and the Imperial Palace.
