{"text":"A solid choice with very good location We stayed here for two nights at the end of our weeklong road trip along the Pacific Coast Highway starting in LA. The location is excellent. Parking is free (beware of what other hotels charge for this). Once we arrived, we parked the rental and didn't move it again until we left. This hotel is right near bus routes 47 and 49 and not that far from the starting point of the California Cable Car Line (California and Van Ness). If you ride the cable cars and buses a few times each in a given day, buy the all-you-can-ride day pass. Varsa (owner) was very helpful on the phone when I made the reservation. She wasn't there when we stayed, (would have liked to chat with her in person), but the husband and wife team working helped us with restaurants, maps, where to avoid, where best to catch the cable cars, etc. The room is decent size for the city. It was fairly quiet, and very clean. The elevator worked well. It was nice having a fridge since we were leaving early for the airport on our 2nd day. I'd recommend stocking up on food from the Real Food organic market just around the corner on Polk St (kinda pricey, but aren't most organic markets). Breakfast at this hotel was skimpy but I never expect much from continental breakfast. Good coffee could also be had around the corner on Polk at the Royal Ground, and 1\/2 way decent bagels at the San Francisco Bagelry (Polk as well). The 20 something crowd would like the proximity of this hotel to the bars. Perhaps not as ideal for families with younger kids (no pool, no green space to run around), but this is an urban area after all.
