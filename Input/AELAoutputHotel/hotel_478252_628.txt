{"text":"SomeGood-Some Not So good This was our seventh all inclusive trip (2nd to Punta Cana). Several cruises thrown-in. Love cruises, but all inclusive is the way-to-go. The most bang-for-the-buck. This resort is big, not overpowering but big enough that a person with a little mobility issue will notice. English is language #3 or 4. We had to muddle our way through some of the staff conversations. No major problem but compared to other resorts, very obvious. The room was very nice..turn down, jacuzzi tub,etc. We don't smoke(terrible,nasty,stinking habit), but 75% of the adults did. This is a smokers paradise because they don't enforcement the no smoking areas. This was disturbing. This alone would prevent us from ever returning to this resort. The food was good, just like all the buffets, you get a little tired of them...but you gotta eat. Stayed 8 nights and ate mostly fruit the last two days. The seafood specialty restaurant was horrible. The steak house OK. The Japanese was the best. The beach was beautiful and plenty of chairs,palapas. The pools...again plenty of chairs and palapas. The pool was missing a lot of tiles in places. We have not seen this at other resorts. Pool maintenance seemed to be a bit slack. The lousy crushable drink cups were left lying around for several days, mainly around the bridge areas, but still a lack of maintenance\/cleaning. Let's talk drinks. Did I mention the lousy crushable drink cups. The drinks at the pool bars, other than the beer, were not good. They do not make frozen drinks that stay frozen more than, 20 seconds. This was a major problem for both of us. Their ice is just barely frozen and melts too quickly when mixed. The lobby bar had much better drinks, but that's a 400 yards away.For most of the stay, the ice cream in the restaurants was more like thick milk than solid ice cream. They have a real problem with keeping it solid. The flavor was good,but here again, we wanted ice cream, not scoopable milk shakes. We realize that this review is negative, but please remember, we have experienced better resorts and this review is based our experience from these resorts (Iberostar, RIU). This is still a good deal and nice vacation, we just didn't like the differences.The arrival process was smooth and simple. Pay your $10\/person, go through immigration\/customs ,go to your bus and head for the resort. Getting out, a different story...make sure you have 2 hours or more during the busy times. Little air-conditioning, lots of people. I won't bore you with details, but this was a horror story. We will not be back to this resort and probably not to the DR.
