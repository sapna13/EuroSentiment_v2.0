{"text":"Excellent Hotel and Staff I stayed at the Mandarin Oriental for a conference, and it was unfortunate I was traveling by myself because the hotel and its location are fantastic.The hotel itself is situated on Biscayne Bay. I was fortunate to get a room facing the bay and took full advantage of the private balcony that comes standard with every room. (Have a room service breakfast on that balcony and you'll know what I mean)The room itself was done in rich mahogany and the bed was extremely comfortable and very sleepworthy. The bathrooms were superlative and done in marble. It was really a nice treat to sleep at night with the windows to the balcony open and the ocean breeze blowing in.In regard to items outside the room, the lounge on the lobby floor of the hotel was superb and as you would expect also provides great views of the bay. The pool scene is also top notch, but the wait service by the pool could have been more timely. There is a walking\/jogging path that winds around the hotel and hugs the bay through some adjacent condo buildings.The only minor downside I would state is the ability to walk to anywhere notable from the hotel. Its location on the bay also puts it at almost a required taxi (especially given Miami's heat) to anywhere notable. But taxis are always available and immediately summoned by one of the valets. However, given that significant upside of the views based on the hotel's location, this would be a trade-off I would make anytime.In terms of security, this has to be one of the most secure hotels in which I have ever stayed. First the only reason you would be on the road to the hotel is to visit the hotel---so there is no drive-by traffic at all. In addition, there are security\/concierge staff all over the lobby and curbside areas and they know what they are doing. For example, I went out for a run and exited through the back of the hotel but entered back in the front. I looked less than attractive upon my return, but the hotel staff opened all of the doors upon my arrival no questions asked. On the other hand, one of my clients who was dressed in a business suit who was not a guest at the hotel was questioned (in a subtle gracious way) if they could be of assistance, which is hotel code for What the heck are you doing here?Finally and certainly not least is the staff. Absolutely first rate and ranks with the best I have ever experienced. Everyone at the ready to assist, with attentiveness that was both subtle and gracious. As an example, I walked up to the concierge and asked him to FedEx a golf club. (Do you know how hard it is to package a golf club?) Rather than the anticipated drill of filling out numerous forms and time taken for them to find materials, the concierge simply took the club, had me fill out the destination for the club and that was it!! (Of course, the charges were billed to my room) But the whole experience was effortless.Bravo to the Mandarin Oriental...
