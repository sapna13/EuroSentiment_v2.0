{"text":"Totally Wonderful Hotel and Experience The Alexis is a magnificent jewel in the West Edge neighborhood of Seattle. Beautifully appointed with eclectic and unique art and furnishings thoughout. Front Desk and Bell Staff absolutely helpful and friendly. Room was beautifully decorated with modern art and 5 amazingly different lamps, plasma screen TV, and 3 large windows that opened wide to bring in the gorgeous city air. The bed was a dream to sleep on. Lovely cotton sheets and extremely comfortable mattress. Bathroom chock full of Aveda products, plentiful luxurious linens, phenomenal shower head with good flow. Love the robes that are available for purchase. Only 2 blocks to waterfront and 6 blocks to Pine Street (the Retail Core) and Pikes Market. The # 18 bus runs on First Avenue where the Alexis is located and is free in the downtown area. If you take the #56 bus just south of Madison and First you can get out to Alki Beach for just $3.50 round trip. McCormick and Schmicks Seafood Restaurant is the best for seafood and you can sign to your room at the Alexis. Restaurant is half block north of the hotel. Complimentary coffee in the lobby is excellent as is the complimentary evening wine tasting. Be sure to put an Early Housekeeping sign on your room door if you plan to return to your room midday otherwise you may wait for your room to be cleaned. Housekeeping Staff was flawless and paid attention to every detail. Stacks of New York Times, Seattle Times. and The Wall Street Journal are available for free in the lobby. I enjoyed jumping out of bed, grabbing a cup of coffee downstairs and bring the papers back to my room. A complimentary Seattle Times paper is delivered to your room daily. If you need quiet during the day and want to keep your windows opened, I would suggest asking for a room away from the front of First Avenue. That being said, I enjoyed my room facing First Avenue and the noise didn't bother me but I was not conducting business on this trip. Pet friendly, no hidden charges, makes this hotel the #1 pick in Seattle for me. I plan to frequent Kimpton when I can because of their strong committment to the environment and giving back to the community. What amazed and delighted me was that each room had a recycling container and a trash can. This is unprecedented in the mega corporate hotels that I normally frequent. Alexis and staff, you truly wowed me.
