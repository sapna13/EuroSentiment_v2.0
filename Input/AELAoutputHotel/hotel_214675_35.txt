{"text":"for 65$ excellent value Booked a special internet rate of 65$ night plus tax for 3 nights 12\/12 to 12\/15\/2007 and stayed in #4012 mountain view.The good:Location is close to all the bus transportation,--and good drop off and pick up site for airport shuttle.Free Wifi in the loby (not in the room)Free big safe in the room.If you are up in the top floors, even mtn view is dramatic.Very friendly staff.Mostly Japanese tourists stay here so that is a positive since they are not as loud and obtrusive as Americans.The bed was actually pretty comfortable.My bath and tub were very clean.The housekeeping staff were thorough.Free coffee and coffee maker, iron and hairdryerFree shampoo and body lotion.The bad:no wifi in the room. as everyone has noted, this hotel has the slowest elevators in waikiki.The towels are not the big fluffy ones you get at 5 star resorts but they give you plenty of the thin ones. (but you will need to bring a beach towel)The rooms are small. I would not stay here as a couple unless I was a starving student--this is not a honeymoon resort!The windows only open 6 inches.There is no lanai.There are 16 rooms on each floor and the walls are thin so you may hear other people.Conclusion:If you are looking for a budget hotel, you could do worsethan the maile sky court.This was an excellent value for a single traveler. The staff are fantastic, the bell hops are friendly, and there is even a business center where you can print your boarding pass for one dollar (if you are fast).Sleep:I actually slept better here than I have in much higher end properties. Maybe I was just lucky and the hotel may have not been that full during my stay.The higher you go up, the less street noise. So if you can get up on the 40th floor for 65\/night, that seems like a great deal in waikiki.I never went to the pool area so I can not comment.In sum:If you want to stay in a high end resort on the beach, you need to spend at least 300\/night. This is not the place to impress anyone or to spend your honeymoon. Trust me. Look elsewhere. Spend more and enjoy a premium experience.But if you are a solo traveler and not picky, this place can save you money. When not traveling with my wife, I may go back just because I liked the unpretensious vibe.
