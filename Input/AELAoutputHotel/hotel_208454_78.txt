{"text":"Excellent and disappointing Having read the rave reviews we decided to stay here for my birthday trip to New York. I looked it up on the internet and found a special deal for a Chic Picnic. Basically the fourth night was free, the room was superior and we received a picnic hamper with wine or champagne. The first down fall was the pricing. According to my reservation our final bill would show the full amount and then have a 25% discount. I therefore took the quoted amount to be the full amount and applied 25% discount. Not so we discovered on our first night. The quoted was with the discount so the cost was 33% higher than I budgeted. Maybe this is me being daft but I have reread my booking and it is still unclear. Eventually we got checked in and went to our room on the 19th floor. The view was breathtaking, the bed wonderfully soft, there was a plasma screen TV and a bottle of champagne for my birthday. However the big marble bath was barely big enough for me at 5'4. We asked for our chic picnic on the second day and it came in a wonderful wooden hamper with a bottle of champagne. Unfortunately we were then told that we couldn't take the champagne to central park so that kind of ruined our champagne picnic. We left the champagne in the room and, on the advice of the concierge, walked to Central Park carrying the hamper. Do not be tempted to do this. Take a taxi. It will cost all of $6 and you will arrive fresh and unharried. On our last evening we requested a wake up call as we had to be at the airport by 6.30. We never received a call but luckily woke up in time. Checkout took forever as we had to use two seperate cards. Overall it was wonderful and disappointing all at the same time so I've marked it average. ","annotations":[]}
