{"text":"Fantastic find It has been about a year since our stay at the Chedi Club, but I thought I would throw in my two-cents here since it was definitely a hi-lite of our honeymoon in Bali. We spent 4 nights here after 5 nights at FS Jimbaran Bay. Our experience at the FS is what you would expect for paying the insane amounts of money per night - pretty terrific...however, it did feel a little corporate (plastic as one other poster said), and while you got personal and excellent service, given the size of the hotel, you did still feel like one of many guests cycling in and out. The service we got at the Chedi felt more sincere, it was top-notch and we just enjoyed our experience at this hotel so much more. The prices are still not cheap, relative to other things in Bali, but you do get quite a lot of value - free breakfast, butler service, free laundry, free drinks (house liquor, but includes local beer), free internet. The breakfast menu was limited, so after 4 days there, we had pretty much tried everything. We did not dine there for dinner, but we did have lunch and room service (virtually the same menu). Food was very good and servers very friendly.The grounds are very well kept, likewise our villa. We were told that the estate was designed by a respected Jakarta-based architect, and one of the villas on the ground is for his use, when he goes to Bali. We had one of the villas with the private pool (much bigger than the one we had at FS) and outside dining pavilion that looked out to the paddy fields. It was very posh. Large bedroom, closet\/changing area, inside shower, outside bathtub. Bose speakers inside  out, so you can hook up your ipod and listen to music wherever. There was a DVD player which was nice to have (see below).As an aside, we were in Ubud during Nyepi (Balinese New Year), which involves a day of silence. The entire island shuts down, as does the airport. Locals are not supposed to travel, use electricity or even really go outside of their homes. The hotel advised that we stay within the compound, but we were allowed to use electricity (though they asked that use be minimized). The DVD player was handy on this day since we were basically sequestered. The day before Nyepi, there is a colorful festival of ogoh-ogoh (paper mache monsters) that the locals parade down the street. It was quite a sight. The day of silence was nice too, it made us slow down and really relax.A special mention of our butler, Arka, who was the nicest guy, and so attentive, but not obtrusive. He was also instrumental in getting us a smaller guest room after check-out time, where we could store our things and have a quick shower before our late flight back home. He was our go-to man for all our questions and needs (he even personally wrapped up some local wood carvings for us to carry home!) It was nice to have consistent interaction with one person the whole time we were there.Without a doubt, I would return to this hotel if we ever go back to Bali.
