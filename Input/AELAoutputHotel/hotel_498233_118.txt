{"text":"Great Hotel and Location! We really loved this place. We got a great rate of $129 for a 1 bedroom suite and it was well spent. If you are going to be in NO more than a day or two, get this room. Very well layed out with a separate area with a sofabed, tv  microwave and fridge. Large bathroom and closet and a very good sized bedroom. Nicely decorated. Had 10-12 foot ceilings with floor to ceiling windows. Loved that! Everyone we came in contact with at the hotel was very helpful and nice. Lovely areas in the lobby for just hanging out and a computer with a printer for use in the main area that comes in very handy. Small but lovely pool area and workout room (who cares, you came to Louisiana to eat ,not workout!). Happy hour drinks in the lobby and bar area from 5-7. Breakfast is included.And the location is so perfect. Across the street is Cuvee restaurant. A few doors down is the Bon Ton Cafe. A couple of blocks over is August, Emeril's and best of all, Cochon!! The French Quarter is 2 blocks the other way. Great shopping and transport onto Magazine Street and the Garden district. If you are cabbing it, it is very central. Parking is $25 additional.In all, a terrific choice for NO. We had stayed previously at the Monaco in one of the suites and really enjoyed it but for less than 1\/3 to 1\/2 the price this was just as good. Go to New Orleans and all of Louisiana! Everyone we came in contact with was so happy that people were coming back and so appreciative of it. What remains to be done there is horrifying and an outrage that every citizen of this country should be aware of and angered by. Just not acceptable that our fellow citizens are still embroiled in this nightmare 19 months later...Go and love it and the people and eat yourselves sick! Don't miss Parkway Bakery and their po boys. Spread your money around. Roulez les bon temps...again... ","annotations":[]}
