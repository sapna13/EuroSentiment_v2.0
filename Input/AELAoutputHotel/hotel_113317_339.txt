{"text":"Fabulous This hotel really is fabulous. I was booking a trip to New York for my husbands 40th. I spent ages looking at different hotels and their reviews and nothing really jumped out at me. I then found best hotels site on Trip Advisor and gave it ago and i am so glad we did. The hotel is perfectly situated and although its noisey on the outside once inside its quiet and peaceful. All the hotel staff are very friendly and helpful and nothing is too much trouble for them. The breakfast is help yourself with a selection of fruit salads, bagels, cream cheese, hard boiled eggs, and a selections of cereals plus the tea, coffee, juice. After a hard days walking and sight seeing its great to sit down have a glass of wine or 3 and a selection of cheeses and biscuits too what more would you ask for. The room we stayed in ( standard) was not huge but a good size and with TV and DVD player mini bar and a lovley bathroom with robes, soaps shampoos, cotton wool and cotton wool buds they have thought of everything even slippers!Yes i would stay again and am extremely happy to recommend. The price we paid via the net was $249 but there are taxes on that to take into consideration. However a bargin all in all. Tony's restaurant next door is very good and the portions are huge so if you are from the UK share the main course and even the starters are big - ask the waiter just in case and by the way they are really friendly too!
