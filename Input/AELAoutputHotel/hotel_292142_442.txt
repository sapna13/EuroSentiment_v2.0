{"text":"Affinity with the Affinia Dumont! I hate to be one to follow the crowd, but the glowing reviews here are all spot on! My wife and I have just stayed at the Affinia Dumont for 5 days as part of our honeymoon and it exceeded our expectations on every level. Considering we'd been desperate to go to New York for years (this was our first time there) that's no mean feat!Having mentioned our honeymoon when making the booking, on arrival (early check-in) we rocketed up to the 24th floor and found we'd been upgraded to a large suite with kitchen, king bed and an amazing view over midtown Manhattan (including the Chrysler Building!). The room was spacious and incredibly well designed\/furnished - a true slice of NY chic. They even provided us with a surprise complimentary bottle of champagne and a note of congratulations! The staff were friendly and attentive throughout our stay, helping us without a moment's delay when we asked for an international plug adaptor, looked like we needed a cab, or stored our luggage for 8 hours after checking out (we had a late flight home). This customer-focussed approach extended to staff at the excellent Barking Dog bar\/restaurant next door, who also provided Room Service for the hotel. The portions were immense, but that's NY for you!The hotel's central location is a major plus point. Sat towards the east end of 34th St (a major shopping street as it turns out), several key sights\/streets are within easy reach, with a subway station just one block away for getting to those attractions further afield. It's even on the same street as the Empire State Building and Macy's!To sum up, we were hugely impressed by the Affinia Dumont and would certainly consider staying there again. Having travelled a fair bit in recent years, I can tell you that hotels of this type\/price don't come much better!
