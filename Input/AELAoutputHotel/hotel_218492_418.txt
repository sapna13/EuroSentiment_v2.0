{"text":"DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!!! THIS HOTEL IS TERRIBLE!!!!!! If you are American, do not stay here. They do not like Americans, but LOVE the US dollar. We spoke spanish most of the time, but still were treated with complete disrespect. Everyone is rude, with the entertainment staff. We had no hot water, broken hair dryers and a leaky roof. It took sometimes a half an hour to get a drink at the bar, if we got served at all. They just skipped right over us. When we asked the waiters for things, they just ignored us. Forget about eating at any of the restaurants...you need reservations in which the lady working is a [------]. It took two hours to check in. Check in time is at 3PM, but did not get a room until 5PM; however the day of checkout they are quick to call your room to let you know. NONE of the info on any of the travel sites is true about this place. The kids club they offer is 5 and up and it only runs from 9AM - 12PM and again from 3PM to 5PM. The discoteque [---]There is nowhere to go off of the resort. We booked a Swim and Snorkel with the Dolphins trip in which the guest services man said it was three hours and it was swimming and snorkeling with the dolphins. It turned out to be about 20 minutes of going into a pen with two dolphins in which we could look and get a little feel of them. At the end of the trip, we asked to speak to a manager in which the front desk staff would not tell us who one was. Finally, one of the staff lied and told us some guest services guy was a manager. Make sure to bring plenty of dollars, euros or pesos because for a large hotel, they NEVER had any money to change out traveler's checks. The only relatively nice part was the entertainment staff....but I only think they were nice because the guys wanted to hook up with my sister and I. I have been to over 15 countries and have never experienced anything like this. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO A PIG!!!!!
