{"text":"Great Experience......... We just returned from a 10 day stay that was a combination of a business and pleasure trip. This hotel hit a home run in both ways. They were undergoing a renovation to correct past shortcomings and to get more up to date, but there was very little inconvenience other than one of the 3 elevators being worked on while we were there. One renovatation was the addition of a nice large flat screen TV on the wall that added lots of room to the average size rooms. We got an oceanview room that had a partial view of the ocean and the surfers on the beach. It was great to go out on the lanaii to have a morning cup of coffee and to watch the city wake up to another day in Paradise. cities are by their nature busy, but Honolulu is probably the most laid back city I've ever been in, so the crowded Waikiki area isn't as bad as you would think.What made the hotel one of the best I've stayed in was the staff. They were smiling, friendly, and genuinely wanted to be of service and to please. We noticed the heavy Korean influence in the hotel and found out it was Korean owned and had just hired an California based management company. The large numbers of Koreans and the presence of a Korean Airlines office made for a nice experience in a hotel that was full of guests. The staff was so service oriented and anticipated our needs that we almost forgot we were in a nearly full hotel instead of being the only guests in the hotel. We especially liked the 2 restaurants, one an upscale Korean\/Asian one and the other a Hawaiian\/American style one. the food was top notch and the service was sparkling.The half block distance to the beach and closeness to the middle of Waikiki's shopping and night life make this an excellent choice in a headquarters for a visit to Oahu. All the tour busses stop there and they have an underground parking floor in the basement with an elevator that goes straight up to your room. Also, good deals can be had on rental cars and my advice is to take your GPS system with you or rent one. They are great and take a lot of stress out of driving in an unknown area with long and hard to pronounce names!The Waikiki Resort Hotel made us very happy on our trip and I highly recommend it to others who want a good value hotel near the beach.Tha Laird ","annotations":[{"endOffset":403,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":399},{"endOffset":648,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":642},{"endOffset":648,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":642},{"endOffset":648,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":642},{"endOffset":1249,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1245}]}
