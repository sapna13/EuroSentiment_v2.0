{"text":"Great Rooms, Great Location I had checked various websites including tripadvisor before booking this hotel for a long weekend with my wife and another couple. However closer to our departure I got a bit nervous as some of the reviews were not favourable but I decided to stick with our original (and very cheap) booking. I need not have worried. The location (in El Born) is fantastic with so many shops, restaurants and cafes nearby in little sidestreets and squares. The hotel reception is little more than a desk and anyone who wants a grand lobby, bar or even a great buzz from the hotel will be disappointed. However all of these things are provided by the area in spades so the lack of facilities were made up by the rooms. We had booked suites which were a few hundred yards away off the Placa Santa Maria which again had plenty of life both day and night. The rooms were very spacious and well-kept. The decor was modern and minimal without being sparse. They are like small apartments with a shared communal entrance but at @ √ä√£¬¢90 per night they were a bargain. I would have no hesutation staying there again and although some reviews said staff could be surly they booked a restaurant and taxis for us with no difficulty and were very courteous. If you spend a lot of time around your hotel go somewhere else but if you enjoy a little bit of luxury at a knockdown price book it now. ","annotations":[]}
