{"text":"Nice time but would not go back First I would like to state that I had a good vacation. For the price the Occidental was ok. Our group consisted of 4 women who annually take a break from the husbands and kids to spend a girls week on the beach. We are not that interested in activities all we really want to do is eat,drink and plop on the beach! We were able to do all three! This is our third year coming to the DR and on previous trips we had stayed at a different location. We decided to try a different place but we will not return here. It was not as horrible as some reviews I read and if I did not have another hotel to compare it to I might think it was good but I did have some issues...My biggest problems with the place concerned water pressure and airconditioning. We were in building 23. We were on the 3rd floor. There is no water pressure on the 3rd floor of building 23 between the hours of 5 and 7pm. I guess it is too many people using the showers after the beach but I would like to take a comfortable shower after I come off the beach. I do not consider that a luxury item. I never had a hot or even very warm shower. Cool showers were simply a trickle of water and to rinse shampoo I would push to all cold,stick my head under and hope for the best. There were times when the water just stopped coming out of the shower...speaking with other guests this seemed like a common problem. Speaking of third floor rooms...I do not mind climbing steps but have to say that by the end of the day I was tired of having to walk up 3 flights of steps over and over to get to my room. There is no elevator-shame on me for not checking in to that-the other resort I stayed at in the DR had elevators. Our airconditioning did not work very well in one room. The other was great. {guess which one I was in?] Luckily the ceiling fan helped so we could sleep at night. This was reported several times to the front desk beginning on Sun pm and no one came to look at it until Fri pm-it never worked although the repairman told us it was fixed. We left singles, candy,cosmetics, perfumes etc every day in our rooms for the maids[she gave us a bunch of coffee when we left! LOL!]. Rooms were always cleaned but little things were not done...ashtrays on balcony not emptied, toilet tissue roll almost empty yet no extra roll left. No boxes of tissue in the room. Lightbulb burnt out on balcony took 4 days to replace. I thought the food was as good as any other place I have stayed on the DR . Italian restaurant the best-Mexican ok and steak house more like a Brazilian rodizio. Bar drinks rated an ok...Miami Vice was the best Iced drink. I am very thankful that I go with some early risers as it was necessary to hit the beach by 6am if you hoped to score one of the huts on the beach. I do not bake on the beach I want shade but we were setting cell phone alarms for 5:30am to get the huts-to me that is crazy on vacation. The resort uses the beach for day activities and built a wooden platform for arobics,games etc. Perhaps they could move some activities off the beach to allow for more huts. One annoying thing..beach-pool towels are only available on the beach on the far side of the property-there should be a more central location near the many pool areas.Bottom line is: We had a good vacation- the shower and airconditioning were big negatives[thought is was odd they didn't address this since they were trying to hawk this place for time shares!]. The Occidental needs some updating in the rooms...we had peeling paint in the tub the other room had rust on the outside of the tub. Just looked very worn. Room was kept clean-no smell no bugs. Food was pretty good for all inclusive drinks were ok. Beach was nice, need more huts for sun protection. Staff not friendly yet not unfriendly...I would not go here again instead I would return to the Iberostar.
