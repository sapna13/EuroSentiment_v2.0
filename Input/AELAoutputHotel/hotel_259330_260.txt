{"text":"Great vacation for the price We have just returned from an 8 day vacation at Grand Paradise. We all had a really nice time, in spite of all the horror stories previously posted. The resort itself is really nice. It is clean and they really work hard to make you comfortable. The food isn't bad and not outstanding either. There is a variety, so if you go hungry it is your own fault. Make your reservations for the restaurants as soon as you arrive. The seafood restaurant fills up fast, so you may not get in. There is a bit of a language barrier, but you are in a foreign country, so you should expect it. Brush up on some Spanish words and you should be just fine.The beach, it was awesome. The water so blue and sand so white. The waves were calm during the first few days we were there, then by weeks end they were stronger. We loved it. It was very hot there, so we spent our days at the beach enjoying the water. There was entertainment every night in the theater. The shows were different each night. Some better than others, but it was very entertaining. The staff worked hard both here at the theater and in the restaurants. Bring dollars for tipping, they deserve it. Don't forget about the maids either, they did a good job with our room, so we tipped them as well.If I had a chance to return to Punta Cana, I would probably stay in another resort, only because we like to stay in different places. There wasn't anything wrong with this place. For what you pay, it was really worth it.
