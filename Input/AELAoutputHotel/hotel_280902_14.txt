{"text":"water leaks and cheerleaders on the loose My fiance and I stayed at the hotel for two nights. The [first] room, #221, seemed very nice - tasteful decor, Starbucks coffee for the coffeemaker, etc. - until we discovered pieces of wet plaster falling from the ceiling onto the bed. Unfortunately this discovery occurred AFTER we had unpacked, showered, and gotten into that same bed. ICK. We reported the problem to the front desk. The pleasant but not terribly apologetic clerk got us another room - although to our surprise she didn't seem to share our concern over what appeared to be a water leak. We packed our things and moved to the new room. This second room, #423, turned out to be wheelchair accessible, which would not have been a problem except that the shower floor (which was open to the rest of the bathroom) was not built properly slanted, so that upon using the shower, water ran out into the bathroom and pooled in the opposite corner instead of running down the shower drain. (We wondered if the room above our original room was wheelchair accessible - we thought that might explain the leak over the bed!)In addition to these problems with our room - correction, rooms - the hotel was full of energetic (read: loud) young cheerleaders and their families during our stay.Overall, our experience wasn't awful, but it was not what we expected from a Westin. We would have said such to the front desk clerk upon checkout if he had asked us how our stay was, but he didn't.
