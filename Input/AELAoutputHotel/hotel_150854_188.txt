{"text":"Riu Macao was good, but not the greatest We stayed at the Riu Macao Mar 15 to 23, 2007. The hotel is nice, clean and welcoming. Make sure you request a room closer to the ONE set of elevators or else you will be walking a long way to your room bc the resort is huge. The staff are friendly and courteous but most speak only Spanish in the restaurants. The restaurant food is not so great after 2 days the food gets really boring as it is almost the same every night in the buffet. My 3 yr old daughter ate pasta for 7 days twice a day and of course she had ice cream at each sitting too. Just a tip for those of you who eat alot of salad -- bring your own salad dressing as they only have flavored oil and dill sauce. The salad bar and fruit bar is filled with lots of very fresh and delicious items so take advantage and bring your own dressing to make it even better. The pool is small and you have to wake up early to reserve a good spot otherwise the beach is a good alternative if you arrive late. The beach is amazing...white sand and lots of beach chairs. Back to the pool, if you have young children the kids pool is small and dirty (just still water, I wouldn't call it a pool). Mydaughter ended up playing on the stairs of the adults pool for the whole week as there is no shallow end also make sure you bring some toys that your kids can play with in\/around the pool otherwise they will get bored going up and down the stairs all day. Bring inflatableballs and toys as they charge $20 US for inflatable dolphins\/whales. The soft ice cream by the pool is delicious, I think my daughter and I had 5 cones a day. The waiters by the pool are very good at makingsure you always have a drink, so make sure you tip them bc they are running around all day getting drinks for everyone. Our hotel room was clean and nice but the beds are hard and uncomfortable. Water pressure in the bathroom was good too but no exhaust fan in the bathroom so it can get stuffy in there if you know what I mean: ). We were allowed to visit the other Riu Hotels on the strip which we did but other than the newer Riu Palace, the other Riu's were a bit lower end than the Riu Macao although I think the food is the same at all the hotels. All in all I think this hotel is a great hotel especially if the weather is nice. My only complaints are that I thought the food would be tastier and more variety, also the pool is small for such a big resort and there are no activities for children.Anyways have fun and try not to eat too much soft ice cream!!
