{"text":"Will not return If you are disabled, or have difficulty walking. DO NOT STAY HERE! Everything is incredibly far, even rooms to the elevator. The hotel is like an L shape. The elevator to the lower pool area is at the end of the L shape, if you have difficulty walking--no pool for you! There are NO Handicapped rooms with two double beds. There are no courtesy wheel chairs, they rent for $25 a day. Frankly, there was no courtesy anythig! Be prepared to pay for everything.DO NOT be fooled by the pretty recently removated rooms on the web site, these do not exist, at least at the normal people rate. One of our rooms was missing a lamp FROM THE WALL over the bed, the bathrooms were big, but kind of grimmy from aging. The mattreses were awful, you could hear the springs every time you turned.The only really nice thing was the ferry to Palominos island. The boats are new and the crew very courtious and nice. Be aware that they do not let you bring even a water bottle on board. This is because once you are captive at Palominos they nail you for everything. The water sports come at a high price also. In short, although the hotel grounds are neatly maintained and the view is spectacular, the accomodations, amenities and services are poor.Another terrible thing was the uncooperative, and unfriendliness of the folks at th front desk. They made little effort to accomodate or help resolve a situation. I stayed there this one time, but will not return. If they sell themselves as a luxury hotel, they should deliver what they sell.I also stayesd at Parador Villa Parguera and when compared, I will return to La Parguera, but not to El Conquistador.
