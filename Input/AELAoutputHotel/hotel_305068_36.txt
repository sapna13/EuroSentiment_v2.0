{"text":"Faultless service, breathtaking harbour views Perfect scores all round for this hotel. I stopped off in Hong Kong on the way back from Europe for 4 days, and will definitely stay at the Intercon again. From checkin to checkout, the service is superb, all staff smiling, enthusiastic, immaculate and with initiative, especially those in the Club lounge. You have to pay extra for a harbour view, but it is worth every cent, waking up to that amazing panorama (as the electric drapes open to unfold the drama on the harbour). I spent a lot of time sitting in the armchair just enjoying the view! After check in, Chinese tea and fruit are delivered with a welcome card. Nice touch. Bathroom very spacious and Housekeeping generous with replenishing full-size Bulgari toiletries. I took quite a load home, and won't need to buy shampoo or conditioner until next year! The gym is very impressive - for a fitness nut like me, the facilities (including a huge pool and day Spa) were heavenly, especially the extensive array of free weights (dumbells) and cardio machines. This is Hong Kong, so there is no shortage of shopping nearby. The MTR (metro, or underground train) is beneath the hotel, but quite a long trek to the platforms - something to note for the elderly, lazy or just plain unfit!Club lounge food presentations were excellent, in terms of quality and presentation. Unlike many Executive Floor or Club lounges which I've tried, this one is very spacious, and located on the 2nd floor, which is the perfect height for enjoying harbour views. Such a memorable experience, I cannot wait to return for Christmas!
