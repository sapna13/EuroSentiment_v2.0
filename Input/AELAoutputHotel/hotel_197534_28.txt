{"text":"Loved the Hotel Napoleon - Old world charm with modern amenities The Hotel Napoleon was everything you think it might be when you look at the web site, and if you like spending time in the hotel, you will love the Napleon. It was in a beautiful neighborhood and steps from the Arc de Triomphe and the metro. We booked a Deluxe Panoramic Room on the Napoleon web site (the best rate we could find at the time). It was very expensive (310 Euro per night), but in the end we felt like it was worth it, especially if you don't think you'll get to Paris again. There were no surprises with the rate and no hidden fees; however, nothing else was included in the rate.....no breakfast, no internet (we paid 19.99 Euro per 24 hours, but the connection worked very well). The hotel lobby, hallways and room were beautiful....just what you'd want in Paris. We had a corner room on the 5th floor and could see the top of the Eiffel Tower and the Arc (at an angle) from our room. The room was very spacious and felt like a little apartment because it had a small foyer when you walked in and opened up to a sitting area with a desk near the king sized bed and a large armoire. The room was furnished with old world charm, but the bathroom was moden, spacious with double sink, had a great hair dryer and plenty of room to unpack to make you feel at home. The only complaint would be that the glass shower door wasn't long enough so water sprayed on the floor (seems to be a European thing). We also loved the separate toilet area with it's own sink. We enjoyed the hotel restaurant....very cozy...and thought the burgers were among the best we've ever had.
