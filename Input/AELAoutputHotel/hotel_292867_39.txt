{"text":"Beautiful Place This was a girlfriend getaway. We were there from April 30 - May 4th. It was beautiful. I have read several reviews some good but most were bad and I have to admit I was SCARED!!! But don't take the other reviews for granted, you have to experience it yourself.When you first arrive at the airport, you'll be greeted by women dressed up and willing to take your pictures with them. You will be able to purchase these when you leave for $8. They come out very good. I wanted one, but my girlfriend beat me to it it and they only make one copy.. :( After that, you go through and pay your $10 tourist card and get your luggage. You will have men trying to take your luggage and carry it for you. I wouldn't of done it, but my girlfriend had already gave our stuff. They help you to your information desk and YES they expect a tip, so if your not a big tipper, then I suggest you carry your own luggage. They will try and bug you, but be strong and keep walking.Once we got to our apple vacation desk, he showed us to our ride and they took us to the hotel. It's about a 20 minute ride from the airport to the hotel (unless you have other stops on your bus as well, then a little longer).Once we got to the hotel, we checked in and it was BEAUTIFUL... The lobby was so nice, the staff was friendly. Everyone said HOLA. It didn't take us long to get our room and since we were VIP (which I sugget), we had to meet with the guest services to get all of our information, such as (internet, motorized sports, and massage) coupons.It was beautiful weather all week. It only rained Friday night really hard and Sunday morning (for like 5 minutes) dispite what the weather channel said. The beach was GORGEOUS... I have never seen a beach more beautiful. Water was great. Yes, you have women walking around topless but this isn't just at the beach, they also do this at the pool. It didn't bother us though.The food - well that is a different thing. At the buffet, they have a lot of different things, I didn't care for the buffet, but for breakfast I got an omlet and potatoes, nothing else. For dinner, I only ate cheese  pepperoni pizza. The Seafood restuarant - NASTY!. The Mexican place, DELICIOUS, as well as the Italian (momma mia).The rooms - they were very nice  clean. They are dated like in previous reviews, but very clean. Our mini fridge was stocked every day and we didn't have to request nothing. The only thing I suggest is, if you plan on tipping, do it when you leave. We didn't tip until 2 nights before we left and on the last night, they didn't give us our turn down service. We were in room 2222, our balcony faced the family pool and ocean, GORGEOUS!!The pool bar was good, JOSE  OZZIE are the men at that bar. The manager Carlos was very nice as well. The Beach bartender was KELVIN, he was MY FAVORITE. If you gotta try a drink, try the banana mama or ask Kelvin for bed breaker, very good. Also ask Kelvin for Killing Me Softly.They will keep trying to have you taste their mamajuana, some liked it, I HATED IT. Too strong and NASTY.Over all, a very nice place. If I had to say a bad thing, it'll be about SOME of the guests. We met some very nice people from England and all over the states, but then we had met some ignorant guests from London, but you ignore the ignorant people and enjoy yourself. I would love to take back my husband  daughter. I hope you enjoy yourself if you go and I would consider upgrading to VIP if you haven't already. Well worth the extra money.I hope you find my review helpful.
