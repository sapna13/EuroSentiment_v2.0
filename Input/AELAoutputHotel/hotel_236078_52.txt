{"text":"5* Budget Hotel for Ambiance Chasers... Is the Seven Bridges Hotel really better than the Amstel Hotel? Well...considering that a week's stay at the Seven Bridges is about the cost of one (two at the most) night's stay at the Amstel, the answer is an unequivocal yes! The properties of course are not comparable...One is a budget hotel...priced nearly as low as any in the Canal Ring...the other a true 5 Star, but value is a truly important consideration when deciding on lodging. For your $1,200 or so per night at the Amstel, one gets great public spaces...people flocking around serving you...and the opportunity to have a $500,000 Chopard watch delivered to your room.For your $1,200 or so at the Seven Bridges, you get about a week in a cool little Canal House, well located and well decorated with antiques, complimentary modern pieces and oriental rugs. An abundant breakfast is brought to your room on lovely China...all adding to the charming ambiance of the hotel.The peaceful Garden Room 4 was our home for the week of March 27-April 4, 2008 and the only complaint I have is that the table is a bit low. I twice bumped the edge with my long legs, spilling some coffee during the abundant breakfast. Covered with glass, cleanup was easy. That's it...a bit of my clumsiness is the largest finding of fault...This little gem of a place is exactly as advertised...a sparkling clean, calm and beautiful retreat for the independent traveler. Hotel doesn't quite seem the correct word; but it's not a BB either...It's a labor of love shared by the proprietors for those willing to go through the process to book a room here. The lack of amenities (no elevator, public rooms, bar, etc) are OK considering that Barney's Lounge (Mint tea, milkshakes...and.) is a stumble outside the front door...and the ample dining options (Tempo Doeloe, Mujah Taret, Alfonso's and more) on Utrechtstraat are also just a short stroll...as is Rembrandtplein and its tremendous selection of eateries and little food shops. Their website perfectly captures the essence of the hotel...and needs to be examined in detail before deciding to stay here. The interior stairs are steep, no doubt about it, but Garden 4 is on the entry level...removing that concern. Garden 5, up one flight, is easily one of the nicest rooms you'll find anywhere...and the room's private terrace is a great place to take breakfast during pleasant weather. The Seven Bridges Hotel is a quiet and tremendously refined slightly upscale budget hotel with limited services. It is not an acceptable lodging for those that need to be watched over or have their every question answered, although they will assist their guests however possible. We loved it...and recommend it highly to those that find it appealing.
