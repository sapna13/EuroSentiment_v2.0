{"text":"Exceeded the expectations of a picky ex-New Yorker I recently stayed at the Library Hotel for two weeks on a business trip; as a former New Yorker and bibliophile, I had always been intrigued by the hotel's concept but never had a reason to book a stay there until moving away from the city. I'm a pretty picky traveler and have traveled widely all over the world, so I wasn't expecting to be especially bowled over, but the hotel exceeded my expectations in every way. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's like a cozy and friendly private club in the middle of NYC. The staff are friendly, but not intrusive, and the amenities like the rooftop bar and complimentary wine  cheese reception are nice touches. (Vis a vis the rooftop bar, it does get crowded with locals after work so best to get there on the early side, like 5:30, for an outdoor table.)Although the rooms are small (I stayed in the Deluxe which was snug but comfy and nicely decorated, though a luggage rack would have been useful), they are immaculantly clean and I really loved how quiet they were. NY is loud and I have insomnia, so I was worried about staying right on Madison Avenue, but the windows are amazingly soundproofed. (At one point, there was late-night street drilling going on outside and at another point, the Indian parade was warming up on a Sunday morning, and barely a thing could be heard inside my room). Also, as I often worked in my room until early afternoon, I loved that housekeeping never once intrusively knocked or phoned asking when they could clean my room. I will most definitely be staying at the Library again when I return to NY for the holidays; it's my new home away from home.
