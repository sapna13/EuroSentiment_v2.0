{"text":"Great Place-lives up to its reputation! My 11-year old son and I stayed at the Hotel Davanzati for three nights in early December 2008. We chose it for location, free use of internet and a laptop, and because of its great reviews on this site. In our experience, the place was great. Fabrizio and Tommaso, the family and staff were all so friendly and made us feel right at home. Our room was about three steps up from the lobby. It was a large room, with two twin beds, sofa, armoire, desk with laptop, Playstation 2, and a large bathroom with a full-size bathtub (not just a shower stall). The room also had a mini bar (which we did not use) and a safe. I also liked that there was no carpet on the floor. It was cold out while we were there (just above freezing sometimes), and the room stayed warm with two steam radiators. We also kept the shutters closed which helped keep out the cold. The room was quiet despite facing front but in the summer it could be a bit louder as there would be more pedestrian traffic at night. (There are white noise machines in the rooms that can be used if this is a problem.)Breakfast was continental with delicious cappucinos and pastries and rolls etc. My son loved the chocolate breakfast cake which he would never get at home and the hot chocolate. Evening happy hour \/ cocktails was great. Nice to relax over a glass of prosecco. The location was convenient to everything-shopping, restaurants, museums, the Arno. I loved being in the middle of everything. We stayed in an apartment in Rome near the Tiber that was on Via Guila but also very quiet and not as convenient to the sights. We ate down the block at La Bussola per Fabrizio's recommendation. It was so good we went back for a second visit .If I am ever so lucky to get back to Florence, I will head back to the Hotel Davanzati. Regards from the Middle East Fabrizio and Tommaso, and thanks for the wonderful stay.
