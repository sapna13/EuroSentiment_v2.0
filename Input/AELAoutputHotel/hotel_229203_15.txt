{"text":"Good Location - Adequate Hotel The Holiday Inn Humboldt Park is actually located at the Gesundbrunnen S and U-Bahn station, not Humboldt Park. It is across from the park.Transit connections are excellent to get all over Berlin. The neighborhood is very pleasant, and typical of Berlin.The hotel itself is a modern high rise. The staff is mediocre at best. I speak German so there was no language problem. The room I was given reeked of perfume. I was exhausted upon arrival after a transatlantic flight so I took it. I figured the smell would be gone if I left the windows opened. It didn't happen. It was overpowering and I eventually asked to have my room changed. The desk staff was not pleased by this, but I insisted. It turns out that they spray perfume in smoking rooms and then let them as non-smoking rooms.The side of the hotel that faces the park has a nice view, but there is street noise. The cobblestone street is quite noisy, so with the windows open it can be bothersome.There was a very nice breakfast buffet, but it was 19 euros, which I found very expensive. There is a shopping mall across the street at the train station where I found several places to have a much less expensive breakfast. There are also a number of places in the Badstrasse to eat, including several kepab places that stay open late. I also found an Internet cafe that was very inexpensive to use and is just a block from the hotel.
