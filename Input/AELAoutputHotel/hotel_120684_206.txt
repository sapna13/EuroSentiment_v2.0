{"text":"Excellent Hotel with small beach and poor soundproofing My wife and I stayed at the Outrigger Waikiki for 5 days at the end of May. We booked the hotel through Expedia, finding a much better deal on that site than booking through the hotel's web site, which was slow, and confusing. Expedia allowed me to combine discounts that the hotel reservations didn't offer. Our package included free breakfast every day, which was terrific, and a car, which we wished we had skipped. The hotel staff was excellent. Everyone was friendly and helpful, including the valet guys and bell staff. Service was always prompt. The property was very well maintained. Our room had an ocean view, with a very small balcony. The room was large, with space for a couch and a desk with 2 chairs. The hotel provides free calling anywhere in the US, something I have never found anywhere else and free wired internet access. Most higher end properties charge for these services, and I have never stayed in a hotel with free toll calling. There are 2 problems with this hotel--a very small beach and poor soundproofing. We met an elderly lady who was badly sunburned. She said you had to be on the beach by 8:00 am to get an umbrella on the beach. There is a small strip of land and a small deck. If you come down later in the morning, you're basically out of luck, but judging the size of other hotels on waikiki, you're probably out of luck everywhere by that time. However, with a strong tropical sun, unless you're already deeply tanned, you won't be able to spend much time without shade. The water is great, with a sandy shallow area, followed by a deeper dropoff for about 50 yards and then a sandy shallow reef. You can swim or paddle out to the reef on a raft and float around through the waves.Breakfast was great. We really enjoyed eating in the open air restaurant every day when it opened at 6:30.We rented a car, but wasted our money doing so. There is transportation everywhere you would want to go. Parking is valet only for $25 per day. There are plenty of places to rent cars for the day or two you might want to drive somewhere else on the island. We went to the luau at the Sheraton Royal Hawaiian, the Pink Palace next store. It was expensive, but the food was good and the show was great.The only real downside to the hotel was the terrible soundproofing. I am a light sleeper and was awakened twice late at night by the sound of the couple in the next room making whoopee, and by the sound of the guests using their bathrooms at other times in the night. We could also hear muffled conversations in the adjoining rooms in the morning. I have usually found that hotels in this price range are pretty quiet. This one needs some work to cut down on the sound intrusion in the rooms. That said, I would stay here again, but bring soft ear plugs.The restaurants have free music, including a live band on the beach side deck on the weekends, which draws a lively crowd.The bar has a very good happy hour. The bartenders are first rate. Watch out for the Mai Tai. When they warn you about them, take heed. Meal prices on the hotel are good for Waikiki. To save money, go one block over to Kuhio Ave, where the less expensive restaurants are, or take the bus to Ala Moana shopping center, a few blocks away. Also walk up to Kapiolani Park a few blocks toward Diamond Head. We found a little festival on the weekend, with music and local food vendors, including one selling Hawaian food.Yes Waikiki is overdeveloped, crowded and touristy. But swim out to the reef, look toward Diamond Head, and have breakfast on the veranda watching the rainbow through the clouds and the surfers on the reef and you'll know why this you came.
