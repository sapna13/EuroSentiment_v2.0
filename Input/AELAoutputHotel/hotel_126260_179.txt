{"text":"5 Stars? According to who?! As a former Hotel Hopper in Manhattan, always trying to find the best hotel I thought I had found my home...NOTUpon check in on a Friday evening at 7PM OUR ROOM WAS NOT READY. Having stayed in hotels across Europe, arriving at 8AM I have ALWAYS had a room ready by 10AM or Noon at least.To not have the room ready at 7PM at this level of hotel is beyond absurd. The woman at the desk was unhelpful, condescending, and downright rude at times. At NO TIME WHAT SO EVER was any attempt made to rectify the situation, or any gesture made by the hotel for their shabby service.Furthermore, I was not given the room I booked. I booked two executive King Rooms and my sons room was on the executive level only. When I went for breakfast in the executive lounge, I was escorted out as I was not in an executive room, only my son was (of course it was all being paid by MY American Express card).My son's room had a large turquoise stain on the carpet, and THE LOCK ON THE DOOR was falling off (missing a screw)At a hotel that is as highly regarded as the Palace is, it is shocking that this would happen. From the staff who could really care less about the guests, to the rooms that lacked proper maintenance, for $600.00\/night. I would THINK TWICE about staying here again,to top it all off the Palace Lobby was like a ZOO at all hours of the day.
