{"text":"Great Great Hotel + great value My family and I (wife and 2 daughters, ages 7 and 9) stayed at the hotel Diva for a week on a vacation. We highly, highly recommend the Diva, and we had a great time.We stayed in a studio suite queen, which provided us 2 separate bedrooms that shared a bathroom, this was perfect for us. Complaints about noise on Geary street are valid, ask for a room in the back. The individual that checked us in gave us a choice and we did this, and the room was quiet.Our beds were comfortable. Our rooms weren't big, but weren't tiny either. We did fine with a week's worth of clothes as long as we were organized. Our bedrooms and bathroom were very clean and stayed that way throughout the week. Note to visitors, tip cleaning staff at any hotel a few dollars a day, this always goes a long way.The staff were sociable and helpful 100% of the time, including cleaning staff, and several staff members made it a point to be engaging to my children. My kids weren't ignored and were treated well. I greatly appreciated this. The hotel does appear to be marketed to adults, but my kids fit in fine and we did not feel out of place. I noticed they have many specials, several geared towards kids The lounges were great, I liked the style and appreciated having computers and morning coffee available.Are there homeless outside, yes, and they are all over San Francisco as well. While I don't care for being hit up for money every 5 minutes, neither was I harassed, and one homeless gentleman even directed my daughter towards the inner sidewalk when she was unsafely heading towards the street. Polite homeless folk? Only in San Francisco!I truly don't understand some of the negative reviews on this site. I've traveled a lot. Was our experience perfect? Well, I found a piece of lint once, and the screen saver on the computer in the internet lounge jammed up from time to time. Twice the coffee in the lounge came a little later than I wanted (I was on NY time and was up between 4-5am most mornings) So what? Any complaints I might have are minor in comparison to the major issues I've experienced at other hotels. You want perfection and someone to jump when something minor bothers you? Pay 5 times as much and go to an expensive chain hotel. Stay in NYC sometime and you'll see what I mean. Our experience at the Diva was much, much better than average and I would happily stay here again, with my family or on my own. It was a great experience and a great value.Dcman ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1309,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1303},{"endOffset":1309,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1303},{"endOffset":1917,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1911}]}
