{"text":"2nd visit went okay but still not my first pick THE GOOD:Free town car use in town (they expect tips and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go to the airport)Fast check-in\/check outFree internet and its fast and consistent (big plus)Pretty in old-fashioned way Very good food in restaurant\/room service (but limited selection)Tea maker in room makes excellent tea (loved it)Friendly staff in each departmentBed was decent and lighting in room was goodGood bath productsTHE BAD:Checked into wrong room (had suite, checked into regular room); they fixed when I asked about it Water in shower is extremely inconsistent and dangerous. It went from cold to scalding hot in seconds and wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ maintain a steady temperature (actually burnt my skin) Very strange strong odor in hallways (but not in rooms) Heat did not work in my room (they sent up heater but took 2 days) No clock in room (had to ask for one, which they sent) No sound proof windows; street sounds were extremely loud (sirens, cars, train whistles in early am, even heard what sounded like drag racing several nights) No bathtub in a suite room is ridiculous; only had a tiny shower Not close to Pike Street\/tourist area (but short cab\/car away)I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe given this hotel two chances. Would I stay here again? Maybe but I would definitely look elsewhere first. (W, Four Seasons, Pan Pacific, etc.) The shower burn was a big turn-off and not easy to forget. The level of service is not up to par with 4 star hotels at all but the staff is nice enough and they√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e trying. Half the issue is the building is just old. Half appears to be a lack of anticipating basic needs or informing guests of items. IeNo bathtub in an upgraded room was a rude shock. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not completely horrible but so much ends up not going smoothly or to guest expectation that it ends up feeling like a hassle. I upgraded to the junior suite on this visit because I thought it would be better than the regular room on my last visit but there was barely any difference and the lack of basics was still the same. I also do not remotely understand anyone rating this a 5 star hotel. Maybe based on friendliness yes, but execution? No way. Not if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe traveled at all and stayed at a true 5 star hotel. And they seriously need to work on the water situation. It's not only a hassle but dangerous. What if I'd been someone that couldn't jump out the way fast enough? I moved REALLY quickly and still got hurt.
