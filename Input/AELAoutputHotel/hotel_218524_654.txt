{"text":"Good but too expensive for what you have !! First, it is a 4 stars hotel... not 5 ...at all. The first employees of the week are great but the second employees and the reception are very cold. Few employes had a smile at our arrival. The food is excellente and the room are very clean. The room service is good but don't expect any ''goodies'' like special towel animals of things like that every day in your room. They change the bed, towel, clean the room and filled the bar. Don't ask for more. The concierge has a great service for all your demand but all others employees don't follow her instruction precisely and she have to confirm if the job is done right. The real problem is the dinner part. They don't have buffet. Only 7 restaurants and they don't take reservations. 2 times in the week, they have closed 3 restaurants so all the people are going to the others and imagine ... traffic. There is always lines outside all restaurants except if you are only 2 persons... you wait few minites. All the time you have to expect a late dinner. The food is also great but don't take the lobsters restaurant... no choice in the menu. The show at night are ok. 5 shows for dancers, one singer and one little circus. Don't expect a great show... only costumes.. no fantasies but it is entertaining. We had few cuts of electricity and missed water 2 times in our room. The beach is great. For my conclusion: It is a good 4 stars hotel... not 5 stars and way too expensive for what you have today. ","annotations":[]}
