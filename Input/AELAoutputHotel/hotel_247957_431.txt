{"text":"Dissapointing...definately not four star!!! We just returned from a one week stay at the Occidental Grand Flamenco. And let me say, had we known we would have booked elsewhere, definately not a four star resort.We flew Air Transat and had a premium package. Upon arrival check-in was a breeze, definately would reccomend the premium package if you can get it, since we had our own check in desk. Felix was helpful for checkin, and we were assigned our room of 24230. Once we reached our room, a good trek from the lobby, we were very disspointed in what we saw, very outdated, weird smell, and the bathroom was rusty in spots. We proceeded then to request another room and were given 24103, worse still so went back to the better of the two. Still not what I would call anywhere near a four star, maybe a three on a good day. The beach was beautiful and the water was great. The challenge came with getting a beach chair, after waking up the first morning at 7am and seeing 90% of the chairs with towels on them, we became just another person in the chair races. Don't count on sleeping in at all if you want any chance of getting a good chair, it seemed to get worse as the week progressed, on the last day we were at the beach laying claim at 5:45am, and believe it or not half the chairs were already taken.The food was ok, at best. All the a la carte restaurants had mediocreservice and food quality that bordered on the same. Water pressure was somewhat of a luxury, as was water temperature. Beware, two days there was absolutely no hot water that would even come out of the tap, just gargled and spat gross smelling muddy substance out. All I can say is good luck to whoever goes there, if you go there expecting a two to three star you will enjoy your experience. Just don't go there expecting anymore, or you'll be seriously dissapointed.
