{"text":"OK, very old fashioned - not in a good way I was set to stay in Sf for 6 days and so wanted somewhere nice to be based. A friend recommended the Mark Hopkins and so I booked.On check-in, was told I had been upgraded to a business room. However, this meant that the room had a big pointless fax\/printer in it (with no USB connection, so pretty useless) and no free internet access, so I wonder exactly what was so business-like about it.Views from the 5th floor were OK, but as the room was on the front of the building, I could hear the trams and the doorman whistling for cabs all day long. Single glazed windows that did not shut properly were great for ventilation (no need for aircon!) but lousy for blocking out the noise.My room was opposite the lifts and next to the ice machine - which also made for a noisy stay.Bathroom - poorly laid out and with infuriatingly shallow American style shower bath. I realize that most Americans prefer to shower, but I want a bath I can actually soak in and enjoy. Either put in a proper bath or don't bother - put in a good shower stall! Ugly marble does not a luxury bathroom make. Very low shower pressure - i also heard another guest complain of this, so not just a problem with my room.Bed very comfy, so apart from the noise, a decent night's sleep.General service - not up to standard I'm afraid. As a late riser, I must have caused havoc for housekeeping, but while they managed to change the bed each day after I eventually left, no-one ever got around to restocking the minibar.I did consider checking out early and moving to a different hotel, but I had pre-paid in order to get the better internet rate. Doh! Wanting to avoid the hassle of a confrontation, I stayed put.In summary: great location, but old fashioned without being charming. I expect more from a hotel of this ranking.
