{"text":"Some concierge behind the desk need to communicate We decided to stay at the Ritz for our honeymoon after discovering a great deal through Singapore Airline Stopover Holiday. Initial impression on the place and services were absolutely immaculate. The concierge that helped us when we checked in was great. Unfortunately the subsequent concierge service was less than perfect. We decided to use the concierge service to help us with our internet check in as we wanted particular seats on our long haul flight to London. Unfortunately, due to lack of communication, we ended up with seats 2nd last row from the back of the plane, where we didn't want. As the seatings were now confirmed, we were unable to change the location. Normally on a short flight, we wouldn't have minded, unfortunately this is a 13hr flight! We ended up with the most uncomfortable flight experience which dampened our trip a bit. I wished the concierge would have given us a call before confirming those seats. Otherwise, all of the floor staff were very polite, friendly and extremely helpful. Greeted all the guests when they walk by, and opening doors etc.We had a room in the Kelang View side, which we thought was quite nice. Room is slightly dated, but the bathroom is still nice and modern. Nicest mattress we've ever slept on! Only noise we could hear at night are people walking in the hallway. Maybe a reposition of the bed in the room would minimise these noise?Overall a comfortable stay. ","annotations":[]}
