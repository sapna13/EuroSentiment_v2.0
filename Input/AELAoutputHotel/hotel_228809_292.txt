{"text":"Very nice hotel in great location! My husband and I spent 6 nights (Sept 7-13) here and for the most part were very happy. I spent many hours searching trip advisor and the internet for a place to stay. I always worry about finding a hotel in another country that will be in a nice area, affordable, and up to my expectations (which my husband says are too high). Given the great reviews on this site I felt comfortable booking at this hotel and was glad to find I had made a good choice.The staff was very friendly and spoke English perfectly, although we did not converse with them much.We were very happy with the room. They look just as the pictures on the website show. Not often do you find the pictures to actually be accurate. The room was cleaned spotless everyday. We had a junior suite that was nice and big. The toilet was in a separate area from the shower\/tub which was nice. The decor was very pleasant however there was no room for toiletries in the bathroom so be prepared to use a shelf in the closet.I had originally planned to book a club room but they were not available when I booked. We saw into one of those rooms and it looked like it was nice sized and would have been fine. We also saw into a standard room and that looked very small and cramped. However depending on how much time you spend in the room this hotel can accommodate everyone's taste.It was nice to have the option of air-conditioning as it got quite warm the last few days of our stay but most nights we just slept with a window open slightly and were very comfortable.Free internet access in the rooms was a plus.The location was great and close to the Metro. We did not eat at the hotel so I can't comment on the breakfast however 12 euros seemed quite a lot to pay for breakfast.One issue we did have, although I can't really fault the hotel, was the people in the room above us. They were traveling with what appeared to be twins about 2 years old and had no common sense or courtesy to those guests in the rooms around them. The first 2 nights we listened to them running back and forth across the floor and crying until after 2:00am. and the father repeating over and over stop it. We asked about switching rooms and were told that those people were moving. It turned out they only moved for 2 nights and then were back above us. (The 2 nights they were somewhere else were very quitet ). We did not ask to be moved again as we didn't realize it until the 5th night that they were back and we only had 1 more to go. I admit we did not complain to the front desk as we should have but could not believe those people could be so insensitive and rude to the other guests. I would encourage anyone traveling with small children to consider those others around you that may be enjoying some time away from their own kids and plan your days so as not to disrupt the routines your children are accustomed to causing them to be disruptive at odd hours.Overall I would highly recommend this hotel and would definately consider staying here again if we visit Paris in the future.
