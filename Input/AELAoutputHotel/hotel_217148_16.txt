{"text":"You can't belive a word they say The room was clean, though the air conditioning system's operation was unpredictable. We attended the eBay Convention and asked whether or not we should drive or take their shuttle. We were told that the shuttle was definitely better, as the parking at the convention center was $20 - $30, and traffic was terrible. When we asked about the frequency and reliability of the shuttle, we were told that the shuttle would leave every 30-40 minutes, but that when we were ready to return to the hotel, all we needed to do was call the hotel and a shuttle would pick us up within 15 minutes of our calling. Although they had several shuttle vehicles of varying sizes, they never were able to accommodate all of the people who were ready to be transported, especially on the return trip. The 15 minute pick-up promise was a misquote, to say the least, as it always took more than 45 minutes for a shuttle to pick us up, and never were there enough seats for all who had called. Calls to the hotel manager were answered with reports that the manager was not on the property. Additionally, parking at the Convention Center was $10 and the traffic was never bad, and we would have gladly paid to park and drive ourselves, rather than be among the last persons to be picked up from the Conventiion Center each evening. We will never recommend this place to anyone, and will never again lodge here. ","annotations":[]}
