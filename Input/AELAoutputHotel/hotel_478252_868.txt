{"text":"Loved the Bahia, would recommend this Resort! I have been to Punta Cana on 3 other occassions and would rate the Bahia as the best overall resort I have stayed at so far !(Breezes, Palladium and Ocean Blue on prior trips). I came down from 2\/3-2\/10 with my mother for a relaxing get -away and that is exactly what we got! We arrived on Saturday night with no problems....USA 3000 Charter out of Hartford, CT was flawless. Went right through customs and straight to resort. We had upgraded to Club Golden and and were taken with our luggage directly to our room in Building 1 - what a surprise when we realized that we had a room right on the beach! The ocean breeze was fantastic and the location was close to both the main pool and beach which made getting a lounger in the morning very easy! The main pool and beach do fill up early, but that is no different than any other resort I have been to. By the time we unpacked, it was late so I called room service and nacho chips and cheese were delivered in less than 10 minutes!We ate at 4 of the Ala Carte restaurants and they were all excellent! Japanese was fun...after dinner you are moved to another table to allow the next group to come in and allow you to relax and enjoy dessert and an after dinner drink (try the Mama Juana). Le Gourmet, the French restaurant, was so elegant and the service was the best we received all week! I had the Surf and Turf and Mom had the pork tenderloin...excellent! The Garden Grille was also very good although my rib eye was a little grizzly...I would recommend the T-bone that our neighbor at the next table had...a large man and he could not finish it! Finally, on our last night, we ate at the Beach BBQ and feasted on all the lobster tails I could eat as well as steak, chicken, ribs, salads, etc! The buffets at dinner were varied and the food was fresh. If you can't find something you like, well, then I don't know what to say! Plenty of choices for breakfast and lunch as well. You can always go to the main buffet or a variety of other choices. We ate pool side most days and tried Italian on one occassion...the calzone was tasty as well as a pizza my Mom ordered. Variety is not an issue at this resort!Transportation is easy...this resort is huge but they have the trolley system down pat, so you never, ever wait around for a ride. We were so tired every night that we didn't stay up for the shows (other than watching the Super Bowl on Sunday night in the Karaoke lounge!) but we heard they were good. Our room was impeccable and our fridge was always stocked with water and other beverages. I tipped our maid $2 every day and left a small gift....not necessary but she left our room perfect every day! What is different at this resort is that everyone from the pool staff, to the wait staff, to the bartenders, all had a smile on their face and worked very hard to make your stay enjoyable. It was the most consistent service we have ever had. Sure, the language barrier was there...but we always managed to get our request across. It actually got funny sometimes! I went in with average expectations based on some of the reviews I read, and I must say that my expectations were exceeded! The food, rooms, and overall quality of the resort were absolutely fantastic!I would recommend this resort to anyone looking for great weather, great beaches, great accomodations and overall relaxation. You can do alot, or, you can do absolutely nothing! I am actually returning in April with a group of 40 friends and have no doubt in my mind that they will enjoy it as much as I did!
