{"text":"A great home base for activities Stayed there last week as part of a large group that took up most of the hotel. The hotel itself is nice and the grounds are well kept with a fantastic beach. Lounge chairs  umbrellas were complimentary and there were plenty to go around. The beach is fairly large and never got too crowded. Beach toys are available for rent. We had a room on the 6th floor with a great ocean view and a balcony overlooking the main back yard with views of the pools and beach areas. Anything lower and the palm trees may obscure your view a bit. We had 2 double beds which were ok although we would have preferred a king. Tile floors and the bathroom was nice sized. Overall it was clean and comfortable. We got a mini fridge to cut down on costs and they brought that up within 5 minutes of asking for it. We only ate at the resort once at Aqua Luna which was ok...not fantastic but good overall. Our best meals were ones we got offsite consisting of local food. The numbered kioks at Luquillo beach (about 5 minutes from the hotel) off of Route 3 on the left hand side (2 stoplights away) were great. We went 3 times. They all offer similar food but #58 had a whole spit roasted pig which was outstanding and the best pork we've ever had. Across from them was a little tent selling chicken  pork skewers for $2 each which were also good (chicken better). #60 had a great seafood rice dish chock full of seafood. We spent between $10-20 each time we went. You can pick up the food  walk about 30 steps to Luquillo beach which is directly behind the food kiosks. Another great find was Ismar's Bakery on the corner of Route 3  where you turn into the Westin. Great Cuban  Pastrami sandwiches. Pueblo, the supermarket also had a great little cafe that had even locals lined up. If you are driving yourself from the airport, you will find plenty of supermarkets along Route 3 (which has tons of stoplights) to stock up on food  drinks. Must do's: 1) the Biobay in Fajardo...we're so glad we tried it and swam with the dinoflagellates...we just drove to the pier and paid $45\/each to EcoAdventures 2) El Yunque hiking - tip...take the Ranger hike for $5\/adult that lasts 1 hour to learn more about the rainforest  its inhabitants if you want a tour rather than pay $60 for the same thing from a tour operator 3) Nature Reserve of Las Cabezas (near Biobay in Fajardo) offers a $7\/adult tour of the reserve 4) cock fights in Isla Verde to see locals enjoying a favorite pasttime for $10.75 for men (ladies get in free) 5) old san juanWould stay at the Westin Rio Mar again.
