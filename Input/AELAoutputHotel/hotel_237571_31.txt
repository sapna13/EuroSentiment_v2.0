{"text":"Nice with one caveat I appreciated the nice, quiet neighborhood where this hotel is located. Its peaceful and refreshing compared to the busy areas near the center towards the train station. The staff at the the reception were very friendly and took time to answer our questions. Room had a nice view of the park and canal. There is some noise from the park in the evenings from the people having picnics etc., but it becomes background chatter and easy to get used to. In the morning you can hear only the birds chirping (and there are many varieties due to the general leafiness of the area). We noticed some mosquitoes in the evening due to the close proximity to the lake nearby I guess, but they were not too bothersome. The neighborhood is very nice, some nice restaurants, and grocery stores nearby selling organic produce. Nice tapas place 5-minute walk! The only thing that bothered us was the room cleaning service - the bedsheets are changed every 3 days. Once we wanted to change the sheet after one day, and deliberately put the sheet in the bathroom floor for this purpose. However, much to our surprise, the sheets were put back on the bed from the wet bathroom floor! After we explained the situation to the front desk, they were sympathetic and quickly gave us new sheets. They explained that the cleaning staff was outsourced to an outside company, and beyond their control. Other than this small mishap, its a great hotel in a peaceful, quiet area, and the front desk staff was quite nice and helpful.
