{"text":"I'll be back!!! This past July, we hotel hopped, Stayed in Fajardo, Isla Verde, and Ponce. Staying in Ponce allowed us to visit the central part of the Island (many mountains and incredibly beautiful) wich was only about half hour away. The northern part of Island was about 1 hour away and the West coast 30-45 min drive. We had never stayed at the Hilton, reading the reviews here helped us decide to risk it. Well worth it. Unfortunately, We only spent evenings and mornings there and did not enjoy the facilities enough. The next time down, we will spend more time at the hotel.The rooms were clean, neat and a sort of modern decor. The open lobby invites you to stay and enjoy the ocean breeze. The lower lobby restaurant, seemed to have a formal or semi formal setting, I'll try it next time. Pool was very spacious, many palm trees, and alot of facilities for the kids . Parking is extensive and the casino is entertaining and inexpensive . Staff couldn't be any friendlier. The beach is not good for swimming, but hey, 15-30 min away, you have many beautiful beaches.About 5 minutes south of the hotel is a place called La Guancha they have typical food and music. A beatiufl sunset there (currently my computer's background). The concierge gave us a map of Ponce, we visited downtown. Very historical; the architectural landscape was unbelievable, took some great pictures. People very friendly, a cop on every corner. Ck out the Fire Station, and have an Ice Cream at a store right in front of the fire station..... I had a coconut one and it was reallll gooodCan't wait to re-visit!!!
