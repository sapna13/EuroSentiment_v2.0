{"text":"I wouldn't stay here if you paid me! My partner and I had booked 4 nights stay at Hotel Brian for July 2008. When we arrived we were able to check straight into our room. They only took cash so we arranged to put our bags in our room and go get more cash out. Trying to get up the stairs to the top floor was like climbing a ladder. The stairs were so steep  small it was nearly impossible with backpacks. If you had a suitcase you wouldn't be able to get up the stairs. Once on the top floor (3rd or 4th floor) we entered our Double Room with Shared Bathroom facilties. We were due to pay $87AUD per night for this room. The lock on the door was faulty. The room was unbelievably small, smelly and not particularly clean. The 'Double Bed' was more like a single cot on the floor. And the room had no furniture. I have no doubt in my mind there would have been bed bugs. The roof was just a skylight that was covered in dirt and the window was small  dirty with bars across. To make matters worse, the toilet was filthy and the shower\/bathroom was OUT OF ORDER! That was the last straw for us so we went downstairs, paid for the first night to be fair and left to find other accommodation. I definitely would not recommend this place unless you are extremely tight on money and don't mind sleeping in filth. This is more like a really bad hostel than a hotel.
