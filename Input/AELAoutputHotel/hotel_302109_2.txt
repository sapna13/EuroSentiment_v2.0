{"text":"Very Good but not Excellent First impression from the outside is that it is very dated, but most of the inside tells a different story. When I say most, we stayed in the Horizon Tower and, in my opinion, this is showing its√à√\u2020\u2022?age. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get me wrong, the room was very clean, adequate and a comfortable bed, but I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥oh this is nice√à√\u2020\u2022?when I walked in, it just felt like a normal good standard room that could do with a bit of updating. Other posts have mentioned that their rooms had recently been renovated, I can only assume they hadn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ done ours yet. One other comment about the room, although not a major issue, is that it didn't have a separate shower as mentioned on the website room description.We booked directly with the hotel, their website gives different package options and they say they won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be beaten on price. We decided to go with the club room and glad that we did when we found out the price of food and drink at the hotel, and outside for that matter. We took breakfast in the Blu restaurant on the club floor, this was excellent with plenty of choice with the buffet and a la carte menu - and the fried eggs were cooked exactly to order, not an easy thing apparently judging by the other hotels we stayed at on this trip! If not included in the price, breakfast costs SG$40 a person. All the staff on the club floor were very pleasant, attentive and would help with anything you asked for. We did make the most of the club lounge and went to the early evening cocktail drinks each night. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ glad we did as the first night we went to an outside restaurant, nothing grand, a can of Guinness cost SG$18. We also found out later that the cocktails in the hotel were SG$25 a go, so the additional cost of the club lounge well and truly paid for itself.We also tried some of the local food outside the hotel. We ate at the Maxwell hawker centre in Chinatown, limited choice of mainly chicken and rice but food was excellent and cheap at SG$3 a meal. The lady concierge at the hotel recommended a good roti pratta caf√ã√\u2022√ñ near River Valley Road, fantastic! It was a true locals place and the roti and chicken curry were excellent and less than SG$10 for two. Overall the service and staff at the hotel were very good and the hotel is in a convenient location within walking distance to the shops, restaurants and bars of Orchard road as well as the MRT. For the price though, I have stayed at better hotels and would probably check out the others if I were to return to Singapore.
