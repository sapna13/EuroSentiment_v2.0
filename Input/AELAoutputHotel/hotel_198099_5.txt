{"text":"Good Hotel, not fantastic We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights, in mid march of 08. The hotel is clean, and looks nice in the lobby, and we were happy enough with our room, which featured a HUGE king bed and enormous bathroom. I do agree with the woman who said the decor was dark, but we did think it interesting, as it was in a bit of the 'old style' tapestry - you could envision yourself in bed under the old style of curtains and canopies, if you were inclined. The breakfast was good - we've enjoyed better at the Mercure, with more options, but it was satisfying enough. The 'snacks' you can get in the lobby dining area are outrageously expensive, so go walking to find food if you can. Similarly, room service is no deal, with the tip adding onto every bill. The maids were very kind and gracious - rarely do I compliment the maid service, but they were truly very nice, even though we chose not to make use of their services (save the environment and all). The internet access fee was expensive - we didn't like that too much, and location wise, it was a little farther from the 'hub' than we would have liked, but the metro is so good, it doesn't matter. The staff seemed less than eager to help us poor non-French speakers (although we do limp by in French adequately). Other than that, it is Paris, and it is a clean room. I wouldn't steer you away from it! ","annotations":[]}
