{"text":"Welcoming, Relaxing, and Healthy! We loved the FS Miami. Hello,The Four Seasons Hotel is our favorite hotel in Miami, for a relaxing healthy getaway. This is the fifth time we have stayed at the Four Seasons Miami and it gets better with every visit. We were warmly greeted at the front door by the valet with an immediate offer to help us with our luggage. Upon entering the lobby we were again warmly greeted by Drew, Gabriel, and, remembering us from a previous visit by the wonderful Alvin Tham, and quickly checked into our room. The rooms are the highest quality currently available in Miami. They are a very spacious 550 sqf decorated with sleek bright very comfortable furniture and bed. The bathrooms are equally spacious with the tubs perfect for deep soaking and the shower water pressure strong. Terry cloth robes are thick and enveloping. They welcomed our small dog (without a deposit or extra cost) providing him with a special welcome amenity (he never eats dog treats but he loved the ones the Four Seasons gave him). Outside of our room retreat we took full advantage of the Sports Club LA a short elevator ride away. This enormous gym provides hotel guests complimentary yoga classes, spinning classes, weight training classes, step etc. The spa, Splash, is very good though I wish that they offered manicures and pedicures. These services are offered on the hotel premises but by another salon occupant called Rikrak. We both had massages which were uniformly excellent, providing just the relaxation we needed. The hotels private Olympic pool and manicured acres surrounding it are unparalled. The restaurant, Aqua, serves a fabulous dinner and Sunday Brunch, the lamb is exceptional as is the baramundi (white fish, ask for it without the skin). It was our anniversary and after asking the pastry chef if he could surprise my spouse with something he recommended a plate of chocolate cookies. I was skeptical but when I SMELLED them outside the door to be delivered I knew they were the right choice. Hats off to their French pastry chef. Thank you for another wonderful stay. We are looking forward to returning...
