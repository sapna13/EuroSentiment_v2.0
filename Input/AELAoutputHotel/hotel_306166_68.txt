{"text":"Good Service, Friendly  We booked a Classic guest room but had been given an upgrade to an Executive Room on the Executive floor, with all pluses that comes along with it. We had our 2 young kids (pre-schooler and baby) with us so was quite nervous about the upgrade, being around the business travellers and all. But as soon as we got into our room, we knew that all guests, both big and very small, would be given equal treatment, that is all staff was friendly, welcoming and attentive. For those with children considering the Conrad:-I can say that they were excellent with our kids. Although the Conrad is mainly for Business Travellers, and not a family hotel, they will still cater to the needs of children. The baby cot had the same linen used for the KS bed, but was made to fit perfectly (with mini quilt and a pillow), my preschooler had his own kid size bedroom slippers and bathrobe, both embossed with Conrad on it, and of course the signature teddy bear and rubber duckie, and my baby was given an even smaller teddy bear with a nappy on it! there was also the complimentary child toiletry pack with shampoo, talcum, wall plug safety covers, etc. and because we were upgraded to Executive room (27th floor corner room) all the goodies (chocolates, a great selection of fruits etc.) that comes with it. Room service was excellent in assisting with our baby's food preparation, but a bit slower on the Saturday night due to influx of people (plus there was a wedding on whilst we were there). All staff from Concierge to Housekeeping were friendly and chatted to our kids.For all others considering the Conrad:Although the Conrad is a 5 star hotel, it is not really a Luxurious 5 star hotel as usually known elsewhere and to those who are well travelled and used to the luxury concept. As pointed out by my husband, if you prefer a more luxury feel and ambience (but still in the Suntec\/Marina area), then you should go to the Ritz (which is where he stays when on Business), but of course that comes with the additional price you have to pay. So if money isn't an object - choose the Ritz. And for those with high expectations and attention to detail, i'll mention the following, which you can consider as a minus: room desk chairs due for stain removing or reupholstering, beigy\/cream colored carpets due for stain removing, what Conrad terms as our luxurious bathrobe were thinning and fraying at the edges and need replacing (our kid's bathrobe was much thicker, whiter and newer in comparison!) and just an overall review of condition of furnishing and fittings to ensure they remain at mark as it is probably timely for a refurbishment, similar to that going on with other hotels in the area (i.e. Oriental  Marina Mandarin)..I can understand why the earlier comment was made by the Hilton Diamond member about this Conrad being similar standard to Hilton rather than a luxury brand of hilton...Others:-Dining: We dined at Oscar's which has a great ambience and good selection of food, no complaints.Location: You can't go wrong with Conrad's or any other hotel located in Marina \/ Suntec area. Everything is within walking distance and accesibility through connecting buildings.Room View: Ours was a corner room with a view of the bay, but somewhat covered by Pan Pac and Marina Mandarin hotels..not really an issue if you're on the higher floors (ours was 27th of 31 floors)...But other than the luxury factor, the Conrad does its job well in terms of service and friendliness (and well informed staff and concierge); and fulfills its 5 star expectations.
