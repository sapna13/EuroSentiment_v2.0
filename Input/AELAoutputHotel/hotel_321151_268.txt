{"text":"Comfortably Modern in a Great Location We stayed here over a weekend for 3 nights from Aug 4th to 7th in a Superior King room booked through an online site about a month in advance. Before tax, each night averaged Cdn $200, a great price given what the hotel has to offer.The location is fantastic. Situated in the Back Bay, it's about a 5min walk to several subway stations (Back Bay, Copley, Arlington) on both the Green and Yellow lines -- giving you a choice of starting points depending on where your destination is. The hotel is about 3 short blocks to Copley Square where the beautiful Trinity Church and Public Library are found. It's also just a 5-10min walk to a number of other destinations -- including the Prudential Centre, Newbury St. (great for shopping and late night dining), and the Public Garden. Anywhere you can't walk is an easy 10-15min subway ride away.The room was very clean, relatively spacious, and warmly modern. It featured a wide entry area, with a large double-door closet and oversized full-length mirror. The comfortable king bed was flanked on one side by a bedstand, and on the other by a large desk. This work area would be great for business travellers (with a rolling office chair, and free high speed access). One corner of the room had a side table and chair for reading. The TV was housed in a large wooden wall unit with lots of drawer space, a CD stereo (CDs can be loaned from the concierge), and a small fridge, great for storing drinks and snacks -- and which they stock with 2 complimentary bottles of water each day.The large marble-tiled bathroom featured a granite-topped wood vanity with lots of counter space, plus an additional glass shelf under the mirror for overflow. The tub was fairly small, but clean. Toiletries were Aveda, the towel-rack held oversized bath towels and was heated (didn't seem to do much for the towels, but a nice touch!).Other amenities included: Large in-room safe, ironing board and steam iron, bathrobes, umbrella for rainy days, two clock radios on either side of the bed, and a full-sized hair dryer. For turndown service, staff fill your ice bucket, leave chocolate on the pillow, and turn the stereo on to classical music.The room was very quiet, never once did I hear any hallway noise. The downstairs sitting areas were very comfortable and in the mornings you can grab breakfast treats and coffee at the Barista Cafe. As others have noted, the lobby bar is very busy, but wasn't a problem where we were staying (9th floor).We easily checked our bags for a few hours on the last day, before setting out for Back Bay station to take the subway to the airport (40 mins door to door -- at $1.25 an economical option if you're looking to save on cabs!).Overall, this was a great hotel in a convenient location. I would not hesitate to stay here again if looking for lodging in the price range that I paid.
