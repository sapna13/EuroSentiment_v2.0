{"text":"Great value in Seattle We needed somewhere to stay for a day or two after our cruise, but didn't want to spend $150 a night. Found this hotel for about 90 bucks a night, and it was a good value. Very clean, the guys who drove the shuttle were prompt (look for the van to say Executel though, not Best Western), and they took us to a couple of places not on the usual route whilst we tracked down a rental car.Front desk staff was professional and friendly. We didn't try the pool, but the spa was spacious and well heated, and big enough for several people. The room was clean, and no problems other than a toilet that needed a jiggle of the handle once in a while.They have signage saying that they are undergoing renovations, but don't let this scare you off -- it seems to mostly be external, and never was obvious to us unless you looked in those areas where the siding was being done. There is work going on in the dressing areas of the pool though, as there is no sink in the restroom there. It would be nice to have a drinking fountain down there.Shuttles run to and from the airport promptly on the half hour, and when we left at 4:00am, they even had a banana, muffin and juice for the road. Restaurant staff was friendly, as well as timely. TRY THE CHEESECAKE! It's probably the best I've ever had -- and who'd have thought?The business center has three computers, a printer, and some miscellaneous things like paper and pens. It's in a locked room, and has a quick connection to the net, though it's a bit crampy in there if someone is yacking on their phone.If you are a tourist just keep in mind, it's about 20 minutes from Pike Place and downtown, so plan to either be very brave and get a rental car (awful traffic) or take the bus across the street. There are also some commercial tour places that will pick you up for Seattle tours, but we didn't try that at all.All in all, a nice value, and we'd definitely stay there again.
