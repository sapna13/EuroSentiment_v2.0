{"text":"Good choice near the Wharf This H I Express is the nicest we've stayed in by far. We were pleased with the solid construction - never heard neighbor noise or traffic noise (we had courtyard rooms.) The breakfast bar was fully stocked for a large crowd and they kept it full for the entire morning. The room was updated and stocked with all the right things, the beds were comfortable and the fiber-filled pillow selection was great.We only had 2 complaints:1) no wireless in the rooms. They do have connections in the rooms, but it doesn't work easily for Mac users. The staff was very attentive in trying to help us make it work, but in the end, we just used 1 of the 2 computers near the lobby that they keep open for guest use, which is very helpful.2) despite a reservation for 2 adjacent rooms made 6 months ago, the only thing they had available were two 1st floor streetside rooms (they admitted the rooms were noisy.). But they accommodated by putting us on the quieter 3rd floor. Though the rooms were far apart, they didn't question us when we had our teens stay alone in the 2nd room. (Many hotels have a problem with that.)The hotel is near some great restaurants (Joe's Crab Shack - great family friendly menu and view over fun goings on in the wharfside street) and Boudin (very good chowder - recommend the outdoor eatery - less hectic.) It's an easy walk to Ghiradelli  Cannery Row and a pleasant, do-able walk to Pier 39.Transportation advice: The hotel is near the 2 starting point terminals for cable cars, but if you go after 10 am, you're looking at a half hour wait (an hour on weekends.) However the historic street car (the F line) that travels down Embacadero isn't too crowded except during the 4:30 - 6pm rush hour. And that's only $1.50 per trip. That line can take you to the Ferry Building area, or to Union Square. From there you could walk up to ChinaTown. We wasted our money on the 3 day $18 municipal pass. The cable cars were too crowded to make use of, so we used the buses or the streetcars, which are significantly cheaper.Our family's favorite things - Alacatraz (get tix a day in advance or order from alcatrazcruises.com online), a Giants game and Pier 39 (sea lions, shops and Hard Rock Cafe). Due to the cold weather, we didn't rent bikes and ride through G G park or across the bridge. Next time . . .
