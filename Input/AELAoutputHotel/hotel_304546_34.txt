{"text":"Not bad, but upgrades are not completed... I stayed here recently for 6 days. The location, near the Ikebukuro Station is very convenient- there are a lot of places to shop and explore, many restaurants, all within walking distance. I didn't go to any of the in-house restaurants as a previous poster stated, they are quite pricey. The Business Center with the computers and printers for guests was not bad, and the in-room free Internet was quite fast. Note: despite what others may have posted, NOT ALL THE ROOMS ARE UPGRADED! Only about 1\/3 of the floors are upgraded. While the non-upgraded rooms are not by any means bad, they are a bit dated and worn (circa 1990s). The room I had was a standard double- one night in the non-upgraded and the rest in an upgraded room. The upgraded rooms are very nice- deserving of the 4 star rating. The double bed rooms are tiny, though. We could barely fit 2 26 suitcases and had to use the table as a second luggage rack. There is no desk. Otherwise, it was quite comfortable. I also saw the 2 twin-rooms and their size is better-suited for 2 people. The double rooms are probably best for solo travelers.Overall, this hotel is a great value for Tokyo. The staff really do try to be helpful. If they ever get around to upgrading all the floors (not sure if this is planned), then this would certainly be one of the best values in Tokyo.
