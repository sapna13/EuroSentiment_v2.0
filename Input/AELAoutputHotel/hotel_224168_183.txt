{"text":"Great Location The location of this hotel is excellent if you want to look round Hollywood and this has to one of the main features of the hotel. Check in was fine - a little business like but then it is full of business people\/conference facilities. Not sure what people expect from a check in but after a 10 hour flight you just want efficiency.Room was nice - we were on the club level which was nice - had a good view of the Hollywood sign but to be honest as soon as you walk out of the hotel you can see that. The room was clean and had everything we needed\/wanted (no turn down though).As for the club level - you get breakfast which was ok and hot snacks in the evening. As far as I was aware there was no alcohol available and if it was then it was not obvious. Fruit and cold drinks available throughout the day. I would say it is worth it - just but only just.Gripes of our stay:- I had asked for a fridge in our room and also a bottle of champagne to be delivered after we arrived (I received an e-mail before we arrived asking if we wanted anything upon arrival). After 2 hours neither had arrived so I called and was told that I had to request them when I checked in as they wouldn't know when I would arrive (except at the point that I checked in surely!!!!!!!!!!!!) Rubbish answer to a simple request.I called the bell boy to help with luggage but there was no reply but by the time we got to the ground floor and fell out of the lift weighed down with 6 bags we were asked if we wanted any help. That would be the help for the remaining 10 yards that didn't answer the phone and also wasn't around as I walked from my room to the lift and down.Bar was nice in the eveningbut didn't try the restaurant, gym small but well equiped and swimming pool is clean and with a great view.
