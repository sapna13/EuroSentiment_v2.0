{"text":"Good location for restaurants, shopping and night life Stayed at the Grand Hyatt this past March. The hotel is a high rise in an area convenient to restaurants, shopping and night life. There is no central business district per-se in Tokyo. There are areas all over the city like this one, that are business centers, but not just a main one like in most cities. You can really see this, when you go next door to the hotel, where they have a mall and on top of that building an observatory\/area where you can see the whole city at your feet. We had booked a room in the concierge floor and was smallish but confortable with an amazing bathroom. A gigantic open shower, with a groove for drainage in between the shower and the equally huge tub. Separate toilet that serves other purposes as well. All very interesting. Tried their subway system on a holiday and Saturday (wouldn't go on a regular work day) and it's quite an experience. People were so nice, they come and try to help you even when you don't ask, as the number of available lines and the areas they cover are overwhelming. All types of restaurants around the area, from sushi places, to TGIF, to a Brazilian (very close to the hotel, which I wouldn't recommend at all as the service stinks), and clubs. Try a typical Japanese Steak House, it's quite an experience. Once you choose your steak, which they bring to your table, they'll provide you with raw samples of the chosen steaks for your approval. Wanted to pay extra for a late check-out of the hotel ,but was allowed to stay only until 3PM (our flight out of Tokyo was at 10 PM) for a percentage of the room rate. Oh well.Good hotel, considered one of the most expensive in Tokyo by our business associates, good stay, great city. ","annotations":[]}
