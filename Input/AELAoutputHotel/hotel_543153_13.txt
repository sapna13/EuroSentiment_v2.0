{"text":"Hot and noisy I booked this hotel based soley on trip advisor recommmendations; adn travelled there with my 2 boys for 4 days at the beginning of May. The taxi driver had no problem finding the hotel, even though I had taken the precaution of printing the map.On arrival, we were greeted by very pleasant reception staff and shown around the ground floor, which basically consisted of a seating area and a little room where you could have 24 hour complimentary tentempe. This consisted of breads, soft drinks, juices, water, crisps, doughnuts,crackers, nuts, cheeses, tomatoes. In a fridge there were simple salads,various sandwiches and desserts. All were clearly marked and looked fresh. The area appeared to be very claen. There were different bins for the different types of waste, which I thought was impressive.The only downside to this area was that, according to my 11 year old, it felt like being in an airport terminal. The lay out and the clinical athmosphere were not what we are used to. However, when in Barcelona.....I had booked a suite, simply because my 2 boys and I would not have fitted in a standard room. One of us would would have had to stay across the hall. The suite consisted of a bathroom, sliding door to bedroom, sliding door to living room with sofa bed and french windows to tiny balcony and street outside. Therefore, we had none of this hopping across the corridor to the living room that other people had. There was a television in both the bedroom and the living room. The bathroom was ok, though the tiling looked cheap and poorly finished.It is hard to pinpoint why, but, for us, it just did not work. It was as if I was back in the caravans of my youth! The dim lighting,the sliding doors, the sparse sense of the place, a vaguely musty damp smell.In any event, it was late so we unpacked and went to bed. I agreed to take first night on the sofe bed (Stupid mom eh!) Then the fun started. The room was very hot and though we tried to adjust the aircon, it remained very hot so we could not sleep properly. The living room was right beside the street so it was quite noisy until 2 or 3 am with people in the street; short respite, then noise again from 5am, presumably this time from garbage and cleaning trucks. I must have finally dozed at 8 or so because it was 11 before we finally woke, shattered, and ran down to grab something for breakfast before it finished. The selection was good, well presented and enjoyable.After breakfast, I went to reception and explained about the aircon problem. The girl was attentive and interested. She said that she would try to have it sorted for us. I explained thaif she could not get it fixed we were happy to move rooms. She told me that they were fully booked so I said that , if the problem could not be remedied,we would have to move to another hotel.We went back to the room( I think it was 35) to get sorted and within 5 minutes a gentleman appeared at the door. If memory serves, his name was Peter. He explained that there had been problems with the aircon and that he was happy to move us to another hotel. He would arrange to have our luggage transferred and we could go ahead, inspect the hotel, and confirm whether it was acceptable to us. This we duly did ( see report on hotel regina)We checked out shortly after and I have to admit that I was surprised to be charged the full rate; though the wine I had the night before was comped. I suppose i expected more of a gesture given that we had not slept and that much time was to be wasted changing hotel. In any event, I was too tired to say anything.I paid the bill and we just moved to the other hotel.All in all, the saving grace of this hotel was its staff. I found the service at all times to be excellent. However, it was not enough to overcome the clinical athmosphere,the broken air con and the noisy rooms. We won't be back.
