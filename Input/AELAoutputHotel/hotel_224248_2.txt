{"text":"Excellent value; below average location Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights pre-cruise. Very nice room. Great free breakfast and coffee service. Didn't use pool but it seemed nice. Business office offered free internet access which was very helpful. There was a small pantry selling snacks at absolutely ridiculous prices. Only reason to use the pantry would be to avoid leaving the grounds of the hotel. The surrounding area is pretty run down. There are no restaurants except a few fast food places. I didn't feel very safe in the area, especially at night. The hotel has gated parking that you need a room key to access. It seemed fairly secure, but I can see how someone with bad intentions could easily hop the fence and break into a car and then throw the stolen goods back over the fence. I noticed that the door at the back of the hotel near the eating area that is locked at night (need room key to open) got stuck open a couple of times when we were going through it with our bags. We had to put down our stuff and pull it shut. If you didn't realize that it wasn't going to close behind you, it could end up being open all night long. If someone wanted to jump the fence and access the hotel this way it would be easy. I appreciate the manager's response on this site, but I do have to say I am disturbed by the guest's report of a poor response from the hotel. That would be a very traumatic thing to have happen. If the break-in wasn't discovered until 7:30 AM, it shows the security guard wasn't patrolling the grounds at all. Knowing the neighborhood that this hotel is in and the lack of effort from the security guard and poor response from the hotel to the other guest's break-in, I have to say I won't stay at this hotel again.
