{"text":"Londress Eiffel My wife and I stayed at the Hotel Londres Eifel in mid-september. FWIW, I used trip advisor for all of the research for our european vacation and by and large the reviews from other contributers were fairly accurate. Bottom Line upfront- the hotel was nice, clean and affordable.For someone who had never traveled outside the states unless I was ona cruise ship, the size of the rooms was something you need to get used too. The rooms and baths are immaculately clean but they are small. It doesnt really matter because you will find yourself spending hardly anytime there anyways.a slight annoyance was the fact that despite numerous email confirmations they failed to have our eiffel tower view room available when we got there and put us on a lower floor. To compensate they offered us two free tickets for a cruise on the seine. (which was offfered without any complaining on our behalf-they genuinely felt bad for the mix up and we were so tired from the flight we just wanted to get in a room) The room on the lower floor was like a closet and I would STRONGLY suggest the tower view rooms which seem a bit larger and are nicer and are well worth the additional cost. We opted out of the breakfest and found numerous places to eat aroundthe Hotel. La Gourmandaiss which is on Rue de Grenelle seemed friendly to tourists and has great take-out breakest food at a fraction of the cost---plus its on the way to the metro.To our surprise, despite checking in to the smaller room, our eiffel tower room became open and the hotel moved all of our belongs up while we were out to lunch. Which was nice.The hotel also has WI-Fi so if you bring your laptop you should have no problem logging in. They have a computer in the lobby but it is a french keyboard and unless you read and write french will probably bea bit cumbersome for most.It is a few blocks from the Eifel Tower which makes for a romantic evening stroll and is a a short walk from the Metro Stop Ecole Militaire. There is also a Laundry right next to the hotel which is great if you plan on traveling light. All in all would a reccomend this hotel to a friend? Absolutely! but if going back myself I was not impressed enough to say I found the perfect hidden gem and might be inclined to see if there were some other alternatives. At 180 EUR a night you can't go wrong and if you are on a budget you will not have buyers remorse.
