{"text":"Very Nice Business Class Hotel in Honolulu I stayed three nights for business and found the hotel perfect my purposes. The renovated rooms were nice with the flat screen TVs and nice Hilton bed. The room was kind of small, and for a couple or a family it might be tight. The bathroom was a nice size, but no countertop space -- if my wife had been with me, she would not have liked that.The coffee shop in the lobby was fine for a quick breakfast or dinner. It took quite a while to get served or even acknowledged my first morning there. Quite a while . . . . .The exterior renovation was going on at the time so the balcony was closed off. The views on the mountain side were nice. I would be interested in seeing what upgrade I could get now that I am HHonors VIP Diamond (was only Gold at the time). The hallways were unairconditioned, which I found odd -- it was hot since there were only small ventilation slits in the window areas. The pool area was very windy -- not sure if that was just the condition that day or not.All-in-all a very decent business hotel. I think I would look for a different location for a family vacation.I enjoyed walking down to the strip for dinner and to look at the water (I was there for business -- maybe the only one), as a SoCal resident, I found a 24 Hr. Fitness location on the water also.
