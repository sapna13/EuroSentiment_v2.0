{"text":"A wonderful place to stay!! After reading all of the other reviews, I had to write and say that I absolutely love this resort. I visited for the first time in 2001 (as a single traveler) and immediately fell in love with the resort, the people of the DR and the country. I have since been back about 3 additional times. Everyone was so polite. I communicated by either English or (broken) Spanish and seldom had a problem (when in Rome, speak as the Romans do), although I was always able to find someone who worked there who spoke English.I enjoyed this resort because it was so intimate, anywhere else, I would've been lost in the sea of people. I went horseback riding, I took the day trip to Saona Island, I learned to scuba dive, went snorkeling, swam, enjoyed the beach  the associated activities, swam in the Lagoon (Ice Cold), went to the nightly shows and walked and enjoyed the grounds and along the way I met  enjoyed people from everywhere. I have stayed in both the hotel and the beach villas - they were all clean and welcoming!. When I first started going, it was all inclusive, I haven't visited since the resort went a la carte. There was an office there which assisted the guests with excursions and I utilized them each time I visited. I never had a problem with service. I even sprained my ankle there on one visit and the resort  medical staff on site were always helpful and respectful.Although I loved this place when I first visited, I am now even more bias than before, the last evening of my first visit there in 2001, I met the man who eventually became my husband. We returned and had our nuptials there (Oct '03) with 30 family  friends in attendance. They all absolutely loved the resort and the beauty that it offers. I look forward to my next visit.
