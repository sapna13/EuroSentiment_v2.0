{"text":"Fantastic location and room The Maxim is right in the centre of Florence, but once you leave the busy street, it's like an oasis of calm. We requested a room facing the courtyard, and received it. The shutters blocked out all light, and also the bells of the Duomo (funnily enough, we heard them only once in our room when we were awake with the shutters closed - maybe they start only at a certain time of the morning?).Our room was enormous by European standards, with a double and a single bed. The bed and pillows were comfortable. The towels resembled sheet material but performed just as well or better than the type we are used to.The free internet in the lobby was really handy. We had to wait for it a few times, but there were a few couches and lots of books to read to keep us occupied. There was a flight of stairs to reach our room (and a couple more if we couldn't be bothered waiting for the elevator, and we never could) but they keep you fit. The air condiitoning was a godsend!My only advice in Florence is to walk 10 minutes in any direction away from the centre to find a good restaurant. Most central restaurants cater for tourists, so are overpriced with average food. I can't believe how much more we got charged for gelato in the centre, compared to outside it (almost 3 times more).I most definitely would not even consider staying anywhere else on future visits to Florence. Hotel Maxim offered the best value for money I have received on several trips to many towns and cities around the world.
