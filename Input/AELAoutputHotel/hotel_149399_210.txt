{"text":"would go back in a instant!!! this was absolutely the best vacation we ever had. it was a 25th aniversary and 19 of us stayed in the royal service. the food, pool, beach, weather (totally awesome) and atmosphere was great. it was the quiet side of the resort. it has more action on the tropical side. all staff were kind and friendly. we were teaching each other our languages. we never had a problem getting good drinks from our friend ramone , the bartender at the gabi. i loved having the gabi restaurant, there was always great breakfasts, lunches and dinners. we also had the best server in town. bolivar (boli) was fantastic and his boss carlos made our whole group feel very special the whole week. you really didn't have to do the ala cartes. the international was okay, the italian was good , we had our anniversary dinner there. the staff made us feel special by shutting of the lights and bringing our table this beautiful cake and sang to us. the japanese was very good. it wasn't very busy the week of dec 12 -dec 21 so you were sure to get a seat around the pool and down at the beach. we were always near the beach bar and the path to the washrooms.our children did the disco a couple of nights and said it was great. the flinstone land really didn't impress us. we really felt uncomfortable about leaving our grandson with strangers, that really didn't look interested in looking after children and they didn't speak very good english .our kids did a couple of excursions. they are very overpriced.they really did enjoy the party boat though. one down fall is the amount of salepeople on the beach . you are there for relaxation and they do keep bothering you. but if you say no they do get the idea. we did buy a really nice painting at the little marketplace down the beach. the beach is beautiful. . for a nice vacation, this is the resort.
