{"text":"Wonderful, Wonderful....... My husband and I stayed at the Outrigger Luana Waikiki for 1 week mid-October. What a wonderful stay. We had stayed there previously before the Outrigger chain revamped it - and it was nice then too. Great centralized location, you can walk to Ala Moana or to Waikiki beach with ease. Diamond Head is a fair hike from here but still do-able. The hotel itself is very nice. Wonderfully maintained. Beautiful lobby - Hawaiian decor, clean, friendly desk staff, always an elevator waiting for you. The room itself was lovely - just like the pictures. We had a corner studio room c\/w comfy queen bed w\/storage underneath, sofa, table and 2 chairs, tile floor, A\/C, t.v., internet, iron  small ironing board, fridge, large kitchen counter w\/sink, dishes, cutlery, bathroom had a hairblower, small tub. Balcony had 2 wicker chairs and end table. The carved wooden Hawaiian lamps in the room are great - one is a man the other a woman both in hula poses. There was no toaster or microwave though but for $8 we picked a toaster up at WalMart and saved on breakfasts and lunches by having them in our room - not to mention the pounds we avoided gaining by not eating large meals 3 times a day. The pool was crystal clear, cleaned daily, had lots of pool chairs - towels at the front desk. They also have a very nice gym c\/w 2 treadmills, eliptical, 2 exercise bikes, free weights and several weight machines. Overall, only 2 minor complaints. The shower could use a new shower head. A bit of street noise but was eliminated by the A\/C running. Neverthe less, we'll be back! ","annotations":[]}
