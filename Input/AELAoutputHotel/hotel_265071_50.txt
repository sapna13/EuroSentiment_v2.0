{"text":"Fair We stayed at Hotel Delle Nazioni as part of our honeymoon. We left with a sensation that we could have found a better place for a little more money.We arrived via the Eurostar and were able to find the hotel easily as it is just west of the train station. Check-in was fairly straight-forward although you had to carry your own bags up the initial staircase before getting into the small elevators. Getting to our room (#404), we had to navigate thru some very small hallways. The room itself is quite snug but livable. The queen-size bed took up much of the room. The room was a bit dark and aged like the hallways...a contrast from the hotel lobby. The AC Unit was quite powerful and unlike some people's prior experience where the hotel shut it off at night, we did not have that problem. The TV is small but does have CNN in English. No mini-bar is provided. The bathroom was quite out-dated (1960's?) and probably the biggest turn-off for us. It is small, dark, and not air-conditioned. There is no place to really place anything without it falling onto the ground. The shower is a curtained-off corner which barely can fit one person (I'm 5'6, 145#). The floor is guaranteed to be saturated with water after any shower. Worse, there was no place to hang a towel.On a more positive note, the location is prime as it is next to the train station and also within walking distance of most places. The internet cafe has 5 computers although you must get a login and password each time from the front desk to use. Wi-Fi is not advertised as available in the rooms (only in the cafe). The breakfast was above average offering breads\/cereal\/ham and juices.If not for the old cramped humid bathroom, I would probably rate this hotel higher. I have been told that some of the rooms\/bathrooms may have been renovated and I would recommend requesting one of these rooms at the front desk when checking in. ","annotations":[]}
