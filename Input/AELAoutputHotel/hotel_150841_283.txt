{"text":"Great Beach, beautiful grounds, ok food Just got back this week from a 10 day stay at the Iberostar. We are beach people and found that this was one of the better that we've been to. Plenty of room to play and not a problem getting a palapa. The staff was friendly, especially if they found you giving them a little tip. The food was ok at best. We ate at the Japanese and the Steakhouse and found that both were not what we would consider gourmet. We all got a little stomach thing at one time or another during our stay. I suppose it was just that everything was just a bit different. Breakfast was the best meal that we had. It took a couple of days to get the food schedule down. I thought that they might be more accomodating considering that people are coming from alot of different time zones. The entertainment was very cheesy but made us laugh a little. I wouldn't suggest seeing every show. Vey redundent. The rooms were adaquate. We had a family of four with a king bed and 2 couches that doubled as beds for the kids. My 12 year old son got the short bed, similar to a loveseat. Not sure how you justify putting a family of 4 in a room like that but we liked our location, close to the pool so we sucked it up. Iberostar advertises as a 5 star NOT. Took 2 excursions, the Jungle Tour and Marinarium. I would say the Jungle tour was the better of the two. All in all it was a great vacation. Excellent beach, beautiful surroundings well kept, nice staff. A bit of spanish goes a long way!
