{"text":"Like everything else, there's the good and the bad We were here on honeymoon for 2 nights at the end of June. Location wise, this hotel was excellent. Just off the river and a few blocks from the major sites of the Uffizi and Duomo, and tonnes of upscale shopping just outside the door. Of course, Florence isn't too big anyways, but the hotel is central, which is great. To get to the front desk you have to go up stairs just to get to the elevator. This would be a hassle if you had heavy luggage. If you don't want to wait for the elevator, it's a few flights up. Our room was in a corner far away from the common areas, so it was very quiet. The TV remote was not working so the TV couldn't be turned on at all. It took a day to get us a new one that would work. The room and bedroom were large and clean and nice. The bed was comfortable as well. The room was well air conditioned, so it was very cool, which was great considering the temperatures were in the high 30's every day. Breakfast was a good selection of bread, cereal, fruits and juices and coffee. The front desk helped us big time, by finding us an available hotel for an unexpected extra night in Florence. There is a common area with a computer for internet use. You have to buy internet time from the desk. The computer is old and the connection is slow. (There are lots of internet cafe's in the area though with much faster connections) The hassle of giving up your keys to the desk whenever you leave, and getting up and down the stairs might not bother you considering the location, value and room condition are all above average.
