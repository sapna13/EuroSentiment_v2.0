{"text":"New Years In SF My wife and I stayed here over New Year's Eve and we were throughly satisfied. The room, although small when compared to most modern hotels, was very clean and very quaint. We were on the top floor with a nice view of Union Square. Note - If you don't care for traffic noise you may want a room not facing the street. The staff was very friendly and helpful and since it was New Year's Eve they had extra security measures to prevent unwanted guests into the hotel.The location of the hotel is EXCELLENT. If you are into shopping, Union Square is surrounded by big retail stores. Food-wise, we couldn't pass up Sears Fine Food (next door to the hotel) home of the little pancakes. Note - get there early (before 8am), when we left there was a line out the door! We also had dinner across the street at Scala's Bistro. It was very busy so instead of waiting 30-40min we took a seat at the bar and had dinner there. The bartenders were nice and the food was good but nothing to write home (or TripAdvisor) about.The hotel is right on the street car line which is awesome! You can make it to most of the major tourist spots on this system. Also, the hotel is a few blocks away from the Powell street BART station which is great if you are flying in and not planning to rent a car.All-in-all, I would definately recommend this place and I would stay here again.
