{"text":"Needs a little help! We exchanged our 5 star timeshare to stay at the ESJ Towers Jan 10-17, 2007. My husband and I are very accustomed to staying at nice places through our timeshare company and we love Puerto Rico but ESJ really needs a little help! Our unit was a studio facing the beach--the view was great but the room wasn't very clean, the water in the shower was lukewarm-cold most of the time, the clean glassware in the kitchenette had lipstick marks, the mattresses were worn to the point that sheets of wood had been placed between the mattress and the box springs to add support and the pillows were mostly lumps of cotton. ESJ charges for everything--beach chair rentals as well as laundry which we were not accustomed to with timeshare exchange. We did not get maid service during our week and had to take our dirty towels for exchange each day. No VCR or DVD in the room but many cable tv channels were provided. On the plus side, the front desk staff were all very nice as well as the concierge. The man that runs the small store was great and always had a smile. The best part about ESJ Towers is the location--great beach, right in Isla Verde near restaurants and close to Old San Juan. We attended a timeshare presentation and asked if they were planning to update the hotel and the answer was NO! Our owners like the retro feel of the place. The lobby is very nice and has lots of great artwork and is kept very clean. We will go to San Juan again at some point in time but we'll try not to stay at ESJ Towers.
