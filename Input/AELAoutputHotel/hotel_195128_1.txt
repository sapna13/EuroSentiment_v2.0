{"text":"First Class Stay at Silken Ramblas Me and a friend stayed at the Silken Ramblas Hotel for five days during November while sightseeing in Barcelona. It is perfectly located, just off the Ramblas, a short walk down a typical Barcelona street (not seedy and another reviewer stated) with a few nice cafes and restaurants, there is a great chinese restaurant at the end of pintor fortuny st, near the rambals, look for the dragon. We booked our stay through last minute.com and everything whent smoothly with the booking. The hotel was very nice and was well worth the √ä√£¬¢250 (inc flights) for the four nights that we stayed there. The main reception rooms were very smart, clean and modern (beautiful bar area) and the staff all spoke good English and were very helpful and polite. We had a twin bedded room which over looked the main street, which was not noisy. The room was modern, clean and comfortable with comfy beds, LCD T.V, and mini bar (which had plenty of room for our own drinks, instead of paying mini bar prices). The bathroom was a reasonable size, with marble walls and floors and was cleaned every day, as was the main room. While staying in Barcelona the 10am tour of the liceu opera theater was great (you get to see the private members club on this tour) as was walking around the ramblas food market and of course the Casa Battlo, Casa Mila and the Sagraga Familia, You will get Gaudi overload.
