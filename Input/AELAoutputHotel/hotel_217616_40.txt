{"text":"Great hotel, but be warned.... Kimpton hotels are excellent. Stayed in San Fran and now New York and upon picking up the phone, they greet the guest by saying Good Morning, how can we inspire you? The Muse is just off times square and centrally located. Staff are friendly and helpful and the hotel is modern and trendy. However...what the website fails to warm guests is that for the forseeable future, that behind the Muse is a derelict landsite that from early in the morning most days, loud construction is taking place and the guest is greeted by a wake up around 6.30\/7am to loud drilling and construction work. When I asked to move to the front of the hotel, you are warned that since you are off times square, you should be aware of infrequent noises and cab horns during the night. So I chose the back as it was a good sound sleep until early morning. For most business clients, this should not be a problem as most of us are up that time of the morning anyway and for tourists during the weekend - the drilling I believe stops, but the problem exists if you are out late at night as its impossible to sleep in to the loud sounds of scraping and machinery that goes on all day nearby.Saying that , New York is a fun, busy and noisy city and located off times square, you are always subject to noise but for those who want a quieter time, this isn't the hotel for you!
