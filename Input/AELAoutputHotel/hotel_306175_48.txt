{"text":"Great hotel and great location!!!!! It was a bit strange looking for the reception desk at the Hyatt as it is tucked in behind a room but a quick question to the doorman pointed me to right direction. I was quickly checked in despite arriving early again (10 AM) and was in my deluxe king room a few minutes later.The room is a large size with a contemporary decor and furniture. The nicest point of the room is little balcony like room at the corner with chairs and a table. Perfect for having a afternoon tea or watching the busy street below. The bed is very comfortable with plenty of down pillows. The sheets is as white as they can be. Just a great place to jump in and have a nap after a long flight.The walk-in marble bathroom with separate bathtub and shower is the larger than either the Pan Pacific and the Marina Oriental. Amenities are well stocked with quality shampoo, conditioner and lotions.The service is attentive and security seems to be less stringent than the hotels in the Marina locations. The lobby seems to be pretty busy all the time. The breakfast buffet is quite good although they are not a good value as there is a hawker center near by.The location of the Hyatt is great, right in the action of the Orchard road, yet just far enough from the MRT entrances to have some quietness if you need it. A nice hotel in an excellent location.
