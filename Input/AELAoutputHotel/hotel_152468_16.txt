{"text":"Charges for everything! Generally speaking, the Maria Isabel is a perfectly acceptable choice, and manages to maintain a standard which one would expect from a Sheraton property, with one or two exceptions. The location is very handy for those staying in Mexico City on business, or wishing to experience the dlights of Zona Rosa, which is just across the road. It's also a good base for tourists wishing to explore more of the City and surrounding areas.I wasn't lucky enough to get a room\/suite\/mini-city in the 'Towers' of the hotel, so my 'regular' room in the main building overlooked the eternal queues which snake to the visa and consular section of the US embassy next door. The room was a little tired; not exactly in desperate need of renovation, but a bit of a refresh. Standard Sheraton fayre, really! Furnished with two queen beds, had four people occupied the room it would have definitely been a tight squeeze. There was an adequate wardrobe which houses an ironing board and iron plus the safe, which fitted my laptop perfectly. The bathroom was fine, with the toilet tucked away and the bath\/shower partially concealed. Sufficient space for all your toiletries and plenty of towels provided, plus hairdryer.My big bugbear with this place is that they charge for ameneties\/facilities which properties of this standard should not be doing. There is a coffee maker provided close to the minibar\/mini-fridge, but the two coffee bags provided are charged for as part of the minibar list! Not acceptable. I'm not a gym-buny unfortunately, but access to the gym is also chargeable unless you are paying certain rates, (I'd enquire and get something confirmed - in writing - if this is appliccable to you). The rates quoted to colleagues varied a lot, too, so find this a little hard to trust. I also don't think its unreasonable to provide at least one bottle of water free of charge; tap water is apparently drinkable but not recommended. Three bottles are provided, but yep, you guessed it, at a fee.Staff are friendly enough but it all feels a little perfunctory, as if they are just going through the motions.Lower your expectations a little and you won't be disappointed. If you know this kind of place from experience, you'll get exactly what you expect.
