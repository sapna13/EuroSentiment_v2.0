{"text":"Great hotel for business or vacation This is a great hotel for either business or vacation √à√\u2020\u2022?expensive, but nice. I stayed at the Ritz Carlton from Nov 28 - Dec 2. The first 2 days we held a business meeting there and we were all impressed with the hotel rooms, the meeting rooms and the service. The meeting rooms had wireless internet service and the business lunches were very good. The corporate rate was amazing: $165 (it amounted to $200 after taxes and resort fee, which is still a great deal). We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get a room with a balcony, but the rooms still had a combination water view\/pool view. Our prior meeting was held at the Caribe Hilton and this is a much better place to go for a meeting. We had dinner at the Italian restaurant in the hotel (Il Mulino)√à√\u2020\u2022?very good and very expensive. The portions are extremely large, so if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e in a group I suggest sharing entrees or ordering the appetizer sized portions. The last 2 days of my trip my sister joined me for a few days of vacation. I was able to get the corporate rate for the remaining 2 days √à√\u2020\u2022?what a deal! I got a pedicure at the spa √à√\u2020\u2022?even though I e-mailed my request for a spa treatment without the 24-hour notice, they were able to accommodate me at the requested time. The posted rate was $75 but it ended up costing around $95 by the time they added tip and tax. This was the most I have spent on a pedicure √à√\u2020\u2022?I hope it lasts. The spa service was friendly and professional. The fitness center was great and the classes were very good √à√\u2020\u2022?not easy at all. If you take a few classes a day you are bound to return fitter than you arrived. Most of the cardio equipment had their own TVs. All headphones were cleaned after use. Water bottles and fresh towels were placed on all pieces of equipment, and the instructors would hand out cold bottles. The one negative about the fitness center was they only had 2 elliptical machines (which everyone wanted to use), and they were very much in need of service, making loud banging noises if someone used them. I found the noise quite annoying while I was exercising - They should have placed √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥ut of service√à√\u2020\u2022?notices on them. The pool and the beach were nice. There was just one pool and one hot tub, but there always seemed to be available chairs. There were always lots of towel guys hanging around to find you a chair. My only complaint about the pool area was the lack of beverage\/food service. There were only a few people taking food and drink orders √à√\u2020\u2022?not enough to cover everyone. Not one approached us to ask us if we wanted something √à√\u2020\u2022?we had to chase them down or go to the bar and order on our own. I found this surprising because the ratio of hotel service people to guests was extremely high throughout the rest of the hotel √à√\u2020\u2022?twice when I asked how to find something ( a restaurant or meeting room), someone took the time to walk me there. The rooms were nice. The air conditioning was adjustable and there were flat screen TVs and free internet. The one thing we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like about the rooms was the lack of an internal privacy lock and lack of √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëo not disturb√à√\u2020\u2022?signs (called √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºhh√à√\u2020\u2022?signs in the hotel). Our room did not have a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºhh√à√\u2020\u2022?sign, and a member of the housekeeping staff walked in on my sister while she was getting dressed. We then asked for a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºhh√à√\u2020\u2022?sign for the door, which disappeared the next day (perhaps taken by another guest who needed one). I would prefer a privacy lock on the door. I had an evening flight, and the hotel provides √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âhanging rooms√à√\u2020\u2022?rather than let you check out beyond 1:30 PM. Overall, this was a very nice hotel, which is why I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ taking the time to write this, and I would definitely go back. This hotel is highly recommended for business travel and for a business meeting location. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ also a nice place for vacation travelers who aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pinching pennies and are OK with $24 breakfasts and $14 pina coladas.
