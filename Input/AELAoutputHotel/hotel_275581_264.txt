{"text":"Great hotel We stayed at the City Inn for three weeks in 2005 and I have been meaning to write this for some time. It is a really good hotel. London hotels often mean tears before teatime: so many of them are overpriced piles of chintz and pot pourri, run by people who think that a free cup of weak tea in the afternoon makes up for grimy bathrooms and snooty service. The City Inn is not for people who like flowery curtains and tizzy ornaments: it is clean-lined and minimalist. If you like traditional decor you will not like this. But it is functional, efficient, and spotlessly clean. The rooms are not huge but they are not the smallest in the class, either. There is a little sitting area and a CD player, flat screen TV  DVD player, and you can borrow DVDs from the front desk free of charge. Good internet access in the room. Breakfast is a continental buffet (included) Mon - Fri, and there are hot items (eg bacon  scrambled eggs) on weekends. There is also a la carte at extra charge. There is a Pizza Express around the corner and a couple of restaurants near Pimlico tube, but it is not a thriving restaurant area. However, it's a short walk to the tube or up to the busier areas around Trafalgar Square. The Tate is just down the road and the hotel is in a nice residential area. The square in John Islip Street is a pleasant place to sit with your Starbucks and the paper. It is a very safe area, being so close to Parliament and other government buildings.Basically, this is a really good place to stay. For the money, it is excellent value. I have stayed at more expensive places in London, but my next visit will see me back at City Inn. I believe there are City Inns in regional centres as well.
