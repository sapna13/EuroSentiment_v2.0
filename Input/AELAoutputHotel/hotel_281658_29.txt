{"text":"Great Place We were in Seattle for a wedding. In addition to my family of four, my extended family took up at least 6 more rooms. We had a room with two queen beds and there was plenty of space for us and our children (ages 11  3). The room was clean and having a microwave and refrigerator in our room was great for the kids. It was also very easy to get around in the hotel. I didn't have to worry about my 11 year old getting lost trying to run back up to our room to get something. The staff was terrific and friendly. The shuttle service was a great way to get around to the fun places without a car and the shuttle drivers were super friendly (particularly Monica). We were able to get everywhere we had wanted to go using the shuttle. It was also nice to have free internet access down in the lobby.The breakfast was convenient and my kids loved making their own waffles! The food at Cayenne was fine and the people who worked there were really friendly. The only complaint I have for our entire trip was Cayenne's inability to divide checks at least by table (I understand not wanting to manage 20 single person checks). However, making us do the work of working out payment from 20 people was more frustrating to us than it would have been for them to divide the group in to the four tables we took up. This was the only not-customer oriented experience we had on our trip. I would suggest they change that policy and I'm also guessing that their tips would be better broken out in to smaller checks.Other than that, it was our first trip to Seattle and we had a wonderful time. We will definately stay at the Silver Cloud Hotel again. Thanks. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":877,"mention":"waffles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waffle"],"startOffset":870}]}
