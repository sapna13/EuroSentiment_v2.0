{"text":"Tranquil  We stayed in the Bale for the second leg of our 2 week stay in Bali. I had high expectations and I was not disappointed. We were shown around our amazing pavillion (single deluxe) but decided the sun wasn't on garden for long enough so we were moved to a pavillion where the sun was shining on the pool etc until about 4pm (no .36). It is so private, you feel as though it's just you and your partner there! The novelty of stepping into your own pool from the bathroom did not wear off! We were chaffur driven to the beach every morning - when you arrive you receive towels, sun cream, aftersun, body mist and as much water as you wanted. The beach is lovely, alhough the sand is very soft so you tend to sink in it! Cannot complain really but I did prefer the beach in Seminyak. They chaffur you back to your villa when you are ready and we enjoyed the rest of our afternoons in our pool and snoozing on the day bed! Nusa Dua is a lot quiter than Seminyak but we discovered the Bali Collection which has loads of restaurants and shops to keep you amused. Another restaurant you must visit is the Bumbu Bali-authentic Balinesse cuisine. We had breakfast most days served to us in our own garden (fab) at no extra charge. You are allocated a private butler for the duration of our stay but we didn't see him once, we dealt with several members of staff, all of which were lovely and friendly. Their English isn't great but not too much of an issue (only when ordering breakfast over the phone!) All in all a fab time and we were gutted to leave. - miss the complimentary fresh cookies everyday ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1593,"mention":"cookies","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cookie"],"startOffset":1586}]}
