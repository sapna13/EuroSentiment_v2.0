{"text":"Hotel in Transition As a repeat visitor (last year same time 12\/26- 1 \/2)my wife and I were not made aware of the CHANGE in OWNERSHIP of this property taking place during our stay .DECEMBER 31 , 2006 marked , out with SECRETS and in with EXCELLENCE.BUT I WOULD RETURN for sure , let me explain.The tone of the staff for the first 6 days at SECRETS was one of uncertainty and for those of us that have lived and or worked though a takeover in a company , you know what I mean. I certainly empathized with the staff although when you are paying TOP $ and you are on holiday the last thing I need is a disgruntled employee NOT ENGAGED. did I mention the food \/ bad.Imagine if you are bailing and the owner , would you invest in the clients , staff , facialties , customer expierence?But here is the catch and why I would go back .The property is fabulous , the beach although rough (waves) is great, the new owners from SPAIN , swooped at midnight on the 31st and by morning the transition team had converted all seven resturants to new names(signs) , eliminated all branding of SECRETS and changed the LARGE signs on the front of the property by day light .Watching THIS TEAM (appeared like 30 members on the team ) was amazing and they didn't stop in the morning ,in fact the group was excited to get in and start the changeover. Prioritizing the must dos first.Here is what they said!This propert y is spectacular and our immediate goal is to make a difference everyday , in 3 months the hotel will be on its way to becomig a mazzarotti(sp) vs a volkswagon.These guys are serious , have a plan and the resourses to execute.The smiles of the staff re-appeared magically and immediatley life seemed , calming once again.Anyway I wanted to clairify that the quality of this SECRETS vacation was not worth the money we paid this year and only regret we could not enjoy the changes the new owners are planning .If the first day as an example , they not only changing the names of resturants but also the menus. The first meal severd in the BARCELONA was 9\/10.We have friends that want to expierece this place and they are going FEB , 2007 and I await their comments . I think I know the answer.The Excellance Club was worth the extra $ , internet \/ room service\/ I believe the rooms through out the hotel are all very similar except for the views. beach vs quiet pool .The new mini bar ; is not mini! Johnny Walker black , Grey GOOSE ,(full boottles ) Red Bull , various beers , snacks , very impressive . Go crazy!Entertainment , we loved it! Jazz , Live Shows, Disco, non stop evening fun till 2\/3 am .Settle back upon arrival one hour 15 minutes drive from the airport, The arranged mini bus was fine and had great AC.Summary : Great secluded property , 7 a la carte dining expierences , no kids. Great beach. Only wish the change over was , not a SECRET!JCTORONTO , CANADA ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2208,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2204},{"endOffset":2208,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":2204},{"endOffset":2455,"mention":"Red Bull","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Red_Bull"],"startOffset":2447}]}
