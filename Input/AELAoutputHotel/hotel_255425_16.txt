{"text":"Great room, lousy amendities and terrible customer service The room is great and the rate is not good as well. But that is all I can say about positive aspects of the hotel. The 'classy' rooftop swimming pool is more like a giant bath tub, and when I was there, there was only one man sun tanning. Not surprisingly, as the water in the pool did not look well-maintained. Vibe hotel is a business hotel for business people, but that was definitely not the impression I got. First of all, the internet was not working, and it takes on average 3 phone calls and 30 min before getting any of your requests attended to. The person who helped us with the internet has no basic knowledge about the internet... When we checked out, we were billed A$40 for internet charges (we only used internet to syn up our email..). We thought that the wireless internet at the lounge was complimentary since the internet in our room was down, but we were told that that was impossible and were treated as freeloathers. When I requested to look at the internet log files (I am still holding onto the log file), I saw that we were charged A$20 for 8min of internet usage!! The manager on duty, Mr. Godwin Oparah, was not only unhelpful, but was very rude to us. He accused us of lying and argued with us for more than 10 min. We were catching our flight, so this last episode totally ruined whatever good impression we had of the hotel. To rate him and his staff's service and attitude, on a scale of 0 to 10, I would give them a low 1.5. Out of the 5 counter staff I spoke to, only one of them was polite and professional.Would only recommend this hotel if you don't mind bad experience for the price and location. ","annotations":[]}
