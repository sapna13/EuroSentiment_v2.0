{"text":"So happy we had our wedding here! My husband and I had our wedding reception at the Doubletree in August 2007. We lived in the area for years, but had never considered having our reception there despite its proximity to our ceremony location. But then my husband was doing some searching online and found the website. We visited once and booked it right away!Kimberly Findley was our wedding coordinator for a large part of the planning process. The previous wedding coordinator, whom we loved, left about 5 months before our wedding. We were TERRIFIED that everything we had worked out would be lost when someone new came. The catering manager met with us privately to ensure that that would not happen. And he was right! Kimberly was fantastic to work with, honoring every single detail that we had previously established.The hotel was wonderful to work with when planning our room block. When more guests decided to book there than we had initially expected, they contacted US to ask if we would like more rooms blocked for our wedding guests. That initiative was greatly appreciated! Our family absolutely LOVED staying there. They talk frequently about going back for our 5 year anniversary to have a reunion. Everyone's rooms were ready when they arrived. My 2 floor suite was AMAZING! Such a wonderful place to get ready for a wedding.The day of the wedding, the staff at the hotel could not have been more helpful. Even the front desk staff knew about our wedding, addressing us by name whenever saw us! They literally took care of everything! I can't say it any better than that. Our reception was WONDERFUL! Great food, served hot, great bar and wait staff!I cannot imagine having celebrated our wedding reception anywhere else! ","annotations":[]}
