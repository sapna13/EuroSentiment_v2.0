{"text":"Excellence x 5 - Well this was our fifth trip to Excellance in the past few years. Byfar it was also one of the best. We have traveled to several other couples resorts-Jamaica, Mexico, Puerto RIco and still have a need to come back here without disappointment. Here it's truly about having fun and pure relaxation.Excellance is not about taking tours all day as it is one of the most remote resorts in Punta Cana. However, there is always somethingto do from sun-up to almost sunrise. The layout of the resort is comfortable for walking daily, with beautiful gardens, animals (chickens, peacocks, ducks) strolling through adding to its natural beauty. While we were there some couples asked if this is a slow time as it seemed not quite full; however to thier suprise they were very full. You never feel as though you were on top of one another. THe food is plentiful, and with enough choice. I did find the breakfast a bit monotnous this trip. Notably, there was great improvement in the baked goods and desserts. The food does tend to be salty; however when I asked, they were more than willing to prepare my dinner selctions without. I did miss the snack bar at the pool bar at the far end of the complex in the afternoon, allthough you could get a pre-made hamburger there. The afternoon cooking on the beach is tons of fun as are the evening beach parties. We were there this year over 4th of July with a wonderful show and fireworks display. Great Job by the resort. The best kept secret was the Sax and piano on the beach at night-- I didn't want that night to end. The disco is always a must to end a wonderful day. The entertainment staff are by far the best and most comitted indivuals I've encountered at a resort. Julio A., Luciano, Isabele and other will keep you laughing and having just a great time. Beware of the bike tour - this is not a pansy trip. Ask where they are taking you-- as one of the rides will take you into the mountainswhich is quite beautiful, its also a no pain...no gain kind of ride. The ATV ride group at the end of the beach as well, is well worth the effort. It's not quite as long as the ones offered by the tour groups which is fine. You still go up into the mountains, towns and visit an Indian Cave. The Martini bar is a nice added addition. But, there is none better than Jose, Benjamen and Kenny at the Beach Bar. The drinks are well made-- if you want more - no problem. I did miss the vendors that would come at night on to the resort. I found the displays at the huts a bit boring as it has not changed in 4 years-- meaning same old (cheap) stuff! If you walk toward the right of the beach there is another area that had a few new things. I did notice the gift shop expanded thier selction which was a nice addition. The Spa services are nice as far a s massages, facials etc. Word of the wise, stay away from the waxing. Not a great service or techinique. Over the years we've made many friends here at Excellance- it's romantic, relaxing and well worth the trip--- even for the fifth time. But please don't ruin it for others seeking to escape-- leave your cell phones in your room, don't sit yacking everywhere and especially your laptops. If you need to stay that attached-- stay home.
