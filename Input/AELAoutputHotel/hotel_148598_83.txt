{"text":"Bad for families If you have already booked your stay, be sure you read this below.We took our 3 kids to this hotel on a family get away. Here are some things you won't be told or know till you get to the property:1. The shuttle service costs $60 per person round trip regardless of where you go (ie, to  from the airport, 10 minutes to the grocery store, etc). If you choose to rent a car be very careful as the locals do not use signals and make turns across lanes in front of other drivers3. The restaurant prices are off the charts. Don't go by the menus on the web site, they are old and out of date. Expect to pay $100+ per meal and that's sharing dishes. All cocktails by the pool are $9, beer is $4, personal pizza is $20, etc.4. The free breakfast included in the Escape Package doesn't include gratuity. You will get be charged unless you go down to the front desk and point it out. Also children do not eat free, that is a very broad statement on their website. Only kids age 4 and under are allowed to eat free. They say under the age of 5 and in Puerto Rico that means, 5 doesn't count.5. The beach surf is dangerous and deadly. It was either yellow or red flag the entire time (6 days). The rip tide in the area is bad and they even have signs posted on how to swim out of rip tides. There are no life guards on duty and it is swim at your own risk. We witnessed a man save a woman and her son in a rip tide while hotel personnel watched!! I was incredulous that they didn't help. Their excuse was simply we aren't supposed to.5. The pool area is not family friendly. The adults do not choose to stay in the adult pool and will play in the area that is supposed to be designated for kids. If you worry about scantily clad individuals or PDA, beware.6. You cannot bring food from your room to the pool area. So those PBJ sandwiches by the pool are a big no-no. We were dressed down by a worker (the Spanish lesson teacher) in front of our children for eating by the towel shack, she said if a manager saw you, you guys would be in big trouble, you can only eat food you've purchased from our restaurants.7. Their accounting system has difficulty identifying different forms of payment. ie., if you use a company credit card to reserve the hotel but another for incidental charges, you'll probably see the charges show up on the wrong card.8. The hotel doesn't designate non-smoking in the hallways, so no matter where you go, the hotel hallways have a bad odor.9. The staff in the hotel are hit and miss - one minute you are talking with Andra, who by the way is awesome, and the next you are dealing with a rude operator on the phone who doesn't speak English. Over all the hotel staff are lazy and are not willing to go above and beyond for their guests.
