{"text":"Okay, but does not live up to the hype The location - absolutely excellent. You couldn't wish for better. Easy walking distance to La Rambla and the underground.The rest was, well, average. We arrived on Friday 29\/09 at 7.30pm and were greeted by a full compliment of departing guests hogging reception... waiting for their taxi to the airport. The reception is very small. Eventually the receptionist turned up and copied our passports before advising us we would be staying in room 107. No cava offered...Overlooking a narrow, deserted side-street the room was quite small but very crisp and clean. The bathroom was also small and neat and exhibited the fresh flower and wide range of toiletries as descirbed in previous guest reports. We were lucky enough to have a full height 'patio'-style door that opened onto a very small balcony. The air conditioning worked perfectly despite the daytime temperature averaging 28 degrees, for early October...The breakfast was superb, with every conceivable taste catered for. Although it was charged at √à√\u2020√ü?4 (per person) for the first 2 mornings it was only √à√\u2020√ü? for the 3rd morning, this averages at √ä√£¬¢7.50 (√à√\u2020√ü?1.50\/$13.50) per day for as much as you can possibly eat and drink, excellent value.The free internet was present but nearly always fully occupied from early in the morning 'til late at night. The free coffee, water and pastries were very pleasant after a long days' trekking but only made up for the lack of such facilities in the guest rooms.Overall a very pleasant stay. For the location and facilities in the great city of Barcelona the H10 Raco del Pi offers a discrete but average experience. Just don't expect 4-star quality for a 3-star price.
