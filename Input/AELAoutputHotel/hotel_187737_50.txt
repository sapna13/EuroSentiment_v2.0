{"text":"Quiet  We recently stayed at this quiet hotel. We had a suite which consisted of an entryway, sitting room, and bedroom, plus a large private bath. Pros: Everything was comfortable and quiet. The hotel was very clean and our room was large enough for a rollaway in the sitting room. The bathroom was quite luxurious and had all the amenities that one would expect at a good hotel. Everyone was friendly. They have 2 other public sitting areas: a smoking room and a non-smoking room. The non-smoking room is where you can get tea and biscuits (cookies) in the afternoon and hot chocolate at night. They had a wonderful collection of magazines in the sitting room and lots of free publications (including TimeOut London) in the entrance to the hotel. There was another eating area but we never took meals at the hotel. Cons: The cooling and heating was controlled by the main office. So, whenever you wanted a change, you'd have to call down. The people who worked in the main office were uneven - some were absolutely fantastic and knowledgeable but others seemed a little clueless. (Note that everyone was friendly and tried hard and so this might be ok.) Little tiny things did not work in the room. When the internet went down on one of the days, the front desk had a hard time knowing what to do about it. Could be a Pro\/Could be a Con: The hotel is in the middle of what seems to be a street maze. All the buildings look very similar and the street signs are not very good. Our taxi driver had a hard time finding it. After a week, we had figured out fast ways to get in and out though. Because it is so hidden, though, it's also very quiet. Note that although the doorman told us that we could use the smoke room, it was so smokey that I couldn't even really stay in the room enough to see what was in it.Expense: Note that breakfast does not come with the room. The hotel is very close to some inexpensive places to eat, though. There's an honor bar in the room and an honor bar in the smoke-free room. The hotel is a bit far from things but is very close to the tube (for inexpensive transportation). Internet was free but you have to ask for a code.
