{"text":"Overall a great place and great value We agree with everything that the reviewer from May 10th wrote about the hotel. Staff was very accomodating, breakfast was a plus, workout room was plenty for what I needed and the location was wonderful. We loved being 2 blocks from the french quarter so that we weren't too in the action and we were closer to the convention center (the reason for the trip). The room we stayed in was on the back side of the building and had a nice little sitting area where I would read. The down side was that our room had a door right beside us and it seemed like the walls were paper thin. Every time the next door neighbor would go in and out it sounded like they were coming in and out of our door and we could hear their conversations. Also, there is an alley on the back side of the building and every morning around 4am a dump truck of some sort would empty trash for about 15 min. That was annoying but we didn't know if you could really escape that unless you were on another side of the building and we didn't feel like gathering our stuff and moving to another room.Overall, the place was great with the front desk even calling a cafe for us to see if they accepted credit cards. Another great perk is the computer in the front lobby with a printer. We were able to check in to our return flight and print our boarding passes!
