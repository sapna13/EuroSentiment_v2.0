{"text":"One of the best in Florence Just got back from a five day stay at the Plaza Hotel Lucchesi.PlusesLocation. The hotel is right along the Arno river with a great view. Do not ever trust an Italian when they tell you how far something is. To them, everything is just a 5-10 minute walk. Rome, Los Angeles, all five minutes away. Below are the accurate walking times I recorded to all the hot spots from the Plaza Hotel Lucchesi.Ponte Vecchio- 12 minutesAccademia- 20 minutesUffizi 8 minutesDuomo- 20 minutesSanta Maria Novella- 35 minutes (take a cab)Santa Croce 7 minutesThe hotel is on a street that is relatively quiet so u get a good night sleep.The Staff The concierge and front desk all speak very good english. They got us tickets to the Uffizi and set up our taxis and shuttles with no problem. They were also polite and helpful with directions.The Breakfast Fabulous by European standards. Eggs, bacon, sausage, fresh fruit, pastries, coffee, tea and cereals.The Air Conditioning trust me, this is huge. In Europe during the summer, the heat is unbearable...you need ac.The negatives: Room size The room was tiny, even by European standards. So was the elevator. But if you go to Florence and spend a lot of time in your hotel...you're a fool.Restaurant staff Some of the restaurant staff was very rude. They kicked us out of the breakfast room, even though it was open for another 5 minutes. All in all, I would definitely recommend this hotel and I would stay there again. I also recommend making your reservations thru the hotel website, I found them to have better rates than any of the travel sites online.Below are my other suggestions if you are going to Italy:-get Euros thru the ATM only. Ordering euros through your bank or buying them thru an exchanger will cost you an additionial 30-40 bucks every time you do it.-bring sunscreen and bug repellant-try this great restaurant at the edge of the Ponte Vecchio called Golden View- be wary of pickpockets entering and exiting buses and at the train station.-if possible, get a tour guide for the Uffizi, there is so much art it gets overwhelming.-buy tickets in advance for the Uffizi and Accademia to avoid hour long lines.-drink lots of limoncello.
