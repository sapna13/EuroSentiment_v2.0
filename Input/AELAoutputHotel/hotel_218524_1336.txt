{"text":"Beautiful Grounds and Pool, the rest not the best We travel at least 2 times per year and this was our second all inclusive trip. My Husband and I went to Secrets Nov. 19th-25th, we chose this resort because in March of 06 we were married at the Secrets in Riviera Maya Mexico and loved it. I can say that Secrets Punta Cana by far had the most beautiful grounds, our room was 10004 with a walkout and to the left you could see the Ocean and hear it all day long, it was amazing. The pool was great, there was always rafts around and no real issue with getting a chair anywhere around the resort. The nature scene at the entrance of the resort had flamingos, ducks, parrots, peacocks and much more, it was beautiful.The room was pretty comprable to Mexico however believe it or not the smell was better than in Mexico, we carried the smell around back home for ever, but not from Punta cana. You have to realize that you are in a thrid world country right on the ocean and that you should expect some sent. We had no bug issues other than some tiny ants in our bathroom sink, but I brought off and sprayed one morning and never saw them again. The food, well that is a totally different story. The food was not good, it was bland at best and the menu's at the resturaunts are just not like back home. We lived on Pizza and noodles in butter sauce, these were the few things we knew we could eat without getting sick. My husband and I were sick a day each but we were fine the rest of the time.The alcohol was minimal at best, they did not carry the brand I like and I tried other things but it just never really tasted the same, sometimes we thought they were just filling your drink with whatever they felt like at the time and there was NO DIET PEPSI which for me was a real bummer. Overall the grounds and the view made the trip, but for the price I would say you could find other locations that would be much more worth your dollar.Much needed Rest!
