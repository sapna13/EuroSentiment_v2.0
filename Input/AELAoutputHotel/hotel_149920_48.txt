{"text":"Heaven on Earth I must say that I this was an absolute breath of fresh air! It pains me to even tell you why I'm writing a review because I don't want this one thing to deter you from staying and I should not. We checked in at about 3pm on August 15 after traveling from New York since 4:30AM. We were hungry and wanted to enjoy a nice Caribbean lunch in the hotel restaurant LA VISTA. We were seated outside on the terrace as requested and ordered two delicious mojitos right away. Followed by this we got Ceviche as an appetizer and proceeded to order our main courses from a slim menu. I got the Cuban sandwich and my fianc√ã√\u2022√ñe ordered a grilled Caribbean mango chicken sandwich. $70 later plus tip, I have to tell you how disappointing this food was. I really had higher expectations of a Marriott resort restaurant. The bread was not fresh and the sandwiches looked and tasted like they came out of a school cafeteria! We got engaged on the Beach outside the hotel the next day and went to dinner down the street at an Argentinean restaurant. I'm sure we would have, as we planned, eaten in the Marriott Tuscany restaurant for dinner that night. But we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. Nor did we order breakfast to the room the next morning to eat on the balcony while watching waves crash as we planned due to our lunch experience on day one. The hotel, staff, casino, bar, club scene, pools, and especially the beaches were all stellar! We loved this hotel! It was a fairy tale engagement vacation and I would highly recommend going there. The staff was always smiling, always attentive, and so very helpful. The food was well below the bar that I would expect of a Marriott Hotel \/ Resort. We would have probably eaten at the hotel several more times, but lucky for us, the street just outside the hotel is packed full of great restaurants!
