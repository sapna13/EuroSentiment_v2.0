{"text":"Pretty beach, great service, poor to okay food We stayed in the Royal Junior suites section of the resort. The rooms were nice and roomy, however, not as pretty as the pictures. For example, there were thin cracks in the wall in the bathroom and the room overall was basically average. The good news is that the service was excellent. All employees were friendly and the reception staff was very helpful. We also really enjoyed the private beach area of the resort. It was very nice and we especially enjoyed the variety of chairs, the beach beds, and the views of the ocean. Overall, the grounds of the resort were very nice.The downside of the trip for us was the food. We are foodies and I would say are picky eaters. We favor a vegetarian and low fat diet, and finding food that we liked was sparse. Starting with the breakfast, the milk was whole fat and warm. The cereal was tasteless and mushy. Therefore, we basically ate eggs, pancakes, waffles and yogurt every day. Since we normally have a light breakfast consisting of low fat cereal, this type of food was too heavy. The only fruit we enjoyed was the pineapple. We did not like the cantelope and the watermelon was tasteless. Also, the juices mostly tasted like sugar water. The upside of the breakfast was the coffee, however, do not look for skim milk. Moving on to lunch. The variety was plentifull, however, in preferring a vegetarian diet, the only food we ate was salad (iceberg lettuce, cucumbers and black\/green olives), cheese pizza which was very good, pasta, french fries, and chips and cheese, The highlight of the food was the desserts, they were very good. However, we typically eat a low fat diet, so as you can see, there was very little low fat eating on this trip. In regards to dinner, we went to 2 ala carte restaurants. The first nite we went to the seafood restaurant, and everything was very salty and was average. We also went to the Spanish restaurant, and it was again barely average. In general the seafood at the restaurants was not good. I expected more. The other nites we dined at the buffet, and more of the same food we had at lunch. For us, food was a necessity and we filled our stomach's, however, it was not enjoyable. I wish I could be more optimistic, but for us, we will not stay at this resort again due to the food. I will say that a few of the guests we spoke to said they liked it, however, they are meat eaters and may not be as picky. In closing, we found the Dominican Republic beaches beautiful, the service very good, however, the food was too big of an issue for us, therefore, we are going to stick to vacationing at the Bahama's or Mexico where the food is of higher quality. Good luck!
