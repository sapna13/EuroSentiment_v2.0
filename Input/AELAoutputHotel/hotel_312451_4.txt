{"text":"lovely rooms Bali tropic is located on a lovely beach, but still not soft and white sand as I expected.The pool was nice but a little bit datet.They had a sunken poolbar who wasn't open for very long. And the biggest dissapointment was that they could not make any good alcoholic drink that was good.The rooms very lovely with ensuite bathrooms and very clean.A wonderful beautiful lobby and the personal was friendly but their english was pretty poor. But that was not a problem.The spa was very nice but very expensive but I tried it out anyway. It's more the feeling than what good it does for your body, the footbath meant a scrubbing for 1 minute a foot. The hotel was not full and I only saw about 3 children during my whole stay wich was lovely. No I love children but don't want that nocie around me when I am on a luxurus relaxing holiday.The biggest dissapointment and the only dissapointment for this hotel is their drinks and food. The breakfast was lovely and thank god we didn't take their all inclusive and have to eat their lunch and dinner every day for 13 day. If you eat there occasionally it's okay but the food is the same every day and the drinks we had at another restaurant near by since they were disqusting.But I will return since it was nice and clean. But because of the food and drinks we will not take the all inclusive this time either.There is shops close by the hotel and you can walk up to tanjung benoa to find markets and small shops all the way. There prices are a little bit higher than in kuta, semiyak etc. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":83,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":78}]}
