{"text":"Great hotel, staff  We found the hotel newly remodeled, very contemporary in design, the beds comfortable, the A\/C excellent and the entire property exceptionally clean. The room was a bit small, even when compared to European hotels; however the bathroom was great. The hotel staff is exceptional, eager to help and fluent in English. The staff even helped translate TGV tickets I purchased todetemrine if I could change these. Staff pleasantly handled our last minute request to extend our stay (when they were completely booked) even though it required the juggling of reservations two days in a row and constant checking for cancellations. Finally, when bookings made it impossible to stay longer, the hotel staff located another nice hotel within walking distance, reserved the room and prearranged check in so we did not need to complete a registration form at the second hotel (Hotel Londres Tour Eiffel- also an excellent hotel with charming rooms and an exceptional staff.) I must mention that staff did all the above without any additional inquiry or prompting and kept me regulaly informed. Other requests for directions, taxis and information were handled pleasantly and professionally.The hotel has is excpetionally well located one half block from Rue Cler. Rue Cler is hard to beat. Restaurants (cafes, brasseries, Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, crepes and take away) shops (cheese, produce, meat, fish, wine), landromats, a post office and a super marche are all within an easy 5-10 minute walk, mostly on a street with no traffic. The Eiffel Tower is close by (15-20 minutes) as is the MetroI travel more than 200 nights per year on business and have experienced the exceptional and the absolutely awful. I highly recommend this hotel although the rooms are small.
