{"text":"Russell will Rock your Socks! What a great hotel! Charming and historic, a hotel with alot of character and warmth! The location cannot be beat. You're a two minute walk from the the harbor, the Circular Quay and a breathtaking view of the Harbor Bridge AND the Opera House. The best part about staying at this hotel was the neighborhood, a maze of cobblestone streets and charming restaurants and shops. That being said, it is located on George St. which is lined with a few pubs, restaurants and shops. During our stay on a Monday and Tuesday night we noticed more of a afterwork crowd, not a drunk people spilling onto the streets scene. Our room was not on the street but on a side street and only one night we heard some pub crawlers boisterously making their way back home at 2 am but it was brief and we chuckled thinking how our pub crawl lasted only two pubs and we were in bed by ten!Other reviewers have greatly over exxagerated all those stairs it's one stairway up and they will help you with your bags(we travel light but we saw the staff helping other people up with thier overstuffed suitcases). Advice to travelers in general is DON'T PACK SO MUCH!Speaking of the staff, they were awesome! Our flight arrived early in the morning. We got to the hotel at 9am and our room was ready to go even though check in is not until 3pm. We were so grateful to come to our cozy room and catch some zzz's after our long flight from California. Our room, though small, had everything you would need: Bathrobes, a coffee press, iron and ironing board, hairdryer, etc. The decor was lovely, the armoir beautiful and all the drawers in the dresser worked(functional and appealing).There were two bathrooms down the hall. One was spacious and pristine with lotion, and shampoo, and body wash. The other was very small; a wash closet on one side to shower and across from it was the toilet seperate but I never had to use this one. The spacious and spotless bathroom down the hall was always available.In the lobby there's a computer available to go on online and the staff was always helpful pointing us in the right direction of a caesar salad that I was craving. However, there's SO many eating options you can't go wrong. The breakfast downstairs was wonderful! You could get a full hot breakfeast with eggs, bacon and toast in addition to cereal, fruit, pastries, juices, coffee, tea... the works! We would fill up on breaky in the beautiful restaurant\/breakfast room downstairs and be fueled up for a day of sight seeing. We had such great experience! We would not hesitate to return. We paid $110 a night for a double room. I believe we stayed in the cheapest and smallest room available AND I think we may have paid considerably less considering we got the rooom through a hotel broker at NeedItNow(the australian equivalent of orbitz). However, barring a budget I would come back here in a heartbeat. Enjoy!
