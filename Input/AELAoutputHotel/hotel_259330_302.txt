{"text":"Beautiful!!! Horrible reviews scared us but we were pleased upon arrival.Check in: ask for a remote for your tv. Ask for a safe: it's $20 US per week.Rooms:We wanted to be close to the beach and pool so prior to arriving I e-mailed the hotel asking for a beach or pool view. They said they would do what they could and we ended up getting an awesome room (6132). They aren't fabulous rooms but ours was clean and we had no complaints. Think about the Country you are in and pay attention during the drive to the hotel to get a better perspective and understanding of the rooms.The beach: BEAUTIFUL ; if white sand and gorgeous, clear blue\/green water is what you're looking for!! You can walk for miles on the beach each day. The food: We loved the buffet. There was some of the same foods everyday but there was enough variety we never got bored. Snack bar wasn't fabulous.When you arrive you are given slips of paper which enable you to make 3 separate reservations for A La Carte restaurants during your stay. We only tried the seafood and were'nt impressed.Staff: Well, they're either happy or they're not. Definately not the friendliest bunch regardless of tips. I thought if we were nice they would be too but that didn't seem to matter. Put it in perspective though; they work their butts off and don't seem to get a whole lot in return.What to bring from home: a cup for each person who wants a drink. Tim Horton's mugs worked for us, bring extra batteries for your camera (upsetting if you don't), bring a clock or watch there's none in the rooms....I know, you're on holiday but if you plan to go on any tours you need to get up, bring at least 2-3 bottles of sunscreen (15 won't cut it...45 maybe), if you run out there it's almost $20 US for a small bottle, snorkle set if you have one.Tours: we went on the marinarium tour, the catarmarand (sp?)and the Outback Safari. Each cost around $90-$100 per person (canadian) and were worth every penny. Next time I would try the dolphin swim and the sunset tour. You find out about these from your travel advisor from your travel agency.Tips for you: Read the paper they give you when you check in regarding the hotel. In there you will find out there is a swim up bar!!! We found the swim up bar on the last day it is located in the other section of the hotel closest to the front gates. Also, if you like to snorkle there's a reef close to the swimming area where we found all kinds of colorful fish waiting for visitors.We ran into 6 people who were'nt impressed with the hotel but the only thing that would have made it better for us was knowing more about what the hotel offered before the last day. Friendlier staff would have been great! The store staff are horrificly (if that's a word) unpleasant. We had a great time here at the Grand paradise but would stay at a different hotel next time to keep it new and exciting.
