{"text":"Great Location, Great Hotel The York is a remarkably good property - provided you can book into the higher floors (eg. 16 +). The staff are courteous and helpful. Check in\/out is fast and hassle free. My room was very clean, light and bright, recently refurbished in mod colours and serviced daily. The 2 bedroom deluxe has an enormous living area and main bedroom, plus every kitchen appliance (huge 'fridge), washing machine  dryer. You really do have everything included in these rooms.Sliding doors enable access to balconies for fresh air and al-fresco dining. Great to sit there watching the north Sydney skyline at night. The location is close to everything - Wynyard station, Circular Quay, the Bridge, Coles Express, etc. If you don't feel like cooking walk around the corner to the Travelodge for good simple meals at very reasonable prices. The northern city location is away from the traffic  hoons of the central\/southern city areas. Having a free car park in the same building is amazing value - just take the lift down to the parking areas on the lower floors. The only potential problem would be the traffic noise coming off the 10 lane approach road to the Harbour Bridge. I noticed it some nights on the 18th floor - but my travel partner said it was very quiet. The lower rooms could be very noisy for some - upper rooms are perfect. Double glazing would be a good idea.For me the York was all good, no complaints at all and excellent value at $290 per night . Just make sure you get the higher rooms.
