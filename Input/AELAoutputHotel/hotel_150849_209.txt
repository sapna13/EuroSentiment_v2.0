{"text":"Don't Believe the Negativity OK, so I was planning a five-year anniversary excursion with my wife and found trip advisor to be helpful. Every place I found had some negative reviews, so I used my gut and went with the Riu Bambu. My wife and I just returned and while we did have very few complaints, the overall experience was fantastic.For anyone saying they had a bad experience I would like to meet them. Either they are use to Paris Hilton type treatment or they simply don't know how to have fun. When we checked in, we were greeted immediately by a young lady serving refreshments. The staff checked us in and took our bags to our room with no problem. I only speak English and had no trouble. You don't evenn have to convert your USD to Dominican Pesos as everything like cab rides from airport accept USD for cash.The rooms were a little small and did have typical Caribbean smell, but nothing like some of the reviews I read. The mini bar was stocked with local liqours, but who cares? The full service bars with much better atmospheres were only 100 yards away! The lobby, main resturant, bar area, entertainment stage and pool are all IMMACULATE. Simply gorgeous and well kept. You will not have ANY trouble finding picturesque photo opportunities as the whole resort is magnificent.We were told by our cab driver that $10 US will feed his family for an entire week. I say this because even if you tip a couple of dollars, the Dominican staff will not forget your kind action and will do anything to please you. They don't hound you at all for any money whatsover, but when you do tip them they will thank you heartily. So we tipped the room attendants, the bar staff and our waiters and had no complaints about the service. The bartenders were so, so friendly and the island cocktails (Dr. Funks are a must!) are super tasty and perfect for 90 degree heat. Never watered down, but again we tipped!The beaches are breathtaking. We had no problems finding chairs at 11AM as some people have suggested. If you bring your own containers as we did, the bar staff will be happy to fill them for you. As for activities, there are two other resorts in the Riu Complex that you can also visit. We found the Bambu the best of the three, it was the best looking and seemed to be the most fun. You can go windsurfing, sailing, snorkeling, play volleyball and soccer on the beach, sea kayaking, paddleboating all for no extra charge. Anything like parasailing, scuba diving, etc. will cost extra. The free scuba in the pool is really just a sales pitch for the scuba excursions which cost money. Definitely get one of the boats and go out to the shipwreck which is very visible from the shore. Good stuff.Only complaints were the smell in the Mama Juana (the lunch\/afternoon snack hut), which is also the Steak House at night. It had no walls, thus no AC and so we opted for the main Colonial restaurant for lunch and dinner. Food was great, we ate like Kings. Wine is so so. Nightly entertainment is in all Spanish. A lot of it is music so you can enjoy it anyway, but we expected to be in the minority since we were in a Spanish speaking country! So not really a complaint. Finally, night life. The Discoteque club is actually pretty nice. It's mainly young people looking to hook up, but the music\/lights\/dance floor are pretty nice. We were never approached by drug dealers or prostitutes as I read in one review. The casino is nothing spectacular but sufficient for any of you who like to gamble. We met a couple from Buffalo who told us they had stayed at a Sandals a year earlier which they said was better than the Bambu. But they also admitted that the price difference does make the Bambu the much more attractive trip! They didn't think the Sandals was that much better if you understand. You get one fantastic deal at this resort, I would definitely recommend it to others and go back someday!
