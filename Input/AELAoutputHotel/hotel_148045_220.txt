{"text":"Beautiful views, huge property, but not 5 star We had a great deal staying there for 3 days and 2 nights $379\/person including plane ticket and car rental at the airport. This was our second time there and we were better prepared this time. Some tips:1) Reserve a car at the airport. Confirm car at the airport before getting on the shuttle to pick up the car (cause you have to deal with lines there.)2) Before getting to Conquistador there is a Walmart, Walgreens, supermarkets, etc. If you're frugal like me and don't want to pay an arm and a leg for beer, chips, soda, and water, buy all your groceries and bring them in. Make sure your room has a refrigerator as well as one for the snack bar (2 fridges) though they both weren't very cold.3) If not peak season, try to get a room closer to the funnicular (the elevator-like tram that takes you to the ferry. We had to trek for 7 minutes from one end to the other end. Ferry runs everyday beginning at 9:30am every half hour and takes only about 7 minutes.4) I snuck water and snacks over to the island cause I'm too cheap to pay their prices although my husband says they deserve the money since they spent a lot of capital on that manmade island.5) While driving on the highway, Rte 3?? I think it was, there are lots of stands along the highway. Try them. Mofongos which are crushed up plantains with seafood are not bad. There's a restaurant called La Casita Blanca that's near the airport which serves local Puerto Rican food. Google it.6) Plan the trips to Culebra and Vieques carefully. We didn't have time to do either cause we didn't look at the schedule until we got there and it was too late to go and come back. If you want to check out the bioluminescent bay in Vieques you have to stay overnight though I hear that's the prettier one than in the main island itself.As for the room and its properties, it wasn't dirty (like insects everywhere and stains all over) but it wasn't spotless either. I stepped on old cigarette butts in the balcony when I got close to the edge to take a picture of the water (which was very pretty by the way)... If you're not a picky person, the rooms won't bother you really. For the price we paid and the amount of money we didn't spend at the hotel, it was well worth it.
