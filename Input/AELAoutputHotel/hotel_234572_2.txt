{"text":"highly recommended My husband and I stayed here for our wedding anniversary wkend. We were upgraded to a massive queen size bed, our room had a balcony looking out into a courtyard, and huge french doors. The window through to the bathroom that so many people have mentioned was quite unique!! we decided it was like a one way mirror you see in cop shows in an interrogation room. There is a venetian blind on it so it can be closed completely for privacy, or opened for questioning!!! The hotel is very comfortable, with lovely seating areas. The staff are superb, loads better than the staff all around the city, who we found a bit reluctant and surly. The hotel staff couldn't do enough for us. Breakfast, at 13 euro, is good but pricey. There's a small bakery, Dino Pan, two doors down. You can get gorgeous coffee and croissants there for about 2 euro, or there are other cafes within five mins walk as well. The hotel is in a lovely area, just ten mins walk through the Modernista district (Eixample) with the lovely architecture will take you to some great shopping areas. Or the metro stop Hospital Clinic is two blocks away (incidentally, the only bad food we had all wkend was in a restaurant at this metro stop called TAPASBAR, a glass fronted place - avoid at all costs). This hotel made a great base for our stay. Taxis are cheap, public transport is easy to access, and it's a quiet, relaxing home base. Can't recommend it enough.
