{"text":"***** Perfect Paradise ***** THE MOST AMAZING HOLIDAY EVER!!!!! Just got back from the Riu Bambu after staying there for 2 weeks. The whole experience was amazing. All 6 of us agreed that this was the best holiday we had all had. Upon arriving, we were handed our keys for our rooms. As there were 3 couples we noticed that we were all located in different blocks but this was because we had booked seperately but I asked the reception assistant whether we could all be located closer to each other and within minutes he handed up 3 keys all in the same block. The service overall could not be faulted. ALL the staff were friendly. They just couldnt do any more for you. The rooms were clean, spacious and the fan and air con was fab. The rooms had optics too so could help yourself to drinks whenever you desired. We had run out of softdrink but after a call to reception, within 3 mins we had a member of staff outside our room to stock us up! The food was just out of this world... the choice was sometimes making it difficult as you just wanted to eat all of it! One of the girls that was with us is very fussy and she was eating every night, platefuls! Pancakes in the morning were the best! Smooties were just great... The pool was great too with a swim up bar but we spent most of the time at the beach as it was so hot and it meant we could get a bit of breeze.Acitivites were aplenty... so much going on all the time.. bingo, horseshoes, volleyball, football, scuba, windsurfing, canoes, catamarans! Mental!Entertainment team were the best too! Oliver was so funny! I just loved it all of it! Want to go back! Will be going to the Riu Tequilla next year!! Riu from now on every year!!
