{"text":"Convenient, clean and comfortable Last minute booking with no problems. The hotel is right at the Boston Logan Airport and can be accessed from the gates by walkway. I came into Terminal B and it was about a 10 minute walk, all indoors through walkways and through Terminal A, and it was not difficult to find. It appears to be new. Although it is it at the airport, I did not hear a single jet take off or land, which I was concerned about when I booked.Check in was quick and easy (I came in at 11:00 and there were only a couple people waiting at the check in desk) and the assistant at the front desk was pleasant. The room was a good size, very clean and very comfortable. I particularly appreciated the HD television and HD Channels. I also liked the night light in the bathroom, of which I had not seen a similar one before. It was its own outlet and gave off a very low blue glow when the light was turned off - not bright enough to be seen in the bedroom, and just light enough to let you see the floor as you walked into the bathroom in the middle of the night, so that you could easily find the light switch without banging a toe, or worse.My view was of the road coming into the airport, but I wasn't looking for a good view given my limited time there. It looked like there were potential for some nice views of the harbor from other rooms. The lobby is large and well appointed, and we used a conference room that was clean, well appointed and had convenient power plug ins for computers located within the tables and out of the way.The only negative I have about the hotel is that you have to pay for the wireless internet connection. I personally believe that today all hotels, and particularly hotels catering to business people, should not only have wireless internect connection, but it should free (at least build it into the cost of the room).One last positive. I had to cancel my second night stay and check out about 15 minutes after noon. The hotel did not charge me for the second night or charge a late cancellation fee without me asking. I really do appreciate that and I consider that good service.
