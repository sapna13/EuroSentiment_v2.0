{"text":"frightened to give due praise as may mean cannot get a booking in future! As per so many of the reviews - great locaton (3 euros on the airport bus and a short walk down the Ramblas is even easier than a taxi) but a haven of peace and calm compared to the fun and craziness of the day and night entertainment outside the front door.The cooling pool (towels provided) and deck showers on the rooftop were very welcome, with superb comfort provides by daybeds and plenty of cusions - the views across Barcelona to the sea were a real treat. We did not have breakfast in our package so avoided 18 euros and went to Starbucks right next to the lobby.Loved the room, the pillow menu, the very comfy bed, and the calming lighting! Spotless bathroom with great shower.Modern decor throughout. As great fans of the UK boutique hotel group Hotel Du Vin we are delighted to find a similar level of style and comfort in our favourite short break city. Every trip for us includes a lunchtime visit to the Mercato - a feast of produce that has to be seen and enjoyed!If room mini bar prices put you off drinking the amount of water etc you should do to remain headache free in a hot country there is a supermarket just a few yards up the road (left out of front door).The staff were polite, although not overly warm. One of the young barman at the rooftop bar was very helpful and pleasant every afternoon and evening.
