{"text":"Fine hotel, not blown away though Based on review from Trip Advisor, we booked 4 nights in the Park Hotel for April. The view from the room was great. Free internet was nice. The room was a bit smaller than I would have expected but it worked.Unfortunately the metro station in the building isn't a very useful one. It's on the Oedo line which doesn't go to many touristy places and it's not a quick connection to get to a more useful line. 95% of the time we ended up walking to Shimbashi station which is on the Ginza line. It's about a 10 minute walk from the hotel but involves using highway overpasses and crosswalks that go across 6 lane roads which can take a while. If you're caught in the rain, it's not a fun walk. Plus getting into the hotel isn't always straight forward. The raised entrance from the highway overpass and JR station closes at night which can be annoying. Also you have to take two elevators to get to your hotel room. One to get to the lobby on the 25th floor, and another to your room. Not really something you look forward to after a really long day; and the elevators are really slow.The restaurants in the hotel were grossly expensive, but this isn't a deficiency unique to this hotel.If you take an elevator from the lobby to the basement level you can get right to the Shidome metro station on the Oedo line. In the basement there are also a bunch of smaller restaurants that are reasonably priced. You can walk past them and outside to get to a FamilyMart (ubiquitous convenience store in Japan).All in all I'd say the hotel itself was fine. Really nothing special. Next time I'm in Tokyo I'll be looking for something with a better location; both for walking and for using the metro.
