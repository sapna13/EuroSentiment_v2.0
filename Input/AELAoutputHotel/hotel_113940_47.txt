{"text":"Charming inn; ideal location I had originally booked a DIFFERENT inn, based on tripadvisor recommendations. Escaped the other inn within a half-hour (see my other San Francisco review for reasons why), after calling to find out whether the Petite Auberge had a vacancy. They did. What a relief it was to find a place that lives up to its best reviews. The decor is antique (or reproduction antique) provincial French throughout. Rooms are decent-sized, very well kept, with decor that matches the public areas. Staff is more than helpful.Fresh-baked cookies and coffee are available in the tiny but adorable lobby, any time. Sumptuous breakfast downstairs includes quiches, tons of fresh fruit, croissants, and other delectable baked goods. There's a small, darling patio off the dining room but SF mornings tend to be chilly so I didn't see anyone take advantage of it while I was there.In the evenings, wine and cheese (or other snacks) are served in the sitting room and guests chat freely with one another. I imagine that most folks who choose a BB or small inn over a large impersonal hotel do so because they enjoy this sort of exchange with other travelers.A tiny European-style elevator serves the floors but I noticed that most guests, like me, used the stairs except when carrying luggage. The treads on the stairway from the second floor to the lobby are a little narrow, possibly because they've been carpeted when they weren't originally intended to be, and that limits the space for your foot. That, and the fact that wifi isn't offered free, unless you sign up for their club membership (free), are my only complaints with an otherwise perfect little inn.
