{"text":"Friendly Family Hotel - All Inclusive Option Stayed for one week with family (two teeneagers) using the hotel's All Inclusive internet offer.Very impressed with the actual All Inclusive option. Not only includes room and food\/beverages, but even motorised water sports which probably beats most others.Hotel is nice though not spectacular. Our rooms were a bit dated but otherwise fine. Had a romantic sea view room and a standard room. Not sure the money paid extra for the sea view room was worth it. Food on the All Inclusive plan was surprisingly good and varied daily. Buffets often combined with local dance performances and al fresco had a good selection. Did not try the Italian restaurant on premises, but the kids enjoyed room service and we liked the Chinese restaurant next door that was also included in the plan.Water sports equipment is a mixed bag, with hobie cats and water kayaks being quite new and in good shape, while windsurfers and the hotel's speed boat have seen better days. Jet skis were OK. Everyone at the hotel was friendly and welcoming, any issues were promptly addressed.During our stay there were mostly families, mainly from Germany, Japan, Russia and Australia.No real animation programme √ã√ë√∏ la Club Med, but daily activities like pool volley ball or beach socer were a hit with the kids.The beach is not really what you may be thinking of when you imagine Bali or the Tropics - no white sand coves framed by palm trees. Actually, depending on wind and tide you may not even want to swim there because of the reef and also because it does not always appear to be clean. However, this is a problem for all the properties along the Tanjung Benoa\/Nusa Dua beach line.I probably would not go back (I rarely go to the same place twice) but had a good time and can recommend it for a relaxing holiday.
