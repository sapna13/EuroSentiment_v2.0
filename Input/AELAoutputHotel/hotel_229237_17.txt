{"text":"Great location, small rooms I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights during February 2008.The booking was made through a travel agency in Greece, and though I have asked for a double bed front view room, mine was twin and had no view.Before booking the hotel I had read several reviews, for small and not clean rooms. The room was very clean and renovated but a little bit small..People on the reception desk were very helpful. Breakfast was plain, but nice and the staff also polite. We had one lunch there, so as to taste the famous filet, which was to our disappoinment bad and very expensive.A problem that we had is that due to a cancellation of our flight, all the group had to stay one extra night and the new room that we were given was so small, that had no closet and only one person could standing be around the bed at the same time. Apart from that, the room had old casings and it was very cold and noisy.Generaly the hotel was very noisy. You could hear peoples' steps from the corridor or from the room upstairs. Another thing, is that during check in the reception desk asked for our credit card for guarantee of any extras, which is common and acceptable, but without mini bar in the rooms (for an example), what consumptions can you make???Overall the hotel in a very nice location in central Amsterdam, with bus and tram stop just outside and just 5 minutes on foot from the central train station, near the market etc.  Would visit it again, provided that I would have a larger room.
