{"text":"5 star treatment at this classy hotel Have just returned from the Sofitel Hotel, in New York to celebrate my birthday and what a fabulous experience we had. We received 5 star treatment from the moment we arrived at the airport. I had already booked a car via Concierge to collect us from the airport and they were there to meet us in arrivals. We enjoyed a pleasant journey to the hotel unlike on a previous occasion when we used a yellow cab! Check in was seamless and all staff we came across at this hotel were fantastic. My partner had phoned ahead and told them it was my birthday so they upgraded us to queen superior on 27th floor - great view of the Chrysler building from our room. You would never believe you were in the centre of the city as it was so quiet √à√\u2020\u2022?a Very relaxing experience. About an hour after we arrived, a bottle of champagne arrived at our room for me, which was a very nice touch especially for a hotel of this size. The location of this hotel is great for getting around. A 5-minute walk to Times Square and Theatre land and 2 doors away is DB's restaurant, which everyone must try. The food and service is great. You need to book ahead for DB's as it is always heaving. We ate at The View (revolving restaurant at the Marriott Marquis) one evening and whilst the experience was good, the food was very average. Would not bother with that again. We had a predinner meal at Frankie and Jonnies Steak House which was alsoi good. This place was full and apparently has been there for years so has a great reputation for its steaks - worth a try. We also tried Tavern on the Green for Sunday brunch, which we nearly cancelled because of the reviews on here but glad we did go. Service was excellent and food good. It is no doubt a real tourist attraction for the city but you should give it a try.The Concierge 'crew' at this hotel are probably the best I have come across. They could not do enough for you. They even organised a hair appointment for me at this fabulous salon on 5th! The doormen are so attentive and one is made to feel very special. This is obviously an extremely well ran hotel and is a credit to the management as their high standards range from housekeeping staff all the way through. I became ill towards the end of our stay and they kindly organised a room for me so I could rest before we had to leave for the airport at no charge. I thought this was well and truly above and beyond expectations and really appreciated the kind gesture.I would recommend this hotel to everyone √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a fabulous place.
