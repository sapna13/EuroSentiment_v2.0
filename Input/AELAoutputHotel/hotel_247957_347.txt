{"text":"Best of 3 hotels we visit We just came back from 2 week stay in this hotel. Well, not exactly, since we spent both weekends in different resorts - our voluntary decision due to overbooking - to simply experience and compare them. And let me tell you, Occidental tops Bavaro All Suites and Caribe Princess by a long shot.First, downsides of Flamenco. If you need luggage service, make sure you inform them hours in advance, and still catch them on their way, otherwise you can end up late checking out. Also, both rooms we had there were just average, TV not working very well, and dated matressess. But at least, AC worked very well and bathrooms were nothing to complain about. After all, I dont plan to stay @ room during my stay in Dominicana anyway.Shows are so so, main objection is about a woman handling them, just not everybody appreciates the strange kind of humour picking up on people.Now, positives. Food. Absolutely amazing, great variety, tasty and served in great manner, in AC environment. And I mean a general buffet. Beach reastaurant equally good. Specialty restaurants rather plain, except a grill one which is highly recommended.Beach and pools are clean and spacious. To ensure a hut @ beach you have to towel-reserve it early by 7 AM, but thats just about in any resort during high season nowadays.Staff is very very friendly, trying their best to please the patrons. And no, you dont have to tip everyone and everything around to be treated well, good manners count as well.We liked it so much, decided to upgrade to VIP status and to make Occidental our primary and desired carabbean chain.To summarize; though some improvement could be made, let me assure you that comparing to Bavaro and Caribe resorts, Occidental Flamenco really shines. Its worth every penny you spend. ","annotations":[]}
