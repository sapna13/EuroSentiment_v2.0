{"text":"Kinda disappointed! We just returned from the Riu Bamboo mid Nov. What an experience we had. First off, when we arrived at the hotel around 11:00pm we had expected to order room service because we were hungry. Instead the front desk said there was food being served at Mamajuana (one of their buffets). Talk about gross-the hamburgers looked like they were there for a few hours and the hotdogs were green!!! There was no room service or coffee in your rooms, not even plush bathrobes. How disappointing was that! The resort and beaches were very clean and beautiful. The food, however, was terrible. My husband and I, along with many other people that we met, were sick for 5 days out of an 8 day vacation. There was nothing inticing about the buffet or any of the al la cartes . So with that in mind we asked their opinion of a nice seafood restaurant in town. They told us about the jellyfish. The restaurant was set on the beach, so the atmosphere was beautiful. Couldn't say much about where they dropped us off and had to walk to the restaurant. However, we had a very good meal. Until we got the bill. For two of us, it cost us $238.00 American. All we had was a seafood platter, that came with rice and veggies and one bottle of wine. That was absolute highway robbery! You know what we could have had in Toronto for that price? We disputed it with the director, but you know where that got us! Anyways, sad to say that we will not be going to the Riu Bamboo again. It was definitely not a five star riu!!
