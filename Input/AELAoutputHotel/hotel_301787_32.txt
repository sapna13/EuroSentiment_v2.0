{"text":"Good 4-star hotel There is nothing really wrong about the Laguna Resort and Spa hotel (which, by the way, is catering to lots of Germans and Russians). My wife and I spent a nice vacation and enjoyed ourselves at this hotel:+ Upgrade to executive suite+ Generally quiet hotel environment - we never heard anything from the rooms next door+ Room clean, functional, and well maintained+ Genuinely friendly staff+ Nice landscaping+ Small, but well equipped gym+ Free DVD rentals (since there is not much you can do at night in the hotel)+ Reasonably priced drinks at hotel barsBut, in comparison to what we had expected, the Laguna fell short off our expectations in some dimensions:- Many staff members not trained to the standards of a 5-star hotel (e.g., butler with a really bad cold serving our coffee, pulling up his nose all the time; servant in breakfast place sneezing all over table and dishes when cleaning table -- DISGUSTING!)- Food quality in hotel restaurants average only, portions too small- Breakfast buffet too crowded; they should open another restaurant for breakfast- Guests from neighboring Melia hotel blocking the few Bale sunbeds without hotel security interfering- And: Plastic sunchairs on the beach (I feel, you can always tell a hotel's attention to detail by looking at the sunchairs)- Overall: a 4-star touch-and-feel; lacking the wow-factor, as a previous poster rightfully saidAlso, my wife and I felt there are much nicer locations than Nusa Dua on the island. We went to Seminyak a couple of times (e.g., to the Oberoi, the Legian, the Seminyak), where the beach is fabulously wide and the ocean accessible all the time (high and low tide). Next time, we will book a hotel in that area.Overall, we enjoyed our stay. Amongst the hotels in Nusa Dua (we actually strolled through all of them), the Laguna made the best impression (together with the Conrad). But we would probably not return to Nusa Dua and the Laguna Resort.
