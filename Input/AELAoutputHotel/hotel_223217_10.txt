{"text":"A little far for downtown tourists I booked this hotel based on reviews on TripAdvisor. This was my first trip to Seattle and I don't mind staying a little out of the way to save some money. However, I was a little confused about the location, because there are to HIE hotels on Aurora Ave. The downtown Airporter from SeaTac will not take you to this one. We got dropped off at the 226 Aurora location and payed $20 for a taxi to this correct location. The hotel itself was very clean and the staff were polite and helpful. My sister and I shared a spacious room with 2 queen beds, with a view of downtown and Mt. Rainier in the distance. We were on the 4th floor and the road noise didn't bother us. The front desk provided an ethernet cable to hook up my laptop to the free high-speed Internet in the room. Breakfast was good and there were plenty of options. There was adequate parking in the lot for our rental car. For going downtown, the bus stop is a 5-minute walk from the hotel, but give yourself plenty of time because it takes about 30 minutes and doesn't run on schedule. I recommend having a car for the entire stay or staying closer if your primary goal in Seattle is tourism. Overall, nothing bad to say about the hotel. We had a good, comfortable stay, though we did not have a chance to take advantage of the indoor pool! ","annotations":[]}
