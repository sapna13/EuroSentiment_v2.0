{"text":"Excellent Club Service. I have recently returned from a three night extended weekend stay at the Intercontinental Hotel in Berlin. The hotel is very easy to find and is around a 10 minute walk from the Zoologischer Garten station. The taxi fare is around five euros.At check-in I was assigned a Club room which was a great touch as I am a platinum elite and Intercontinental Ambassador member of priority club.The hotel has two Club floors which are located in the newer East wing of the hotel. My deluxe club room was excellent and had two twin beds, two televisions and the bathroom was just beautiful with large tub and separate rain shower and of course, Molton Brown amenities. I also had a lovely letter from Guest Relations welcoming me back to the hotel. Turndown service was provided each evening.As my room was on the Club floor I also had exclusive access to the IC club lounge. The lounge offers complimentary internet access with one public computer for the sole use of club guests which was heavily used. Refreshments and snacks are available throughout the day. In the evening a self service cocktail bar is available with unlimited champagne, spirits, wine and beer together with a selection of evening canap√ã√\u2022√ñs. The IC lounge has separate seating areas, dining area, magazines and newspapers. The lounge closes at 22:30.Breakfast was also provided in the lounge for Club guests. The breakfast was excellent including cold and warm choice.I also used the vitality club which is available to club guests. The gym is rather small with limited equipment and some free weights. The pool area is lovely and the wellness area with sauna,steam and relaxation areas is truly superb.Overall I had a great stay at the Intercontinental Berlin and loved the Club level service.
