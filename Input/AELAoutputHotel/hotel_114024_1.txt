{"text":"Felt Liike Royalty We just returned from a four night stay at the Royal Hawaiian and it was lovely. After reading some very negative reviews we were very apprenhensive about staying there however our fears were unfounded. From the moment we stepped into the hotel and saw the granduer of the lobby and the magnificience we were in awe. It was truly a step back in time to old elegance and palatial beauty not gawdy just exquisite. The fault is with the rooms, somewhat dated. Our first offered garden view room was OK but not special so we upgraded to a tower oceanview room at a cost of $100.extra per night and was told it was a special price. The tower is the newer part of the hotel and therefore nicer, the astounding panaroma view of Waikiki beach was worth the money!!!!! Room # 1008. The only problem was that the balcony railing seemed too low and I felt uncomfortable standing too close to the edge. The birds hang out on the railings looking for scraps and therefore leave some droppings.The rest of the hotel is unsurpassed in old world elegance and charm, the beach is wonderful and you can walk out very far in the water and it is not deep. Some spots have a bit of coral so if you think you need it wear water shoes. Also the Luau is very nice my first one so nothing to compare, the food was good not fantastic, the show is great and if you are a guest of RH or Sheraton you get a 20% of automatically, it cost around 96.00 regularly. Barbara Eden was at ours with her husband he is a builder and apparently had something to do with the Sheraton. I highly recommend the Majestic Island tour if you have not seen the island before you will be surprised at the beauty of Oahu, there are things you cannot see by bus or shuttle, well worh it. The concierge at RH arranges everything for you and answers all your questions. We loved the hotel even in it's pre -repaired state so we can only imagine how it will be after.
