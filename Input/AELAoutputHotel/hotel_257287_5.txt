{"text":"suitcase space Cremorne is a picturesque spot with a lovely walk along the Mossman inlet, worth a visit in its own right.The bus to any shops or restaurants runs about every 30 minutes (be careful about finding the return bus stop from Military Road) and the ferry into Sydney is a treat in itself as you get to see the bridge and opera house every day as you travel with the poor commuters going to work, while you are on vacation.My only comment regarding the accommodation would be that Room 5 is a bit cramped if you have two or more suitcases. I cannot comment on the other rooms, but getting to open our bags was a challenge. I do not like putting cases on beds, especially the roll along type but here you have no alternative.Internet access was a plus and you will get to meet new friends at breakfast, because the sitting area is a bit of a squeeze, but overall a nice quite suburb.Two pieces of information that might be of use, it is a fairly steep climb from the ferry dock along Cremorne Road or from the nearest bus stop even with pull along bags, and the ferry from Circular Quay stops running at 19.30 on Sundays. This caught us out once which led to a very amusing taxi ride, where I had to direct the driver, I don't speak Chinese and he didn't speak English, so I had to charge him for the pleasure of our company by not paying the full fare.
