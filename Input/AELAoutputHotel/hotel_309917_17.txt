{"text":"Horrible experience How I wished I went to this website before I booked into the YWCA hotel.As a frequent traveller in Southeast Asia, I have had my share of bad experiences but for a 3-star hotel like this one, I couldn't believe what I saw.When we first checked in, the room given to us reeked of urine and the toilet seat was broken. Disgusted at what I saw, I requested a room switch which was initially denied by the receptionist. It wasn't until I requested to talk to the manager that I got my room changed.Second room had ants in the washroom floor. Ants. The A\/C was ridiculously loud and when the hotel sent up a pest control person to deal with the ants, he ended up overspraying my entire washroom with pesticide. Needless to say, my room stank for the rest of the day.The TV cable was definitely sub-par. On their website, they advertise having nice cable TV, but in reality, there were only about 4 viewable channels with the rest being either fuzzy or difficult to see. 3 Star Hotel Huh? I've had much better TV service in Cambodia costing $10US a night.The service workers in the morning have no utter regard of customer service. I got a knock on my door at 9am from them requesting to inspect my 'minibar' in my room to see whether or not I ate or drank their goods. Without giving her permission, she literally walked into the room, invading our privacy.Frustrated, I demanded some compensation for my horrible experience. Luckily, one of the managers was very accomodating and was probably, the only one qualified in customer service. The best I got was a room upgrade to the 'family suite', not even a discount on the room rate.Sadly, the family suite upgrade also had ants on the table, the TV was fuzzy and even worse, the A\/C system made even more noise than ever. At this moment, I was too stressed out and tired with the whole situation to bother making another complaint again. Upon checking out, the billing system wasn't clear at all and it appeared as if I was being double-taxed for the entire stay.I sent an email to the hotel about the situation afterwards and all I received was some non-chalant reply and a message not to submit an internet review of their hotel to 'tarnish their good reputation'. Some customer service I must say.Horrible experience, I really really wished I read this website beforehand and did my own research.
