{"text":"Nice hotel but big money also!! Enjoyed my stay overall at the padma and had a club room. Decided to stay there after many years of hearing about it from other people so had to stay for 5 days to see what the fuss is about. Positives - Great brekky although the main area can be a little crowded after 8am.- Beautiful grounds and attentive staff.- proximity to shopping, and quality restaurants in seminyak. (about 10 mins in a cab).Negatives - Cost - I never payed for my stay as i used american express rewards but my club room would have been around the 200 plus US dollars a night range. Not worth it considering for the rest of my 3 week stay i checked into my regular 4.5 star hotel with the same amenities and service as the padma for 85 US dollars a night.POOL- The pool is great and huge but there is only 1 of them!! At 400 plus rooms this is a big hotel ans 1 pool is nowhere near big enough to accomodate all these people. On sunny days it was like swimming at a very crowded beach. They definently need a dedicated kids pool and a club members only pool would be beneficial as well.No beach access- Although the beach is close there is no direct access from the hotel to the beach and no hotel lounges or service on the beach for the guests. Having this may alleviate some pressure off the 1 pool.Besides this my family did enjoy our stay there but would we go back! No not at those rates there are plenty of places on the island just as good for half the cost.
