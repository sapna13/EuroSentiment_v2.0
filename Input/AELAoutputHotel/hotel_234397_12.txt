{"text":"Great Location, Great Value For The Money We just came back from 5 nights at H10 Catalunya Plaza. We stayed in triple room, room 206. I had asked for room 313 facing the square, but we got there early at 8:00 am and were able to check right in, in room 206. It had a double bed, and a small sitting area with a couch that converted to a single bed. Which was fine. It faced a back courtyard. It was very quiet. So quiet, it felt like we were the only ones in the hotel, and of course that wasn't the case. The breakfast buffet was huge, same things every day. If I go back I wouldn't book the breakfast. Since you eat dinner so late in Barcelona, we weren't really hungry for breakfast. And it was so-so. The hotel has free coffee, tea, wine, pastries, and mini sandwiches in the lounge. That was a big draw for me booking the hotel, but again we really didn't use it. They had free internet, two computers in the lounge. We used them twice. I never saw anyone else using them. And we had one english channel, CNN. Friends who stayed in a more expensive hotel had no english channels. The room was immaculately cleaned everday, they provided us with 2 bathrobes.The location was great. We took the Aerobus up and back from the airport. It lets you off across the hotel, and you pick it up across the square. The hotel is in the center of everything. The beginning of La Ramblas is one block away, and the gothic area 5 minutes away. We were one block off of Passeig De Gracia the main Blvd. I had originally wanted to book a hotel in the gothic area, but now am glad I didn't. Its very dark, and small narrow streets at night. I felt very safe at the H10 Catalunya Plaza as its on a huge lit up square, and there always seemed to be people around. I would definitley recommend this hotel. Great value for the $. Be sure to go to Caelum, up Carrer Palla, a little pastry shop in the gothic area and sit in the cafe. Wonderful. And eat at Taller De Tapas also in the gothic area on Plaza Sant Josep Oriol. We took the hop on hop off bus and got a two day pass. You get the bus in front of the hotel. There are two routes, the second leaves from across the square. Lots to do. We loved Barcelona!
