{"text":"Good Trip in the End I just returned from a six day stay at the Melia Caribe Tropical in Punta Cana. I cannot say I was disappointed, but at the same time, I definitely would not return. Basically, I'd say you get what you paid for!Food: so - so. Breakfast was delicious; I definitely recommend Los Atables' omelet bar! Lunch was fine, not delicious, but tolerable. For dinner we tried: American Grill, Hokkaido, and La Pagoda. The American Grill was absolutely excellent; do not go expecting truly Amercican food though, keep an open mind. Hokkaido was fun, and the food was good. La Pagoda was not very good in my opinion, but other people did enjoy it. Try and make reservations as early as possible (9-11 the day before) or else there's a good chance you will not get a spot - they fill up extremely quickly!Rooms: I was disappointed in the rooms. They smelled terrible the entire stay, and were dirty, with dirt and sand all over. There was also lots of mold and mildew in the bathroom, and the water pressure made it impossible to take showers some days!Service\/ Check in - out: The people here were very, very nice. The language barrior was confusing, but as long as you know a few Spanish words, it's fine. Check in\/ out was very slow, but the computers were down when we arrived, so it was not completely their fault. I'd say Check - in was the worst part of the trip; I was tempted to book a flight home right then! We had no room for three hours, then we had a regular room with no electricity, when we had asked for RS. However, I'm glad we stayed, because the trip turned out great!Beach\/ Pool: The beach was beautiful, but the seaweed was a problem. You had to walk very far to get away from it all! The water was warm, and a gorgeous turquoise color - it made all the stress we'd gone through worth it! The main pool is absolutely huge, and the swim - up bar was great. Finding a chair was difficult, so go early in the morning and make sure to get one. The spa was also great - I had an Anti - Stress \/ Relaxtion massage, and it was exactly as the name implies - very, very relaxing. Well worth the money. Also, the resort is huge. While this is nice, it was difficult to get around. There was a train, but I found it easier to walk than to wait for it all the time. Be sure to bring sneakers or comfy shoes because honestly, it takes at least 15 mins. to get ANYWHERE in this resort! Finally, be sure to pack everything you need. I had my sunscreen confiscated at the airport security so I needed to buy more at the hotel gift shop. It cost $20 for a tiny tube of sunblock here! The gift shop is ridiculously overpriced for everything ($10 for magazines, $50 for t - shirts) so don't plan on getting much shopping done. All in all, the hotel is very pleasant, and the trip is worth the money. But if you've got a larger time frame \/ budget, I recommend doing some reserarch and finding another option.
