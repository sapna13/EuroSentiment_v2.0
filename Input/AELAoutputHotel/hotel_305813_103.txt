{"text":"Cannot fault this place From the limousine pickup at the airport, through the personalised check in process, right through to checkout, the whole experience was seamless.Whilst it may not be the best hotel in the world, it certainly is very good at what it does. Some staff members spoke better, more intelligible ,English than others, but that was our only perceived problem.Upon arrival at the hotel, we were personally met in the lobby by our check-in consultant. Once the formalities were handled, we were sent off to our room with any required instructions, such as how to use the key cards, access, hours of operation of facilities etc. All comprehensively done.We only had a standard room but it was very good indeed. The large comfortable beds, quality linen, pillow menu, high-tech operation of all aspects of the room functions, personalised greeting on the Plasma TV and wide variety of screen entertainment options etc., were all of a high standard.The bathroom was perfect. All glass and marble and very nice products to avail oneself of. No screw cap toileties that you migh have to fumble with. Quality flip cap toiletries that were easy to use with either the rain shower or hand held option also.If only more hotels were like this. Especiall at the excellent rate per night we achievedThis is the only time I have ever awarded a hotel an 'excellent'; in review.Apparently Mong Kok has the highest density population of any area in the word, I have been told, though have not tested the veracity of this statement. It certainly impresses 'shades of old Hong Kong' on the mind in the way that the area is a little jaded, bustling, busy and crowded area. In this, the area detracts from the hotel. If a hotel of this style could be transferred closer to the harbour, it would be all for he better.
