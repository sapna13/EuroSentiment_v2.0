{"text":"Excellent Hotel My husband and I stayed for 3 nights at the Omni in San Francisco and we were so impressed with this hotel, we were compelled to write about it. The price is so affordable that you really don't expect to be 'wowed' by the hotel. But our expectations were far exceeded.The service of every staff member we came in contact with was exemplary. The Front Desk personnel were so helpful in recommending restaurants, transportation, etc. They even booked a (future) dinner for us at a restaurant in Napa Valley, which was the next leg of our vacation.The Front Desk personnel, Bellboys, the Doormen, the Housekeeping staff---every single person treated us like royalty. Our room was perfectly clean when we arrived, the front desk staff went out of their way to see that we had a room with a view, and they always followed up by phone to make sure we received whatever service we had requested. Additionally, the location of the Omni is ABSOLUTELY excellent. We walked EVERYWHERE. To the Ferry Building every day, to Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, to Ghiaradelli Square, to Lombard Street, to dinner each night. We never had to take a taxi or other type of transportation. Granted, some of the walks were steep uphill climbs, but that was part of the inate charm of the city. What a fantastic, albeit short time we had in San Francisco. And many thanks to the Omni for making our stay so thoroughly enjoyable. Steve and Tammy Lunn, Laytonsville, Maryland ","annotations":[]}
