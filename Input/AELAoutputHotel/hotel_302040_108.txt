{"text":"one of the worlds great hotels We stayed at the Peninsula last yearand enjoyed a most relaxing stay with excellent service.This year we were in HKG and stayed at both Shangri la hotels and the Pen.Certainly the Island Shangri la and the Pen are of a similar luxurious standard. Our stay this year at the Pen was however spoiled by what could only be described as indifferent check in staff.On arrival, around lunch time, we were advised that our room would not be available until 2 pm-- fair enough,the check in timeis stated as 2 pm.The receptionist was hardly warm or welcoming.When we said that we were pleased to be back at the hotel we received a blank expression.At around 2 20 we returned to be told that the room was still not ready.The same situation at around 2 50.By now I was becoming annoyed.Then we learn that altough we had booked a king bed the room allocated was a twin.On explaining that this was really not acceptable we wereinformed that the 2 beds would be pushed together.By now i had had enough.Fortunately, the Guest Relations Manager was nearby and with a minimum of fuss we were given a room with a king bed.Overall the staff handling our check in fell far short of the standards of the rest of the staff we came into contact with during our stay.That night we enjoyed dinner at Gaddis.A truely superb meal with faultless service.On returning to our room a beautiful tray of fresh strawberries with a note from the Guest Relations Director apologising for the difficulties we experienced at check in greeted us.Full marks for agood guest recovery approach.I spoke with the Guest Relations Director later,thanking her for efforts.It seemed that the hotel was having some challenges with some of the newer staff.On checing out our bill included some $400 in mini bar charges.This was quite a surprise as we had not consumed any items from the bar during our stay.I raised this with the receptionist.An icy look and phone call to i guess the supervisor resulted in a revised bill being presented to us.I must say this employee would not be out of place atPyongyang Airport Immigration.We were made to feel quite uncomfortable.I gave up using mini bares long ago. Isimply refuse to pay 10 times the retail price for a can of soda water.We,as i think many travellers do is to purchase some mixes outside the hotel for the duty free scotch.Apart from the check in staff our stay was truely superb.Ifirst stayed at the Pen with my parents when iI was 4 years old.I have many happy memories of this grand hotel ","annotations":[{"endOffset":57,"mention":"Peninsula","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_Peninsula_Hong_Kong"],"startOffset":48},{"endOffset":2251,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":2247},{"endOffset":2251,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":2247},{"endOffset":2251,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":2247}]}
