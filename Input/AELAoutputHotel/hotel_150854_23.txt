{"text":"Overall, very nice hotel..... This was my first trip to the DR, and also my first all-inclusive.My bride and I stayed 8\/23-8\/30\/08.From the moment we entered the spacious lobby and were met with drinks, we felt very special. I don't know where some of the criicisms came from from other travelers. We had a standard room, which had a small terrace. It was spacious and had 2 queen size beds. The room was clean, the bathroom was not large but more than adequate. The furniture may not be brand new, but it was in good condition nonetheless. The mini bar was constantly stocked, and there are liquor dispensers in each room (no extra charge)Let me start with the negatives:1. Other reviewers as well a friends advised me to stay away from the restaurants. The Palace Macao has a Japanese restaurant and a Steakhouse. Although not bad, neither stand out. We were told we could visit 3 of the other 4 Riu resorts in the complex, but we didn't bother. The buffets made up for the restaurants. See comments later on.2. The Room Service leaves a lot to be desired. They boast of 24 hour availability, but the menu leaves little to order. 2 salads, 2 sandwiches, nachos and cake are all there are on the menu.3. The main entertainment is not very good. It's time to retire the Michael Jackson impersonator. The other production is Cabaret. Yes, the original broadway cast, or rather their voices. The entire production is lip synched. The La Boheme theaterwas about 85 degrees, and we left as soon as we heard Liza's voice coming out of someone else. They really need to update this.Now, the positives:1. The rooms were constantly cleaned, and the bed was turned down every night. The sheets were clean, towels were more than ample, and the bed was very comfortable.2. It rained, so we had to resort to the TV. Other reviewers said they got a few poorly received channels. There were only 3 English speaking channels, but about 20 in all. The TV could be upgraded to newer sets, but that's not why you go to the DR. 3. The buffets-amazing! From breakfast through lunch and then dinner, the selection was unending, and the food was fresh and attractively displayed. Other food is available near the pool all day. There was no reason to make reservations at 8 AM, as many others said. Make friends with a maitre' d and you're in. 4. The pool is clean, certainly large enough, and there is much natural shade right near the pool for people like me who burn and don't tan. The beach is right there, and the clear water and cool sand make it a pleasure. Water sports are available, many for free. I tried to go parasailing 3 times, and they screwed up the reservation each time. Still I loved the beach. As there are many Europeans, some went topless.5. Tours-there are many availabale from different tour operators. We took the Bavaro Runner tour, which is an all day excursion into the real DR. The tour guide, Mimi, was great-he is full of funny stories. Beer is served on the open bus (no windows). You visit a sugar cane plantation, cigar stand, a school, a beach and a horse farm where riding is available for free. A Dominican lunch is included, and was a pleasant surprise-nice variety and good qualiy.6. Finally, the people. The Dominicans are very friendly. Everyone I know said to bring a lot of cash for tipping. It's not really required. The service at the hotel was fantastic-a special thak you to my man Pedrito, who made sure we were happy.Overall, we had a really nice time, and I'd visit another Riu property with no hesitation.Andy MMonroe Township NJ ","annotations":[{"endOffset":18,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":14},{"endOffset":765,"mention":"Palace","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/The_New_York_Palace_Hotel"],"startOffset":759},{"endOffset":1140,"mention":"salads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Salad"],"startOffset":1134},{"endOffset":1154,"mention":"sandwiches","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Sandwich"],"startOffset":1144},{"endOffset":1162,"mention":"nachos","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nachos"],"startOffset":1156},{"endOffset":1171,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1167},{"endOffset":1171,"mention":"cake","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1167},{"endOffset":3473,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3469},{"endOffset":3473,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3469}]}
