{"text":"Loved it, good value! We stayed at the Royal Plaza for 8 nights and stayed in the Executive Suite as we travelled with a 3yo and 7month old. Our room was on the 10th floor, these suite go from the 10th to 15th floors. Our room entailed a separate lounge (which is where we put the cot and rollaway bed for the children) which had a large screen TV, a lounge suite and 2 tub chairs, writing desk and coffee table and also a dining table.Our bedroom was very roomy with an iron and ironing board and his\/hers wardrobes. It had a king bed with large marble ensuite with bath and separate shower and also a bidet.The turn down service is great in the evenings as they replenish all used towels and fill your ice bucket, empty bins and even tidy your bed etc The views were of surrounding buildings but was a very quiet room with good natural light.We had tea\/coffee making facilities and free mini bar which has 2 Tiger beers, 3 cans of Soft Drink, an orange juice and 4 bottles of water daily, which was great.We also got a complimentary choice of buffet meal daily at Carousel and entry to the Royal Club lounge. We chose breakfast and dinners on alternating days, then mid week decided on dinners instead and they happily complied! The range of buffet food was fantastic from sushi, to seafood including prawns and crayfish to Wagyu beef , Duck and Quail- also various roasted meats and a large asian choice. The desserts were fantastic- there really was something for everyone and breakfast just as amazing in choice.We didnt use the Royal Club until a few days before we left as we had the kids, but that was a mistake as we had free breakfast , afternoon tea, all day tea\/coffee\/soft drinks and evening cocktails which run from 5.30 to 8pm (my husband really enjoyed the cognac!) it was a great place to go together or separately for a bit of quiet!. It is on the 15th floor and the lifts are very fast, so not a problem to get to.We didnt try the wifi but used the complimentary computers.The Pool was a typical hotel pool, but the gym was small but is going to be upgraded this year. Was absolutely a first class, 5 star hotel, but saying that ,we had a mix of business people and families and didnt feel out of place with 2 young children.The staff were friendly and courteous, check in was fast, the door men were knowledgable in everything we asked them, from laundromats to directions!Hotel is very well placed for MRT access and in the heart of Orchard Rd. Also has a supermarket within 100metres.We hired a babysitter for our children for 2hrs in the evening and they are from the hotel- from housekeeping etc so this was organised through the hotel and was $9 per hour (3hr min) for however many children. We will definately stay here again and would recommend the Club Lounge.
