{"text":"Excellent experience, up to all expectations, plus some. We stayed there a few days either side of New Years Eve, and were mainly very pleased indeed. We travelled from the UK, there were nine of us in four rooms, and apart from the rooms not all being ready - which was not handled well - the rest of the stay was wonderful. The position is ideal for Times Square and much of all else in NYC.The rooms were very fine, perhaps slightly showing some wear, but the bed and shower and facilities all measured up to best expectations. The food for breakfast and evening meals was extremely good, in fact the fillet steak was up there amongst the best I have had anywhere. The restaurant service was top notch, even new years day!The service, pre arrival and after arrival, was in most respects very good indeed. The Concierge desk was superb, and set us up with the best New Years Eve experience in Times Square we could ever have hoped for, especially as it coincided with a 21st birthday.The only surprise was the handling of our checking in, it being announced that our rooms were not all ready, almost as if it was our fault √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√áecause of the time of year√à√\u2020\u2022? but this may have included some language issues, eg our English accent perhaps! It seemed to magically sort itself, which was also left unexplained.To make up for that, a small but significant admin issue re the booking agents, making some prepaid rooms unpaid, was handled immediately with such care and management attention that I have never seen before in any hotel anywhere in the world.All in all we had a thrilling new year experience in New York, and the Westin Times Square contributed a large part to that, indeed if they read this then thank you very much.AJ ","annotations":[]}
