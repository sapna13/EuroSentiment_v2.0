{"text":"A great overall experience The Vibe Hotel was awesome! After reading some of the reviews before booking this hotel, I was skepical..but, it was clean, great attendance, the only problem I had was with the remote, don't mess around with it, if it's not working. I was there for two days on my own, felt very safe! I stayed in the hotel for a total of 5 days. Food, of course is expensive, but... if you are hungry and not sure where to go.. just step outside the hotel, go left from the hotel and then about 2 or 3 blocks go left and you will run into China Town, lots of different foods and good prices. You can walk just about anywhere, but ladies, watch the high heels, they'll get your feet! I took off and just walked and discovered so much... The Opera House, Botanical Gardens, the parks, a dinner cruise was awesome, you can see the city night lights, the shopping....so much to do.. the weather was great! My overall experience with the hotel... GREAT! I would definitely stay there again! Clean, curtious staff, quiet...and they were all accommodating! Best advise on getting there from the airport...catch a shuttle! I took the taxi... $50, plus I tipped $5.. which I found out later, did not need to do that! I was overcharged to begin with. I took the shuttle back to the airport and it was great! a few stops on the way, but the conceire told us what time to catch to get to the A\/P on time and it was fine! ","annotations":[]}
