{"text":"Royal Magda Etoile reviews are true! What a lovely hotel, especially for 99 Euros a night in mid-January. The hotel is a mere block from the Arc de Triomphe and two blocks from the Air France Express Bus to CDG Airport. The service was friendly, and everyone spoke English when my French stumbled.I traveled solo for a long week-end holiday to the City of Lights. Although my room was small, it was certainly more than adequate enough for me. The sheets were soft and comfortable, the room and bathroom were immaculately serviced each day, and there was wireless internet access available. For such a small hotel, I was surprised to find that the hotel offers room service and a mini-bar (although I did not partake in either).The breakfast may be expensive for some at 12 Euros (it was not included in the room price I was quoted), but it consisted of a nice assortment of breads, croissants, cereals, yogurt, meats and cheeses. The breakfast area is quiet and comfortable--a nice place to plan your day over an endless cup of hot coffee.Overall, I find it hard to believe you can beat the value this hotel offers.HINT: Although most people would rather visit Paris during the spring and summer when Paris is in full bloom, don't neglect this city during the off months. Airfares are a bargain (I paid $550 round-trip from Newark Liberty), the tourist sites are empty, and in January especially, all of the stores have great sales. Even with the weaker dollar, I spent over $300 on great deals at the Men's store Madelios.
