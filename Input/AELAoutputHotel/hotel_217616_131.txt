{"text":"Fine, but not Great! We were just at the Muse, staying from November 4-7, 2006. While we enjoyed our stay, I would not agree that this is a four star hotel. Because this was a busy weekend due to the New York Marathon, I had used Priceline to book our room. Since I did get a good price, I probably should not complain at all, but had I paid the rack rate I would definitely have been disappointed.The location of the hotel was great. It was on a quiet street, but only a block from Times Square and close to Rockefeller Center, 5th avenue shopping, etc. We found it easy both to catch the subway nearby and to get a cab in front of the hotel. The complimentary wine between 5pm and 6pm was nice as well. I found the beds to be very comfortable and the bathroom to be a nice size with nice toiletries included.On the other hand, the room was a bit worn. Also, the cleaning service did not do the best job, leaving garbage in the trash cans and not wiping down the sink at all. Our room had a hole in the sink where apparently the sprinkler was missing. I have never seen this in a four-star hotel before. Finally, we found the staff (with the exception of the doorman) to be a bit cold and aloof, as though you were putting them out if you asked a question.All in all, we didn't really spend much time in our room anyhow. I would stay at the Muse if you get a good rate. We would not stay here again if we were paying full price.
