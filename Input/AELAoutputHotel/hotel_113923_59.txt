{"text":"Pretty nice My husband and I just got back from a 6-night stay at Hotel Kabuki, and for the most part, enjoyed our stay. We reserved and were presented with a renovated deluxe king room, only to be disappointed! Although it was on the 16th floor, our room was tiny and a bit outdated. The room was very clean, but smelled of smoke. The bed wasn't a king, and the view from the room was very average. The staff was nice enough to relocate us. We settled for the same type of room on the other side of the floor, which was slightly larger and had a king-sized bed. The view into the city was spectacular. Although the walls were paper thin, we found the 16th floor to be very quiet.We LOVED our soaking tub, our cozy bed, the free internet, and the festive decor. We also appreciated the wine hour, the great martinis in the bar, the front desk, and literally being in Japantown. We highly recommend parking underground for half the cost of valet, and reserving a room as high up as possible for a good night's sleep. The front desk even gave us a half bottle of cabernet for no reason-what a nice touch! We always found our room as neat as a pin when returning back in the afternoon.We did NOT like the lack of storage space in the room (where to put clothes?), nor the desk and chair being inches away from the bed-I had to climb over the bed to get to the other side of the room when my husband was working at the desk. We also did not appreciate the inappropriate conversation made by the bellman upon arrival. We were not given the tea service as promised, but maybe they were too busy? Being that the rooms are so tiny, we would probably opt for a corner room if we were to return.Overall, we felt that our stay was a great value, yet presented some awkward moments. The staff does make a valiant effort to accommodate the guests, and we left very content with our experience.
