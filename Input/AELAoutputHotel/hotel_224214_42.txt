{"text":"Cool Hotel This is a cool, small boutique hotel. The rooms are larger than in most Manhattan hotels. Our room had wood floors and it looked out at Bryant Park across the street (a small side street at that). At night, if you don't feel like walking any more, but you're not ready to be cooped up, the park is a very relaxing place to hang out and watch people (and drink cheap store-bought beer, although it's against park rules). The Koi Restaurant in the hotel is still a trendy place to be for locals, and it is an absolute madhouse from happy hour through 10 or 11 at night during the week. And the food is fantastic. If you want to be a tourist (which we were) the hotel is 5 minutes from Broadway and a short walk to the Empire St. Building. The entertainment director (the concierge) will book anything for you and make great suggestions for what's overhyped and what's not. The staff is cool, too. The pop singer Usher was staying at the hotel while we were there. The morning he was going to put on a free concert at the Park, which was our first morning there, having arrived the night before, there were crowds lined up down the sidewalk on both sides outside the hotel. We walked in and out of the hotel at least 5 times past the crowd, all of whom wanted to try to sneak into the lobby to see Usher, and the staff didn't give us a second look, because they memorized our faces when we walked out the first time. Great place to stay. ","annotations":[]}
