{"text":"Wonderful week! I was at Natura Park Hotel from march 11 to march 18 and I had wonderful time and a very good experience. The hotel is very good, the ground are wonderful: a lot of lake, smalls bridges, a big variety of flowers and trees and a lot of birds. The beach is also very beautiful. The sand is white and you can walk a long time on an almost desert beach. When is windy you will find some seaweeds but the hotel clean it many time a day.If you like the nature you will be served! The food is very good and I don't understand why some people wrote that it was horrible. Every day the buffet offer different kind of food. It have food for every taste! The a la carte restaurants are excellent! The service in the three restaurants is very good despite what the people said that the Italian restaurant has a slow and bad service...it was very fast and the servers are very nice. If you go at the seafood restaurant take the langouste bisque and the langouste! It was so good and it's free! I travelled in many place in caribean before and it's the only hotel I went where is was free. The grill restaurant is good but it was not my favorite... but the restaurant has a very nice and romantic atmosphere. The rooms are very nice. The ceilling and the doors are in wood and the room is very clean. For sure I will recommand this hotel to my friend. I had such a good time! If you want to relax it's the perfect hotel.I hope my review will help you and I'm sorry if I did some english mistakes...I'm from Quebec! lol ","annotations":[{"endOffset":42,"mention":"Park Hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Park_Hotel_Shanghai"],"startOffset":32},{"endOffset":1185,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1181}]}
