{"text":"Good value We got a good deal to stay here through Cathay Pacific Holidays. Upon checking in, we were delighted to be told that we had been upgraded to an executive club floor room. Thinking it was our lucky day and having stayed at similarly named rooms at deluxe hotels, we had high expectations, however it was really just a room and there was no fancy club lounge or extra benefits. At first glance the room looked nice and modern, however upon closer examination you could tell it was a bit of a show. Nothing terrible, although the bathroom in particular was small and not very practical. We also had a problem with the shower not draining properly and having to spend half the time ankle deep in water! However we chose to put up with this and not report it to the hotel. Despite the above, the room was adequate and it was not a bad choice for the price we paid (AUD 122 per night). Our package included free internet (always handy) and buffet breakfast which provided a lot of variety although the food was not all edible. Service was reasonable and we had a smooth check out.The area is quieter than others and is mainly residential however there are plenty of small shops nearby, a decent supermarket and it is handy to reach by MTR or bus. In particular the airport bus (approx. HKD 40) stops right outside the hotel.I would recommend this hotel if you can get it for a reasonable price and don't mind staying away from the heart of the action. It is not a luxurious hotel (although it tries to be!) and is nothing to write home about, but all the essentials are there.
