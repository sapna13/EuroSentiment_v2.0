{"text":"Has its good points.... Stayed here but not on Royal Service!Only 20 mins from airport which was great.Check in did take a little while (30 mins) but due to all of us arriving at the same time and only 3 check in staff!Grounds are extensive however there is a trolley that takes you all around with frequent stops and we never had to wait more than 5 minutes!Our room was located near the pool which was great.The rooms are nothing special but clean and funcionable!The staff we found to be very polite and eagre to please however as other people have said their VACATION CLUB reps can become a nuisance...a very fim but polite NO put them in their place and in the end I did have to say I dont want to disrepect you but please leave me alone!!The food we found to be of OK quality in the buffets with a very wide selection however the restaurants had very limited choices on the menus but it was nice to have the variation.We had no problems booking any of the restaurants but we booked the day before we wanted them...just a tip!Excursions were very limited for us as we have an 18 month old.They took all day and it was not an option for us.The kids club i cannot comment on as our child did not go....the ones that were there seemed to be having a good time....however from my initial view of the care and attention of the leaders I would not have felt comfortable leaving my child in their care...thats just a personal view though.The roayel service side looked excellent and we wished we could have afforded it!!Snacks after 11pm are non existant and VERY EXPENSIVE at the gift shop.....bring your own!!The grounds and lobbies and bars were spotless and the staff were attentive however on an all inclusive reort we found 2 weeks too much.....10 days would be better!!!Check out is 12 noon however for $75 you can keep your room until 4 pm.....for $45 you can keep it until 3pm!! Exchange rates vary every hour!! Carry both dollars and pestos!!All in all we enjoyed it....glad we went there...would we go back??......with another couple and it would have to be Royal Service!!!Woulnt rush back but had a good time!!We almost cancelled because of the negative reviews about food and the sheer size of place......glad we did not as the size is not a big issue but dont expect gormet food!!
