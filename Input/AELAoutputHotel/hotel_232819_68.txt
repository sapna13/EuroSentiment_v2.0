{"text":"Plesant stay I ended up picking this hotel because of the reviews, price and location.We weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ disappointed, however, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know if it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ truly Madrid√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ #1 hotel.We had 2 rooms. The first being a single room which was actually a full bed, big enough for 2. The room itself felt a bit cramped because you can only get in on the bed on one side since the room isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that big, but it was perfect for just one person. It had a desk and a flat screen t.v. There is also a safe and a mini bar fridge. There was a window facing the inside of the building with no special view just of other walls. The decoration is modern yet minimalist with wooden panels on the walls and great lighting. The bathroom was very spacious with marble tiles, a regular sized bathtub and bidet. We spent 90 euros a night for this room. The other room was a twin room with 2 small beds. The room itself was spacious and had a small balcony facing the back of the building. The closet space was double the size of the single room. All the other amenities were about the same. We paid 112 euros a night for the twin.The only complaint I have is that the cleaning staff starts at 7 am and I could hear them in the morning. I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect this for a 4 star hotel which is what the hotel is now considered √à√\u2020\u2022?TA still has it as a 3 star.The other downside is that breakfast isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ included. However, there are some great restaurants nearby that are not touristy at all. I did enjoy my stay and would recommend it to anyone. The location is fantastic √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ central but not on a main busy street and there are lots of great restaurant options nearby. The decoration is very nice and the hotel is well maintained and extremely clean. The staff is very welcoming and extremely helpful. ","annotations":[]}
