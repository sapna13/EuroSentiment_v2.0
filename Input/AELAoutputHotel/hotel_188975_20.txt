{"text":"Excellent, but not best in the world for me This is a beautiful hotel with great service, so I do think it deserves a five star rating. I had read so many great reviews of the hotel, that maybe I was setting myself up for disappointment!! I was looking for the ultimate Paris hotel experience, but I'm not sure if I got it. I would definitely stay here again, but my next time in Paris, I might very well try something else.One of the high points of the hotel is its staff. They were generally really helpful and attempted to please. An example of this was the front desk manager. We had booked the top class of double room - the Premier (I think) at about $1500 per night. I was somewhat disappointed as this room was not even located in the hotel, but in adjoining building, connected to the hotel by a long hallway. I didn't feel that the room had a lot of character to it. It was perfectly nice, but just not really special.  I had stayed in the George V prior to it becoming a Four Seasons, and the room we had then had amazing decor, so the Four Seasons corportate look is a bit of a let-down. The front desk manager worked with us over several days to find a better room. Eventually we moved to a superior suite, which was an improvement, and located in the main hotel...although I still felt the decor was a bit lacking, and the suite only had one window for three rooms. Still, I appreciated the effort involved by the front desk manager, and he was a very nice guy.We had similar pleasing experiences with the concierge and the luggage porters.The gym is very nice and very well-equipped in quite a small space. There are two or three elliptical machines, three or four treadmills, and a rowing machine, as well as lots of weight machines and free weights. There are nicely chilled waters and cold scented towels which were very refreshing -- I loved the frangrance of the towels. The pool is nice, but very small, although in Paris, it is a surprise to have a pool at all. The location of the hotel is great, but I do agree with one of the other reviews that the Champs Elysees location is not my favorite. It has improved, I think over the years, and we ate at a number of the restaurants on the boulevard. We especially loved Laduree for breakfast, and Leon, for a great Belgian mussel dinner experience. With the euro exchange rate being what it was during our visit, I did feel that the hotel breakfast was quite highly priced and not worth it.I have stayed at a number of Four Seasons hotels, and I would rank the ones in Istanbul and Tokyo above this one, even though the Paris hotel is very good. Istanbul just had a lot more character -- for instance, canapes were delivered to our room in Istanbul every afternoon. It was wonderful, and the general decor of the rooms was better in my opinion. In Tokyo , the number of amenities in the room was unbelievable -- think combs, brushes, face blotting papers, pajamas, and elastic bands for your hair, and again, I thought the modern decor was memorable. Both the Istanbul and Tokyo properties have such a special flair about them. Apart from Four Seasons hotels, I would also rank a number of properties in Asia over this one....for instance, Raffles in Singapore, the Oriental in Bangkok, and even the Peninsula in Hong Kong deliver a better experience. The George V is great as well, but just failed to deliver that extra touch which really lives in the memory.
