{"text":"Wonderful Stay I had a very pleasant stay at the Courtyard Marriott. Though SF is known for its boutique hotels, I was skeptical of staying at an independent hotel after reading some of the reviews on here. I'm very pleased with my decision! Though a little pricier than other hotels, the extra money is worth it to be in a clean room and a great location. The lobby staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful (the concierge held my luggage while I went out for a meal and called me a car service when I left). I stayed in a queen room on the 12th floor, and my room was very spacious with an excellent view. I couldn't hear any street noise. The bed was really comfy (Courtyards are known for this!) and the shower pressure was great. My room was well-cleaned every day and new linens are always available upon request. Though there aren't many extra frills, I felt the Courtyard provided great value for the money.Best of all, the hotel is very conveniently located -- just a few blocks from public transport, and within walking distance of the SFMOMA, Yerba Buena Center, Ferry Building, cable cars, and lots of good shopping  restaurants.The only complaint I have is that they seemed to be doing work on the floor above me. After a delayed arrival late at night, I had been looking forward to sleeping in, but a loud banging noise woke me up at 9 am. However, this seemed to be an isolated incident, as it was only an issue for one morning, and the rest of my stay more than made up for this minor inconvenience. I would certainly recommend this hotel! ","annotations":[]}
