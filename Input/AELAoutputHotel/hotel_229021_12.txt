{"text":"Awesome Hotel, Great location I stayed at the Calzaiuoli Hotel last week for three nights and the hotel exceeded all my expectations. Its rated 3 stars, but I would venture to say that it should be more. The hotel is very clean and beautifuly decorated with marbel and nice finishes everywhere. It has a very knowlegable consierge and a door man to help any traveler. They are vey nice, they helped me book a tour with a third party company, and even though i did not have cash to pay for the tour, they took the reservation and let me pay later on once i stopped by an atm once it was convinient for me.The hotel is in what I would say is the very best location in the city and one could not ask for anything else. It is very centraly located with the train station a 10 minute walk, and the other plazas are within 2-3 minutes. Only downside is that the room was small, but clean and had an updated bathroom with marbel everywhere. The room did have very high ceiling, which helped if frrl a bt larger. Also, the room had AC, which was key to help with the early summer heat, and satelite dish TV. Breakfast buffet was good (eggs, bacon, juice, breads, coffe, etc) and included in the price.We booked the hotel the night before on the internet for ~$225\/night (about the same price other hotels listed on hotels.com for the same period) and could not have asked for anything better. We would reccomend this to anyone.
