{"text":"Great Stay in Boston We booked the Park Plaza for 3 nights over the 4th of July holiday. We chose the hotel because my wife had stayed there for business a year ago and knew it would be convenient for all of the sites we wanted to see in downtown Boston. It is close to Boston Common and has close subway access and is within walking distance (a few miles) of all the major attractions and historic sites.We booked a King Deluxe room which was a very large room - much bigger than the standard room my wife had stayed in previously and a very generous size for a downtown hotel. The room was very comfortable with new pillow top bedding and white linen bed covers, a desk and two armless chairs (I would have preferred a lounge chair as there was room) and a flat screen TV on top of a 6 drawer dresser. I believe this room had once been two smaller rooms as there were 2 bathrooms - one with a tub shower and one with a stall shower. However typical of downtown hotels both bathrooms were quite small with limited shelf space so having two made the small size workable. The shower bathroom lacked a niche for soap\/shampoo and the toilets in both bathrooms were packed in pretty tight quarters. The room was very clean and the hotel staff kept it that way throughout our stay with thorough and efficient service. We had a drink in the hotel bar and the prices were reasonable and the cocktails well made.Overall we found the hotel to be very convenient and a good value. We highly recommend it for people traveling to Boston to see the sites.
