{"text":"Most comfortable beds EVER! This is one of the best hotel stays I've ever had. Stayed here prior to a cruise after having travelled for almost 24 hours straight. The staff were friendly and helpful and allowed us to check in early. Free parking was nice. Yes, it is gated, but that made me feel like the car would be safe. Neighborhood wasn't bad at all. Rooms were obviously pretty new, clean and really nice. Good size too. The best thing was the amazingly comfortable beds. I don't sleep as well at home as I did there! For being SO close to the airport it was really quiet. Not much of a view of the lagoon, but that wasn't a big deal to me--it's an airport hotel. There aren't TOO many places to eat nearby--a Burger King and grocery store across the street and a few small Cuban cafes, but that's about it. Gas station with a store and pharmacy across the street were convenient as well. The hotel's complimentary breakfast is great! Hot food (sausage biscuits and gravy and eggs when I was there) as well as fruit, cereal, yogurt, pastries, many different breads\/bagels\/muffins, hot and cold drinks was served in a nice area with plenty of seating. I was there 30 minutes before the end of breakfast and there was still more than enough food left. They have a business center with free internet for checking e-mail and flight info. They have a small store on sight with snacks and necessities as well. Pool and hot tub area were a bit small, but looked nice and well kept--didn't get a chance to use it because it was raining. Would definitely stay here again if I have the opportunity.
