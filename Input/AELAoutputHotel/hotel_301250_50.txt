{"text":"A solid 4 star I know this hotel gets rave reviews. This is not one of them. This is a four star hotel masquerading as a five star hotel. The difference between a club room here on a Saturday night and a room at the Park Hyatt was about $50-100 and there is no comparison. The room is not in same class as the Park Hyatt and was frankly a disappointment for the money. It was on the small side and in terms of style; more department store catalogue rather than a designer experience.The staff at the Cerulean are obviously trained to be attentive, however, it can become a bit too much. They were all lovely but such enthusiasm at breakfast! The club breakfast was served in the signature dining room with a sensational view and it was very good. But a formally served five course breakfast is a bit like the enthusiasm, a bit much first thing in the morning. Wonderful coffee was a big plus. You can opt for a continental breakfast at the club, but the selection is ridiculously meagre.The club cocktail hour was very light on too, the club area was small and the standard range of hors d'oeuvre was so poor as to be laughable. It is not comparable to the normal Club lounge scenario, however again the view is wonderful.The location is good for this side of Tokyo so if you really want to stay in Shibuya then I suggest you take a standard room and skip the extra expense of a Club Room.. I suspect all rooms are identical to the club rooms but others are on a lower level of the hotel.. The lobby was full on, always full and bustling. Some people may like that, but it felt like the rest of Shibuya, packed and trendy. It was no retreat from the outside world.Yep, after three days the Cerulean made me finally feel my age. I probably resent that but what I resent more is paying for 5 stars and getting a good solid four star experience with a few flourishes around the edges.The Cerulean is a hotel that really tries to be more than it is.The Park Hyatt or Mandarin Oriental are in a different class.
