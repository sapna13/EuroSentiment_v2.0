{"text":"Save your money!!! Natura Park, Punta Cana, Dominican Republic...41\/2 * to 5 * ???Date: Dec 22 to Dec 28\/06Reviewer: We're just a couple who want to save you some grief and hard earned money!What a nightmare this trip was...here is why:1st night NO AIRCONDITONING  our fridge was LOCKED in our room which holds our free beer and soft drinks plus other items you can pay for which we didn't do. They didn't open our fridge for 3 days...which cost us precious time away from the beach to constantly check up on this complaint. Then we expierenced NO HOT WATER one morning and STILL A LOCKED FRIDGE!Our Christmas dinner they served was horrible. We had reservations for 7 and we still didn't have all the courses served to us by 9 pm. One of the dishes were lobster, which I couldn't eat because of allergies and there was no substitute and others said it was smothered in mayo and cold, and tasted like crayfish! We then were served a broth that smelled terrible and I couldn't stand the smell of it never mind the taste of it. They sereved us a 1\/2 of a frozen lime filled with sorbet that melted by the time we got it. The main course was suppossably turkey, but I've tasted better and played it safe and only ate my vegies. We left then not waiting for dessert and hoping to eat something at the buffet ...wrong again...this area was also transformed into the Christmas a la carte restaruant...and if you didn't make reservations like an oriental couple, you just DIDN'T GET TO EAT ANYTHING!The pool, and only 1 pool with no hot tub, only whirlpool with 1\/2 the jets working was disgusting. Never looked after it and it was filthy dirty with hair, sunscreen and other nastys floating about it.There was never anything opened to snack on when we wanted to. I didn't appreciate that there were time limits on when to snack...never opened late enough.Drinks were weak and we always had to double up on the shots and they didn' t serve any dirnks in fancy p'apples or coconuts done up...just plain old glasses.No one smiled, and if they did, it wasn't often. You NEVER heard any of the staff wish people a Merry Christmas unless I said it first? No one sang or looked happy or made us feel happy for being there.The front desk was always in chaos! There isn't a proper manager there to deal with the complaints from the people. They always said to us, we'll write it down and let the manager know OR we'll take care if it in 5 min which is 2 - 3 hours there time or NEVER!...our rep. Julo, was a joke, he only came to our resort from 4:30 till 5:30 - 1 hr each day! No backbone on him. He was bomb barded with complaints  hassels from other tourists, I felt sorry for him. Get another job! The hotel was overbooked too so none of us could pay for a later extention on our rooms as we weren't leaving until 7:10 pm the next night. There was NOTHING they ever did to take control of a situation to make it better. All empty words of comfort and we picked up on that quickly as did others.My husband was so angry and upset at our situation that when we talked again to our rep, who could do NOTHING for us, became so sick and had to walk away from him before he would hit him! His last night there was spent in bed popping pills for his head and stomach and couldn't wait to get out of there. Our vacation was a nightmare and a waste of our hard earned money.I suppose if I had to say just one good thing about this place it would have to be that the sun was out everyday and the ocean was warm...but the beach\/sand was always dirty with the ocean wash up...not like what you see on the pictures on line.WE'RE GLAD WE'RE HOME...SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!
