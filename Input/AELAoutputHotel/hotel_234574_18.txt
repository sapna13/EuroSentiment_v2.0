{"text":"What I had expected, no problems at all My colleague booked this hotel for me for a business trip, and initially I was pleased, then worried when I read some of the other reviews!However, armed with a few handy hints from other reviewers, I asked for a room on one of the upper floors to avoid the traffic and subway noise. I got room 603. I did hear the subway when I was in the restaurant (in the basement), but I have to say I didn't notice it at all otherwise.The room was pleasant enough with a nice bath and powerful shower and a comfortable bed, although the headboard was fre-standing which meant it kept banging against next doors wall when you got into bed. A quick towel over the top and it was sorted.The English language TV stations were a bit sparse, with only CNN and MTV really useable. Be warned that if you attempt to find them by scrolling up through the list of channels, you'll find the adult channels first, so if you have kids be careful! The channel cuts off after a few seconds and asks for a PIN, so it's not too bad.There *is* air conditioning in the room, but as others have mentioned it is switched off out of season. I tried it anyway, and it blew slightly warm air in, so I shut it off and opened the window!Quite a few power slots available in the room, which was useful for me wih my laptop. The wireless internet service was excellent, and there is an ethernet port in your room if you don't have wireless.I tried the breakfast one morning, and others were right. It *is* overpriced for what it is, but it's optional so you don't have to pay for it. There is a lovely Cappucino bar about 30 yards up the road which will sort you out in the morning for about half the price.Room service was fast and efficient, and the food was very nice.There's a mini bar in your room and it's not locked, so my advice would be to go to the Spar type show a few doors down and get your drinks from there, then put them in the fridge!Evening meals wise, there is a fantastic Tapas bar across the road in the precinct. On the other hand, if you turn left then left again from the hotel, you are less than 5 minutes walk from La Rambla, which has everything you could need (drunk British tourists too in the summer).So given the few niggles, why 4 out of 5? Because it's really not that bad. Yes it's certainly not a 4 star hotel by UK standards, but then I never expected it to be. As a general rule, I subtract one star from *any* Spanish hotel's rating, and it was certainly a good enough UK 3 star hotel. The staff were all polite, smartly dressed and efficient. The location is pretty ideal. I was there on business and it was more than enough for my needs.
