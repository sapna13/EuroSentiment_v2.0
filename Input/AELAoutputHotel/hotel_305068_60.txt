{"text":"Best hotel in the world?! I have stayed here on business a number of times over the last few years (before their rates and my travel budget fell out!) and i have always been very impressed. So much so that I even book it for our honeymoon and it didn't disappoint. My wife was blown away by the place and it was perfect for the 3 days we spend in Hong Kong.The restaurants in the place are amazing, Spoon and Nobu in particular are probably 2 of the best restaurants in the world let alone Hong Kong. The breakfast buffet is also amazing with a ridiculous amount of choice that caters for worldwide tastes.The rooms are very well appointed with large flat screen tv's, ipod docks, Bose sound systems, Wifi and one of the most comfortable beds I have ever slept in. They are also on the whole very spacious particular if you go for the junior suite with dressing room! If your budget can stretch to it go for a harbor view room - what a view - it has to be one of the best in Hong Kong and for a city renowned for its views thats saying something.The location is also good, just a short walk to the star ferry in Kowloon. One of the real highlights has to be the pools. 2 infinity pool (at bath temperature) offer great views out over the harbor - the perfect place for an evening beer!Would i recommend it? Definitely, without a doubt. ","annotations":[]}
