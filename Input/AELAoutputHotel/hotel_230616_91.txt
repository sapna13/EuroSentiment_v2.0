{"text":"Extremely Overpriced! Not Worth the Money! I booked this hotel after reading the positive reviews on TripAdvisor. Apparently, most people don't mind paying through the nose for a less-than-mediocre hotel. I stayed for 3 nights in May. I booked a double deluxe room with canal view for over $350\/night and I thought I'd be getting my money's worth. What a disappointment! This hotel is nothing more than a Holiday-Inn type chain. The room was really tiny and had cheap stucco-type walls and ceilings. The hotel says it's different because it includes drinks and snacks--this is their gimmick to justify charging such high rates. Your mini-bar is stocked with cans of soda, a couple of waters and some mini bottles of really bad wine. In the lobby you can get more soda and coffee, and... mini Mars bars and other assorted candies. In the afternoons they put out small amounts of bread and butter w\/ a very limited amount of cold cuts, which are not replenished when finished. My point is: if their free drinks and snacks feature is supposed to justify their high rates---it's absurd.About the view: I had to stand on my toes to peer out the window and see the canal. Service was standard, and the staff is trained to repeatedly ask you how you are and how your day went EVERYTIME you exit and enter the building.They also ask for a tip when your bill is printed out--there's a blank tip amount line when you sign your bill upon check-out.Overall--no charm, cheaply decorated, tiny rooms, intrusive service--NOT WORTH over $300\/night. You'd do better to book a bed  breakfast on the canal and get your money's worth.
