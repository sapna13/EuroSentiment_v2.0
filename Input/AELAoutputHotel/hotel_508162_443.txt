{"text":"We all loved it Our family spent five nights at Dreams (March 20-25) and really loved it. It exceeded our expectations. We were treated to wonderful weather, terrific hospitality, and comfort and a festive feel throughout. We would have loved a few more days at Dreams.Our family suite of two adjoining rooms was perfect for a family traveling with two children. Our room was updated and spotless. We spent our days moving between the fabulous pool and beach, and were able to find seats at both. The ocean was closed for a few days for what was said to be unusually rough conditions. I loved the stretch and aerobics classes on the beach, as well as the afternoon step aerobics class on the deck (get there early if you want to get a step and don't forget your exercise shoes). My kids loved the batting cage, soccer goals, games and activities along the beach, and enjoyed the paella making contest! They loved collecting the resort money every time they participated in an activity, but were disappointed with how difficult it was to spend the money at the evening auctions. I think it would make more sense for the resort to offer less combination packages of prizes and more individual prizes that were kid friendly (less rum!!) so that people could actually spend the resort money.As for the food, we especially enjoyed breakfast in the World Cafe. The fresh-squeezed juices and smoothie bar are to die for! The kids figured out that they could get little pizzas to go at lunch time, and brought them out to the pool. The Seaside Grill also let you do take out if you don't want to eat your lunch in the lovely open-air restaurant just right by the pool. I didn't find the dinners at the specialty restaurants to be as good, but they were still fun. It was somewhat competitive to eat at the Japanese restaurant, but it seems like they are trying to get a better system in place. The Mexican restaurant often has strolling musicians which is fun. The only complaint I had is that there is no brewed decaf coffee anywhere in the resort, just Nescafe crystals (yuck!)My kids loved the entertainment staff. They were so much fun and always smiling. The music at the dance classes was great. The staff definitely adds so much to the festive feel of the place.Contrary to other reports, we didn't find there to be any lines of any significance at the bars and had no trouble with coral in the water (it was completely smooth). The only other tip I would give is to bring conditioner. The hotel doesn't supply it.Enjoy your trip. You will love it.
