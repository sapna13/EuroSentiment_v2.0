{"text":"Terribly Over Rated We just returned from a 2 week stay Dec 19-Jan 2. We had stayed here in Feb 06 (was Punta Cana Grand then) and thought it was great. I can't believe a resort could go so far downhill in that short a time!Checkin took forever. Very slow, inefficient and unorganized. The little drink they give you while waiting doesn't help when it is midnight and you have been in line for an hour!Had to change rooms 4 times to get satisfactory room. One neither door would lock.The hall door had been kicked in and night lock hanging by screws, patio door wouldn't lock.Toilet wouldn't flush, phone didn't work, etc....Other room had not been cleaned (and by now it is 1 am) The food is terrible. At the buffet the only way to get hot food was the pasta bar or cooking station. Only overhead light bulbs keeping other food warm. Last day there saw ants all over the fruit, and a yellow coloured fly came out of a sweet roll I was eating. Friends saw a cockroach going across the floor. Service in buffet excellent but does not make up for quality of food. DiMarios was so bad we walked out and left food on table.Ceasar salad tasted like it had been cooked in fish.Tex Mex restaurant really good but you can only eat at each a la carte once a week.Christmas and New Years were done very well, but food quality a real issue.Adult pool is not maintained that way. One day there was 6 little kids in the jacuzzi that we asked to leave. their parents were very upset. Two other times we told kids they had to leave. The staff does nothing about it. This is also supposed to be the only area where topless is allowed, but not the case. Around the main pool, and on the beach, once again not supervised by the staff.Booked a trip to Higuey that was supposed to be shopping at a market, visit a cathederal, tobacco place and a Dominican lunch. Our driver spoke no English, took us to the church and said there you go, took us to one shop where he was angry we didn't buy anything (it was too expensive) then took us to a supermarket. (we didn't really need any groceries)Then he took us back to the hotel. That trip was $60US a person.We booked a trip to go on speedboats ($75 US a person) but they never came to get us as the Sunwing rep wrote down the wrong time. He wrote 12:25 am not pm. Logic would think that no one is going out in speedboats at midnight! Rep was MIA for 2 days. We got oyr refund as we were getting on the bus to airport (after many calls)Pool is clean and good temp.Beach is nice except for the seaweed. They clean it up once a day but needs done more often as there is a lot of it.This was one of our worst vacations ever. It also rained for 5 days (that's the chance you take!) which didn't help!We were so dissapointed as we had such a good time when here before.Would never go back. This is rated 4 star and 5 star (depending on the company) but is barely a 3.
