{"text":"Fantastic Hotel I have never been to Amsterdam before  researched  asked many questions on Trip Adviser before coming to Amsterdam. Prins Hendrik was recommended to me.We arrived later than expected due to a delayed flight  also we got on the wrong train from the Airport to Central Station. (Therefore didn;t arrive till after 11pm) Prins Hendrik is literaclly a 5 minute walk from Central Station  very easy to find.When I first saw the hotel, I thought it would be very noisy, but far from it, there was no noise at all. Mattijs greeted us in reception  advised us on where to go straight away if we fancied going out. Which we did.The hotel room was huge, very spacious with plenty of storage space in the room for our belongings. The beds were very comfortable with very large comfy pillows.Breakfast is served in the morning until 10am. There was a good choice for a continental breakfast, fortunately I bought some Tetley teabags with me, as I didn't like the tea, but that is just my taste.The hotel is fantastically situated near everything you would want to do  see.When I arrived at the hotel, I mentioned that the hotel was recommended to me from someone from TripAdviser  Mattijs made us most welcome, searched on the internet for restaurants for us, advised on the best places to go, it was a very nice personal touch.I can't wait to re-vist Amsterdam, but will only stay at Prins Hendrik.The best hotel, with the best Service  the Best reception staff - Sante (Cheers) Mattijs. x x x ","annotations":[{"endOffset":970,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":967},{"endOffset":970,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":967}]}
