{"text":"This Place Is A Joke... This place is a beautiful place run by misfits. Where do I begin. While waiting approx. 45 minutes to check in - one desk person for 30 hot, sweaty people waiting to check in - guests already staying there came in to complain they had been robbed. Another couple complained that they saw one of the maids wearing a necklace that belonged to the guys wife! Shoddy construction done in their remodel - case in point where the tile meets the carpet we stepped on the tacks holding the carpet down - ouch! The room had not been cleaned. We didn't get the king size bed that we had booked more than 3 months in advance! We were paying $500.00 per night and we were told sorry you can't use the infiniti pool because you're not staying on that side fo the hotel! Are you kidding me? I asked the mgr. about this and his response was essentailly yeah - tough luck - you can't use it! I asked him why it's on their website - and a glazed look came over him as he couldn't answer it. What pathetic customer service! The mgr. should be working at Toll Booth. My apologies to the other professional tool booth collectors. in conclusion please don't stay here. save yourself some money and heartache and find another place and If you go down here sleep with one eye open and screw or nail down everything in your room if you if you leave for any period of time cause chances are it may not be back when you return...
