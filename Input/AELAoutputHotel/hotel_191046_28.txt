{"text":"Lovely stay. Good value for the money. Recommended! We had a great time during our stay at Rivoli Ramblas.For the price, you get a very reasonably sized room (I might even call it large, by European standards) that had tasteful, contemporary decor. The location is especially marvelous (right on Las Ramblas, close to Placa de Catalyuna and the airport buses)! We were not even bothered by any noise from the street (though we're from NYC). Room was clean and the only slight drawbacks are that (1) the hotel is actually two buildings connected together, such that one side of the hotel is a little inconvenient to get to (5-6 steps up\/down once off the elevators) if you have heavy bags or a wheelchair and (2) you can hear the scraping of chairs against the floors both above and below your hotel room. But there aren't tons of people hanging out in the bar downstairs, so it was not a huge distraction for us during this stay. BATHROOM DETAILS: We had a gigantic tub, good water pressure in the shower (though no door or curtain, so that room can get a bit wet post-bathing), bidet, toilet and sink with large surface vanity area.ROOM DETAILS: Beds were reasonably sized (wide twins; our king bed was two wide twins pushed together), though there were not many blankets for a room that can get quite chilly with the AC running. There was a mini fridge and I think an electric kettle for tea would have made it perfect. Large windows that faced onto Las Ramblas with electronic shades for keeping out the noonday sun during siesta.I'd definitely stay here again the next time I visit Barcelona and would certainly recommend it for travellers who want a nice room without a high price tag. It is not a budget hotel nor is it a luxury hotel. And it is not faux-contemporary, either -- it is *actually* contemporary in some rooms and our room, one of the ones recently renovated, was great.
