{"text":"A Jewel in Florence My sisters and I have just returned from a four day visit to Florence. Having searched the internet for a reasonably priced, well located hotel we decided upon La Scaletta. For exploring Florence, we could not have chosen better! Situated only a few footsteps away from the Ponte Vecchio and Pitti Palace in a quieter area of the city, the hotel was conveniently positioned for all the sights. The bedroom (triple room) was large, and the beds extremely comfortable, with a large ensuite shower room - our only disappointment was that the room did not have tea\/coffee making facilities - but perhaps this is not 'standard' in Italy? If you enjoy a substantial breakfast to set you up for the day be prepared 'eat out' as this was a very minimal, unappetising affair : ham, cheese, pre-packed croissant, machine tea and 'flask' coffee. Tables were not fully set and the waiting staff unwelcoming. Be aware that the hotel operates strict breakfast times (7.30-9.30) and if you arrive at 9.25 you will not be allowed to eat! (Tea\/juice machines were switched off, coffee pot and food removed!!) Prior to our visit, I liaised via email with the hotel and found them to be extremely helpful - unfortunately, on arrival, we found only one female member of staff to be welcoming (and she was always very friendly and helpful, with excellent use of English). However, do not let this put you off of staying at the hotel - we only wanted to use it as a base and it's worth it for the outstanding views from the hotel's two rooftop terraces. Wow! What views! Absolutely breathtaking (a rooftop view of Florence including the Duomo, Pitti Palace, Boboli Gardens, etc) - if you only visit to sit on the terrace, do it! We would love to revisit Florence and wouldn't hesitate to stay at La Scaletta purely because of its convenience and stunning vistas. If you have difficulty with stairs, then be warned - if the lift is out of action there are 94 steps to climb and, once in reception, some of the rooms are down a very steep set of stairs (not easily negotiated with suitcases!) All in all a great time was had in Florence and we all slept soundly on very comfortable beds! We would definitely return to the hotel, despite our few 'niggles'.P.S. If you get a chance, take the bus to Fiesole - a beautiful hilltop village with amphitheatre and, again, magnificent views.
