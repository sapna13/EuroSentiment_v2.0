{"text":"Choose another resort The pros: the beach and ocean are beautiful. The grounds were quite lovely. The rooms aren't bad--and we really found the bed comfortable. There are plenty of pools. And since we went to relax and lay on the beach and just chill out, it was a nice vacation. However, this resort is really only average. By NO means a 3+ star resort. The cons: the food was very mediocre. The drinks, although plentiful are also mediocre at best. For non beer drinkers, there were sad choices considering they don't use real fruit juice--which was strange. They ration towels. You never knew from one day to the next how many fresh towels you would get...and regardless of the daily tip I left for the maid, we never received a wash cloth again after the second day. The worst part, was the never knowing when we would have running water in the room. There were times there was not enough water to flush the toilet. And for quite a few hours every morning and evening, there would not be enough water to make the shower run. So, be careful making reservations at the specialty restaurants, becuase you very well may not be able to shower in enough time to make them. I would avoid wasting money at this resport's spa. My husband had the weakest deep tissue massage possible, and I paid for an 80 minute massage where I was left laying in the room alone for about 20 of those minutes. It is a major rip off. The scuba diving was only average and we were not crazy about the dive operation. It was on par with the rest of the resort--pretty average. And unless you like to be severely reprimanded publicly, never confess to keeping your pool towels over night. The woman who works the pool towel hut, we lovingly dubbed her the towel tyrant, is adamant about towels being returned by 6 pm EVERY night. Otherwise you get a good public tongue lashing and raging bad attitude. Overall, if you go in with low expectations and just want a nice beach for a reasonable price, it is fine. However, as much as we loved the beach and would probably go back to Punta Cana again, we will NOT stay at this resort.
