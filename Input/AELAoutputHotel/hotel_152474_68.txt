{"text":"Great value for money! My husband and I wanted to stay in Mexico City without spending a lot on a room, while also making sure that the place we stayed at would be clean and convenient. We booked a room at the Hotel Catedral in Mexico City based on the reviews on tripadvisor and I must say that this turned out to be an excellent decision. The room was super clean--you'd probably pay double for a similar room in the US--and the bathroom was very well maintained, the tub et al being sparkling clean. When we had a slight problem in the bathroom, the maintenence person came up within minutes to fix it. There was no air-conditioning in the room; however, we did not feel the need for anything other than the fan which, along with the pleasant night-time temperature, proved more than adequate. The staff is very helpful and it was comforting to come back to a nice clean room at the end of a long day of sight-seeing.We did make sure that we asked for a room away from the noise, as other reviews on the site had suggested; we were certainly not kept up by the noise in the room that we were in. Location-wise, the Zocalo metro station is a short walk away, and there are plenty of restaurants around, including vegetarian ones. Although we did not stay out very late, there was plenty of activity on the road itself until about 9:30 p.m.If you are a budget traveler who is looking for good no-frills accommodation at a very reasonable price, I would strongly recommend this hotel.
