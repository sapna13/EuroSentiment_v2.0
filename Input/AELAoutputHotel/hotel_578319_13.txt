{"text":"Just OK My friend and I stayed here 4 nights en route to another island. I cannot see what the buzz is about. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ëeluxe√à√\u2020\u2022?room was very small...NYC small. We could barely fit our luggage in the room. From what I could tell they have two types of deluxe rooms. One is the size of the regular rooms (small) with the added outdoor shower and one was a little bigger and also had the shower. I was told all deluxe rooms are on the ground floor which means zero privacy and zero sunlight because you have to keep your shade down all day - the pool and the people are literally a few feet from your door most of the day. If I went back I would not pay extra for a deluxe room. The open air shower in the back really isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ as great as it sounds. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ covered so you can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ see the stars at night so why shower outside in the humidity? Plus there is no lock on the door from the bathroom to the outside shower. Although covered, it could easily be broken into.Cons: The bathroom shower was dingy and gross despite the cute tiles. However, it was big and did work. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºafe√à√\u2020\u2022?in the room was a joke because you are given the code by the person showing you your room. You cannot change it. The pool was crowded all day and you had to put your junk on a lounger to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªeserve√à√\u2020\u2022?it very early in the morning as there were not many and lots of people who wanted them. The pool area was crowded most of the day with groups of young Australians - like college age -who all smoked. It was a kind of a party hotel and atmosphere. Fine if that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what you want. The entire staff was very young, all under 23 which did not lend itself to a professional atmosphere.Pros: The courtyard and pool were pretty. Locations was pretty good. AC worked well in the room. Hardly any bugs. The cafe was OK. There was a mini-market and ATM super close.The hotel was fine for our purposes but definitely nothing special. I would not stay here again and would try someplace else next time.
