{"text":"Loved the line restaurant but annoyed about a late\/wrong minibar charge First hotel in our honeymoon as a 2 night stopover to Australia. Great welcome and check in, very helpful in cutting the lock on our case after we lost our key. We stayed in the Garden wing, think slightly bigger room and lots of greenery on balcony etc.HighlightsGood welcome on arrivalBed was really really comfortable - slept really wellElectric curtains (unnecessary but felt really special)We got a membership card which gave us half price on breakfast in the line (buffet restaurant).The line was a really great buffet breakfast (best we had on our trip) - great fruit selection but loads of great choice , really modern look and feel and as we grazed we could watch the staff preparing pasta.Didn't feel too business orientedLowlightsOn getting home we were charged a late charge for whisky from the minibar after we left but given we don't drink whisky definitely not us but unnecessary hassle and not what we wantedUninspiring viewsRoom was good size and no issues with it (other than seeing a few ants in the room) but does look a bit dated compared to other more modern hotelsRained most of the time we were there (hotel provided umbrella in the room). Did a day tour but didn't feel there was that much to see\/do (took a picture of the merlion, saw a temple, some botanical gardens and a factory), so probably worth looking at prebooking a trip to sentosa island before you go.
