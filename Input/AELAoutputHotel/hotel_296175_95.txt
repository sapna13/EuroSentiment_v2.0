{"text":"It's a Gem We stayed at the Davantzi in late August and thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel in downtown Florence. It's within walking distance to all the major sites. We booked directly several months prior to our arrival and during that time had numerous emails w\/ Fabrizio and Tommaso regarding our accomodations and booking of museum times. They were both always very prompt in responding to emails and arranged the bookings as requested. Our room was clean and cozy. We booked a single room double bed which was great though just a bit small. The laptop and internet access in the room is a plus. We enjoyed the dining area in the morning for a quick breakfast and cappucino. Also enjoyed the ambiance at night at the hotel with the dim lights, and music playing in the dining area. The hotel is very cozy and has more a feeling of a bed and breakfast than a hotel. Fabrizio made a couple of excellent recommendations to us for restaurants including the Marionne Restaurant (also recommended in Rick Steve's Guide) which was authentic, basic Italian staples and LaBarrola which was near the hotel and had great pizza. The only negative I can think of is that at least in the room we stayed, the walls seemed paper thin as we could hear guests in the room next to us talking in the middle of the night but it was not a major problem. We are planning to return to Florence and would definitely stay here again.
