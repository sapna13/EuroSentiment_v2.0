{"text":"Was really good. Well, where do i start. Myself and my girl friend stayed at the bavaro princess from Jan 12 to 19. We did everything online and flew out of Toronto. The flight was good, about 4 hours. We flew into Santo Domingo.From there it was about a 3 Hr bus trip from the airport to our hotel. This was ok because we ended up saving about 1600 dollars by doing last minute and flying into Santa Damingo and not Puta Cana. I would suggest to all if you dont mind seeing some of the country side save your money. We arrived at our hotel about 230 am. When we checked in we payed for a suite but they gave us a Junior suite. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU PAY THE EXTRA 100 DOLLARS AND UPGRADE FROM A JUNIOR SUITE TO A SUITE. The junior suite that they gave us was very damp and musty. It smelled like smoke. The lamp didnt work and the door would not open to the patio. I went down to the front desk and talked to Alfrado. He was very good and told us that he could give us a diffrent room in the morning. We slept there only because it was now about 330 am. The next day Alfrado had a new room for us. The room they gave us was 3226 if i am not mistaken. This room is about a 30 min walk to the beach. He gave us room 302. This room was 3 min to the beach and from our patio we could see the ocean. So as far as rooms go make sure when you check in you get the right room the first time. The maids are great there and look after you very well. The only down fall when it comes to rooms is the plumbing is not very good so the toilet backed up a few times. Not a really big deal but they dont have plungers in the rooms so you have to wait for house keeping to come with one. I would suggest by a small one at Canadian Tire and bring it with you just in case.The food and entertianment was really good. Myself and my girlfriend are picky eaters so we really didnt try alot but had enough to keep us full for a week. The beach and grounds of the resort were unbelievable. We have been to Cuba and the sand there was really white and also hot. The sand here was nice but not as hot as Cuba. The drinks are very strong which was great for myself. We watched 3 weddings in one day and all were really nice. If you want endless spots to take wedding pictures this is the resort to go to. This was a really big resort and had a lot of birds and wildlife write on the resort. I think that this resort would also be great for kids because from what we saw you would have no problem keeping them busy. There was lots of things to do and the pools all seemed to be great. Again i would have to say that we would go back again very soon. The weather was between 28 and 30 degress all week. I hope this helps most people that read it.
