{"text":"Totally Pleased (which can be hard to do!) I have been checking out reviews of the Excellence since February and was truly expecting just an okay week. Nothing bad but probably nothing great either. Boy was I wrong!!!I am probably one of the most picky, hard to please people that probably shouldn't even do all inclusive places, but here I was trying the Excellence Punta Cana. When I tell you I literally couldn't find anything wrong with it...I really couldn't. My fiance was joking that I was upset that I had nothing to complain about.The service was top notch, the rooms clean and beautiful. Pool and ocean clean and well kept around the area. Drinks were plentiful and I never had to wait for anything. It really was a magical week and I could not get over that this was an all inclusive place. No fuss over stupid beach or pool seats either which always drives me crazy in other places as well. Plenty of towels and seats for late birds like us!The meals (although I knew to lower my standards somewhat) was really wonderful. I really could find something to eat at every meal and at every restaurant. Thinking I was just going to be shuffling from one crappy buffet to another all week..no we weren't. The restaurants were very nice, without having to make annoying reservations I might add and I left each night feeling like I just dined somewhere special. Even lunches if you wanted could be ordered right from a menu if you didn't feel like doing the buffet. Even room service was an option at any time of the day, but we never did try that.Our plan really was to just relax all week but if you want to be on the go, there seemed to be things going on at all times of the day and night.I could go on and on...but in my opinion just book this place. You won't be sorry. You may not love it like I did, but you aren't going to be wishing that you were home either.It was fantastic and I cannot wait to go back or try their other resorts in Mexico or Jamaica!
