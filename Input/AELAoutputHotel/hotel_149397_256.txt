{"text":"Great Place, but I have been to the DR 5 times, but, this was the first time at the Bavarro Princess. The rooms were very nice, I would have preferred the air conditioning to be a little cooler, but, it was certainly liveable. As you have probably read, the water pressure in the showers drops considerably during the getting ready for dinner hours, about 4-7 P.M., but, again, you can get by. The food in the various restaurants was very good, but, even in 1 of the brand new restaurants, El Gaucho, the steak place, there is no air conditioning, a little hot. The new breakfast and lunch buffet, on the beach, is nice, but, again, no air conditioning. The employees are very nice and, if you can speak some Spanish to them, they really open up, after all, you are in their country. I know this place is an all-inclusive, but, please, give some thought to bringing a bunch of 1 dollar bills with you and tip the staff if they do a nice job, it's only a dollar to us, but, you will light up their faces with a dollar here and there, they are very appreciative. Also, please don't forget the ground staff, they work extremely hard and very long hours and don't have the normal opportunity of receiving any extra tips, just a dollar or two to show your appreciation for keeping the hotel clean and enjoyable. Also, if you think of it, a nice gift for the maid, shampoo, conditioner, skin lotions, scented candles and, if you have the room, some school supplies for the kids, copy books, pencils, notepads, coloring books, crayons, etc. are very much needed and appreciated. This is a very large complex, 98 acres and they do have tram cars to transport you around. Overall, this is a beautiful place, the food was good, the staff excellent, but, the lack of air conditioned restaurants would probably keep me from returning to the Bavaro Princess, it is very hot and humid. For breakfast it wasn't that big a deal, but, when you dress up for dinner, men must wear long pants and collared shirts in the restaurants, not the buffets, it's not very pleasant sitting there trying to eat while you are sweating your --- off. So, if you don't mind the heat and humidity, while eating, this is the place for you.
