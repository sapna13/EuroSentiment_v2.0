{"text":"Clean, friendly  July 8,2006 2 weeks in beautiful Punta Cana. The resort is kept immaculate. Of course all the workers are friendly  helpful, expecially Carlos one of the animators, he always came over to say hello and to ask about our daughter who he included in all the games and shows. (She is 17). The best thing was eating at the specialty restaurants. You need to make a reservation in the morning, but it never costs you extra and you can go to the other resorts as well. Book early (8:00am) We always ate at 6:30 and were usually the only ones in the restaurant until 8:00pm. TEX MEX Grill ...Awesome! Mama Mia.....great pizza  lasagna  soups. Tipping is always enjoyable for us so we bring $150.00 in $1 US bills and tip everyone from the conceirge, maid, porter, bar tender, lady who comes around with coffee at breakfast etc. We also bring old clothes, toys, candy, toiletries, medical supplies and make-up to give to the people who work at the hotel. They truly appreciate it and always give us special attention. Everything about the hotel was great. We never had to put towels on a chair to reserve a spot, there are plenty at the beach and the pool. It is great to have the trolley to take you around the 3 properties even if you just go for a ride after dinner.Beautiful spot for a Wedding if your looking they have it right on the beach in a Gazebo with palm covered arches leading the way with flowers and covered chairs with bows. The bride is brought in on a horse drawn large white carriage. No Complaints.
