{"text":"Just plain awesome. I've been to Paris about 15-20 times and have stayed at a variety of 4 to 5 star hotels. This is one of the very best experiences. We stayed in one of the deluxe rooms on the Romance Package. I'll start with the one and only negative. The view from our room was of the adjacent building's wall and roof. Now on to the good stuff. The staff was uniformly excellent, professional and helpful. No separate concierge, but each member of the front desk was able to help with any arrangements necessary. Particularly good was Jenny. The room was lovely, good linens, nice marble bathroom, beautiful original beamed ceilings and brick columns. All done in a lovely classic, traditional style. Lovely sitting area as well.Romance package came with great extras, two tickets to the Louvre (although we didn't use them as we used a Carte Rouge), two tickets to a Seine cruise, classical music concert tickets for two at a local church, champagne, roses, etc. The location of the hotel is outstanding, so close to the heart of St. Germain, yet steps from the Pont Neuf and therefore, a stone's throw from St. Chappelle, Notre Dame, the Louvre, Musee d'Orsay, etc. The hotel is definitely the best 4 star hotel I've ever stayed at in Paris. How does it rate against some of the 5 star hotels? Pretty well as well. Sure, it doesn't drip with the luxury of the Crillon, the Bristol, or the Meurice, but it also doesn't come with the attitude either. And still nothing compares to the George V. But for the money, this may be as good as it gets in Paris.A couple restaurant recommendations... My wife and I fancy ourselves a bit of foodies, and we've dined at some of the best that Paris has to offer. We did not dine at any of the temples of haute cuisine on this occasion, as it was more of a casual trip. But Parisien bistros can of course offer some incredible dining as well. La Maison du Jardin close to the Jardin de Luxemburg was lovely and a tremendous value. Au Moulin a Vent in the 5th arrondissement serves some outstanding food, great chateaubriand, escargot, and grenouille.
