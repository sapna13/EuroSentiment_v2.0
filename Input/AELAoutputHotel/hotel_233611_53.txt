{"text":"If you want a Paris hotel that feels Parisian... I booked a double room at the hotel Langlois after reading positive reviews on Trip Advisor, and on the whole, was pretty pleased with what we got. Our room (31) was big, with a large bathroom, and while the decor erred on the vintage side of chic, the old furnishings gave the place a great deal of character, often missing from anonymous city hotels. Big double bed (but small pillows), lots of hot water, TV, wardrobe - and we didn't have a problem with noise from other rooms at all. And as other reviews have mentioned, the old-fashioned lift and the helpful French staff make it a characteristically Parisian experience.Location is very good, about 2 minutes' walk from Trinite metro station, and the Metro itself is as easy to navigate as the London underground. Montmartre is just a few stops north, and it takes no time to get to the major central attractions. We skipped breakfast in the hotel in favour of nearby cafes or boulangeries, of which there are plenty. Downsides? Make sure you bring your own toiletries, or buy some from the Monoprix nearby: the soaps and shampoo sachets are really horrible, stingy offerings, and there's not even a facecloth. Our room was freshly cleaned when we arrived, but it did smell very pungently of fragranced cleaning products, to the point where we had to leave the windows open during the day, just to air the place - if you're a non-smoker with sensitive nose, ask for a non-smoking room!
