{"text":"Hated the Monna Lisa I recently spent three very unhappy nights at this hotel. I travel to Europe, and in particular to Italy, frequently, and am accustomed to single rooms being small, but this was the worst room I have ever stayed in. To get there, you had to climb a flight of stairs and walk down a corridor so narrow, I practically had to walk sideways. I felt like I was banished to the servants quarters.The room was about the size of a closet; there was no natural light, no air. The window could not be opened because the headboard of the tiny, narrow bed was in the way. There was no real shower, just a shower curtain separating the shower area from the rest of the bathroom, so water went all over the floor.As others have mentioned, the walls are paper thin. I could hear every single word said in the room next to me; in fact, I was woken up when my neighbors came home late at night.And when I finally laid down, I heard buzzing in my ear. Apparently this hotel has a problem with mosquitos. I still cannot believe that I visited Florence in November and came home with mosquito bites. There was literature in the room that indicated Florence had a mosquito problem, but I've stayed in about 8 or 9 different Florence hotels and only one had mosquitos: the Monna Lisa.On the positive side, the staff were very nice and the breakfast was good. But with so many nice hotels in Florence at this price range, I would highly recommend avoiding the Monna Lisa.
