{"text":"Never going back I traveled to this resort with my boyfriend, soon as we reached the airport an everyone was rushing around and pushing you I knew this was going to be a disaster. Immigration and customs was so unorganized I was ready to pull my hair out. We could not find our bus to the hotel. We had to pay some one to find it for us. Once we reached the hotel I was so excited. We were upgraded to the premier club because the punta cana side was all filled up. This was not a very nice upgrade in my eyes. We had our own pool but that was about it. We were the farthest from the beach and food. But I guess being far away from the food was a good thing. I got sick after the first day. We got there on a monday afternoon. I got sick Tuesday. We came home Friday. I was not completely better till the following Tuesday. To make things worse. The resort stunk of cigarettes and gasoline the entire trip. There was no break from it. I think that was part of my distress. I spent a good part of the trip in my room. To top it all off if you have fair skin spf 50 will not cut. I applied over and over again. and i got sun poisoning. I could not lay down at all. My boyfriend has a stomach like a rock and very dark skin. He even got sick and a sun burn. My advice to you if you plan on going here is be careful. When i showered i kept my mouth closed tight I was sure not to consume any water. Maybe it was the ice cubes but they came from bags so who knows. The nice part about the resort was the beach was beautiful. The pools felt like bath water... it was gross because you got no relief from the heat trust me! it was warm!The grounds were beautiful. But slippery I almost fell walking around out side every day because they had sprinklers on and power washed every thing. The language barrier is not that big of a deal. The people who vacation there do not speak english. we met no people. The staff are friendly but i felt like every one looked at you like they knew something about you that you didnt. Definitely invest in the room safe. I did not feel safe on the resort people can just pop in your room at any time. Over all the resort was beautiful. But the food was disgusting, it made me so ill when we got home my boyfriend was not allowed to even say the name of the resort around me. I had to wait a week to write this review because i was not able to think about the food with out feeling nausous. Good luck if you have the guts to go. Maybe June is just a bad month for the bahia principe because I read such wonderful reviews but it seems in the month of June the reviews have gotten negative. Oh on the way home be prepared to have your luggage searched 3 times! In conclusion i would probably never return to the DR it was an experience i will never forget it was beautiful but my stomach cant handle it.
