{"text":"............ I took a look at this hotel online, Judging by the pictures, it looked like a great place to stay. I got there and the lobby was absolutely gorgeous......but that's where everything ended. The front desk was anything but helpful, I specifically asked for a non-smoking room, and extra blankets for my feet. I got to the room and it was horrid!!!!!!! The room was a smoking room, definitely not what I asked for, the extra blankets, I wouldn't give to a stray dog, How can I keep my feet warm and toasty with these thin, dirty blankets. They even had holes in them....HOLES. Needless to say I stormed down to the front desk and demanded a new blanket for my chilly feet. They just sat there and looked at me, after a bit of repeating myself they finally said okay and I went back to my room.  When I got back there I went to watch some TV (I kept my shoes on the whole time I was off the bed) the floors were dirty, You could tell that the smoke from whatever was smoked in the room had just seeped into floor. I was scared for my feet to touch it. The bed was hard and uninviting, the sheets were course and thin, some again having holes in them. When I actually gained enough bravery to attempt the food, I was rudely greeted by plastic looking eggs, nasty looking and smelling meats, cheese that was just god awful and I didn't even dare touch the milk. I must say, I expected much more form this hotel. I got sub par service and a horrible room. not worth a penny I wouldn't even suggest ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1428,"mention":"sub","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Submarine_sandwich"],"startOffset":1425}]}
