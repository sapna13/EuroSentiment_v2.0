{"text":"Good Hotel but Location not Ideal It was our first visit to Hong Kong and we chose Harbour View International based on predominantly positive reviews on tripadvisor.com. Using Rates to Go, we made a reasonably priced reservation --3 nights stay in a standard room with daily breakfast for 2.Check in: We arrived at around 9 pm. We took the A 12 bus from the airport but overshot our stop, ending in Causeway Bay. Apparently, we were supposed to stand by the exit and be quick pressing the stop button since the stops were close together. We took a taxi back to Wan Chai which cost us an extraHKD33 + HKD10 for 2 pieces of luggage. As per the advice of other trip advisor members, we asked for but did not get a room upgrade with a harbour view. Instead, we got a renovated room with a distinct odor of paint--not too strong though. Room: The room was smaller than what we're used to but it was clean, and adequately furnished. The window faced a wall so we just kept our drapes closed. There was a small fridge with drinks (fee)and a daily supply of bottled mineral water (free). There was a good sized safe which was very useful to keep our passports and cash secure. We loved the strong water pressure of the shower--a godsend after hours of walking. My husband looked for but did not find an ice dispenser in the hotel. House keeping instead brought us up a pitcher of iced water.Location: If you were in Hong Kong attending a seminar in Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, this hotel is a perfect alternative to the pricey Renaissance Harbour Hotel and Grand Hyatt across the street. To hit the tourist sites, you can't do anything on foot if you want to conserve energy, keep cool and maximize your time in Hong Kong. The Wan Chai MTR is a 15 minute walk (unless you are unusually fit--you can do it in 5 minutes). You have to do several flights of stairs and several blocks as well. The bus stop is about 30 meters from the front of the hotel--very convenient except that only the 18,18P, 46X buses stopped there. In Gloucester Road are other bus stops but to get there, you have to do the previously mentioned stairs. I asked the concierge for a map indicating all the buses that enter Wan Chai. I cannot believe that he did not have one! We would have enjoyed our stay more if we had route maps for all the buses. The Wan Chai Ferry to Kowloon is a 20 minute walk from the hotel . We ended up spending about $150 HKD per person just for fares (MTR, buses, ferries) to and from the tourist sites and shopping areas. Next time we are in Hong Kong, we will get another hotel that is closer to any MTR station. In that way, we could get the 3 day tourist pass that allows you unlimited MTR rides for 3 days and either a one way or round trip airport express ride.
