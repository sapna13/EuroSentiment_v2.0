{"text":"Great Vacation This is our 4th trip to Dominican we have stayed at hotels from one end of the island to the other end and in the middle . As far as this hotel goes the rooms and food were good compared to the other hotels and the grounds were beautiful and everything was a short walk which I like. We had an amazing room with a King size bed and ocean view which I have always asked or but never got. This ocean view was spectauclar day and night that alone was worth the trip. The only complaint I have was that I was not aware of the marina next door and I dont like the thought of boats being so close to were I am swiming and also breathing the fumes in. The seaweed didnt bother me and the water was very clear but I think the bavaro beaches are much better this one is situated in cabeza de toro. This hotel sets up a wonderful beach party barbecue every thursday night. The staff works very hard setting it up and all the restaurents gettogether and prepare the food and they even have the entertainment on the beach the only problem was that the clean was up was underneath our room so it was very noise all night while we were trying to sleep The shows we found were more proffesionaly done than the other ones we have seen . Tthe Michael Jackson show which we have seen in other hotels does not compare to this one this one was very good as well s Shakira. Overall it was fine and I dont understand why people complain about he food there was plenty to choose from every day and we have never gotten sick only my husband once but thats because he had too many Pina Coladas which can be like a laxative.P.S. We tried getting the Pallapas on the beach every morning by getting up at 6:00 to no avail we did manage to get one at 5:00 one day but it was the last one all the towels were on the chairs already so I came to the conclusion that people are puttting them on the chairs at night before going to bed.
