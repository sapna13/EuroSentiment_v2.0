{"text":"Royal treatment at the Palace We have spent the last 2 weeks travelling through Italy. We spent 4 nights at Palazzo Magnani Feroni and it was one of the best places we have ever stayed. We travel first class around the world and typically stay in either Leading Hotels of the World and also Small Luxury Hotels.The Palace is an amazing place. We have stayed in many chateaux in France and other palace type accommodations and this was probably the best place of all. The furniture and antique pieces are from the original owners of the palace (the owners still occupy one of the upper floors). We are not big fans of antiques, and our preference is modern and contemporary, but this place is so amazing, the antique pieces contribute to the overall feel.We had a 1 bedroom suite (the Lucrezia room). It was beautiful, very clean and very spacious, in fact by European standards - enormous!!! The palace does those little extras, like providing the next day's weather forecast, and chocolates at turndown in the evening. The room was very comfortable and the staff were amazing! They were all extremely helpful and bent over backwards to help. We were meant to stay here 1 night and fly out of Rome airport the next evening, but I developed a middle-ear infection and could not fly. Our travel insurance company requested a doctors report so we could change all of our flights and accommodation for the remaining 3 weeks of travel, etc, and the hotel staff organized a Doctor that came to our room at the hotel so I didn't have to sit in a clinic. Then, they faxed documents back and forth, to and from our insurance company several times during the night. Our room was available for the next 3 nights, so we extended our stay. The next day, my husband lost a filling so they made a dentist appointment for him. The staff were unbelievably helpful and by far the BEST staff of any hotel we've ever stayed. We are frequent travellers and have travelled all over the world, many times. All the staff were a pleasure, but Valentina was extra special. She was very helpful!The breakfast is good also. There is an extra charge if you want eggs\/omelette (5 euro). But, they provide FRESH fruit, cereals, yoghurt, freshly squeezed juice, a variety of breads, cheese, meats and good coffee.They restaurant and trattoria recommendations that the staff provided were really good! They made reservations for us. (Try Mamma Gina's which is a 5 minute walk along the same road, towards Ponte Vecchio - fantastic food!) Also the shopping along the same street - towards Ponte Vecchio, is fantastic! There are about 13 shops along the same road owned by the same man (whom we met, nice guy). Stylish clothing for men and women and great shoes! The beds are firm, but it was not a problem for us.Stay here - it's a great place!
