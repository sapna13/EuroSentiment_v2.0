{"text":"Mixed feelings about Radisson... As a young family, we don't get the chance to take extended vacations very often. This last leg of our trip included a four night stay at the Radisson Ambassador Hotel. The room was nice, though we wanted two double beds, and received a king. It was a typical room with typical amenities. There are a couple good and bad points about this hotel I want to share. First, the parking situation is ATROCIOUS! We arrived back at the hotel at various times in the evening, only to find the parking lot extremely full. You have the choice of valet, but it costs more. We discovered the next morning, there were only a handful of cars left in the lot. This meant that casino gaming visitors took up all the parking meant mainly for hotel guests. We were on the third floor and could hear a lot of the casino noise from downstairs. Another thing you don't find out until you arrive are the parking fees were $15.00 per day. The hotel didn't express much sympathy when we brought this inconvenience to their attention upon checkout. The front desk reply was Yes, we are quite a busy hotel ONe thing I want to rave about is the proactive action taken by the hotel housekeepers. My daughter still loves her milk, so I bought a half gallon at the store and chilled it in the ice bucket. The next day when we got back from our busy day, we found a small fridge in our room with the milk chilled nicely inside. I was very impressed by this. I guess we made a mistake staying at a hotel with a casino in it. So if you don't want the parking hassle and the noise from a casino, definitely don't book your stay here. ","annotations":[]}
