{"text":"Not worth the money This is a swanky, small hotel. The ratings are good enough. They've acquired enough awards and accolades. The location is fantastic for the leisure traveler wanting to walk Boston--you can hop on the Freedom Trail just outside. The rooms are nicely appointed with European sheets, robe, and spa items from Mario Russo. The staff was helpful in loading\/unloading, check-in, concierge services and calling transportation.What is not good? THE BEDS ARE OLD. You can have the finest linens in the world, but it will never mask a worn-out bed. My husband and I had a queen and neither of us got a full night's sleep on any of the four nights we stayed. We left our vacation feeling more tired than when we arrived.Second, THE ROOM SERVICE IS TERRIBLE. On two mornings we ordered from from the room service menu. On a continental breakfast, they forgot the juice both times, neglected salt\/peppper, butter for toast and breads, and sugar for our tea and coffee. They were out of an offered yogurt for our entire length of stay. The second morningn they sent a completely different meal from what my husband ordered! They did make it right, but at a hotel of this advertised calibur, the service could be 100x better. We did not even dare enter the restaurant, Spire, for that reason.Also, be advised with the pampering service, this means they enter your room about 3x a day. Once in the a.m. for cleaning, once in the afternoon and once for turndown. If you want more privacy, let them know, rather than shooing housekeeping three times in a day, as we had to do.
