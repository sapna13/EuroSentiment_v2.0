{"text":"Really different and quirky We spent 3 nights here and booked a club room which gave access to a lovely lounge with food and drinks, internet access, fab views and a massage chair.The bedroom also had magnificent views over the city and was well equipped with huge flat screen tv, and dvds available to borrow from a library. Toiletries were lovely and there was everything you could need. Breakfast was in the club lounge but you had the free option of buffett breakfast downstairs ( I think they probably had to do this as lounge could get busy) The location is very different as the hotel and attched shopping centre are part of a big development investment in Mongkok - which is a real local area and not the traditional touristy part. The streets outside are brilliant to walk around - a real hive of activity with people making everything in front of you - from rivets to coffins and shoes to bathroom fittings. It is really atmospheric yet so easy to get to the sights by subway which is the best subway I have used anywhere in the world.On arriving at the hotel a girl with shocking pink gloves and a funny hat calls the lift for you! Its little things which are quirky\/nice!Only downside ( and its not a huge thing) was that we queued to check in only to be told that we should have gone straight to the club floor to check in. When we got there we had to queue again. The club checkin frequently had people waiting so maybe that is a process which could be improved.All in all a fantastic place which I would recommend. Thanks to Trip Advisor as it was through the recommendations there that I booked it.
