{"text":"It is still great Returned for my 60th birthday with my wife and 2 of my sons after staying for a couple of days last October. The staff gave the same excellent service and treated us like royalty. We opted for the Gold band which gave us the run of the hotel's restaurants and bars which was very handy for my sons who are young men and partial to a drink or two. We didn't need to put our hands in our pockets for any food or drinks during our stay and gave our sons more scope for shopping outside. There are stalls near the hotel that sells clothes and souvenirs. Right opposite the hotel is a small minimart where you can buy essential foods and drinks if needed. The hotel is a very traditional hotel, a bit old but very clean and the rooms are quite spacious. We had a suite as part of the Gold band, and we were able to get free laundry every day, which my wife thought was great so we didn't take a pile of dirty washing home. You can also get room service with food and drinks as part of the gold and you get reserved loungers which we organised for the beach and avoided the annoying lounge reservers. The food is excellent in all restaurants and the Italian is air-conditioned which is a bit more up market and you can order lobster if you have the gold band. We had a fantastic time and are planning to return agin soon. ","annotations":[]}
