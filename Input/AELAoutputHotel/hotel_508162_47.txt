{"text":"Good Dreams! My husband and I stayed at Dreams October 26 through the 31, and we loved it! Yeah the drive from the airport was long and scary, but what do you expect in a foreign country. Our driver took us through the country instead of going through town on the way there, and the country side is beautiful once you are away from the houses and stuff. The trip was for our 3rd anniversary. When we arrived the check in went smooth and we were greeted with a letter telling us happy anniversary. When we arrived at our room we were surprised to find out that we had been upgraded to an ocean view suite, we also had a bottle of champagne and a fruit plate waiting on us. The suite was in building 1 and was a swim out. The deck had two lounge chairs, a table and chairs, and a Jacuzzi tub. It was quite nice. The grounds were beautiful and the pool was just awesome. There was always someone pruning bushes, picking up trash, and cleaning the pool. The beach was nice as well, but I think they need to have more waitresses on the beach to take drink orders. We tried all of the restaurants except the Italian one. They were all pretty good, but the Japanese and the Mexican were our favorites. The buffet was ok, but not the best buffet we have ever encountered to at an all-inclusive. I just got a few drinks from the bars. If you are looking for a good time order anything with rum, they are not stingy with it, but the margaritas suck. I liked the red wine, I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ know what kind it is but it was pretty decent. The people that work here a super nice, not once did I walk past an employee that didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ give me a smile and a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¢ola√à√\u2020\u2022? If you get a chance check out the wellness center, they have a nice big hot tub with a waterfall, a steam room, a sauna, and various showers. I had a massage, body wrap, and hydrotherapy, and the wellness center was included. I think I could have lived with just spending a few hours in the wellness center. The massage was wonderful, but I could hear cars driving by and people talking from the treatment room (not so relaxing). We had a wonderful time during our stay. I would definitely recommend this resort to family and friends. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a great place to stay!
