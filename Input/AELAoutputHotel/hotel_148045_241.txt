{"text":"No place like it on the planet Stayed three nights mid April. Took our two teenage boys, and had lodging in the Las Casitas villas. We rented a car from San Juan airport, and drove to Fajardo. Not a bad trip, but beware of drivers in Puerto Rico. They make their own rules. We rented a car to have access to the rainforest on our own time so as not to have to take a tour. It was a good decision, and we'll definitely rent a car next trip.Last time we visited, we went in February. April is a much better time to go. Hotter and more buggy, but not as crowded. The El Conquistador is unbelievable. From the moment we were met by smiling staff curbside, took the last moment we sadly drove out of the gate, it was like being placed on a picture perfect postcard.Bottom line: this place is expensive. Our first night, at the Strip House, our two boys drank $28 worth of diet coke alone. But, where else can you find such a view on planet earth? If it wasn't expensive, the hotel couldn't afford the upkeep of such beautiful grounds. They were exceptional. Flowers and hedges perfectly trimmed. Pools and pool areas very clean. Ferry service to the island -- 7 minutes! How can someone complain about having not having a beach at the hotel if they can't wait 7 minutes??? Have a mai-tai at the marina and relax!One disappointment: Drakes Cigar Bar doesn't allow cigar smoking anymore due to the new smoking laws in Puerto Rico. You can't even smoke a cigar on the adjacent patio. If you want to pay fast-food prices, find a 3-star hotel. But if you want luxury, this is the place. We will definitely be back. And We Can't Wait!
