{"text":"Cheap but Noisy Stayed here for three nights Nov 07 as part of a group of 12 friends. We chose it mainly because of its nearness to Las Ramblas.Overall, we were fairly happy with this hotel, but we each had individual gripes as we were scattered throughout the hotel and had differing experiences. All agreed that the noise factor was an issue. ALL the rooms have paper-thin walls it seems and you can hear people speaking in the next room - goodness knows what it would be like if they were rowing!! Also the lack of carpeting means that you hear every footstep, both in the rooms and in the corridors. One couple had a room next to the lifts and heard everyone getting in and out all night. Two couples had rooms that were overlooked by the pool area which meant they had to keep their blinds closed at all times. We had a front facing room which I have to say was only noisy if you left the windows open, but the hair-dryer was broken - reported to reception the first hour we were there- but never repaired. One couple's safe was broken - when reported were told that it had been like that for a while!!!All agreed the reception staff were polite but not particularly helpful or interested. We didn't have breakfast because it seemed expensive when we booked. Lots of cafes nearby offer more choice and better value. The free internet was a plus and the chambermaid was a gem - we could not fault the cleanliness. Overall - great location, clean rooms, noise factor and desk-staff attitude let it down.
