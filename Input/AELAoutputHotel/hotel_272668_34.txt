{"text":"5 people, 1 room, 1 week 5 of us chipped in to get 1 room with 2 queen beds and a rollaway bed for $110 a night for 7 nights before tax.Pro's: great price, about 15-20 minute drive to sunset strip, always open space in the free secure parking under the hotel, friendly staff, clean and quiet place, breakfast buffet from 630am-930am restocked throughout the morning so you're not going to miss out on certain food by getting up late, leftover coffee and juice still available after 9:30am, room fridge, microwave, and a\/c all worked great, decent thai food place downstairs, good hot water pressure in shower, some decent restaurants and convenience\/liquor stores within a several minute drive up w. sunsetCons: on the 3rd floor there was NO wifi signal at all (too weak to even show up, wired ethernet was fine,) the remote to our tv did not work (we tried new batteries) and we complained once but it wasn't taken care of, the tv only got 12 channels because it wasn't programmed properly, the bathroom was very small (door almost touches shower,) inconvenient having to recode all room keys daily at the front desk, scraped the bottom of our rental several times going over the steep hump into the garage, rock hard bedsOverall, great value and good place to sleep, get cleaned up, and eat breakfast before going out. With no pool, gym or lounge, and spotty wifi and tv, not somewhere too exciting to relax all day. It was a good fit for us and any complaints were minor for the price of the place.
