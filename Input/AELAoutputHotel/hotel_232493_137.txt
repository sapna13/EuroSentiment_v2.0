{"text":"Hotel nadia was great value in the centre of Amsterdam We stayed in Amsterdam for 3 nights at Hotel Nadia based on reviews here. A little apprehensive as we rang the bell of the tiny door in the street but our welcome was fantastic . We were a little early but were offered a cold drink, coffee as we relaxed in the breakfast room getting our first glimpse of the Amsterdam canals. The staff also insisted on carrying our bags up the stairs for us. Our room was small but very clean and perfect for our needs - it also looked out to the canal in the side street - the fridge also meant we could stock up on some food from the nearby supermarket for picnics by the canals. Breakfast was adequate - rolls, cheese, coffee, tea, croissants, juice. Perfect location with easy tram ride from station (the tram numbers are on their web site) and 5 minute walk to the main square, 10 minute walk to red light district and many restaurants and bars in between. Amsterdam is a very interesting and perhaps unique city and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. We hired bikes for the day from Yellow Bike and they pointed us in the direction of the farming area by catching the ferry across the water at main train station - spent about 5 hours leisurely exploring the farms, dykes and villages. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel and its staff who continued to be extremely helpful right throughout our stay.
