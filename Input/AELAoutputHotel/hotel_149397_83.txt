{"text":"Big Mistake If anyone is trying to make the decision whether to stay at Bavaro Princess---DON'T!!!! I got on travel advisors and there was enough pictures and negative things that I wish I had listened to them but I was stupid and listened to those that would say the oppisite and convince me that the people writting were just negative people...They weren't, believe me I've went to Punta Cana 6 times and always stayed in a 5 or 6 Apple Resort and I know the difference..Bavaro Princess should be rated no more than a 3.. My friend and I arrived there May the 12th and the Bell Boys took our luggage and showed us where to catch the tram and we waited and waited just like people had said we would..We finally walked to our room which hadn't been cleaned, I turned the tv on to see if we got any Latin music because I love it and the tv wasn't working.. the maid reported it,,then after she left we was looking the room over,,sure enough like we had been advised,,there was bugs, mildew on the walls, and the light in the bathroom wouldn't work..I called to report that and then we got ready to go eat..We went out to the tram stop and waited again for 10 minutes and finally the tram came,,,FULL,,we finally walked and it was a long walk, believe me,,I was told about the sewage smell but again didn't believe it,,I do now,,it was terrible..dinner was good until later when I was running to the bathroom often, it was too dark in the main lobby and we went to the show which was a magic show, very boring. Well we decided to go in, get some sleep and start over tomorrow..no tv and no light in the bathroom,,luckily I took a flashlight. The next morning I was so sick I couldn't eat breakfast and soon after breakfast my friend was sick..We went to Apple and ask to be moved..After checking around, they found us a great resort and we moved..Please if you're thinking about going look some more..I'm really upset that Apple would rate this place a 5 as bad as it was...I'm sure if these people that give great reviews had been to any other resorts they'd realize that Bavaro Princess has a lot of problems..Our vacation was ruined from getting an enzyme or poisoned the first day..I go to enjoy everything,,always look foward to the food, drinks, entertainment,,I missed all of that and was moved to a fabulous resort but was too sick. Don't be pulled in by the good price like I did,,I regretted it. I hope you'll listen to me..Thanks Susan ","annotations":[]}
