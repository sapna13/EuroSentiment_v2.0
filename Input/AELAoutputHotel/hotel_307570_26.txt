{"text":"Paradise on earth√à√\u2020\u2022?well close enough Paradise on earth√à√\u2020\u2022?well close enough.Stayed at the Grand hyatt Nusa dua for seven nights and enjoyed every minute. The hotel is located in acres of land and felt like we were the only people there. Due to the location you are not hassled much but vendors.Pools were amazing, wished they were open after 8pm.The room was spacious and felt at home.Overall the price for food\/services are expensive but that is a given when staying at a resort like this.It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ within walking distance from the local shops\/supermarket. Just outside the Nusa dua complex there is a market that closes around 9pm.Kuta is about 20 mins drive away and a cheap taxi journey.Would recommend this hotel for a honey moon, anniversary√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√∫irtually anything. Worth every penny.Location √à√\u2020\u2022?set away from √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂¬®eal bali√à√\u2020\u2022?but staying at a large resort will generally be like this. The stretch of beach that the hotel is on is great and clean. 20 min drive form the Kuta night life but it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ a cheap taxi ride and there are taxis outside the hotel night and day.Rooms √à√\u2020\u2022?large, clean. The room we stayed in was more like a one bed room apartment. Did not feel like a hotel, more like a home. Good size TV with SKY, large bed, day bed, great bath room.Take your laptop for wireless access but weather you use your own or go to the business centre you have to pay for web access.Restaurant √à√\u2020\u2022?breakfast was really good, a wide variety of food.There are various restaurant do dine all of a high standard. The Japanese was especially good. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ cheaper to go into the Bali mall which is walking distance from the hotel. the food in the restaurants there is good and there is a lot of choice.Gym and Pool √à√\u2020\u2022?there are four pools and at no point were any of them overcrowded. All were exceptionally clean and very pretty.The gym was big and equipment was up to date. Shame that they close at 8pm.Staff √à√\u2020\u2022?the staff are very attentive and help when ever they can. Felt that the luggage people were a little cheeky as they broke the handle of our case and waited for a tip! If you get the chance dine at Bambu Bali, the food is amazing and very authentic. They also offer cooking class. They offer a free pickup and drop off service.There are a lot of tours, arrange them via the hotel. they may be more expensive but the overall service is a lot better.
