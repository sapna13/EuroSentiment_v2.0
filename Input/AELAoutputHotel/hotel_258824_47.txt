{"text":"Great location, great hotel! We stayed here for 6 nights in Nov 07.First night was a bit rough, we had asked for a room with a view of the Space needle, which is exactly what we got. It was a nice room on the sixth (top) floor, room 632. However, the hotel has a bathroom extraction system that is always on, as opposed to having a system that has a fan on a timer in each individual room. Unfortunately the motor\/unit for this entire system appears to be directly above this room, mounted on the roof. As a result we found it almost impossible to sleep!This issue was resolved the next day with a transfer to another room on the fifth floor on the other side of the hotel, sadly minus the view of the needle but they did give us a discount for the inconvienience, problem solved!The hotel is lovely, nice and clean, very helpful staff and we would certainly stay here again as well as recommend it to others!The real benefit of this hotel is the fantastic location!!! There are plenty of shops\/supermarkets for any of your food\/beer requirements (each room has its own little kitchenette\/bar!) and tons of places to eat, drink, breakfast etc etc. The hotel is also directly next to the Seattle Centre (Key Arena, Space Needle, museum's, theatre etc) and also on a main bus route to get directly into downtown Seattle if you don't fancy the walk.Good choice of hotel!! Good choice of city to stay in, Seattle was a great, safe place to vacation in, lots to do!!
