{"text":"Terribly Overrated I picked the Affinia Dumont for our party (4) because I had read the reviews and had seen such terrific compliments. In fact, I recommended it to people based on what I'd seen on this site. There ended up being several people from our group who stayed there b\/c of what I'd seen on TripAdvisor. I had never been to NYC before and was looking forward to staying in a quality, smoke-free hotel that (apparently) had great service. What a disappointment!The disappointment started right off the bat when we were put into a room that was obviously not used very much (on the 3rd floor) even though we checked in early and stated that we would be willing to wait for something to open up so we could get a decent room. We had booked this hotel months in advance and had asked repeatedly for a nice room with a view. We didn't get that. The view I could live w\/out but I expected a nice hotel room. The room we were given was musty and moldy smelling and it had a horrendous view of apartment buildings in the back. That wasn't too bad until I found out that several other people staying in the hotel had booked after we did, had the same # of people in their party, and got a great room. Didn't make me happy. Because of the mold and must, two of us ended up getting incredibly sick and were coughing throughout the entire weekend.During our stay, we had the toilet break down and it wasn't fixed until the next afternoon and only until after we'd called twice in the morning to see if it was going to get fixed, after being told that maintenace apparently doesn't have any type of emergency service after business hours. So we went all night w\/out a working toilet. 4 women sharing a toilet that didn't work for over 24 hours? Not good. I ended up using someone else's bathroom on the next floor up.We also asked repeatedly for extra towels and blankets and had to keep calling and asking to get them. If they were having trouble finding these items, all they had to do was say that the hotel was booked solid and that they were looking. The front desk just kept telling us that they were contacting housekeeping as though they'd forgotten that we'd just called 10 minutes earlier.One of my roommates also had significant trouble with her internet and called twice to try and get it sorted out. Everytime she tried to bring up the internet, it kept asking her for credit card information all though she had already given it and her 24 hours wasn't even close to being done (same day). This hotel is getting five star reviews and all I can say is that I hope that those people were\/are being treated better than we were and that they get a room that is actually used. I won't be staying @ this hotel again.
