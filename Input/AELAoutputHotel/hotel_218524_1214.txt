{"text":"Good First All inclusive experience This was our first all inclusive hotel experience. I have to say as the first experience it was well worth the money. Initially when you get off the airplane you see a beatiful out door airport and palm trees, my favorite part of the caribbean. Through our booking agent we had a hotel transfer...which at the airport it is slightly overwhelming because there are individuals who basically grab your bags out of your hands to carry them for you. Although this is a nice welcome into Punta Cana, I found it slightly abrasive. The ride to the hotel was about 1.5 hours due to us dropping off other guests at other hotels. It was VERY bumpy and there was a lot of unorganized traffic. Upon arrival to the hotel, we saw this beautiful hotel and landscape. We were very excited to begin our stay. We got out the of taxi and were greeted by the valets who were extremely friendly and we were also greeted with a glass of champagne for each of us. We then were escorted the the exclusive excellence club where we had the pleasure of meeting Jacqueline and Miguel. They were very helpful throughout the week and made our stay very relaxing. Our room was gorgeous. We were in building seven on the top floor. We had two balconies and a private jacuzzi tub as well. Our view was the ocean and the swim up pool bar. Beautiful!!Maid Service- Was ok. We were supposed to receive a paper every morning and we did not. We were supposed to have fresh fruit in our room everyday and we never did. The maid did come in and clean our room each day, only thoroughly if we put the sign in the door. The maid also came in and did a turn down service each night, some nights we had a copy of the Excellence news while others we did not. So it was inconsistent.Food- Ok. Best restaurants Barcelona, Agave, and the Grill. Dress code is a little ridiculous. Men HAVE to wear long pants, but that means some were in sweat pants or in jeans with ratty sneakers and t-shirts. While those who had on nice shorts, shirts, and shoes were sent back to their room to change.Entertainment Team-- What can I say, these people make the experience!! Every night there was a show which was always fun to watch. Each afternoon when we would get rain showers, they were there with games and bingo. Needless to say we were never bored. Francisco, Juan Miguel and the rest of the entertainment team created a fun environment for all. Service- In some of the restaurants the servers were slow. In Agave, they were quick to greet, bring our food, and fill our drinks. The cocktail waitresses were ALWAYS walking around asking if we needed anything. Sanller in the pool bar is always smiling. Victor and Santos in the Excellence club were also always a pleasure to have conversations with and provided great service.Shopping- At the resort, one word, over priced. I paid $12 for a bottle of Tums 100ct. Absolutely ridiculous.Word to the wise, it would be beneficial to polish up your Spanish to visit the island, not just the resorts.
