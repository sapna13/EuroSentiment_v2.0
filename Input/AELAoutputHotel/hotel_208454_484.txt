{"text":"Out of their way outstanding We did our annual shopping trip in New York and stayed at the Sofitel. I had holds on places like the W, The Palace and The Westin Times Square but none of those compare. Sofitel brings the sophistication of Europe to 5th Ave in a way many others cannot. I am a longtime guest of the Essex House but since their change of ownership didn't have a favorite. I do now.Check in was immediate, friendly and accurate. This was a busy weekend in New York and it could have been problematic. I like their bellman bells that they play for front service.The room was as planned and clean as you see in other reviews. Of course I found a few black spots in the shower but nothing like some of the photos you see herein of the W etc. This place visits your room twice daily to attend to things.Extra towels and room service were 20 minutes or less. They could use an update to electronics with flatscreens and free WiFi but that's minor. I am sure they will figure it out. The towels had a holiday inn feel to them also, but again, they will figure it out if enough of us complain.I couldnt find my ipod charger and their faulous head of security John Sheehan not only found one left by another guest but charged my ipod while i was out shopping. Front door staff and such were efficient too.The only downside (and why i gave only 4 dots instead of 5) is that their bar and restaurant are lacking any type of ambiance and panache that most New York 5th avenue area hotels have. At the holiday time, there are great fireplaces crackling, nice cocktails moving about and cheer. Not here. The bartender was majorly UNDER and he was complaining to his boss. The boss, in turn, was complaining about him to another worker. It was very unprofessional. They are also not wheelchair proficient (I am not a user but...) so that our stroller had to go down a bunch of stairs to get to the bar\/restaurant.The breakfast was average and very expensive. Try Norma's at the Le Meridien for breakfast. That place rocks. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great location and attention to minor details.
