{"text":"Modern Hotel Next to Museum of Modern Art My husband and I spent three days\/two nights at this modern hotel located on 3rd Street and Mission in downtown San Francisco. Next door is the acclaimed Museum of Modern Art and a block away from the Moscone Center, Jewish Contemporary Museum and near the shopping arcade. My husband booked our reservations over the phone and reserved a corner suite to celebrate our anniversary and his birthday. Upon arrival, the doormen were friendly and assisted with our bags, and the front desk person was equally welcoming -- she even offered a late check out of 4pm (helped that we were Starwood members). The hotel does have a private car to take you to where your excursions or reservations are located, but this may take 15-30 minutes of waiting time since the car(s) is\/are available on a first come\/first serve basis (plan to call ahead at least 30 min. before you need to leave NOT when your reservation is). Also, the hotel car can not pick you up and bring you back to the hotel, so plan on alternate transportations. The room was on the corner along Mission, which we found to be very noisy with sirens and loud talking\/yelling from the streets below. A good tip would be to request a corner room facing a non-busy thoroughfare. The furnishings and ammenities were comfy -- an L-shaped sofa in the livingroom, desk, king bed, electronic motorized window shades (both black out and sheer), flat screen consoles in livingroom and bathroom. The plus side: sleek and modern furnishings on a quite floor. The minus side: noisy corner location and not enough face towels. We had drinks at the bar downstairs and enjoyed the low-lit and holiday decorated ambiance -- a nice relaxing way to spend the time after a day of hustle and bustle!
