{"text":"Stayed 10 nights For the price and the location, the Diva is a good bet. I stayed for 10 nights and found it to be everything I needed. I was in one of their larger rooms (complete with couch and mini fridge) and did feel somewhat pampered. The front desk staff and concierge were always friendly and greeted me. When we asked for restaurant recommendations or directions, they were always helpful. However, my colleague did have an unpleasant experience with one of the front desk people when she checked in. The hotel should rethink its wall color - the chalky white shows every single smudge and nick, so the walls appear a bit dingy. I usually don't use drawers at hotels, so the file-cabinets-turned-dressers didn't bother me, but I thought they were odd. Always had plenty of hot water, shower pressure, clean towels and I thought the bed was very comfy for a hotel bed, so I was happy. Oh, and the large flat panel TV was nice, too.The location is very close to all of the Union Square shopping and general toursity atmosphere. About a 5-10 minute walk to the BART\/MUNI. There IS a Starbucks right off the lobby, which was convenient, but I thought the service there was subpar. I was not as impressed with restaurants right on Union Square as I was with others around town, but you can find something to eat pretty easily around the hotel. A few blocks away there is a great Thai place called Arroi and a sushi place called Sanraku. Also liked the diner across the street and down a block for French Toast and walk a few blocks to get to a great French place called Plouf (mussels and clams galore). Oh, and for great Mexican food and a cheap bottle of Dos Equis, visit the taqueria that is across the street and down about two blocks in the opposite direction of Union Square. As far as the complaints go about panhandlers in the area... Whether you're paying $500 for a luxery hotel or $100 for the Diva, you're going to run into panhandlers in SF. Most just stand in one place and call out for change - they do not chase you down or get in your face. If panhandlers make you uncomfortable, perhaps SF is not the right place for you to visit. I felt very safe in the area around the Diva. By the way, due to a flight cancellation, I ended up for a night in the Hilton on O'Farrell Street just a few minutes from the Diva. The price was twice as much as the Diva, but I wouldn't say that it was necessarily worth it, since the Diva was fine by my standards. But, if you are very picky and have the money to spend, the Hilton was very clean, new and comfortable. I stayed in tower 2 in one of the handicap accessible rooms, so it was very roomy as well. The buffalo wings in the lounge were very good. :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1513,"mention":"French Toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_toast"],"startOffset":1501},{"endOffset":1513,"mention":"French Toast","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_toast"],"startOffset":1501},{"endOffset":2679,"mention":"buffalo wings","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Buffalo_wing"],"startOffset":2666}]}
