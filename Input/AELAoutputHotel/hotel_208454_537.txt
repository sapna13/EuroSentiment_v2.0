{"text":"Excellent, Fabulous, Amazing, Best Hotel in the World ! We stayed at the Sofitel for 3 Nights 18\/19\/20th April 2006 we came over from Ireland to get married on 19th and we had the best time ever ! This hotel is PERFECT ! cant believe it is not a 5*. We chose the hotel because of the amazing reviews and it definitely lives up to them tenfold ! The staff are absolutely amazing ! so nice and friendly and would go totally out of their way to help you (The lady on the reception desk was absolutely brilliant) Rooms are gorgeous and bed is Fabulous ! We checked in and were trying to organise somewhere for our 26 Wedding guests from Ireland to meet on the morning of our Wedding (for which the lobby was perfect, lots of lovely seating area) and when they heard we were getting married they gave us an upgrade from a Queen room to a King, the lady said they would have given us a suite but they had none available that day, but if we left all our luggage ready the next day they would move us when we were at our Wedding ! we couldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ believe it !  When we returned back that Night after our Wedding they had moved rooms for us and the Room was completely and utterly UNBELIEVABLE ! firstly there was a bottle of champagne and a card from the staff and strawberries dipped in chocolate waiting for us which was beautiful ! such a lovely touch !  the Room was massive with TWO bathrooms, a sofa area a big bedroom and best of all a HUGE SUN TERRACE outside the patio doors with table and chairs and two sunbeds !!!!! we were totally blown away ! I had never seen anything like it and never even thought it could exist in the City ! we were sitting out on terrace looking right at the Chrysler Building easily the most beautiful building in the city, it was fabulous, and all our guests came over the next day and we sat in the sun and drank champagne all day ! (no one could believe the room) then ordered room service that evening which was very nice too.I can easily say the Sofitel made our Wedding Day truly MAGICAL ! It is also situated brilliantly, just short walks to the main attractions and on a side street so no street noise whatsoever. Red Flame Diner is ace for breakfast! The Top of the Rock is good, but it is $18 each to go up to the outside viewing area, which we did a few days before our Wedding, but on our Wedding day we went up to the Rainbow Room for cocktails which is also in the Rockefeller Building and only 2 floors down from the top of the rock and we paid about the same and had a cocktail and were not outside in the wind ! (and we had cosmopolitans which were supposedly invented in the Rainbow Room !) the views from it were amazing no different than the TOTR, the cocktails were expensive but definitely worth going up for one ! but we were lucky as the lady waitress bought us a free cocktail as we had just got married ! I would also recommend a trip to China Town (Canal Street) especially for girlies who love handbags ! bargains galore ! Overall, the Sofitel is FABULOUS and we will definitely, 100 % be back as soon as we possibly can !
