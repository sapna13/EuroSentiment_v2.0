{"text":"Not a three star hotel, don't stay here unless you are OK in hostel-style rooms I read a lot of reviews of this hotel before staying and thought that everyone who said it was bad was overreacting but they were not. The cafe and restaurant are really priced at a four star level and are clearly the reason that the hotel has the rating it does as the rooms are not good at all but the food in the restaurant is lovely. However, the rooms just bring this whole place down.We had booked a deluxe room and were given a split level twin even though we booked a double. At first we were impressed because it was split level but then we realised it was more like a room in a hostel. The two single beds were up on one level and the TV, desk, plastic chair and really uncomfortable bench-like sofa were on the bottom level. I personally would have preferred for everything to be on one level so we could watch TV in bed but this might not be a consideration for everyone. The room had no pictures on the walls at all and the ceiling was covered in stains and in desperate need of a lick of paint. When we took the sheets off the mattresses to push them together and make a double bed, we could see that they had stains all over them including a huge one where someone had clearly wet the bed at some point. This isn't something I would expect in a three star hotel.I was a little disappointed so I went to speak to the front desk staff on the second day to see if anything could be done. They seemed annoyed with me even though I was being polite and told me that most people liked the split level rooms. I said that it was more the two beds that had annoyed me as I was away with my boyfriend on our first holiday and we had booked a double room not a twin. They said that if I had said something the day before they would have done something but now they were fully booked, and that there might be a different room the next day if I went down to reception at 9am. All I really wanted was for them to be a little concerned, say sorry and if I couldn't be moved then give us a token for a tea or coffee in the cafe or some goodwill gesture. I don't think that's too much to ask really but they didn't even say sorry. The customer service is just non-existent. They were really unhelpful with other things as well. The vending machine with the internet access keys in it broke on the first day and it took them three days to get it fixed. The room didn't have a kettle so you can't make your own tea or coffee and as my boyfriend got sick this meant I had to keep going downstairs to get hot water for the Lemsip. It also means that if you want a cup of tea in the morning you have to pay for it - I've never realised how handy having tea and coffee in your room is, it just makes you feel at home a bit.I just don't think that this hotel is three star at all and would really not recommend staying here unless you are getting it really cheap. I spent quite a bit and felt really disappointed. It's not even good as a base because the rooms are just so horrible you don't want to be there.If you are concerned about being central also be aware that it takes about ten minutes on the tram to get in to the centre (its not hard but might be important to some people to be central) and if you book through Expedia also be aware that the city tax is not included in the hotel taxes that they say you have paid. I really wouldn't recommend staying here if you expect three star accommodation.
