{"text":"Could have been so good! This is a beautiful hotel in a convenient location. The problems I had were the same other people have mentioned before:1. Ask if there is a convention being held at the hotel while you are there. The Yoga people made our entire stay difficult. I guess since they had been there longer they felt as though they ran the place. I overheard one of them say they were to be there 9 weeks (?) 2. The elevators are RIDICULOUS! When they are working, the go up and down erratically within the same trip, shake, squeak, stop at every floor, and Yoga people have learned that the only way to get where you need to go is to cram into the one working elevator that services 25 floors. Nothing like having sweaty sportswear against you in the elevator...3. You will most likely not get the room you requested. I realize this is not guaranteed when you book, but come on, I asked for a double room. I was angry to be paying this much to sleep on a fold-out couch. 4. They advertise that there is a car rental on site. There is, but they have a VERY small fleet, are open only until 1 pm, and you have to return the car to a different location. Extremely inconvenient. The upsides are:1. Location is good. You are on the quiet end of Waikiki Beach, but if you want to go where the action is, it's a short walk. 2. The snorkeling is great in the morning; only about a five minute walk from the start of the beach. Go down in front of Fort DeRussy park, straight out from the volleyball courts and Lifeguard station T1. About 30 feet in from the buoys you will find a cleaning station where fish hang out and wait to get the junk picked off of them by other fish. The only problem is it starts to get murky after about noon. 3. There is a convenience store inside the hotel where you can buy (relatively) inexpensive things for lunch and breakfast. There is fruit, yogurt, muffins, granola bars, frozen stuff, etc. that you can get if you don't want to spend the time and money eating in their restaurants.
