{"text":"The little things that make it great! My husband and I just got back from a weekend anniversary trip to NYC with a stay at the Library Hotel. We had a wonderful time! We read many reviews here on tripadvisor and decided to go for it. We were looking for something a little different and we were very happy! We checked in to the hotel late, at about 10:00 p.m. on Friday night. The desk staff was friendly and helpful. They had glasses of wine sent up to our room shortly after our check-in. (They did that for the couple that checked in right before us, too.)  Our room, the Mathematics room, was tidy, comfortable and, as mentioned by many reviewers, small. But not uncomfortably small- after all, how much space do you need in a hotel room? For what? =) There was a full-sized bed, a built-in dresser\/vanity\/tv cabinet, two nightstands, a chair and a small bookcase. There was enough room for the two of us to move around, as needed. The bed was good and comfy (with a feather-top and a down comforter), though the pillows left a little to be desired...The bathroom was a good size, clean and comfortable with a nice shower and a jar of cotton balls and cotton swabs! (I thought that was a cute touch.) In our brief time in NY we partook of the complimentary breakfast (a wonderful way to start the day) with bagels, cereal, fruit salad, pastries, coffees, teas and juices. We also enjoyed the 5-8pm wine and cheese- a great way to relax before dinner!! After our dinner we returned and sat out for a drink on the roof-top lounge. The weather was perfect and the view a lot of fun!! (The drinks were a little pricey, but I guess average for NY prices? $12 for a cocktail, $12+ for a glass of wine) But it was worth sitting out there and enjoying the evening!The location is nice- very close to grand central station and within NY walking distance to Times Square, Central Park and other must sees. We didn't have much planned but had a nice time walking around in fabulous weather!There's also a computer room with two computers and a printer which you can use for free (and we did- to print out our boarding passes and find a restaurant). And there's wireless in the rooms, if you bring your laptop, which we didn't.Everyone was very attentive to our needs and questions! We thought this was an excellent place to stay because of all those little added features that made it comfortable and functional- for the price you'd pay at a bigger hotel without any of those amenities or the personal attention!
