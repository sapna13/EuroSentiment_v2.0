{"text":"JK PLACE - The Best Place in Town! Our first trip to Florence 32 years as newlyweds lugging back packs and with little money in our pockets for three months travel in Europe found us staying in a pensione featuring bed bugs and cold showers. For our return to Florence we decided to stay in the best hotel in town - and that place is without a doubt JK Place.From the time we selected JK Place in February 2006 as our residence for an 8 day stay in Florence, we were treated like we were going to be the only guests staying in the hotel. Our travel plans were sketchy as we were not sure our children could join us until a few weeks before our trip. The staff responded to our e-mail regarding room reservations the same day and then worked with us so pleasantly and professionally to hold the room for our children until the very last minute - unfortunately they could not travel with us. Every one of our few requests were responded to with such immediacy and personal attention we thought, for the first time, this is a hotel management that understands a vacation begins before you arrive at their door - they insure that you are NOT greeted by all of the little annoyances that are standard when you check-in at a hotel - room not ready, room you booked not available, non-smoking room request not honored, etc. Ori Kafri, a young, enterprising and savvy owner, understands - it seems instinctively - how to run a small luxury hotel with an air of casualness and class that makes staying at JK Place feel welcoming, relaxing, and pampering from the time you are met at the front door by any one of their excellent staff. Heading that staff is Claudio, who knows the town and how you can live and eat among the Florentines and stay clear of the many, many, many tourists who populate most of the city. Along with Claudio Lorenzo, Sabrina, Angela, and Julien assisted us daily and they are all the definition of superior hotel professionalism - attentive to detail, thoroughly knowlegable about Florence and the environs, personable, caring and truly endearing. We are indebted to all of them for treating us with a kindness you receive from long time friends. When I left my reading glasses at a restaurant, several calls were made to discover their whereabouts, and Claudio went personally to retrieve them even though we insisted we could go ourselves.Knowing we were celebrating a sort of second honeymoon, we were treated to a surprise on our arrival, an upgrade to the master suite for our stay. Our balcony room overlooked the Piazza St. Maria Novella - even with the church masked by restoration, some renovations going on to properties in the neighborhood, and foot traffic below, the suite is quiet and comfortable and furnished in the best taste. Comments regarding the area being unsafe are unfounded. In fact JK's convenient location to the train station is a bonus as it makes travel to other Tuscan cities effortless.Although we are so pleased to offer our positive comments to support JK Place, we wish we could keep it to ourselves. However, if you, like us, want your hotel experience to be equal to all splendid treasures Florence has to offer you, then you will choose JK Place as well.Joe and Justine MedeirosWestlake Village, CA ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2553,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":2548},{"endOffset":2553,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":2548},{"endOffset":2553,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":2548}]}
