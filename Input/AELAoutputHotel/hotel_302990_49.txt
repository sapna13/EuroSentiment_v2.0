{"text":"Too small, but clean Stayed here twice with my family. Once in 2003 when SARS was declining and the second time in 2005. Rates back then were a lot cheaper than now, of course. The low price was the main reason we stayed there the second time. Back in 2003, free internet service was available through the TV. They were using an extremely old version of Windows (3.1 maybe?) But it worked! Checked my email, etc....But in 2005, when Harbour Plaza took over management of the hotel, internet access was no longer available through the TV. Internet access was only available at the business center or if I had a laptop. Like previous reviewers, I also agree that the rooms are tiny. I had booked a standard room with two beds. Judging from their official website, the other rooms below the executive suite level are probably just as small as the standard room. Cramped space, not much room for two people. I felt claustrophobic by the time I left the hotel. I would never stay there again. I'm going back to HK Summer 2007, but I'm not going back to Kowloon Hotel. They're charging around $119 (as of May 2007) for a standard room on some websites when I can find larger rooms or similarly-sized rooms for a cheaper price. But the rooms were clean and the bathroom was a good size. The hotel is in a very good location with Starbucks next door, walking distance to Star Ferry Terminal, the Harbour City mall and Ocean Terminal, and the MTR entrance is located within the hotel lobby.
