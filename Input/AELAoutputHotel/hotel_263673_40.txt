{"text":"Loved the Degli Orafi The Degli Orafi enjoys what I would have to term the best location in Florence. It is directly next to the Ufizzi and one block away from the Ponte Vecchio, with views of the Duomo.As soon as the doors slide open, you know that you are in a special place, with a fragrant large fresh flower arrangement and tastefully appointed but still comfortable lobby.We stayed in their luxury apartments, with a downstairs containing a kitchen complete with plates and cutlery, a dining room with marble table, a living room, a bedroom and bath, and upstairs, a large bedroom and bathroom along with a walk in closet.The only thing that was bothersome was the weak air conditioning on the upper floor of the apartment, which was located on their highest part of the hotel. It could hold the temperature at 24 degree Centigrade, but it could get no colder.The room and hotel was very clean throughout.We liked the thick terrycloth bathrobe and new slippers provided for our use.We had no view to speak of, as we looked out onto a sqaure of other windows like our own. That didn't bother us so much, because we really appreciated the spaciousness of the rooms.There were 3 flat screen TV's located throughout the apartment.Water bottles from the minibar were free, and the breakfast each day (which lasted until 11am), was spectacular, with unusual extras like poached pears, and brie cheese along with the usual compliment of delicious pastries, fruits, eggs, sliced meats and cheeses, cereals, etc.The staff was very helpful and attentive.We would be happy to stay there again..
