{"text":"Excellent Location, except for the metro noise We stayed here over the Easter bank holiday weekend in March and it suited us really well.The location is ideal. Only a few steps away is a metro station, which is both a positive and a negative. It's great because you can quickly get around the city and further afield, but our room did shake every time a train went through the metro station. It didn't bother us too much, as we didn't spend that much time in the hotel anyway.The hotel itself is fine. The staff were extremely helpful and friendly. If you make the effort to speak a few works of Spanish, then this is really appreciated. They booked a table for us at a restaurant we had been recommended to visit by someone who used to live there - L'Olive and it was amazing. The restaurant is only 5 mins' walk from the hotel and worth every penny, but you will need to book.Our room was large with high ceilings and a separate hallway entrance area that also led to the bathroom.The breakfast room was a bit small for the number of guests and it could be a bit of a rugby scrum, but the food was replenished quite quickly.Our weekend stay was very expensive, but we think this was because Easter weekend and we booked quite late.In summary, the hotel is in an excellent location and we enjoyed our stay. Just a shame about the shaking room each time a train went through the metro station. ","annotations":[]}
