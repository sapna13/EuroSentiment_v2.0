{"text":"Place: OK Service: THE WORST ANYWHERE!!! First let me say I am a seasoned traveller who has stayed at many resorts in many countries. I am also very easy going. I would clean my own room and make my own food if I could. I am 180 degrees from demanding. That being said, this place is the worst of the worst. I couldn't believe all of the guests complaining to uncaring service people, and what was more shocking is their complete lack of caring. They couldn't have cared less if a guest had a complaint, and there were MANY. I swear I must have witnessed a dozen people just insanely angered every day, and these were only the ones I saw. From the minute we arrived and had to wait an hour TWICE to check in (one hour to tell them we were there, another hour 3 hours later to get our key to the room) It seemed like the more people who were waiting for service, the more people working the desk would disappear. At one point there were 20 people waiting to be checked, and only one (inept,slow,maybe braindead) person working the front desk. In all my life had never even heard of such a thng, much less see it for myself.I discovered later that the only thing the owner of the hotel wants to do is sell VIP packages that have to pay an annual fee. The vacationing guests they obviously had little if any care for. The beach was nice enough, but was covered in garbage and cigarette butts untill about 10 or 11 a.m., when the service people finally came out to clean (doing a poor job at that).The waiters were inept (somehow a diet coke sounds like a rum and coke. Good thing I am not a recovering alcoholic, after taking a sip of that strong drink I would have fallen right off the wagon.) I ended up getting up and getting my own drinks after 6 or 7 such mistakes (for the record, I speak perfect spanish, there was no mistake on my part, just incompetence on theirs)Don't even think about leaving the resort. Absolutely nothing to see. I took a bus to the nearby (one hour ride) town of Higuey, where we were harrased my touts non-stop (no exageration) for 4 hours. Dirty, disgusting, and completely pointless trip indeed. I felt like I was back in Bombay, but 10 times worse. Absolutely horrible.All in all, if you have the patience of Mother Theresa, you might end up leaving with your wits in tact, but needing another vacationing regardless. Spend your money elsewhere. There are many all-inclusives in the area and in other countries. SKIP THIS ONE!
