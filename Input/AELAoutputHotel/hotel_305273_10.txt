{"text":"More of a youth hostel than a hotel I just got back from a weekend in Amsterdam where I spent two nights at Marnix Hotel with 5 friends. Since it was all booked last minute we did not have much choice as far as accomodation was concerned. But we're all former backpackers in our thirties now and decided it would be fun to re-live that dorm-room experience. Since one of us is pregnant though, we asked if the room had a private bathroom. We got a very nice answer saying, yes, of course the room has a private bathroom. As we got there we first had to make it to the third floor: the steepest and narrowest stairway I have ever seen! The room was about as big as my home bathroom (and I live in a small flat) with three bunk beds, no room for our bags (even very small ones) and NO BATHROOM. One of my friends had printed out the booking e-mail and made her way back down to complain only to be told that dorm rooms have no en suite bathroom and that since they're all booked out and all Amsterdam is booked out we would just have to make do...Since it was supposed to be a fun weekend we decided to laugh about it and adjusted but I still think at a 150 euros per night it was a rip-off. Had we known we would have just gone for a hostel that calls itself a hostel: at least we would have known what to expect! One last thing: the breakfast room is the tiny lobby which fits about 10 people. If like most of us you get up between 9 and 10 forget about finding a chair...we decided to splurge and went for the breakfast buffet at the American Caf√ã√\u2022√ñ (just 5 minutes up the street) were you can sip champagne and eat all you can for 20 euros!!! All in all the Marnix Hotel is a youth hostel, the room and shared bathroom were clean and the beds comfortable. If you simply need somewhere to sleep and everywhere else is booked out, go for it. If not take the time to look for something decent (Hotel Sint Nicolaas by the main station, where we were allowed to leave our luggage FOR FREE finding the storage room at the station full, seemed very nice).
