And of course ...... the signature Conrad rubber ducky  Conrad Teddy bear. Now, that's the REAL reason why I stay in Conrad!!Other amenities=============When you have back-to back meetings, there's just no time to check out the pool  gym. Now you know why that Conrad Teddy bear is an important companion. Or that Rubby Ducky. At least the Conrad recognises that there is a child in everyone of us!!Conclusion==========I have stayed in the Marriott  Shangri-la in Pacific Place, but give me the Conrad anytime. The Marriot feels used  old. The Shangri-la has an old dame feel (some call it grand). I like the Conrad because, on relative terms, it is the most modern of the three, both decor and personality. You could just stay in-doors and vegetate  watch dvd. For those on business, bring your other half along, so that your other half can enjoy Conrad while you slog yourself away.
