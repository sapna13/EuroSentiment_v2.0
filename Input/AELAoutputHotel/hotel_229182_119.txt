{"text":"WARNING. Definately NOT worth a five star rating. Dear Hotel Seekers in Amsterdam. A note of WARNING!Please note that the Krasnapolsky does not meet the required standard of five stars! Hence lower your standards if you are prepared the pay the overpriced amounts charged by this far below ''five star'' standard hotel.I stayed in an executive room in the royal wing despite my suspicions after seeying all the varied reviews on different websites (should have been a warning already!!!). This leads me to the first and only advantage over other five stars in Amsterdam - it's location and the only reason I went forward with my reservation.Here's the horror in a nutshell.-incredibly slow reception. honestly, only two receptionists for a hotel this size. what are you thinking? you could see the build up anger\/ frustrations of everyone waiting in 2 queues of minimum 5 people (and more during checkout times!!!) - non smoking room. nonetheless the room stank of smoke and there were cigarette burn marks in the curtains and night stands!!! - the exec room wasn't sound proof at all. I was woken up by someone elses wake up call. had to get up myself at 5 AM walk into the already vacant room and switch it off myself!!! To illustrate the noise levels even further I could hear other peoples conversations in the corridors word for word!!!- the exec room is thus far from the main hotel that any ''hot'' food from 24h room service is served cold. as was my experience with the bltc sandwich and margarita pizza!- the alley between the hotel and the royal wing is often visited by drugdealers and or youths smoking drugs. o.k. it's Amsterdam but single females, older people could feel threatened.- prostitutes tend to visit this hotel. coming back one night and going up in the elevator a ''lady of the night'' offered me her services! could not believe it!!! after declining kindly she asked me whether I could buzz her out since the door is key activated. obviously she did not have one!!!- it's design has been radically changed the last 4\/5 years. the winter garden is beautiful but the rest of the hotel lacks in design and luxury. Most certainly not the interioir one would expect from a five star hotel! It has been downgraded to an unoriginal and plain ''modern'' design which is a shame considering the hotel history. - the standard rooms are quite cheap but attract all kinds of riff raff. definately not the kind of people one would expect in a luxury hotel. please don't get me wrong im really open minded but this is simply an observation. - the products offered in the bath room were very cheap and horrible. really I do not want to use shampoo that leaves me smelling like an orange or a yelly bean!!!- frankly you cannot charge 254 euros nighly for the exec room and have all the above happening to you.All in all. Please take my advise and stay away from this hotel. I'm a Dutch citizen living in London and a fond lover of hotels. I most definately do not hold a grudge although I should after experiencing the above!!!There are much much nicer hotel in Amsterdam along the grachten\/canals that are worthy of their 4 and 5 star rating!!Krasnapolski...i'm sorry you should only have four minus!!!!
