{"text":"What a Horrible Nightmare High class expensive DUMP:Our children made a reservation in the San Juan Hotel and Casino, Isla Verde Puerto Rico 7\/14-7\/17 2006 $896.00,. as a gift for Dad's 70th brithday. We checked in on Friday the 14th , that's when our NIGHTMARE began. The day was shot !! we were given ROOM 426, dirty, musty smelly, dingy rugs, in front of the closet the rug was wet , a leak from the A\/C vent, this room located next to the elevator is like living next to the railroad tracks, it overlooks the roofs of other buildings A\/C units ,pipes and vents with the ocean at a far distance.We called to complaint and were told they would send someone, after a 45 minute wait just seating and wating, we decided to go to the front desk and have our room changed. A very annoyed clerk told us they had no other rooms , they are going THROUGH RENOVATIONS, to try ROOM 326 another DUMP, next to the elevator were a dirty tissue had been left behind , on the smoking floor and NO windows. We again complaint, butNo one cared why we were there. Since we had no other place to sleep we spent the night there, after calling the kids and told them what was happening. Thank GOD , AMEX was able to move us out next morning .Don't beleive the hipes, the AMBIANCE, is all LOBBY. From this experience, is an expensive high class DUMPSTER..Never to return, and passing on the word .Agustina  Anibal Perez ","annotations":[]}
