{"text":"A 2 star dump for a 5 star price We went to Paradisus Punta Cana to celebrate our anniversary. My travel agent had been there previously and highly recommended it as a 5 star luxury resort. We upgraded our stay to Royal Service so we could take advantage of the bigger room, better service and adults only pool. What a waste of time and money. When we arrived they did not have our reservation. After 3 tours of the resort they finally found us a room. The room had a bed, desk, and 2 chairs - not what I would call a suite but that was they only size room offered in Royal Service. We were too tired from traveling to notice much and simply went to bed the first night. When we woke up the next day we noticed the blood stains on the sheets, the cigarette holes in the shower curtain, the strange orange stains all over the tile floor, and the bugs crawling all over the desk. On our first full day we were assaulted by our butler with offers of massages, room upgrades, and special dinners. He took us to show us the rooms we could upgrade to and then asked us to join the Sol Melia vacation club. When we refused to join the club the butler disappeared and our Royal Service dried up. When we asked for rides to the lobby with our golf clubs they never sent anyone. When we asked for dinner reservations we were told the restaurants were full or closed. When we called Royal Service to ask to have our toilet fixed, our safe fixed and our sliding glass door fixed we were told it was not their job and they did not offer to contact the right person to take care of it. The Royal Service staff was rude and refused to help us make golf reservations at certain courses even though the courses were on a list of courses that they provided to us. When I asked to speak to a manager I was directed to the public relations desk and the gentleman there was not interested in helping me. The food and drinks were just okay and the food was never served at the correct temperature. Also, every one of the 10 resort restaurants seems to think it is correct to servce red wine chilled and white wine warm. All of the alcoholic drinks were severely watered down as well. The best drink I had during my stay was a beer I bought at a bar down the street from the resort because it was cold. I could go on but you get the idea - if you want to go to the Domincan pick another resort!
