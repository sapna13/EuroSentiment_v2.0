{"text":"Fab stay at The Chedi I think the last couple of reviews posted about this hotel are far from objective, so I wanted to comment upon what a fabulous stay we had at the Chedi. I can understand people moaning about lack of atmosphere, as it is very peaceful and quiet. But peace and quiet and a serene environment are what many people want from a hotel! If we wanted to make friends with fellow guests by the pool or the bar, then we would have stayed somewhere else, for example, Butlins.We spent the first 4 nights of our honeymoon at the Chedi and for us it was perfect. Very relaxing, our butler couldn't do enough for us and went out of his way to make it a fabulous experience. Small things like bringing more coathangers to our room because he saw that we had used all of them; bringing an adaptor plug because he saw that we had unplugged a bedside lamp to plug in one of our gadgets; cleaning our shoes after we had been for a rice paddie walk; bringing cold water and towels whilst we played tennis. I could go on.I also loved the Club concept, which meant that this hotel was actually great value. By the time you have had your clothes laundered each day, eaten your delicious breakfast, enjoyed complimentary drinks all day at the pool and from the mini bar in your room, taken afternoon tea, enjoyed a sunset cocktail and had private car transport into and out of Ubud whenever you like, I would say that the room rate which includes all these items suddenly looks very reasonable.Accusations by reviewers that the hotel tried to push you into doing things from which it took a huge cut just aren't true from my experience. And, in any event, it seems rather mean-spirited to make such an allegation, if you have happily enjoyed so many complimentary items that are included within the room rate!I would definitiely recommend a stay in this hotel to anyone.
