{"text":"Lacking cleanliness We just returned from a trip to Old San Juan where we stayed at this hotel. The room was comfortable; however, the maids do not clean the room. We stayed for four night and on three occasions we had to call housekeeping to have them go over the room that was supposedly cleaned while we were out. On one occasion my husband and I sat in the corridor and watch a maid go into our room by taking a fresh set of towels from the car standing in the corridor and he went into the room. He spent 15 minutes and he came out and went into another room. He did not have any disinfectant,, glass cleaner, clean classes in his hands. We went in after he left the room. I found that he had just taken the soiled towels and wiped down the face basin and the class shelf above it. He had not touched the tub which was dirty I do not know how he cleaned the cups and glasses in the room.I went to housekeeping and called the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºupervisor√à√\u2020\u2022?she came and examined the room then she sent him to get the disinfecting solution to clean the tub and then asked me if it was better. Having to complain about the cleanliness of the room three times made me not appreciate the uniqueness of the hotel and it ruined my stay. Also, do not eat at the hotel because the cost is outrageous, even higher than Hawaii. Breakfast for two, with two eggs and toast, three pieces of fruits is $30.00 and up. Here is another example, two tasteless appetizers in the hotel caf√ã√\u2022√ñ with two fruit cocktails, $60.00.
