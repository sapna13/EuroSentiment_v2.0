{"text":"Great hotel, cannot recommend highly enough My husband and I stayed at Hotel Fusion for a week in March, and we could not have asked for anything more. The hotel is located, as many have said before me, a block from Union Square and is brilliant for public transport as well, less than a 5 minute walk to the infamous cable cars. The staff at the hotel were wonderful, and always on hand for anything we needed (which wasn't much!) and the internet access was brilliant - we got a cable for $2 and had no problems at all with accessing the net in our room.Room wise, it was perfect for us, and given that my husband is 66, there are not many people taller, and he had no problem with anything. The rooms may not be as big as many American hotel rooms, but when compared to most European hotel rooms, it was on a par with most of them I've stayed at (having stayed in many in England, France, Holland and Belgium). We had no problem with noise what-so-ever, but we did have an inward facing room, so that could have had something to do with it. We also had no complaints about the lack of air-con, but it didn't get over 80f while we were there - I can imagine it might be a problem in the height of summer.The only real draw-back with this hotel inflicts every hotel in the area - the number of homeless people that constantly ask you for money whenever you step out of the safety of the hotel or a shop - but we never felt in danger, just a little embarassed at times, as I felt terrible saying no - but I was told not to give in as they'll never leave you alone if they see you again...I cannot recommend Hotel Fusion highly enough, and would happily stay there again and recommend it to friends and family alike.
