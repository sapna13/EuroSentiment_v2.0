{"text":"Butlins in Bavarro If you are looking for a good hotel then this one is not for you. We had originally booked the Grand Palladium Resort and Spa and were advised 5 days before our flight on 27\/12\/07 that this was not available. We were allocated the Riu Bambu, and advised by Thomsons agent and call centre that this hotel gets a lot of revisits. I cannot imagine anyone being happy with this hotel, as all clients we spoke to were not happy. The rooms are small, old and in need of refurbishment. Tiles cracked, holes and cracks in walls, mattresses stained, ensuite tatty. The hotel is called a Club Hotel, but no one advised us of what this meant. It is very lively, and lots of noise. There is no service at tables in bars or restaurant, it is all self service. The drinks stations where you helped yourself were not clean, and plastic glasses were washed and and drained wet on the surface beside machines. Not at all hygenic. Four out of the six of us suffered with upset stomachs, and we beleive this is due to cleanliness of these stations. Food - not great, we had to chose carefully and watch what we ate, very repetative. We only ate the evening meal about 4 nights out of 14, as it was so overbooked, that it was difficult to get a table. We did not use the a la carte, as the feedback from other hotel clients did not come back good. Six people we met paid to upgrade and use the Rui Palace next door, and they were charged $50 each per day, which we felt was too much extra to pay, since this holiday was not in our opinion a cheap one. The animacion team are on the go all day and night, but their noise and games are over the top. At 4 pm they clear the pool of children and play adult games, which are what can only be described as 18-30 style and crude. We did not go there to have a grandchildren watch women rubbing themselves up agains the men - ie lap dancing and pole dancing. (We found this offensive).This is not a 4T (or 5* as the Dominicans have graded) it is no higher than a 3*.The chemist on the site is unbelievable expensive. Whilst away we needed to buy some antibiotics, and cough linctus, and were charged √ä√£¬¢25 for each medicine. For 5 tablets of antibiotics and a bottle of cough lincuts we felt that the Riu group were taking advantage of the holiday makets. The only saving grace for this hotel is the beach and location is great.
