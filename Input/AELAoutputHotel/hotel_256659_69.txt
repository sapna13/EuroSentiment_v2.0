{"text":"One of the best in the world - no complaints for us We ended our two week Australian vacation at the Westin in Sydney and the easiest way to describe it is as icing on a cake. Everything about our stay was perfect. When we checked in at 12, we were escorted right up to our room. While we didn't have a view, we were so grateful to be able to get our room at that early time that we didn't care. The room is nothing short of luxury, with the bathtub being the best and most comfortable tub for one or two to enjoy. The rain showerhead was so good that I want the exact one in my home. The bed was like a cloud. One morning we ordered room service breakfast (by the way, one person full breakfast is enough for 3 people - it was enormous and an amazing value for $38 for room service), and just lounged in their cozy bathrobes. It couldn't have been more peaceful and wonderful.The gym is also fabulous. It is not just a hotel gym, but one that people in Sydney actually sign up for. It has classes, an entire room of cardio equipment and very well stocked weight room. We were incredibly impressed with this gym and can definitely recommend it, even for the biggest fitness buffs.Now, you really don't want to leave your room it's so wonderful, but when you do, you find that you are seconds away from the best shopping in Sydney. It is a 10 minute walk down to the quay, and the ferries where you can explore the beaches and the harbour life. We found the staff to be exceptional, as we had some faxes and important calls. They helped us through all of the business we had to do, as well as our tourist desires. We were sending things to Canada and they even helped us figure out the codes to dial.We don't give 5\/5 ratings very often but this one deserved it.
