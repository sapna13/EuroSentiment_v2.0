{"text":"Dream was great We just returned from a weeklong stay at Dreams Punta Cana, and it was a very good vacation. The resort is beautiful and well kept for Dominican standards. If you really look you'll find things wrong, but we looked at the big picture. The three things that were a let down were the ocean,the vendors and the noise. The ocean was really rough, and the last two days it was closed. They have a fantastic pool, so it wasn't too bad, but it for a seaside resort you kind of expect the ocean. The room we had was very nice, but the hallways echo loudly, and the walls were kind of thin. We hardly slept at all the first night, but we got used to it. A few times a week the resort lets in vendors to sell their stuff around the lobby. They are really pushy and you have to firmly tell them you're not interested. The vendors in Mexico were nowhere nearly as pushy.The positives were the food, the bars, the weather and the entertainment and activities. Our kids loved the Explorers Club last year in Cancun Dreams, but hardly spent an hour at the club here... they're a little older now, and found plenty of kids to play with in the pool and on the beach.The ride to the resort was a bit of an adventure, but it's a different country and you have to be prepared for different things. It's a little bumpy and wild. One last thing, don't exchange your US $ for Dominican. You won't need it as everywhere we went thery wanted to be paid in US$. I tried to get some Dominican coins for the kids, and couldn't find any, even at the airport!
