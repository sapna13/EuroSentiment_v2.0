{"text":"Below average hotel I stayed at the Mercure Hotel Sydney Airport for one night due to an interview that was being held there the following day. The rate was $230 which was pretty expensive, but fine. I arrived approximately 9pm and was polite to check-in staff, but they were extremely unfriendly. I went to my room and after using the toilet, found that it kept running very loudly after being flushed. I called the reception and they said they would send somebody up to look at it. Half an hour later, the toilet was still running, and I wanted just to sleep as my conference was early the following morning. So I called the reception and asked to move rooms, which she said would be fine. She asked me to leave my luggage in the present room as it would be shifted and go down to reception. When I arrived at the reception, a different staff member looked at me bizarrely when I said I was asked to come down to change room. She very abruptly went to check and when she came back, she handed me a new key. I asked if I should go back to my room and get my stuff. She asked me What stuff? before agreeing and telling me to get it myself.The new hotel room was fine and spacious, just like the first one. The rooms are looking a little old but they have a great view of the airport tarmac out the windows. I ordered breakfast and lunch the following days from Room Service and these were delivered promptly and with a smile. It seems the hotel could do with re-training their front counter staff. The room service was great. ","annotations":[]}
