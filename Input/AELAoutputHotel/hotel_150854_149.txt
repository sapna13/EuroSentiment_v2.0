{"text":"A palace? hmmmm First off: The resort is beautiful, incredible scenery, landscape and first class beaches and rooms. The hotel rooms are comparable to 4 star resorts. Felt very safe there. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly.Food: ehhh. I would say it was edible at times, fair to poor most times, however, it's not any better at the other Riu's we snuck into or sampled in this resort complex. Stick to the buffet as you are bound to find at least one item you can tolerate. The British and Germans raved about the food and couldn't stop taking pictures of the buffet, but in the US, The Golden Corral beats this buffet morning, noon and night and I'm not a huge Golden Corral fan, but that's what level you are dealing with.Drinks: Awful, every bar served drink, unless it is frozen. Frozen was good. The mojito tasted like jet fuel.Service: Excellent, but there is a huge language barrier, better know how to speak Spanish, French or German.Nuisance: It's all inclusive, but the pay-for sea sports people are everywhere hitting you up. The country is very poor, leaving the resort is not appealing. The other pain in the rear was scheduling dinner, which must be done between 7a and 10a of the same day and the dinner restaurants confine you to an all out bad meal or semi-edible meal. Stick to the buffets at the general restaurant. There are snacks 24hours a day, you just better know where to go, because they are not in the same place. Favorite thing: The beach, although I sat in at least 4 broken lounge chairs while I was there, but the ice cream cones all day long near the pool are great and the pool at the macao is the best.Casino: Nice, I won. Watch out for the 'house' games they try to lure you into.In my opinion, this is the best Riu property out of all of them in Punta Canna, but the food is not good, unless you are from Britain I guess. This is a very European geared resort and we are not snobs, because we eat fast food in the US and great meals at fine restaurants and we travel the Carribean often. If you can stay here cheap and for no more than 4 days, you are in good shape. The region is years from becomiing a major player against other places like the Caymans or Bahamas. An American resort could come in here and destroy the competition, but there must be a good reason they have not at this point.
