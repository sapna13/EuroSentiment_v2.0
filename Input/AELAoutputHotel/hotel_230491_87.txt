{"text":"Lives up to the hype We stayed at the Henri for 2 nights. The hotel is located in the 5eme and, therefore, very centrally located. It is situated on a quiet little side street, but the general area has several eating and shopping establishments. As for the hotel itself, it is quite nice. The lobby is small, but very well kept. The staff is very professional (we encountered 3 desk clerks during our stay) and most had ample English speaking skills. Hicham was on duty when we arrived (I told you that I would mention you, Hicham√à√\u2020\u2022? and had lots of information about the area and Paris in general. As for the room, our room was of average size (for Central Paris), I suppose. It was very clean, however. I do love a clean hotel room and ours did not disappoint. The bathroom was also very neat and tidy. Our room had two single beds, a desk, nightstand and large dresser. There were also two wardrobes\/closets for clothing. A mini-fridge, cutlery, drinking utensils and hot stove were also in the room. This was a very nice touch since we brought food and wine back to the room. We paid 160E per night and this was a very good deal. I messed up our booking (on Booking.com), initially, and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ realize my error until a few weeks before arrival. By then, rooms were more scarce and the price had gone up. However, the hotel honored the price that was available at the time of my earlier booking, thereby saving us about 20E\/night. Not a ton of money, but a very nice gesture on behalf of hotel management. All in all, this hotel lives up to its lofty reviews on TA. It represents great value for the money and the location is fabulous. Paris is a very walkable city and this hotel is in a great location and within 2 blocks of a metro line. Definitely recommended.
