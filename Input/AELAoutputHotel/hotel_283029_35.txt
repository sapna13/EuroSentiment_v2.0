{"text":"just perfect! i went on a romantic trip with my girlfriend - its was our 1st overseas holiday together - ofcourse we spend lots of time together already but this was our first time living together and doing everything together for 3 days - as you can imagine the hotel would be very important to us! and i have to say everything was great! when we first arrived we were welcomed and had help taking our luggage to our rooms - the place just had a warm, personal and friendly feeling. The decor is lovely too and very unique boutique style.Our room was perfect - not too big not too small just right for a couple. There was cable TV, ipod docking station, DVD etc and a lovley bed - very clean with modern theme throughout. the bathroom was a bit small but a great shower lovely mirrors.downstairs in the lobby there is internet and also a cosy bar area with great big comfy sofas perfect for rexaling before going out or after you get back - they had every drink possible in the bar and all staff from reception to bar and cleaners were great and friendly! The location is fantatic but get your bearings because the streets look the same so sometimes a wrong turn can put you right off track - the best way to the local bars clubs etc is to go through and behind the Hard Rock Cafe - once here you can get anywhere from the shopping areas right to red light district and dam square. Vondel Park is like 3-5 minutes away and also the trams are great - quick clean and on time they can take you anywhere and fast too! cabs in to dam sqaure are cheap too so if your out late get one back! we got lost on the way home just becuase we preferred to walk talking in the sights and sounds! there are also bikes with a small carrier at the back perfect for 2 people - they are cheap and about 6 euro per person (12 Euro as they only hold 2 people) but you can get these anywhere and the drivers tend to give you a tour, expaining what everything is as you pass - good to know stuff too!all in all we had a great stay and saw and did so much - the hotel is great and i will be staying again soon! thanks for a great stay! and Amsterdam in itself is a lovely place - no matter what your going for you can find it there!the hotel Roemer is great value for money, location, comfort, and ambience! go there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!i have been to amsterdam about 20 times (my job takes me there too) and on all types of visits from working, with the lads on a crazy weekend, with a girl on a quiet relaxing break, on a music holiday to go clubbing and raving etc - and also a 17 year old years ago to experience the place and definitley the hotel Roemer just had something special so would say its better then the 5 star hotels i stay in when working in amsterdam!thanks!Omar - London!
