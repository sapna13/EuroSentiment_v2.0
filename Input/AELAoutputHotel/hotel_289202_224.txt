{"text":"Fantastic Little hotel I am currently on a two night stay at the Hotel Antiche Figure, Venezia as the final leg of my trip to Italy. A lot has already been said about this hotel, the quality of the rooms, the friendly staff etc and they are all true so I won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go into too much detail. What I will say is that I thought the location was really good. If you are arriving by train then it really is only across the Ponte dei Scalzi, just a couple of minutes walk. Ok the bridge is very steep and it can get very hot in Venice at this time of year but if you are incapable of taking your luggage over this bridge then I would suggest that Venice is probably not the best place for you to visit as it does involve a great deal of walking and climbing over bridges (after all there are over 1000 of them). OK there are probably more central locations down the Grand Canal but these are generally more expensive and I would suggest not such good value for money as the Antiche Figure.I booked the hotel entirely on the strength of the TA reviews giving this hotel a #3 status in Venice went a long way and as usual TA visitors did not let me down. The hotel management obviously keep an eye on this website as they posted a retort to one review a couple of days ago which is one of the great things about this site and is what makes it unbiased. Anyway if they are reading this after I post it just send the Champagne to the room ;-).I booked through an agent (otel.com) but then on the off chance e-mailed the hotel directly to see if they had a canal view room. They replied promptly and for 40 euros per night extra I was upgraded to room 212 which had a small balcony, one of only two with a balcony overlooking the canal. This was a great little bonus as I really enjoyed sitting there watching the hustle and bustle of the canal especially waking up at 06:30 and watching the local papers being delivered along with everything else Venice needs during the day. As previous reviews have said the ACTV stop Ferrovia is directly across from the hotel so you only have to cross the ponte and you can go wherever you like in Venice by vaparetto. One way trips cost 6 euros and 24 hour tickets 15 euros (no reduction for children). You can also get 12, 48  72 hour tickets, see the ACTV website. Remember to validate your ticket in the yellow stamping machines, I nearly got into trouble for this. If in doubt the staff in the hotel will give you more info. Use the #1 or #82 line to get all the way down the Grand Canal and to the Piazza San Marco. The 82 is a little quicker as it has fewer stops. Alternatively you can order a water taxi to get you wherever you want to go.Anyway I was gonna keep this one short so in summary this is a nice, comfortable, well run hotel. The location is great for getting in and out of Venice especially if you are arriving for the first time and anyway Venice is a small city so it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not really an issue unless you really want to stay nearer the so called hotspots. The rooms are well appointed and clean. Staff are great. The internet connection is FREE just ask for a LAN cable at the front desk (my campaign for hotels to provide free internet access is gaining support at last) which is fantastic since it cost me 15 euros a night in Rome. The breakfast is good, probably not the best in the world as already stated by the manager, but a good choice of pastries, drinks etc. You are not going to get a good ol√à√\u2020\u2022?American\/English breakfast in Venice as far as I can see so when in Venezia etc. It was sufficient for me before a long walk around Venice.I would heartily recommend this hotel to anyone.
