{"text":"Bring plenty of Starbuck's coffee with you Excellence in Punta Cana is a beautiful resort. The open lobby is impressive and beautiful. The vast majority of the guests were couples, not a place for single people. Lots of newlyweds and most of the guests were in their 20's and 30's. Almost all of the guests were American.The beach is very pretty, with rows of palm trees on each side. There is a great breeze all day long, so you can sit for long periods without feeling the heat. The water is rough with great waves for boogey boarding, but the undertow was very strong, so you need to be careful. There is a nice lunch cooked on the beach each day, so you do not have to go to a restaurant. The pool is nice as well., with the pool bar being the center of activity. There are lots of lounges, hammocks and poolside beds. The rooms were very nice with large jacuzzis and a four poster bed. The help was very accommodating. Unfortunately, many of them did not speak or even understand English,so you need to bring your Spanish-English dictionary. They have multiple restaurants and the food was similar to cruise food, not great, but good. The French Restaurant, Chez Isabelle, was the best. We ate at the Spanish (Barcelona), the Asian (Spice), and the Steak (Grille) restaurants. All of them were good. There was no need for a reservation and the waits were short. The service was excellent, as they try to provide for your every need. Like a cruise, the help is required to say 'Olla and Buenos Dias\/Nochos' and smile.On the down side:Tthere is NO REAL COFFEE!!!!!!!! They only served instant coffee. I went through withdrawals for a good cup of coffee. The daily shows in the evening are amateurish, with lip-syncing dancers in the early part of the week. While 24 hour room service is provided, you need to order your food hours before you really want to eat it. The rooms smelled musty and the AC was average at best.. The trip from the airport, which is a hut by the way, was horrible and the worst part of the trip. We got transportation to the hotel from Orbitz, thinking it would provide us the best chance at a quakity trip to the hotel, NOT!!. We got on a bus with about 20 other people, we stopped at 10 different hotels. The roads, many of which were unpaved or paqed, but full of hundreds of potholes of all sizes. Each time we stopped, I thougt our luggage would be stolen from the trailer behond the bus. It took us the better part of 2 hours to finally get to the resort after 5:00pm, which basically ruined our first day. The island is disgraceful outside the resorts and many of them are protected by barbed wire. Another interesting fact is that there is a $10\/person Tourist fee to enter the Dominican RepublicOverall, I would go back to Excellence, but not in the Dominican Republic ","annotations":[{"endOffset":33,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":27},{"endOffset":614,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":610},{"endOffset":614,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":610},{"endOffset":1562,"mention":"COFFEE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1556},{"endOffset":1562,"mention":"COFFEE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1556},{"endOffset":1562,"mention":"COFFEE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1556},{"endOffset":1562,"mention":"COFFEE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1556},{"endOffset":1562,"mention":"COFFEE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1556},{"endOffset":1562,"mention":"COFFEE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1556},{"endOffset":1562,"mention":"COFFEE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1556},{"endOffset":1562,"mention":"COFFEE","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1556},{"endOffset":1602,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1596},{"endOffset":1655,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1649}]}
