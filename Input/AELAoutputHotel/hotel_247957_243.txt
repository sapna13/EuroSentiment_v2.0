{"text":"Doubt I'll GO Back! Everything about this resort on the outside is beautiful. I am going to start with the good. Beautiful beach, pools, gardens, clean, tons of food (okay). Good bars, Good service only from the hardworking folks. Great entertainment.The reason for not returning would be the FRONT desk and the people whom went through my luggage!My reservation was not correct as ocean view as it turns out this happends a lot. A lot of over booking and giving rooms to upgrade others. This took a day to straighten out. The first room I was put in was terrible. Loose wires on lamps no clean bedding or towels the first night was a nightmare. I allowed luggage delivery against my better judgement and they yelled at me to leave it and said 5 minutes. 5 minutes turned into 2 hours and they left it in front of the door.My luggage had been gone through somewhere between the airport and my room and things were missing and ruined. So I can't really say where the mis-hap \/ happened. Our second room had a beautiful view of the ocean and much nicer., However we were always interrupted with workers fixing something showers, toilets whatever at what ever hour. They were not called or complained for so I didn't understand why they kept showing up.I also believe that information for americans English was very poor. We were not as welcome as others and I felt this way our entire stay. It is a large mixing pot of nationalities. French, Germans, Russian, Eucraine, Swede, American, Canadians. You name it they visited. I just felt unwelcomed. Mainly by the front desk.The service from the front desk was disgusting and rude and they should be cleaning the gutters instead of a few they have doing it. Over-all if I didn't have the front desk experiance and the luggage issue I may return. However lack of help will be the reason not to. If you already made reservations for this resort you will probably have a good time just make sure you get what you pay for. ","annotations":[]}
