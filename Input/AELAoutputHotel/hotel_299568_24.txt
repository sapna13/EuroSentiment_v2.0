{"text":"What a dump How this hotel gets a 4 star rating is beyond me. We booked through the hotel website and the place looked great. That's not what we got. Our room would have been a 2 star rating.The room smelt like it had not been aired for ages. dark and dank, had to have lights on day and night. Old and decrepit some things that needed attention, cleaning, had ro ring every day for something that had been missed ie not enough towels we needed 3, we kept getting 2, even though there were 3 beds, run out of toilet roll, water not draiing away in the shower, they came to fix it but didn't rinse away the gunk that was causing the blockage, disgusting, the reading light above the bed (halogen) kept flashing on\/off. The knob to pull to get the water to come out of the shower head, was so stiff you had to use a towel to grab it. The drying line in the bathroom didn't work. The remote control for the tv was held together with sellotape. The picture on the tv was sometimes not watchable. The knob to release the sink plug was broken so you had to use scissors to pull out the plug. The aircon was noisy not terribly cold. There were bathrobes in the closet that were old and grey, they started their lives white, looked like they'd been hanging for years.When i went to complain about some of these things on the first day, all they could do was offer me a beach cabana at AUS$250 per night EXTRA.People moved into the room next door, we could hear everything they were watching on tv. The only food we tried was a toasted melt for my daughter, how could you mess that up?? It came with the saddest looking fries you've ever seen soggy and warm. We didn't venture to the restaurant for any main meals after that.The pool had stuff floating in it, i was worried incase my daughter picked up an ear infection. At breakfast every day you had to go and get your own coffee as the staff were in a dream world of their own and didn't notice when people needed refills.Our stay in Bali was for 16 nights and we only booked 10 at this hotel, lucky we didn't book the whole stay there. Nicer hotel down the road is Oasis (same price) we ended up moving to BaliKahma next door, higher price but simply stunning service and accommodation.
