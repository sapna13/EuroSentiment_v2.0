{"text":"Loved the Hotel - Fabulous Views and Pool We stayed at the UN Millenium Plaza over Christmas week 2007 and it was absolutely perfect. When we arrived I asked for a room overlooking the city, but we were given a massive corner room overlooking the river. The room was lovely but I wanted to see the Empire State and Crysler, so I asked if we could change rooms. This was done for us straight away and we ended up with a 32nd floor room overlooking the city and had perfect views of the Empire State and Crysler. The view was amazing, especially at sunrise and sunset and we took some really good photo√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ from the room. The room was large and had everything we needed, including a sofa, safe, hairdryer and a kitchenette with fridge, which came in very handy to store my Juniors cheesecake in, as it took me 3 days to eat it!!The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly, especially Karine at reception and also the concierge.The pool on the 27th floor was great and had lovely views of the city and was good to relax in after a long day of walking and shopping. It was about a 10 √à√\u2020\u2022?15 minute walk into the heart of Times Square, although it gave us chance to see things we wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ necessarily have seen otherwise and also we could get a muffin or a donut on the walk. I would definitely stay here again, mainly for the views, size of the room and the swimming pool. It was also a reasonable price for Christmas and would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone.
