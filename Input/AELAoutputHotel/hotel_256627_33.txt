{"text":"I am glad I chose this one!! Just got back from a wonderful vacation in Sydney. I checked Trip Advisor and the comments were so helpful and true. The Radisson was a great stay. The location can not be beat. It was right down the street from Darling Harbor which we visited almost everday! Our room was roomy and clean. The offered room service daily and the 1 bedroom suite is big enough for a family of 4 ( they can send up extra roll-away-beds for $35 per night). Our room came with a full bar although I wouldn't eat anything from it (chips, sodas and nuts) you have to pay for what you eat and the prices were expensive. It was cheaper to go the the grocery store Coles located up the street for snacks and sodas. I really can't complain though and I would stay here again if I was given the chance. The duty manager was very nice and never got tired of our millions of questions. The waitress Alejandra took care of our dinning needs and really made us feel welcomed whether we were dinning in the hotel restaurant or ordering in-room service ...also the when we ordered food to our room it came up quick and hot!!. I did not like the meat (chicken, fish, or beef) it tasted very different than what I am used to. We loved the dessert. It is pretty expensive ordering food from the hotel but it is an option. There are so many places to eat from within walking distance. There is a great deli (spanish delicatessen )across the street if you just want a real good sandwich and soda. Taxi's galore in the area ( although you really won't need them). China town and Paddy's market is within 5 min. walking distance. Please go to Paddys's market for all of your souvenir's they are 50-70% cheaper than buying anywhere else (same stuff but way cheaper). I went on the last day of my stay and was upset that I did not go there first. So much to chose from ( silk, jewelry, clothes...ect.). We went to China Town and they had millions of restaurants to pick from (some places a little bit ruff looking!) Make sure you get a package deal tour of the main attractions before leaving....was very expensive if you purchased tickets at the door. Kids will love Darling Harbor (parks, play area and sidewalk eateries). Very expensive for dinning out and even for 1scoop of icecream on a cone $4.10. 16 oz soda $3.50 -$5.00. Loved the chips a.k.a. french fries, was the best I have ever had. Not crazy about the fish part. American fastfood restaurants does not taste the same at all! But as the Aussie's say No Worries. Do not do the buy back program at the airport it is not worth it( a fee to have them buy back your leftover AUD$). I doubt you will be bringing any money back from the trip. A lot of things to do with your kids at Darling Harbor very relaxing but fun atmosphere. The weather was mild for winter time but it was raining half of the time but this did not stop us from having a good time. There were sunny days where we sat with the children eating icecream on the docks watching the boats go buy and feeding the beautiful birds. It is a place your family will enjoy.
