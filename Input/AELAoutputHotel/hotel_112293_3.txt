{"text":"Holy Cow! We booked the Cow Hollow motor inn due to its Marina location and price for our first time trip to San Francisco. We arrived 3 hours prior to check-in due to our early flight arrival, and there was a room available for us immediately! The staff was courteous and helpful all the time throughout our stay.The room was functional: nothing incredibly fancy, but clean and comfortable. The television was small, but we did not visit San Fran to watch TV in our hotel room. The room itself was very large by big city standards! The neighborhood is a hip, fun part of town with a number of little bistros, shops, and restaurants. The restaurant in the hotel is open for breakfast and lunch, and is worth at least one visit. I highly recommend walking one block to Home Plate which has amazing food!The location is some distance from many of the more touristy sections of town. There is free parking at the hotel, although we did not rent a car for the stay (you would not want to try parking down in Fisherman's Wharf anyways). The hotel is conveniently located near two bus lines (both within one block's walk). The 30 MUNI bus runs down to Fisherman's Wharf and then through Chinatown and Downtown. It's about a 10 minute ride to the wharf, and maybe 20 minutes to downtown. The buses run late into the night, but be sure to leave plenty of time to get to your destination riding the bus.We will certainly be willing to stay at the Cow Hollow Motor Inn again. Next time, I believe we will rent a car to use it as a base to explore Napa, etc., but a car is certainly not required in SF! ","annotations":[]}
