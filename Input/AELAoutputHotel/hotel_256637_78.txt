{"text":"Close to the best in Sydney My wife and I do around 4-5 weekends in Sydney per year and always stay at one of Sydneys 5 star hotels. Having done this now for several years we have found some lovely places to stay but would have to say now coming back to the Sheraton for the 4th time it remains as my favourite.It is a grand hotel with a lovely rooftop pool\/jacuzzi and fitness room and some wonderful dining options. But most impressive to me are the rooms. We stayed there again on the 11th May and had a Hyde park room which was a good size with lovely furnishings and beautifully decorated bathroom. The beds as you expect from Sheraton were very comfy and most importantly the rooms are very quite with no discernible outside noise.For those perhaps travelling to Sydney for the first time and not really knowing the city the hotel is is in a great spot. Across the road is the beautiful Hyde Park and round the corner is one of the major shopping areas in the city which is no more than a two min walk. Also at the back of the hotel is access to the monorail which will take you to Darling Harbour. Also the restaurant area of Cockle Bay and King Street Wharf are only a pleasant 10  15 min walk respectively all of which is pretty much flat.Also at the moment they are running a Friday package where for $245 you get a room upgrade, breakfast for 2 and self parking. For the city of Sydney in a hotel of this standard that is almost unbeatable value. I will definitely be coming back ","annotations":[{"endOffset":330,"mention":"grand hotel","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Grand_Hotel,_Vienna"],"startOffset":319}]}
