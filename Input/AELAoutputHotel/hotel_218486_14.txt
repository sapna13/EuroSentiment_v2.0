{"text":"Had good points but mostly not too good. This is our 3rd tropical vacation, but our first time in the Dominican Republic. This hotel was listed as a 4+ star hotel on Westjet Vacations website. This hotel in our opinion was more like a 3 or 2+ star resort. There were some good points:The vacation was really inexpensive. $2300.00 for 2 people travelling for 11 days from Thunder Bay. Upon our arrival to our first room, we found copious amounts of mould and promptly switched rooms. Our second room was better but there was still mould in our shower\/tub area around the taps. The beds were saggy and desperatly need to be changed. We found on 3 different occasions a REALLY BIG bug. This bug was a really really fast little bugger too! It looked sort of like a cockroach\/beetle approximately the size of a small mouse. NOT FUN!! We also found a huge centipede!! ( about 6 inches long... gross!!) This little thing was fast too!! And.. hard to kill!! My love quickly hammered it with a shoe.. but the thing would just not die!! Eventually he did manage to kick its little 100 legged butt! But definatly did not do much for our confidence in our room so all of our stuff promptly was stored off the floor! The grounds had the potential to be incredible, but all around us this putrid scent of sewer was everywhere! It was especially bad near the buffet! They likely had some septic problem but it was definitly not appetizing to say the least. The food prep was questionable. My love got really really sick from food at the Mexican Restaurant. He actually had to see the doctor even. He is still feeling residual sickness as of this writing. The choices were lacking a bit, especially in the fruit section. We had melons and bananas everyday but no other kinds of fruit.There are NO blender drinks!! If you want a Pina Colada, you will get instead a Pina slushie.. same as if you want a Strawberry Daqueri.. you will get a Strawberry slushie... You can`t leave the resort... Too Dangerous. Now, on the plus side.... and there are great plusses.. The beach is magnificent! One of the nicest we have ever seen! The sand is as soft as powdered sugar! Gorgeous! The service was really good too. We tipped ( we think) generously and were rewarded with flowers around our sink and our bed covers arranged in fancy ways. We had prompt service at the bars and coffee house and everyone tried really hard to please us. The Brazilian restaurant was terrific! The food was hot and yummy! The entertainment was good, the Anamacion people did a great job on the beach and at night! They were funny and had interesting and fun games to play, on and off the beach!! The coffee house was amazing with the best coffee I have ever had in my life!!!!In our opinion, there are other better hotels out there, we will definatly not go back here.
