{"text":"Pleasantly surprised Having had to go to Amsterdam for a few days on business I booked the hotel as part of a package. Once booked I looked further into other reviews of the Hotel and read a few that raised my concerns on the quality of the Hotel. However when I arrived at the Hotel I can honestly say I was pleasantly surprised. As with most places your first impression is that given to you by the peolpe on reception. In this instance I found the receptionists to be very polite and helpful and this boded well for my stay.My room was very clean and comfortable ( I was on the ground floor) and the bathroom had adequate towels and soap. The plasma tv in the room is not something you would normally expect to see and the room had tea and coffee making facilities as well as a little fridge. It was also nice to open the wardrobe and find a decent quantity of clothes hangers!!.Even though the Hotel was fully booked the only time I heard other guests was in the morning when they were leaving.The buffet breakfast was, as most people have previously reported, above that which you would normally expect and the staff were very courteous and polite. The Hotel does not have a bar but as there was one at the hotel next door this was not a major concern. It does however have a drinks machine and a small snack machine should you get thirsty or peckish during the day or night.As I was not driving I did not need to avail myself of the car parking facilities but the receptionists were very happy to order taxi's for me when needed and they usually arrived within 10 minutes of being ordered. All in all I enjoyed staying at this hotel and would most certainly stay there again.
