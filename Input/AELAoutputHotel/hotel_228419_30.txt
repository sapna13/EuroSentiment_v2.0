{"text":"A Great Place to Stay We only stayed for three nights but it was magnificant. The staff were friendly and very helpful. They could not do enough! The breakfast has the biggest choice we have ever seen. There was nothing missing that we could see and if there was I am sure it would have been provided. Available from 7am to 11am every day is also very good. No rushing down before it closes.Bedroom was good. Bed very comfortable. Excellent power shower. Loads of TV channels and some Radio stations. Quite a lot of in-house movies though we didn't bother with them. Only short corridors from lifts makes a real pleasant change. No long treks to room - fantastic. The lifts are amazing. They are so silent. You press the button and it arrives before you know it. Silently!! The design and decor is very modern. We loved it. Nowhere seems to mention this but the Metro station is Maria Christina about 300 metres away. From the airport take R1 train to Sants Estacio (2.60 Euros) and change to L3 to Maria Christina (1.20 Euros). Total 3.80 Euros. Much cheaper than a taxi and dead easy. Get a ten trip Metro ticket for 6.85 Euros - excellent value. We didn't use them but there are loads of buses right outside the hotel as is the tram. Taxis are everywhere. Coming out of the Metro station turn right towards the Hilton. You cross over a very busy underpass and a busy junction. There on the corner is El Corte Ingles - a fantastic department store. Everything you will ever need is there. In the basement is a large supermarket - again with everything. Excellent prices too. On a par with the larger Carrefour supermarkets elsewhere in Spain. Buy drinks here and put them in your mini-bar to keep cold. Save yourself a fortune. Next to El Corte Ingles is another shopping centre with lots of VERY nice shops. Also quite a few VERY nice food places downstairs - good for lunch and quick snacks.For a reasonable price meal turn right out of Hilton and walk about 1Km to GINOS. Very friendly, good food, good prices. Around the corner to the right from GINOS is La Bo Tiga - a new contemporary eatery. Great staff, great ambiance, great food and stunning prices. It is bright and new. It is also a great place to eat.The city is well documented elsewhere but in just 3 days we had an excellent time. Lots and lots of walking - the best way to see a city. We never got to La Rambla though.Go there .... and don't forget the cable car over the harbour - take your camera!!PW  GS ","annotations":[{"endOffset":884,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":879},{"endOffset":1004,"mention":"Maria","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Marie_biscuit"],"startOffset":999},{"endOffset":1728,"mention":"fortune","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Fortune_cookie"],"startOffset":1721},{"endOffset":1803,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1799},{"endOffset":1837,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1833},{"endOffset":1837,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1833},{"endOffset":1837,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1833}]}
