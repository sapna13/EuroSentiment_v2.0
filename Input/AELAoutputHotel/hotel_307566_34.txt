{"text":"Beautiful hotel too isolated We stayed for 2 weeks at the Patra. The hotel itself was beautiful and we stayed in a delux suite which was also lovely. The grounds are immaculate and the staff are friendly and anytime you went to tip the staff refused which is a change from most hotels to say the least.However I would not stay there again, the hotel is right next door to the airport and although the noise didnt bother us it was too isolated.There are no supermarkets or really anything surrounding the hotel. Which means if you do run out of drinks etc you do without of pay the expensive hotel prices. The shuttle bus runs about 4 times a day but the the times are not convienent to go out for dinner with the times being 3pm then 9pm. The taxis in the hotel compound will not put the metre on as they are looking for a higher fare. We did walk one day and had to walk for about 30 minutes before we found one coming down the road. The best option is to walk down the beach and there is a small lane way just past the Bali Hai hotel. Which was fine during the day but in the evening the lighting isnt good enough to do this safely.The swimming pool looks fantastic but isnt deep enough. On the hot days because it was relatively shallow it was like bath water, which is nice but not refreshing.Being a 5 star hotel things were expensive $5 AUS for a coke from the mini bar. We had one free dinner included in our package and ordered drinks 2 cocktails, a smoothie and a small bottle of water $30 AUS which was comparatively very expensive.The beach sellers which were permanantly camped out the front stretch of pebbles, there is no beach in front of the hotel. Were also very expensive compared to anywhere else. Not much action close by for kids, couples, young people I would not stay there again.
