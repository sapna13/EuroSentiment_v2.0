{"text":"Tried very hard to like this place On previous trips while staying at another 5 star property in town, I kept finding myself at The Time Warner center for dinner, drinks, walks in the park etc. Therefore , I thought, why not try it out?While there were no disasters, and nothing particularly bad about the hotel, it came across as dissapointigly average. The park views were terrific. The service was friendly. But the overall experience feels more like a convention Hyatt. There's nothing wrong with that, but its very dissapointing if you are expecting a five star experience. That fifth star is all in the details, and thats what the hotel lacks. From the service, to the finishes in the rooms. Most of the problems come from the building itself. Even though the hotel is only a couple hundred rooms, you definitely feel like you're in a massive structure. And everything, from the spa to the business center feels like its miles away, down random corridors. For example, the entrance to the gym is located just outside a ballroom area: so at best, you have to walk through a dark empty banquet area with a piano covered in the corner, but I couldn't help thinking of the alternative if the room were in use, which would be making your way through a black tie affair in your sweaty workout clothes. One afternoon I returned to my room to find the maid cleaning the room, but noticed she had the TV turned on and was watching a soap opera. Little things like this give the impression there is very little oversight of the smaller details by management. The area rug in the lobby has an ugly rubber band around it like an airport would have, and the tile and fixtures in the bathrooms, while attractive, look cheap and institutional. The rooms have an office-chic feel to them, like a first class airport lounge. Nothing wrong with that, but certainly not the height of luxury one might expect. ","annotations":[]}
