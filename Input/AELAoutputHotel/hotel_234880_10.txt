{"text":"Hand crafted for fun sex romps. A few function problems. Propeller Island Each room is uniquely crafted around an aesthetic theme. √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??rapped√à√\u2020\u2022?room 16 was shaped like a checkmark with a beer keg sink in the short arm and three beds on a ramp up the long arm. A fourth bed is tucked under the top bed with a pulley system to open the bed√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ door. Like sleeping under the stairs. Two tall, thin windows side the sink and a barred window is by the middle bed. The windows look into treetops and vines. Each single bed has a metal shelf with a candle and reading light. The switch for each light operates with the main room light by the door, not independently, meaning you walk down the ramp to turn out your light. The wall paint is mottled wrapping paper with safety zone diagonal black and yellow tape going every which way. Overlapping corrugated panels cover the ceiling lighting. There are two yellow and black wall sconces. The custom audio system didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work in the room. The room was clean and smelled fine. Location was close to the front desk.Room doors are thin, heavy and close loudly. A key deposit is required.The rooms have no clocks or alarm clocks, nor does the desk supply one upon request.With the doors closed you can clearly hear tiptoe footsteps, people quietly having sex, outdoor noises and the previously mentioned loud doors. Perhaps this hotel isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ intended for sleeping.The computer is in the stairwell on the way down to the gallery. Use it during the day since it is locked up at night.The breakfast room is large, bright, and attractive and has a two-chair porch. Meusli, cold cuts, cheeses, pumpernickel\/pinon nut bread and some fruit are available.The hotel location is South of Adenauer Platz, a lively location off the Ku√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√°amm. You can buy ordinary supplies or groceries nearby, plus expensive furniture and clothing. There are cafes, restaurants and theaters. Bus M29 and the U7 subway line are close. People walk around the area at night.The hotel is visually fun and creative but the audio aspects (noise, no included hotel music offerings, no alarm clock) and having to walk down the ramp to shut off the light would deter me from staying a second time, unless a travel companion really wanted to.
