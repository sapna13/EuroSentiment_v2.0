{"text":"Very disappointing, but not all was lost We stayed at this hotel from March 21 - 28, 2008 and let me tell you, I wouldn't recommend this property. It wasn't terrible, but its definately not a 4 star.We arrived around 10:30pm Friday night, only to discover all restaurants and snack bars were closed. We were starved as we left Toronto at 4:30pm. Front desk told us to try the casino across the street (which is affliated with the hotel), and they would have snacks. The only thing they had were ham and cheese sandwichs, which we had to ask the bartender for. It took 20 minutes for him to give my boyfriend and I one sandwich each. When we asked for another sandwich, he refused. Terrible service.Reception at the hotel did not give extra room keys for each person in the room unless asked. They wouldn't let us rent a safe that night. We had to come back the next day.Rooms: the rooms were okay, but the beds were hard, sheets were very thin. Our beds were made each day, but despite tipping practically everyday, we only got a towel design once. The shower did not have complete coverage (only a half shower door) so each day our bathroom floor was wet. We didn't get extra towels and the towels were poor quality - we had towel fuss on out bodies everyday.Service: I found the service generally poor. Servers rarely smiled or greeted you. Only if generous tips were offered did we see any change in service, but there should have been a general standard of service which we didn't see. However, there was one exception, we had great service from Miguel, Carlos and Capitan at front desk. Miguel was generous enough to go with us into town on his day off.A la carte restaurants: There were 3 restaurants, mexican, italian and french. We enjoyed the mexican restaurant, but the resort failed to set the proper mood for each restaurant. The back ground music was often Reggaeton or Bachata - conflicting with the theme of the restaurant. Most cake desserts were awful. I found ordering fruits with ice cream the safest route. The wine tasted like vinegar. Bars: There were a variety of bars, but the skills and knowledge of creating cocktails by the bartenders was poor. We stuck to rum  coke, everything else tasted horrible. They did not use real fruit juices in cocktails like Rum punch or Sex on the Beach, which left a powdery after taste in your mouth.Entertainment: nightly entertainment was entertaining. However, there was no live music entertainment on stage or in any restaurant. I've travelled to many resorts and found this strange. The disco had a good DJ. Overall, the resort grounds were beautiful, but I'd give it 3 stars not 4.
