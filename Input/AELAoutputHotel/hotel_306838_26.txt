{"text":"Not bad, Not good... My husband and I stayed at the Aston in mid September and opted out of the all-inclusive option. We werent sure what to expect being it was our first trip to Indonesia but when we arrived at our hotel, it didnt fit with our expectations.The hotel itself is ok but a bit run down and is in need of some renos. The rooms are spacious and relatively clean but we were disappointed when we found ourselves in a smoking room even though we requested a non smoking. The bedsheets smelled a bit musty and the bathrooms were ok but sometimes smelled of sewage. There are 3 restaurants in the hotel and though we only checked out one of them and ordered from the waiters at the pool, we found the food expensive for what you got and didnt think the food was that great so we often opted to go to another resort or take a taxi to kuta or semynak for dinner where we found better deals and better food. The upside is that the staff are really friendly and the beach and pool are beautiful. If you are looking to get a couple of lounge chairs with an umbrella be sure to get up early. We found that by 9am there werent any available so we'd have to lay our towels on the grass by the pool to get some sun. Overall the resort was ok. Not the best but not the worst Ive been to. If my husband and I make it to Bali again we would probably choose another resort. ","annotations":[]}
