{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous Hotel!! I can not say enough about what a wonderful stay we had at the Mandala Hotel. First off, the hotel is very stylish and hip with a gorgeous lobby and lounge. The staff was friendly and attentive but no overly so. We were delighted that upon check in that we were upgraded to a HUGE suite. I have never seen a hotel room that was so large. It had a kitchenette, living room with dining area, bedroom with office and a huge marble bath. It also had a giant walk-in closet to store our things, which was just great. And when we thought there couldn't be more, we open the curtains to reveal a 30 ft balcony! With the relatively low rate we were paying we thought there must be some mistake and that someone was going to show up and tell us we were in the wrong room! We also appreciated that the room was immaculately clean, the pillows and bed were heavenly, and the decor of the room was very modern and fashionable. Also fashion and architecture magazines were provided for us which was a nice touch.The location was okay. Potsdamer Platz is a newly developed area with lots of great architecture however as another person mentioned, it is not near any of the cool nightlife or shopping. However taxis were always available outside the hotel and a giant U-Bahn station was right there. Also there is a big mall in the Potsdamer Plaz complex which was handy when we needed to find a drugstore, grocery store or quick bite to eat..Overall this hotel was an amazing value for the money and would not stay anywhere else in Berlin.
