{"text":"Great Place-People-Price Wow.. We were at the Palace from Sept.24-30th. and I wouldn't complain about a thing.I was worried about the weather...HURRICANE SEASON It couldn't have been more beautiful. I will definetly come back this time of year. The weather was sunny, hot, not overly humid and just the perfect ocean breeze. Just fabulous. Not a drop of rain during any day we were there.The resort. We love it. It was our second trip in 16 months and it was great both times. Not a thing to complain about. The staff are courteous and helpful. Some are more friendly then others, but tell me where that isn't the norm...We ate well, all the restaurants were great, the SteakHouse, The Mexican Restaurant, The buffett, La Brisis-Seafood, and our favorite for lunch..La Pina. Barefoot in the sand, pick and cook to order, fresh seafood, burgers, porkchops and more.Rooms in building #6 were large, well kept, looked a little newer. Housekeeping does a great job, with the mini bar stocked to order. The staff will try to accomadate you any way they can.There are definetly few Americans there, we speak no Spanish and have no trouble communicating. They enjoy our attemps at their lanquage. We have stayed at other more expensive resorts in the DR..and yes, maybe they were a little fancier. But, we love this place especially for the price.Everyone has different standards, and what they expect. We always have a great time and think if you understand traveling out of the USA is a little different, you should enjoy yourself.Eveyone just moves at a much slower pace, but, after all....Isn't that why we go on vacation?Ready to go again. Can't wait to get back to the DR.
