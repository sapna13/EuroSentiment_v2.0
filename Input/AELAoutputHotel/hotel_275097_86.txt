{"text":"Big Disappointment We reserved the hotel 4 months ago for our vacation in Barcelona (family of 2 adults one teen and one child, thus we needed two connected rooms) based on the great reviews we read in the Tripadvisor.We checked in around 12 and were asked to come back around 3 PM.Already when we entered the lobby we were getting the impression that something is not working as it should, the rug was stained, there were crumbs in the elevator and the impression was not very good.When we came back we were offered rooms 610 and 611 in the 6th floor, but when we entered the rooms a very strong smell of smoke hit us combined with dirt on the floor dust on the furniture and hair on the blankets, immediately we asked for cleaner and no smoking rooms, although the hotel was full the receptionist was very kind and moved us after an hour we had to wait to 2 not connected rooms in the 3rd floor (the rooms were much cleaner and smelled from massive use of air freshener so we assumed they re-cleaned them) apologizing and promising that on the following day we will have the non smoking connected rooms.This was sufficient and as promised we were moved on the next day to two connected rooms in the same (3rd) floor.Still I must also add that on the second day when we went to the SPA in the evening (very very small and cold) we noticed and killed cockroach in the swimming pool and I am sure you can still find it under the wooden floor near the oval windowTo summarize the four nights we stayed there I will say that - The staff is supporting the location is good and the deal for the breakfast is very nice.BUT we can not ignore the poor maintenance level (why they do not clean the elevators more often? Why there are all these black signs that the luggage left on all the walls inside and outside the rooms? Why they do not clean the mini-bars from leftovers of other guests and dirt?).The potential exist but the high expectations could not fulfill.
