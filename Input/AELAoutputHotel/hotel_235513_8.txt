{"text":"Good hotel, a few gripes The Sofitel Layfayette Square is a very elegant hotel. The place is very clean, the rooms and particularly the bathrooms are beautifully designed and decorated. The beds are some of the best I've ever slept on. The staff are exceptionally polite and helpful. Nonetheless, I don't think I'll stay here again, for a few reasons that are mostly the result of my own relatively minor gripes about what makes a hotel stay comfortable for me.1) Many rooms face alleyway. It seems like at least a quarter of the rooms face a dark alleyway in the back of the hotel. There is another building across this alleyway, so when the curtains are open, you are literally on display to the office workers in this other building. Further, this alleyway is busy with deliveries and trash removal fairly constantly, so there's quite a bit of noise. Lastly, this alleyway is blindingly illuminated at night. In short, the shades of your room need to be drawn pretty much 24 hours a day.2) No thermostat in rooms. I tend to like my room on the cold side, and my guess is the room was kept at about 75 degrees, night and day, which made it pretty stuffy for me.3) No coffee in the room. I tend to need coffee right when I wake up, and there is no coffee pot in the room. There is free coffee in the lobby, which means you have to make yourself at least somewhat presentable before you venture downstairs.4) No free wireless. Wireless internet access is $5.99 per day. It's provided by T-Mobile, and requires you fill out a lengthy form and provide your credit card number. My first complaint was just bad luck. 2-4 are the reasons I probably will choose another hotel next time. Even discount hotels provide thermostats, in-room coffee and free wireless, so I'm fairly surprised that these amenities were not available at the Sofitel.
