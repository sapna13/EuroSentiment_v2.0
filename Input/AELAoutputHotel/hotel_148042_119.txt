{"text":"Not bad but certainly nothing great We had a group of rooms for a company retreat. Hotel is a Ritz Carlton and it is like the other Ritz Carltons but it's nothing great. Perhaps compared to the other properties around it, it's the best available. Food was allright and familiarly uninspiring and I wasn't happy that almost all the fruit seemed to come from California and the orange and mango juice on the morning buffet came from a bottle. Maybe that's what people who go to Ritz Carltons like. Beach is nothing great and there is no place to go outside the hotel in the surrounding area unless you are going to Old San Juan a 15-20 minute cab ride away. It is 5 minutes from the airport and that's a plus if you need the quick transfer. Room was perfectly fine but again, nothing ritzy about it. I was disappointed that as a leader of this group using over half a dozen rooms, the hotel did nothing to show their appreciation to me during my stay and didn't even seem to have my name on file. Prices are pretty high here for everything -- the spa is $165 for a 50 minute massage; a fish sandwich at the pool is $19 plus tax and tip. I pay a lot less for this at comparable properties in the US and I expected a more reasonable price for things in Puerto Rico. The Italian restaurant on the property is sky-high with $50 entrees. I don't see the value at this property in Puerto Rico unless you know you want to be in San Juan and you want this property.
