{"text":"Gran Melia- A resort with noisy construction and no ocean swimming, small rocky b We were so disappointed with the Gran Melia and felt isolated and stuck there because it is so expensive to leave the property (I was told $70 to catch a cab to go eat somewhere else).First thing we did after calling service to remove the bloody towels left by prior occupant and clean one of our rooms was take a walk to see the beach and ocean. I was flabergasted to find NO ocean swimming, as I had gone on Sol Melia vacation site to see photos of this hotel- out of the 8 photos they show on the slide show, only 2 were actually taken on site. The others were stock photos. There was just no swimming in the ocean at all. The photos showed a beautiful smiling family on a white beach, and also a man relaxing in the wavesof a blue ocean on a lounge chair. I really think Gran Melia should remove these photos as they certainly are misleading.AND in addition, there was non -stop construction at the pool\/beach area- and I mean JACKHAMMERING! The first day there was hammering andlarge areas cordoned off with caution tape. Then 2 entire days of jackhammering which did not let up until sundown. The 4th day I was given a complimentary excursion by management for 2 of us (oh well, we were a party of 4 that had purchased TWO rooms!!!). The hammering was so loud 2 of us were delighted to get away from the Gran Melia for the day.We thought the food was very high priced and with no outdoor grill orless expensive food available, we were just stuck. There was no warning about the construction- They did have a great gym and thank goodness for that The pool is huge but no deep area to swim-We were very disappointed to fly 3000 miles only to find jackhammers and caution tape, no ocean swimming, very expensive food. Also, bring lots of games for your kids from home, it's a very long night with only a small game room, and you aretotally isolated here.
