{"text":"Nice Hotel - not particularly sure about the 5*'s - really uncomfortable beds! I was staying at the Juan Carlos for 3 nights and attending a conference in the hotel. The conference was well run and the nibbles provided at coffee time were great. The buffet lunch was delicious and there was plenty of variety from day to day.The rooms were very smart but the beds were extremely hard and I woke up each morning with a sore hip. Despite having a pillow menu (with ~15 choices of pillow) there is not much that can be done about the beds! On returning to the room very late one night the key had stopped working and they weren't terribly quick to sort he problem out - after 30 minutes waiting (a couple checking in were having problems with their reservation and all three of the reception staff were busy discussing that) I was relived to finally be able to access my room!The hotel is extremely well decorated and has lots of amenities and beautiful clean and well maintained gardens but it does lack any personality and the few hundred people at the conference were 'lost' within its grounds very quickly between meetings.Despite the key incident, the staff here was great, although they were more snobbish than the majority of the guests! When I was trying to find somewhere for a quick bite and didn't fancy getting dressed up I was clearly warned that other eating establishments would 'serve chips' and not be fine dining. I was flattered that I looked like the fine dining-type and assured them that I could rough-it with the best of them, but none the less went out with trepidation at what I might end up with! (The alternative restaurants near the university were basic but perfectly acceptable and dinner for 2 was 1\/4 the price of the hotel buffet style meal). This hotel is not somewhere I would choose to go back to if I had the choice at the end of the day I didn't feel particularly looked after - but if you need to be near for a conference it is the easy option.
