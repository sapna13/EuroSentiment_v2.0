{"text":"Very nice I went to Nikko Bali on holiday in November 2007. It is a lovely and very large hotel complex right on a clifftop, in Nusa Dua.The staff are very helpful and attentive. The spa is professional and very pleasant, if a bit pricy by Bali standards. The rooms are spacious, the bed was enormous, and the air conditioning worked well. 2 bottles of water were provided complimentary each day. The rooms were teak floored, and the balcony had a lovely view. Ordered room service once and it arrived quickly with a smile. The breakfast buffet is delicious, has great variety, and meant I could skip lunch every day! I recommend getting a rate which includes it.The hotel lobby is situated on top of a cliff, with some buildings on top of the cliff, and the main building built at the base of the cliff. This meant fantastic views across the ocean from the lobby, and the top of the main building has an observation area which is nice. The pool area has 3 pools, an artificial beach, and a waterslide, it's very pretty and nice.The hotel is very secure, set back from the road. Like most hotels in Bali nowadays, all cars are visually checked both underneath and in the trunk before being allowed entry.We paid around 100 euro a night, this is expensive by Bali standards but cheap for the 5 star standard we experienced.One downside is the relative isolation of the hotel. Already Nusa Dua is half an hour by taxi from Kuta or Jimbaran. Nikko is not in the main area of Nusa Dua but 5-10 minutes drive south. Nusa Dua itself is a bit antiseptic and it's mostly tourists. There is a small town about 5 minutes by taxi from Nikko, this is much more lively, but still quite small. You can't really walk anywhere from Nikko, the only way to get in and out of the hotel is by taxi or private car. The cost isn't a problem, taxis are very cheap (30 mins = 50,000Rp = $5), just the time factor is a bit of a drain.I really liked the 5 star nature and easy, relaxed atmosphere at Nikko. The pool area is great, the staff are lovely, and the views are great. But it got a bit claustrophobic that I'd have to order a taxi to go anywhere, and that Kuta is so far away. So if you're looking for nights of bars and restaurants and walking around, don't stay in Nusa Dua. If you're looking for a great cheap 5 star experience, and don't mind being cocooned a bit, it's great!
