{"text":"One of my favourite hotels in the world It's always a joy to arrive at this hotel. The staff are a delight -- no matter what time of day or night it is -- and will fast become your friends. Rooms are exceptionally comfortable, from the smallest to the biggest (and I've been in a fair few of them). The singles can be tiny, as they say on their website, but no less comfortable for it. The larger rooms and suites are exquisite, especially with the garden view.If you like big, bland chain hotels where you can only tell what country you're in by the beer in the mini-bar, the Draycott isn't for you. If you like personalised service, old style charm with a 21st century relaxed vibe, and a dash of eccentricity -- I'm always tickled by their old-fashioned habit of inserting a beautifully scripted calling card with your name on it in a little brass panel on the door of your room -- you'll love The Draycott.Each room also has a beautifully bound visitors book which you're at liberty to sign\/draw\/doodle in. You may sometimes be surprised by who has slept in your bed previously. As the books fill up, they are moved to the drawing room downstairs, building a wonderful record of the people who have passed through each room over the years...And if you're not familiar with London, you'll find you're right in the middle of an upmarket neighbourhood with plenty of entertainment right on your doorstep and the West End only a short cab ride away.One of my favourite hotels in the world!
