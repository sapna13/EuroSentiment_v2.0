{"text":"Great time, beautiful place, but poor service My husband and I stayed here Jan. 10-17\/07 with a large group of other people, we stayed in the royal service side and had a wonderful time and had great people to spend it with but found there were many inconsistencies with our room, the service, and the staff...First the negatives:- upon our arrival no welcoming drink given, most resorts do this, not really a big deal but...- talking with people in our group we were missing certain things in our room that others had, such as robes, one day our iron was missing, we called for one and it took hours to be delivered to us, some people had dishes, pots, etc. in their room...- our flat screen tv didn't work, we mentioned this a few times to the staff and nothing was done- I found that the cleaning of the room was not very efficient, dead bugs still left on the walls, garbage still left in the room, towels not changed when should've beeen, one day the fridge wasn't stocked back up with beer, one day the fridge had no beer or water, someone in our group found a pair of pants under their bed...- no activities going on that I saw anyway and didn't find staff to be too friendly as we've seen in other places, usually they strike up conversations and always say hi when walking by but not in this case- the staff do not speak much english some none at all, once I asked for a vodka and orange and got vodka on the rocks, once I got just orange juice- I myself did get sick, not horribly but uncomfortable, the typical travellers thing, not sure if it was from the food or something was perhaps washed with tap water rather than bottled water, we've been to Mexico and Puerto Plata and this was the first time I've gotten sick- the grounds are huge and there is a lot of walking to do, it was 10-12 mins. to the beach from our room, when it rains the cobblestone is extremely slippery, just a warning...- not too much to do off the resort, we found excursions were priced too high for what you would be doing and for how long, you do kind of feel like its a compound as someone mentioned in another review- lots of mosquitos, by the end of the week we realized they have several areas of sitting water (lobby bar) and we were often sitting there in the evening...- supposed to have some sort of butler service, we saw him once when we arrived...The positives:- resort wasn't too far from the airport...- the weather of course, rained several times and was cloudy off and on, but still nice and warm, windy there I found...- the beach is beautiful and ocean is wonderful...- it was nice to be served on the beach and by the pool...- lots of shopping available - down the beach flea markets and just outside the resort ther is a little shopping plaza with reasonable prices although many stores are not yet open- jacuzzi tub in our room was a plus...- they have a casino at the resort, we didn't go but if you're into gambling- I found the food to be okay, I liked that there was a variety of restaurants to choose from, we ate at the Italian, Japanese, French, American, and Mexican, my favorite was the Japanese, the snack bar by the pool was very good, we ate there just about every day for lunch- we had room service if we wanted but didn't use it at all...Overall, we had an amazing time, we wouldn't go back to the resort and would go back to Mexico or even Puerto Plata again before returning to Punta Cana, this was more of a relaxing trip which was great and what I needed... Definately preferred Puerto Plata though - more to do, more night life, and friendlier people, also shopping things were much cheaper....
