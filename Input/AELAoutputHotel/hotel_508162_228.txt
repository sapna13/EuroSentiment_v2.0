{"text":"Very hot and you can't escape the children! I just returned from an 8 day stay at Dreams, Punta Cana. This was my 5th trip to the Dominican Republic. I have stayed at varying hotels in different cities on the island. Including top rated Secrets Excellence in Punta Cana. I feel I am very qualified to give you an honest review of this hotel.The other reviews are dead on about the drive from the airport to the hotel. It is long and bumpy. But it is the same drive to all the other resorts. I was prepared for the drive. I look at the drive as an adventure and an excellent introduction to the Dominican culture! Arrival to the resort was typical. Except we, there were 4 in our group, had all upgraded to the Preferred Club area of the hotel when we booked our vacation. I am so glad that we did! It was worth the extra money. As soon as the gentleman behind the counter saw that we were in the Preferred Club, he told us to have a seat and he would have someone take care of us. We had a private check in and concierge. No more than 5 minutes later, there was a concierge there to welcome us and take us to our check in. He was wonderful and spoke nearly perfect English. Actually, everyone in the preferred club area spoke GREAT English. My mother and neice checked into their room, a Preferred Club Deluxe Room, and they loved it immediately. My husband and I had a Preferred Club Honeymoon Suite. It was beautiful too. The rooms were both very clean and were in great locations. However, the problem with both rooms was the temperature. Their idea of a cool room and mine are very different. It was about 80 in our rooms the entire time! It never got any cooler. I am not a hot natured person, but the rooms just about killed me. I told the concierge about the temperature and he said he would have someone check on it for us. To my knowledge, nobody ever checked. I spoke with other guests at the hotel, and it was univerasal concerning the temperature. Every single person I spoke to had the same complaint. The rooms were just plain hot. I guess to the Dominican's it was cool. But to this girl from GA, it was hot! Speaking of temperature... The only break you get from the heat is in the pool. Most of the restaurants are cooled, but not very much. My poor husband was drenched in sweat at every single meal! Actually, he sweat all of the time! The food was average. Not great, but not gross. I never went to bed unsatisfied. I never got sick from the food or water while I was there for my 8 day trip. My niece did suffer for a day with a bad belly. I gave her some Pepto and she was back at the pool bar being a trooper within 24 hours. The reason for the low rating of this hotel is the children. I don't hate kids. I just don't want them on me 24\/7. I knew before we booked this vacation that it was a kid friendly resort. I have visited a lot of kid friendly resorts in the past. However, the other resorts did a great job keeping the kids and families in one area and adults only in another. The children were constantly on top of you and there was no break from them at all. I also don't want to supervise children that aren't mine on vacation. It seemed that most of the parents seemed to disappear at the Swim Up bar and the kids were left to run around like crazy! The kids loved the bar and played around it ALL of the time. The kid situation was so bad, my husband and I didn't get in the pool the last 2 days of the vacation. I just couldn't go swimming one more time and have one more drink ruined by a stray child. Overall the vacation was very nice. The service was above par and the rooms were very clean. I just wouldn't visit this resort again or recommend it to anyone else.
