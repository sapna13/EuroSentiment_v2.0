{"text":"An average budget hotel but v. noisy My mother and I stayed in this hotel for 4 nights. The location is great. It's in a funky neighbourhood with lots of cafes, restaurants and shops. There are plenty of near-by bus routes to whisk you into the centre of town.As you'd expect from the price, the accommodation is pretty basic. Our room was a bit dusty but the linens are clean. The advertised wi-fi was broken during our visit but the phone and TV worked. There is no lift and all the rooms are up either one or two flights of stairs. To cut back on costs (?), the reception desk isn't staffed 24\/7 so make sure you let them know when you're planning to arrive (like you'd do for a BB).The main downside to this place is the noise. We had a street-facing room. Three out of the four nights we were (Thurs-Sat) there, lots of noise erupted outside at 1.30 in the morning (when the local bars closed?) It took me a while to get back to sleep each time because people didn't seem to be going straight home but instead standing on the pavement shouting for a while. I've lived and stayed in the centre of many big cities and to be honest, this was one of the noisiest hotel experiences I've ever had. The management can't control that the hotel is on a main street, but they could probably supply curtains (rather than blinds) or better glazing on the windows to contain the noise.The hotel advertises itself as green but this seems to extend only to the recycling bins on every floor.
