{"text":"Highly Recommended Just came back from a one-week stay at the Sirenis. We REALLY LOVED the place. The staff are so friendly and nice and really cary about having you enjoy your stay. They are not pushy however. always smiling!The alcohol is great but they put so much in the drinks that sometimes you have to tone it down a bit. There are bars everywhere (beach, pool, reception) and you will not go anywhere without the possibility of getting a drink.The location is very nice, but the beach is on the Atlantic Ocean. I think that the places more south (in the caribbean sea shore) are nicer (white sand, turquoise water).The food is good but not excellent. Everything was eatable, there was a lot of choices and nothing makes you sick. However it did not exceed my expectations. The restaurants (you get 2 per week) were very nice especially the Japanese!!The hours for the buffet however are not appropriate (breakfast closes down at 10am). So if you get up at 10h15am (you're on vacation come on!) then you must wait until 12h00 to get to the lunch buffet. that was the only negative point.THe on-site photographers offer great quality pictures with various animals for 7$US per photo.there are beach chairs for everyone and the towel service is excellent.**Do not expect to get out of the site for less than 80$US taxi because the Sirenis is WAY OUT in the island. If you are looking for a relaxing pool\/beach week, this is the place to go to!THE SHARK AND RAY excursion is DEFINETLY WORTH IT!!!! (about 80$US for the day per person) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":599,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":594}]}
