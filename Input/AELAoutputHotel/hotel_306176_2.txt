{"text":"Good hotel, complicated internet access I booked this hotel based on reviews from TripAdvisor, 4stars classification and price. We spent the New Year night in the hotel too with the hotel organised party in the main hallways and club\/bar (except the countdown when we went to see the Singapore Marina fireworks). The overall impression was quite good, very good location - close to everything in Singapore and the MRT, very comfortable bed and good quality linen and the fees\/ prices are reasonable good value for money given the overall Singapore prices... The cleaning ladies are good and smiling, the dealings with most of the front desk personnel reasonable. I had two issues during our stay: the main one is the Internet access. It is incredible that in 2008 there is such a problem to connect to Internet in this 4 stars hotel! The normal fee is AUD 28 (approx USD24) per 24 hours (!!!) or AUD120 for 7 days (!!!). This is a wall \/ network connection with a short cable, hence no way to browse from the bed. During our stay we bought a new laptop and when trying to access Internet with the new laptop the connection was not working. After quite a few of phone calls to the front desk and a visit from quite a nice gentleman (service manager) we managed to fix it - initially I was told that the connection cannot be transfered from one machine to another?!?. Overall we wasted about 6 hours of our precious holiday time (and probably used the Internet in total 3....4 hours at the most over the 7 days) . We wanted Internet just for brief access times when buying stuff (for reviews and specs) but it became an expensive ($120) , time consuming and source of frustration exercise (and a lot of explaining to the big boss \/ wife). The other (minor) thing was after the countdown \/ new year at the hotel party - all was very well until 1AM when just when the guests were really enjoying themselves with most old and young dancing the floor, the band \/ organiser got tired or bored (who knows) and decided to suddenly close it off !!! , even if initially when asked, the hotel personnel said that the party will go on until 2AM or later if the guests are enjoying.
