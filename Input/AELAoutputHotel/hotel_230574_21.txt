{"text":"Nice, if you get a corner room This hotel has a great location within walking distance of the main train station (about a 15 minute walk) and the downtown area (another 10-15 minutes).I booked a superior room online and got upgraded to a deluxe corner room. I assume this was because I am a member of the Intercontinental's Ambassador program, although they didn't specifically say. The corner room (1601) was nice, with a view of the river as well as the downtown skyline. It was spacious, with a small sofa and sitting area, and it even included a balcony. Overall, I was pleased with the layout and furnishings.The one bad thing about the room was that the high-speed internet did not work. They had me call the iBahn helpline, which was useless and a waste of 30 minutes. Then they sent a technician, who fiddled with the wires for another 30 minutes and finally concluded that I needed to switch rooms. Finally, they took another 45 minutes to give me the key to another room (fortunately, it was another corner room -- 1401), where the internet was working. It was frustrating to lose a couple of hours on this process, and after all of that, they still charged me the regular rate of 18 euros to connect for one day of internet access. Throughout the process, the staff was courteous (and I was courteous to them, as well), but not once did they ever apologize for the inconvenience.Back to the positives: the gym is relatively large with a good range of equipment. The treadmills are a little old and sad looking, but they still work fairly well. The breakfast buffet is nice, with a lot of interesting choices (they even have a Japanese breakfast area, with miso soup).Overall, I was pleased with the experience, especially since I got a good room rate. If it hadn't been for the issue with the internet, it would have been a perfect stay.
