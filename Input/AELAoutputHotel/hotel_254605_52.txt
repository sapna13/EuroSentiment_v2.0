{"text":"Great hotel \/ great staff \/ great location Just got back from a week long stay in NYC. Found this hotel on the internet and decided to book direct based purely on the location. So glad I did.....Not only is the location great - just off 7th Ave - far enough away from the real noise of Times Square but close enough to it to easily get around, but the staff were excellent too.Upon arrival we had things clearly explained, we were given vouchers to attractions, shop discounts and their bar. During our stay all the staff were welcoming and helpful - it's often the little things that go along way. For example on one rainy evening they provided an umbrella for us to use, upon out return they gave us a DVD to watch in our room and they organised a car to take us and our friends (that weren't staying at the hotel) to the airport. They even looked after our luggage (and our friend's stuff too) once we had checked out until the car came along.Our room was clean and had all the things we would need. It was a little small but we were only sleeping there really!On arrival I thought we were going to be kept awake as the location really is central and the hotel is next door to a theatre where every night you had lots of people queueing for their show etc BUT to my surprise we had no noise at all.All in all this little hotel treated us well and we would go back there next time........bigger hotels and chain hotels could learn some things from the guys here!
