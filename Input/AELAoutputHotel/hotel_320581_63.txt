{"text":"Great hotel in great location for decent price My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights in early June 2008. For our first trip to Tokyo, the Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku was fantastic. I booked online using lastminute.com, and got a decent rate. As we were arriving quite late from Melbourne, I contacted the hotel direct to make sure there would be someone on reception (struggled to find an email address on their website so ended up having to fax a note through). They got back to us via email the same day and confirmed everything would be fine, including our request for a non-smoking room on the top floor. We arrived in Tokyo a bit daunted by everything, our flight was an hour late, we were tired and miserable and my telephone call to the hotel from a payphone on the station platform at Narita to let them know we were running late went wrong when the person who answered couldn't speak English and I ran out of coins on hold. We arrived at Shinjuku station and found our way easily using the directions from a previous review (was so quick and easy and I wouldn't suggest you bother with a taxi unless you have more than one suitcase, it's pouring with rain or struggle with stairs). By the time we reached the hotel it was nearly 11pm, but reception was still open and check in was a breeze - we never had a problem and all the staff we spoke to were fluent in English.Room itself was very small but super clean, bed was comfortable and a decent size (we booked a standard double which had a queen size bed). It was very quiet, being both on a quiet street and on the 14th floor which I was very impressed with for central Tokyo. The slippers and night shirts were a nice touch, although I suspect like us, everyone that stays there dresses up in them and takes pictures as they are not particularly attractive. My husband immediately fell in love with the amazing toilet in the bathroom with functions we'd never seen before, and we used the lovely toiletries provided in the room, been looking everywhere to buy the sort of sponges they provide in the room since we got back as they were excellent. The room had a small desk and a fridge in the corner and a kettle, but only green tea rather than the usual western tea\/coffee facilities. We stocked up from the am\/pm convenience store directly across from the hotel. The TV had only 1 English channel (CNN) although apparently you can buy movie channels, we never bothered.Guest lounge was good with 2 computers with free internet access and a free automated coffee machine. We never made it to the 2nd floor bar when it was open, but did try out the restaurant and bar downstairs for dinner and found both to offer very good Italian fare. Both had English menus and English speaking staff which was something we didn't find in many places around Tokyo.In the area directly around the hotel, there is a Starbucks on the walk from the station, a McDonalds a few doors down from the hotel if you get fed up of sushi, and a lot of bars and the Shinjuku neon district about a 10 minute walk from the hotel which I can highly recommend as a fun night out. There is also an ATM cash machine in the building next door to the hotel which takes foreign debit and credit cards, it was the only one we found in Tokyo in English and was very convenient once we discovered it. Before we booked this hotel, I was trying to decide whether it was worth paying twice as much for the Hotel Southern Century Tower across the road (it's literally across the road), and I'm glad to say we saved the money. Both have a great location next to Shinjuku JR station and the metro stations in Shinjuku, both are on a quiet street and both have restaurants and bars - I would stay here again in an instant as I think it is one of the best value hotel rooms in Tokyo. We travelled to the hotel on the Narita Express, and travelled back to the airport on the Limousine Bus directly from our hotel, and I have to say I think the bus was easier and more convenient. Price wise the train was slightly more expensive and was not much faster, although did go more frequently. If you get in at a reasonable hour at Narita, then I would suggest the bus is probably the easiest choice except during rush hour when the Express train might be quicker.
