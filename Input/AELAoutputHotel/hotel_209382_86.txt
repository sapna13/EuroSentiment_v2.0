{"text":"Loved the UN! Me and my girlfriend stopped at the un plaza for 5 nights in march we had a fantastic time as with most people we stopped for the views we got a room in the east tower in a classic style room which is one of the new style rooms very funky and modern we had a full view of the united nations and could see the empire state from our bed and the chrysler to the right of the window im sure there are better views in other rooms but you may not get as good room decor etc, the doorman robert was a star any directions needed places to eat or drink was very helpful as they all were i nfairness, the only problems we encounted was as we dont own a credit card the guy on the reception barry demanded a $100 a night deposit incase we used the mini bar i felt this was very unreasnable as we had no intention of using these facilities never mind best part of √ä√£¬¢250! he said we should use our money we had brought to which i said no that is for our holiday not a stupid room deposit in the end he took $2oo which we got back at the end, the other was my partner had an elergic reaction to the bed sheet we asked reception on the 2nd night if it would be possible to get a cotton sheet they said someone would be up to our room 4 nights passed never heard a word which i thought was very rude,the location aint as bad as some say as long as your fit and you can read a map its well within reach of most attractions,overall a very nice place to stop and visit!.
