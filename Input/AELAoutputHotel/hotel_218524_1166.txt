{"text":"Dominican Delight! My girlfriend and I recently returned from a week at the Excellence and were extremely impressed with everything from beginning to end. Even the dreaded bus ride from the airport was efficient and relatively comfortable. The pot holes are being repaired (all be it one at a time) and a new highway is under construction from the airport to feed most of the hotels in the Punta Cana area. It should be a quick and bump-less drive in a year or five.The hotel is amazing, the beach is wonderful, the pool is superb and the staff are unbelievable. Here are some secrets for those who have not been to Secrets before:1) If there is a rolled up towel on a poolside chair it means that the chair is NOT being used. The staff put out towels on all the chairs first thing in the morning. We thought that people were getting up at 5AM to stake a place by the pool, but that is not the case and there's lots of room. Only the chairs with the opened towels are the ones in use. Even at full capacity, there was plenty of room for everyone.2) Use the spa. There is a FREE steamroom, sauna, as well as a big hot pool with two cold pools for alternating hot and cold. Great for the skin and very, very refreshing. Try it first thing in the morning and just before dinner. Other spa offerings, such as massage will cost you extra.3) Go see Nancy at Hut #6 for your cigars, rum, hats and other touristy purchases. My good pal Doug mentioned Nancy in his review, however please note she is on the LEFT side of the beach as you look at the ocean with your back to the hotel. If you go right you will end up at the next hotel (ten minute walk) where the vendors are not quite so honest. Nancy will give you a good deal and ensure you are not being ripped off - she's Canadian, eh! If anyone other vendor comes up to you while heading for Hut Number 6, tell them you are there to see Nancy and they'll leave you alone. The vendors are VERY aggressive - so research and shop around before you commit. By the way, Nancy will braid hair for the ladies (or gents if you like) for a reasonable fee. 4) Get out and see some of the countryside by participating in one or two of the many available tours and activities. We went on the Aqua Tour (speedboats and snorkeling), Dune Buggies and a tour which took us to the sugar cane plantations, a local farm and a school. There is extreme poverty in the DR, so if you bring simple things like school supplies (pencils, pens, erasers, writing paper, etc.) you can hand them out to the kids when you visit the school. I highly recommend you do that. Ask to get on Leo's tour if you can - he made the trip unforgettable.5) Visit all the restaurants in the hotel if you have time. They are all good and our favourite was Agave (Mexican) which unfortunately was closed for three of our seven nights there. Note also that on each night at least one of the restaurants is closed. They rotate the closed restaurant nightly and notify hotel guests via a daily newsletter which is dropped at your room every evening.6) Ask Pierre to make a horsie sound for you. He'll do it anyway, and you should take him up on a horseback ride along the beach. There's a half hour ride included free of charge, but he'll get you a non lobotomized horse for a fun run at sunset for only $35. 7) Don' t bring any other currency than US Dollars. You need nothing else.All of the staff were amazing and we had exceptional service from Juliette by the pool as well as Ambrozye (sp?) who went out of his way to get whatever we needed. Francisco kept things going from an entertainment perspective, but I have to say that each and every staff member is commited to excellence at Excellence. An obviously organized and committed management team were always around and genuinely appreciated our feedback. Thanks to our new friends for adopting us. You were a lot of fun to hang out with. If anyone needs blood out of a stone, give Doug a call - he can make it happen.For those of you leaving to go here soon... wish I was you.
