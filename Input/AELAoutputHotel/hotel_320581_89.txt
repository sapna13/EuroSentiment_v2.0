{"text":"modern and in a good lcoation Booked this hotel through expedia which offered a multi night discount so that it went down to a great deal at 139 a night. Its very close to shinjuku station, right next to a couple metro lines, and also convient to the next JR stop down the line if you want to avoid shinjuku craziness.the hotel was very beautiful. the rooms were small, but well organized, clean, and nicely styled. our semi-double bed (booked as double on expedia) was extremely firm (this after sleeping on the floor japanese style for a week) and the pillow was the hardest we had in our Japan travels. sheets were nice though and it had a feather comforter which was cozy. i liked how they had all the products in the bathroom (big things of conditioner etc, and hairbrush, toothbrush, razor, hair dryer). the room also had a tea making facilities and of course the flatscreen.the 2nd floor lounge had two computers for free use, and a coffee machine. a starbucks as well as several other coffee places were very close by, as well as a bunch of cheap eats near the station. the location was really the best part because it was so fast to get to all the parts of tokyo we were interested in, and with few transfers. i would stay here again.note-- they only would give us one keycard to the room even though it was booked as double. the key is needed to even take the elevator. i did weasel one out eventually but it was very irritating.
