{"text":"The Clift is OVER RATED! The Clift is definitely over rated. As mentioned on several other reviews, the doormen are lazy and worthless. I'd fire them because the only thing worse than a guest opening the doors themselves is opening the doors while a stylish guy in a pony tail stands there and watches. No help at all with the baggage. How does that add into a five star rating?The bathrooms are horrible. The marble flooring is scuffed and stained and looked dirty even after a visit from housekeeping. And small! I have never seen a smaller bathroom. There is little or no space for any personal toiletries at all!The rooms are cold and very univiting. Ol' Phillipe S. may have been going for the celestial cloud crap, but itcame off as cold and uninviting. The bed was horrible as well. I'll take a Westin pillow top bed any time over the lumpy bed we had at the Clift.And why can't they find room in the rooms for a dresser? We were here for three nights and lived out of the suitcase because there was no dresser. There was a nice sized closet, that handled hanging clothes, and a K-Mart college dorm style open shelf unit in the closet, but It would be nice to have a dresser!I've stayed here before, and well before the remodling, and I will not try it again. I prefer the Fairmont or ANY Westin over the Clift. The Clift is not a comfortable place to stay. I do not care who designed it, why he designed it that way, of who loves his design. Obviously the hoel management does and the drop his name in every review response. Also the other reviewers mentioned high room service charges, I agree 15% gratutity, 5% surcharge and then a $3.50 delivery charge. All to get a VERY overpriced room meal. I walked to Starbucks every day and was glad I did. Overall not a bad hotel but 5 star? Please!
