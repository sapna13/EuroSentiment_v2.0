{"text":"Fabulous Stayed here for the second part of our honeymmon. Right from the moment we arrived it was fantastic. The staff were so friendly and polite, nothing we asked for was a problem. We stayed in the garden wing. It is a bit seventies style and could may be do with a little updating but we had a lovely pool view and nice big balcony. The bed was super big and comfortable. The bathroom was lovely with a seperate shower and bath. Plenty of lovely toiletries. There was everything you could want in your room. It was spotlessly clean. There was fresh fruit and chinese tea and a congratulations cake for us. We ate in the Line for breakfast and lunch which was lovely and an amazing selection. We had room service most days which was really tasty. We had dinner in Bleu which is fine dining. Don't be fooled by the barfood title as we were. There is a dresscode. the food was really tasty and service exceptional. We also had drinks in the bar and had a nice view of the city. (Not as nice as the view in Equinox restaurant the next night at the Swissotel.) We also had lunch in the lobby bar and was very good. All the staff everywhere are a pleasure to deal with, nothing is a problem. The location is great, just a short walk to Orchard Road and a short taxi to anywhere else you want to go. All in all fantastic. I cannot recomend this hotel highly enough.
