{"text":"Amazing Hotel - Stop complaining! After reading all the negative reviews on this hotel last year, I regretted booking here. But it was too late as I had already booked. When I arrived, I couldn't believe how amazing this place was. I couldn't find anything negative about it. The only thing I regretted was going for only one week. I loved it so much that I am going back for 2 weeks. I am leaving this Saturday and I can't wait!Here's some info for you:Food:The buffet had so much variety that you don't really need to go to the a la carte restaurants. Every night is a different theme (spanish, american, italian,...). The service was great and the staff was very friendly. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ remember in detail what I ate, all I know is that I had amazing food every night. Bear in mind that I am from Montreal where the food is really good. If I liked the food at this hotel, it means something.Entertainment:They had the best show I had ever seen. Their dance routines were professionally choreographed. Don't forget that the entertainers are up early in the morning and organize several activities through out the day. At night, they perform at the show and after that, they go to the hotel's club to dance and get the party going. Speaking of the hotel's night club, only guests of the hotels show up there. If you think people from other resorts are going to come, think again. But if there are plenty of single people at the hotel, the club does get packed. If you don't like it, just grab a cab (ask the reception to call you one) and go to Mangu. Be careful at Mangu, I have heard stories of people have their drinks laced with drugs. Go their with a group of people and be cautious of the locals. If you are a girl, they will ask you to dance one after another, no matter what you look like. So if you crave attention, this is the place for you.Beach:Pure white sand and blue water, what more do you want? It can get rough at times, so be careful of the undertow. You can snorkel at the far left of the beach near the water sport rope, but there isn't much to see. If you walk further right and pass a couple of hotels, there's some better snorkeling, but nothing amazing, don't expect to see Great Barrier Reef quality fish.People:The guests were a mix of Europeans (french, german, spanish, italian) and North Americans. Note to single men: The Spanish women are incredibly hot. Learn a few words in Spanish and go talk to them. If you get lucky, you owe me a drink. Note to women: The entertainers will most likely hit on you. They are harmless, just don't give them any attention and they will move on to their next prey. Room:I don't remember what my room looked like. I was only there to sleep, shower and use the toilet. Once I had the runs and... never mind, I won't go into details. All you have to know is that the plumbing works great!Some people are frustrated with their personal and professional lives. They actually like going on vacation and complaining about everything. So they tell of the staff so they can feel superior and perhaps for once in their life they feel in control. Just go and enjoy your stay. Eat, drink, swim, tan, dance and leave your worries behind.
