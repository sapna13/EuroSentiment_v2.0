{"text":"Perfect Xmas Market Hotel We decided to go to Frankfurt to visit the Christmas Markets as we had heard alot of good about them.I got the Hilton on a cheap deal through work as i work for a travel company. I could not fault the Hotel one bit. Its about 250m away from the main underground station that takes you to and from the airport on Train number S8 or S9. It was 100m away from all the xmas markets and food stalls, and even had a few bars and restaurants within walking distance too! We had a big double room over looking the central park which was nice. The Bed was huge with very comfey Cushons and quilt! ... I couldnt wake up the nxt morning! Bathroom was bigish, it had a bath and a big walk-in shower with a glass panal door that could fit at least 3 people in! (not that you'd want to like! ... but you get my drift!) Best of all though was the Buffet Breakfast in the morning......WOW it was good! They had everything you could imagin and it was always hot and loads of it. Really nice! Room service was good, came within 10-15mins of ordering, and all the staff were happy and pleasant.I wouldnt suggest to buy a drink in the Bar part though as its very expensive! We had 2 Vodka's and Coke and it came to around 40Euro's just for that!Overall we enjoyed our stay there, and will deffo stay there again if visiting Frankfurt!Hope this review is good for you, if you need to know anything else don't hessitate to email me. Cheers! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1205,"mention":"Coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":1201}]}
