{"text":"AMAZING, Absolutely Brilliant! We stayed here last week (Jan 7-14). Had a great time! The food was excellent, our room was well kempt, the employees are nice, the beach is spectacular and the pool more-so. I have read some of these reviews and alot changed about the resort even whilst we were staying there. IFA is trying very hard to make this resort a 5-Star hotel by spring break. For example when we arrived a building was just having the walls put up and by the time we left, windows, tiles, flooring etc had already been completed. There is a fair bit of construction occouring as walk between your rooms and the beach however it hardly bother us to be honest. The spa is excellent as well and the food at the a le carte's were spectacular with great service and atmosphere (eat at the Caribe, the filet mignon was brilliant). We personally had no problems with our room, however one of the people we met down there had their roof eak when it rained however reception quickly gave them a new room and were on the roof of our building the next day. The disco was shite to be honest as the DJ's would play loud latin music for the first hour but after that it was a pretty fun time with more western music so long as you keep the liquor flowing. Food I would give a four out of five and I would personally say this is one of the best resorts I have been to. Be wary of what is written on here that is over two weeks old because, like i said, the resort is changing quickly to bring forward a fresh face for spring break.P.S. Try a tequila boom boom. Wont feel the alcohol, but it will hit you 10 minutes later, and the local drink mahiuana.As well, at the Cafe Dominicano ask for Mary mercedes, she was the best waiter I have ever had. Tipped her $10 at the end of our trip. ","annotations":[]}
