{"text":"Good enough We started our honeymoon here before our cruise. FYI, if you are doing the cruise on either end of the stay, book the hotel through NCL and they will take your bags for you. Otherwise, the NCL office in the lobby will not give a care about you.The hotel was confusing, not signs as to where to go for check in from the shuttle and no one waiting to take our bags. The check in was great, the woman was very nice, our room was in the front tower close to the beach. The view was amazing, in fact, I preferred the balcony view of the beach to the actual beach.They have obviously tried to update the hotel, there are big screen TV's in the rooms and the bathrooms have newer sinks. It is odd what they chose to neglect, like old vents that still have rust. The room was comfortable and the beds were nice.The breakfast buffet was included, it was a nice breakfast, but not worth the $22 price tag if not included.The hotel is across the street from the beach. You are at the end of Waikiki and close to the zoo and Diamond Head. They beach was dirty and kind of sketchy. People actually live in tents n the beach or just have all of their things in a cart or something there. I was not haggled for money, but it just did not feel safe.You will have to walk a bit for a meal, the POSH area is about 6 blocks up the road. Do not walk towards Diamond Head to eat, walk the other way. They have the normal chain stuff. There are many sushi places along the main drag, too. Don't waste your time eating in the hotel, there are many choices if you do not mind the walk.The pool is okay, nothing special, but will suffice. My suggestion is rent a car and go to a better beach than Waikiki.They have a hospitality room. FYI - you share it, so it is weird to go in alone because only the shower area locks and you have to leave all of your stuff in the common area. They do not do a great job saying which sex goes where, so it is quite possible that someone will walk in on you as ANY hotel key opens the door.
