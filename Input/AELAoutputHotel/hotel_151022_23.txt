{"text":"not worth it It is not worth the money. For a little bit more, other hotels in the some area seem to offer better service.We arrived quite late. There was only one person to help an entire group (more or less 15 persons) to the rooms.Once in the room, the lighting switch felt in the floor, the room wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ ready, had a terrible, terrible smell. I was chocked. I asked for another room, and it was given to me. Don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ border to ask anything in the reception because they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do it. They don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ deliver messages; they give you conflicting information, even wake you up at wrong times. In the last day, after checkout, you can have a shower and get ready for the flight. That is very nice. The only problem with that is that I had to ask 4 times for towels, which took 25 minutes to arrive. Very bad service.The space is nice, but that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ it. Food is repetitive and not very good. The fruit is extremely ripe and there are birds flying and eating the food. The majority of the hotel employees is nice, but it takes them a lot of time to do what you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe asked. And usually you do need to ask them all the time to bring you a drink. If you seat in the restaurant, they don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ come and ask you what you need. Of course that not all of them are like this, but generally the services are pretty bad.In the end, it looks like a 3 star hotel. It is not near a 5 star as they say. Grab your money, pay a little bit more and stay in another hotel in the area. I would never stay there again. ","annotations":[]}
