{"text":"Great Location and Friendly Service We recently stayed at this hotel for 2 seperate stays - Pre and Post Cruise. ROOMS - The rooms are typical European size. The hotel is currently being renovated, and the rooms are in much better shape than the hallways. The rooms have excellent A\/C, something not all hotels have, very thick mattress, but somewhat on the hard side. The bathroom was modern, and had excellent water pressure and hot water. There is a blow dryer and a small TV. The rooms are very quaint. STAFF - I can not say enougth good things about the staff, they are very helpful, can tell you how to find anything around town, and will go an extra mile to help you. They provided us with a fan, because we forgot our small one, and like to sleep with the white noise. They also kept our son's treasured blanket safe for him for 2 weeks, because he forgot and left it there while we where on our cruise. We asked for blankets, and they had them there in about 2 minutes. AMENITIES: They have an all day free drink and snack bar area. You can get soft drinks, bottled water, milk,muffins, cereal, toast, cookies, and boiled eggs at any time. They have a small dining area over lookingLa Rambles, that has a wonderful breeze blowing in all the time. They also have free wireless internet. LOCATION; The location can't be beat. It is at the top of La Rambles, and about 2 minutes from Catalunya Square. You can walk, catch the tourist bus or subway, or be at the biggest deparment store all within a couple of minutes. Hard Rock is right around the corner, Burger King and McDonalds are across the street, if you want a taste of the USA. Tapas and shopping are right there. OVERALL: A wonderfully friendly and helpful staff with a great location, good AC, and a modern bathroom. We would recommend it to anyone, but those who are seeking an elegant or really special experience.
