{"text":"Many misleading reviews We spent 2 great weeks at the Barcelo Bavaro Caribe and I really wonder what caused so many negative reviews. What do people expect at a 3 1\/2 star resort outside of Canada or the U.S. ? The best review was written by craigggg, Halifax. He was there just 2 weeks before us and saw and experienced just what we did. I just would like to add a bit more. The pool (at the deep section) was 50 meters long and large black tiles enabled you to swim in a straight line. I am a competitive swimmer and swam for 40 min. at 8:00 a.m. totally alone every day that I wasn't scuba diving or taking a land excusion. I have travelled extensively and have never experienced that. Scuba diving is offered(for $ ) next door at the Barcelo Beach. The company, Scuba Caribe, is first class, offers instruction and has good Divemasters and boats. The diving is beyond the barrier reef so be prepared for top side swells of 10 feet and quite a surge beneath. Many were getting seasick on a calm day, so beware. We booked 3 land (sea) excursions through the Transat reps, Valerie and Patrick. These two are great and so very helpful. Do'nt go out on your own... While there, be generous with tips, learn a few phrases of Spanish (we speak Spanish fairly well) if you want better service. Have a little patience with European rudeness, which is rudeness to us, not to them, and just have a great vacation.Please read the review by craigggg, Halifax, Feb. 19th '07 ","annotations":[]}
