{"text":"if you want a great holiday this is the place 17th November 07 we have just returned from the Melia, we had a great time, lots of relaxing. the sand is white and the sea is clear very little sea weed, no stones, shells or creatures.all the staff were so polite and couldnt do enough for you.the resort is large but there are 2 little trains every 10mins going around the resort plus lots of staff going about on 'golf type' cars always happy to give you a lift.i have a medical problem and would usually find walking distance difficult, but the place is very flat and the walks were lovely.we had breakfast every morning at the beach buffett turey, all the food was 5*.the turey was on the beach and the sea was 10 yards away.we had junior suite rooms, they were basic but large and we had no complaints.there were severasl bars all with open sides to gardens, drinks were great.we saw a wedding most days and they were beautiful.we cannot fault the holiday, the staff in fact we would recomend it to anyone.if you like luxury and being looked after intensely than go Royal service, we didnt feel we needed it, but the room are 5*plus amazing.the ground was a little slippy after the rain but with caution no problem at all we heard of no incidents.the hotel organises some great trips. there wee dancing lessons on the beach, pool excercise, games many things going on.Check in took 10min but Im told some took longer, but relax dont be in a hurry you will be served with drinks and there are big comfy chairs. your cases can take between 10 and 90min to reach your room but dont be in a hurry relax chill and have a drink from the fridge. Tips: this is up to the individual, the lads who brought our cases we gave 4$, and if we got a lift in a golf car we gave $2.if you want to upgrade to Royal service it can be around $80 - $120 a night but sometimes there are special deals.SC ","annotations":[]}
