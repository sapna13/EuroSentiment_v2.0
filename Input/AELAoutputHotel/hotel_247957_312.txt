{"text":"Not that bad really Just come backOk lets get the negative stuff out of the way first, I saw all the negative reviews and got a little concerned as I had already booked the holiday because others were already booked to go there:The rooms were well used and need some work carrying out to get them up to a better standard i.e the plumbing needs to be sorted out a lot of times we struggled to get hot water.The air cons seem to be struggking to be consistant.The walkways are deadly when wet, several people slipped over and required medical attention, as a surveyor I passed on a tip, when painting the walkways which they were doing whilst I was there, just sprinkle a light dusting of sand on the wet paint to make it none slip.The biggest problem for me personally was the smoking, there was no provision for none smokers outside of the resturaunts and as I am very sensitive to cigarette smoke this eliminated me from the reception bar and the entertainment area, maybe more consideration for none smokers and kids should be given.Now I am not a prude by any means, I lived in Holland for many years, but considering that we were on a secure holiday complex why did the security and the management allow the local Bloods in with their PROSTITUTES on weekends to offer their services to even obvious family guys there with their wife and kids, they even seemed to be lining up attractive holiday girls to join them if you know what I mean, this isn't on the all inclusive list of thing to do either it cost a $100 (hope this does'nt encourage some to go)Having said all the above, would I go again,MmmmmmABSOLUTELY the holiday was great, the staff fantastic, the food first rate, the location idealic, the rooms are only someware to sleep and no worse than any holiday hotel or complex for the price, the weather was wet the first week but not all the time, this gave chance to ease ourselfs into the tan second week WOW am I brown.Trips on offer: Saona Island ok but nothing special (specially the all inc food, dont touch the rice)Diving good but only 14m, snokelling not worth it.Carribean Festival (on a Catarmarran) great valueThe best of all the Monster Truck Safari but take a hanky with you I guarrantee you will shed tears when you see how poor some locals specially the kids are, take pens pencils school item with you to give the kids this is well needed (sweets are optional)Each individual has an expectancy of a holiday, you can only see for yourself, yes there are better Hotels along the coast and certainly a lot worse, you get what you pay for but trust me the Occidental Flamenco is really good value for moneygo for folks ","annotations":[{"endOffset":2162,"mention":"Monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Monster_Energy"],"startOffset":2155},{"endOffset":2162,"mention":"Monster","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Monster_Energy"],"startOffset":2155},{"endOffset":2376,"mention":"sweets","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":2370}]}
