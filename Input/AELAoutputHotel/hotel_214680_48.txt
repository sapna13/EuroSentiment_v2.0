{"text":"This is a bad hotel. The Park Shore Hotel is a terrible hotel in my opinion.They do not give customers what they say they will.For example, we made a reservation on the phone requesting2 beds because it was 2 of us (me and my mother). However,when we went up to our room, there was only one bed.I called the receptionist right away at the front desk andshe said that they usually put 2 beds in the room only if they have any left. I thought that's what reservations are for...?! So anyway, despite of our reservation on two beds, she said she can't help us unless we want a roll-up bed. The staff was notfriendly at all and they did not care about the customers'problems. Please, for your own safety, do not believe anythingthis hotel says. The room was as tiny as it could be, we couldbarely pass each other without bumping. The view was towards the side of another hotel and when you look down you can see all kinds of garbage and trashcans. I don't know what happened down there, I think something got burned down and left like this. There was not shampoo or soap or anything of that kind in the bathroom. I thought I would be able to use a shampoo from the hotel but I guess I was wrong. I went to an ABC store and bought soaps and shampoo. The only good thing about this hotel is its' location. It is only 45 steps from the beach. Other than that, there was nothing good about it. They also said that there was free continental breakfast. Again, don't believe them!! It is not free! They also said they have computers you could use for free. Lies, lies, lies. You can tell this whole hotel is a lie. When we first arrived, the hotel looked very nice ( don't be tricked, it only looks nice on the outside) but when we actually went up the elevator we realized what it really was. The carpet was not clean, everything looked very old and the doors to the rooms looked like you could break them down with a kick. Old,old,old. Their prices change but do not go there if it's more than $69, $79 per night because the hotel does not answer to that price. I'm surprised to see their prices at $89, $98. That is ridiculous, they think their hotel deserves this price. Hahaha. Also, the furniture in the room was very old and and not put where it should be. For example, our bed was facing one way while the TV was facing another way making it impossible for us to watch it. We could not move it either because it was in this white, paint-chipped, shelf. The metal parts of it were rusted so when I put my bathing suit up on it to dry, it got on my bathing suit and it wouldn't come out. It's rust.Well, now you know what Park Shore really is so please do not go there (for your own good) unless you're completely broke and have nowhere else to stay!!!
