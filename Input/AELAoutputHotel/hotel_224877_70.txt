{"text":"A beautiful city hotel Lovely hotel with great staff. It is slightly out of the way from the hub of down town miami but i prefrred that. Ocean drive was about a 15min taxi away. We stayed 3 nights on two separate occaisions on a 15 night holiday to miami and the Turks and Caicos. Two nights prior to travelling to Amanayra in the Turks and Caicos and the second time for 1 night on our return back to miami. The second visit wasn't planned, but we loved it so much on the first leg of our holiday we decided to return on the last leg. That, and the fact that our original hotel we had booked on return from amanyara to Miami was just not nice at all, not when we compared it to the oriental in miami and to the Amanyara hotel in the TC.Some minor points for this review, the beach area for the hotel is man made, a strip of land with sand on it with no access to the sea. Personally, i think they would have been better placed to use this space creating a larger pool area as the pool area, although nice seemed a little small and slightly crowded at times. On our first visit we had a marina view room, with balcony etc which was great, but on our second visit we opted for the basic bay view as it was only for 1 night. To be honest we preferred this room. Slightly different design to the marina view and also slightly bigger. Pwerhaps we were just lucky. All in all a great hotel, perhaps not up to the same brilliance to its sister hotel in Bangkok, but great all the same, and for me a preferred option to the delano, tides, ritz carlton etc and even the setai on ocean drive.It was great going to ocean drive for a drink etc, but it was also great to be able to get away from it and return to a refined, luxury hotel.
