{"text":"Almost Perfect The Royal Park Hotel is a fantastic hotel that aspires to be up there with some of the best in the world, a fantastic entrance with space imposing mirrors marble flooring and golden framed doorways...An eclectic range of restaurants to from the traditional Chinese\/Dim-Sum to a more European restaurant which also doubles as the fantastic buffet breakfast facility and a Japanese Teppanyaki eatery.Staff were attentive and welcoming and spoke excellent English, tea coffee at breakfast was always refilled quickly and efficiently and we never had to wait for a table either at Lunch or Dinner in the hotel.Room itself was a tiny bit on the small side to be perfectly honest, this is my only gripe with the hotel and the only point holding it back from a full 5 stars....maybe the room would have been a sufficient\/spacious size for two but for three was just the wrong side of comfortable...but only slightly, it really wasn't that much of a worry.Amenties in room were fantastic, with every need almost being catered for from the dressing gowns in the bathroom to the mini-bar and the big LCD TV, beds were also very good too and room was well decorated throughout, with a special mention going to the spacious Shower\/Bath\/Toilet facility.On paper the hotel seems like it isn't in a fantastic location, but we found it to be near perfect...it's not right in the centre of HK so you don't have the noise pollution, smog etc. to contend with but its not far outside the main central area that you feel you're missing out...with Central station being a mere 10 minute MTR hop away.Another quick mention about the location if you love shopping, you'll love the location as it's practically right on top of a shopping centre!!Great experience throughout here, and would come back again as i found HK and this hotel very nice indeed.
