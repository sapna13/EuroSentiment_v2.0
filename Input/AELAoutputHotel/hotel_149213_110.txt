{"text":"beautiful First, I would like to point out that a lot of the reviews (below) state that the Hotel wasn't good for reasons like our [independant] tour guide didn't speak English and the customs lines [at the airport] were too long. Well, when I went to the Barcelo Bavaro Beach in April 2006, I didn't encounter these problems. But even if I had, I am curious to know how the Resort should be held responsible for slow lines at the airport. Or why the staff is responsible for bad weather. But hey, that's just me...The Barcelo Bavaro Beach is beautiful. I cannot stress this enough. I have been to upwards of 20 different tropical destinations and I think this resort in particular rates up there at the top (Maui being the closest contender). The grounds have just been redone and the paths and plants are beautiful and well-maintained. The beach is simply phenominal - second to none. There is a newly remodeled area with a sports bar, patio, and coffee shop (complete with a brand new giant copper expresso\/coffee maker). The pools were the perfect temperature and well-cleaned. The grounds, the beach are simply unparalleled. Venue: 10\/10The service was also very good. Although a few employees did not speak English, the majority did and those who didn't were able to either figure out what you were asking or direct you to a nearby employee who could. Check in - well, it took about 1\/2 hour. No big deal, since there is a bar right across from the check-in desk. The staff was always happy to please and a tip of a dollar or so was very much appreciated. Service: 8\/10The rooms were average. No better or worse than the normal Holiday Inn. The air conditioning was cold. The water worked (one group out of 8 had water pressure problems). The rooms were clean and comfortable. The beds were not too hard. Overall, not outstanding, not bad, but I don't think we noticed any problems at all because we spent 18 hours a day outside and the rest sleeping. If you are looking to spend the week indoors, go rent a big Villa in Colorado or something and huddle up by the fire. Why would you go to the DR to sit in your room anyway? Rooms: 7\/10The food left a little to be desired. The drinks were made with cheap liquor, but the beer was fine. I would recommend (if you are a drinker) picking up a coffee mug, since the drinks are served in 12 oz. plastic cups and get warm if you are too slow. If you picked and chose what you were eating from the large buffet-style food, then you could eat your fill and be quite content. The Mexican Restaurant was good, the Brazillain one was passable. The atmosphere in the buffet was laid back, and the other places were very pleasant. Overall, I would say the food was average. If you are a picky eater, you will have to pick and choose what you eat, but there is a big variety. If you are a garbage disposal like some of my friends, you could chow on nearly anything and end up fat and happy. Food: 4.5\/10 Drinks: 5\/10.Overall, particularly for what we paid, the trip was wonderful. Sure, you can complain that you didn't like X food or Y waiter was too slow. If you want perfect service and five-star food, go to Mustique or Tahiti and pay 5-10 times as much. If you want a beautiful vacation for a reasonable price with decent drinks and food and are looking for a good time, check out the Bavaro Beach Resort.
