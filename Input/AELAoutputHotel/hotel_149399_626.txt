{"text":"Horrendous - Never Again I have recently been a guest at the Melia Caribe Tropical. I can't believe anyone would rate this a 5 star hotel, I would barely give it a 1 starHotel Services: Four days prior to our arrival I called the hotel directly and confirmed our reservation - one room, two double beds, close to the ocean and pool (which we had paid extra for). We are three adults, one child and a baby. They gave us a room with one king size bed. We had to wait another day before we got a room with two double beds (which I must say - these beds are made for very small people but not for grown adults). Trolly Car\/Train: This is an experience that I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√° like to forget completely. In a place this size they should have a least three trains running at all times. The wait for the train averaged 20 minutes and since we were the last stop by the time the train got to us it was completely full and we had to wait yet another 20 minutes or start walking√à√\u2020\u2022?and that would be ok if the lobby was at a reasonable distance. Walking in 100% humidity in 90 degree weather with a two year old is not the best situation. By the time we got to the lobby we were drenched and exhausted. Restaurants: Their system of making reservations is insanely frustrating and completely unacceptable. In most of the Punta Cana Resorts you have to make reservations if you want to dine at any of the restaurants, which is understandable. Unlike the Iberostar and Bavaro Beach where you can make reservations for the whole week the moment you check in, in this Resort you have to wake up at 7:00 a.m. and begin dialing the reservation numbers, which are constantly busy, to make a reservation for the next day. When I finally got through one day it was 7:20 a.m. and I could no longer get a reservation since they were all booked. This became increasingly frustrating in our √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√üery long√à√\u2020\u2022?11 day stay. It took me 5 days before I was able to book a reservation and when we got to the restuarant they didn't have us down, even though I called earlier in the day to confirm. We were disgusted beyond belief. This resort does not have room service so on those nights which we would have loved to have stayed in and not deal with the hassles of the restaurants or that trolley car we had no choice.I know Resorts, especially √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Öll inclusive√à√\u2020\u2022?Resorts, might water down their alcohol. This establishment took that concept to a whole new level. We ordered a bottle of wine in one of the restaurants and the waiter poured a glass to everyone at the table. When I took a sip - it was water√à√\u2020\u2022?not watered down wine but plain and simple water. They were very apologetic but the harm had been done√à√\u2020\u2022?.talk about getting caught cheating the guest. Pool: It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ great to say that you have 7 pools, but maintaining those pools should be a priority, apparently it's not to these people. There was an unusual odor by the pool bar√à√\u2020\u2022?can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ describe it or explain it. Beach: There is no beach service so if you want to drink something you have to walk to the pool bar which would be fine if the bar was close enough - by the time you reached the beach with your drink the ice was melted. The Iberostar and Bavaro Beach both have beach service as well as the Paradisus which is one of the Melia's Hotels). Thank God this was not my first experience in Punta Cana otherwise I would never be going back. Luckily I have been a guest at other resorts in Punta Cana which have been a total pleasure.
