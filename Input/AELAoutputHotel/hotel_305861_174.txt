{"text":"Perfect deal for a cool stay in HK My wife and I spent three nights at Metropark Hotel in Hong Kong in August 2006. We enjoyed our stay there, as we had the overall impression to have found a very good compromise (comfort\/location) for a reasonable price.Booking : very esay through hotel website, just make sure to get owest possible price by scrolling down the whole page (loest prices are often at the end of the page). We finally paid around 120 √à√\u2020√ü?per night including breakfast, for a 42 sqm suite.Location : not perfectly central (not a walking distance from Kowloon or Central), but we found this to be and advantage towards other HK hotels. In fact, you can benefit from immediate access to the subway (2 min walk, 200 m from Tin Hau), and open view on the hong-kong bay. In addition, it is an advantage as well to escape after an active from the busy crowdy city center.Room : we had 42 sqm suite. It must be said we did not have the impression to have such a surface. Nevertheless, room was overall spacious (bed + sort of small living room with sofa and chair). Being at 21st floor, view was really impressive (park in front row and then in the same landscape HK and Kowloon skylines). Room was clean, even if carpet and floor suffered from several cigarette burnt holes.Food : we tried both buffet restaurant and private vip breakfast space in the uppest floor. The first one offers a great choice of both asian and european dishes, bith fresh and with large choice. The vip room offers less choice, but a much more quiet atmosfear, and a wonderful view (buffet restaurant at first floor is a huge room, which may become noisy).In a nutshell, having made our choice thanks to other Tripadvisor positive comments, we had no suprise to be vedry satisfied.
