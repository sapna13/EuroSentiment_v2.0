{"text":"A Hidden Gem We stayed at the Grand Oasis from June 30 - July 7 2007. We too were a little worried after reading some of the reviews, please do not worry if you have booked this resort...it really is beautiful. This is the first time we have travelled to Punta Cana and it certainly will not be the last. The Beach was amazing lined with palm trees and the gentle breeze at night was breath taking...We stayed in building 7 - the newest building (they are currently constructing new buildings - 100 new rooms will be added to the resort along with a new marina) the weather was flawless between 90 and 100 everyday!!...bring the sunscreen if you tend to burn. The bartenders are ready to attend to your every need and bottled water is plentyfull...the buffet will please even the most pickest of eaters....burgers pizza and fries everyday at the beach grill...shopping is not great - prices are high on the resort..and all seem to be selling the same things..we met some fantastic people from the UK, USA and Canada..the adult pool is really great if you just want to chill and be without the activities of the main pool...The beach party on Thursday evening is amazing..the dinner, show and dancing are done on the beach..the wait staff work so hard..and are eager to please..it rained one night quite hard -...and there was a definate odour after the rain fall..but you must remember they do not have the same water systems we have - you are in a third world Country and need to take a few things with a grain of salt...we also lost power one afternoon for about 3 hours the buffet restaurant had candles everywhere what an adventure...the off resort excursions are also plentyfull...my Husband went deep sea fishing with some folks we met..$80.00USD for a 4 hour trip..they had fun...had a couple of bites...but did not catch anything...I would advise brining USD - small bills for tipping..also better to barter with...bring a book for the airport as they bring you there 2-3 hours before your flight leaves....but the airport is nice with shops and coffee stands..I hope you have as great a time as we did..Nigel and Christine ","annotations":[{"endOffset":819,"mention":"pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":814},{"endOffset":829,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":824},{"endOffset":829,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":824},{"endOffset":2060,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2054},{"endOffset":2060,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2054}]}
