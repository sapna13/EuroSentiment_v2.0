{"text":"Hicups Upon arrival at 8 pm the confirmed type of rooms was not available. The lady at the receiption promissed to move us the next day around noon. At 1 pm the promissed rooms were about to be ready, at 2 pm only the mini bars have to be checked and you can switch rooms and at 2:30pm Sorry, the rooms were given to other guests by mistake. 3:00 pm: You can move in 30 minutes. 4:00pm: You can move every second. 4:30 pm Ooops. Finally at 5 pm we received much bigger rooms than originally booked: Super huge suites!Same with some other services - It is like the left hand does not know what the right hand is doing: If you have your laundry picked up for cleaning service, they will return your laundry the same day, but not give you a new laundry bag. No big deal if they wouldn't charge you 35 bucks for the missing laundry upon departure. Or the mini bar: When you arrive, everything is great. You drink a bottle of wine the first night, they will remove the used wine glasses the next morning, but never give you new glasses. About the bar area: The bar is really nice and fun and fully packed with young local people on the weekends. All seats are reserved, but there is no way you can reserve a seat in advance (even for hotel guests), unless you order a bottle of Vodka or better for 140 USD.They offer you seating in the lobby, which is very windy, if not stormy. Whenever someone opens the the main door of the hotel a tremendous wind blows right into the lobby.Besides all these little hicups, the Clift is a fancy and nicely designed hotel for a reasonable price. The rooms are clean, designed by Starck and Schrager and the staff tries to be helpful. If you want better services you may want to chose the Ritz Carlton or Mandarin Oriental, where you pay about 50% more.Not recommended for families: The restaurant does not have any kids menu!Try to get a room to the back: The street in front of the hotel is very noisy!!!
