{"text":"Just OK. Not going back We took a Mother and Daughter trip in October 06' to Punta Cana and stayed at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. There were a total of 7 of us. The view of the beach is awesome. The colors are unlike any I have seen before. The hotel and staff seemed very nice and were very helpful. They work hard and for a lot of hours. Other than that, nothing else to brag about. The bar by the pool had this smell all week that made all of us sick to our stomach. Kinda like someone broke a bottle of something sweet and didn't clean it up for a really long time. There are fleas in the beach sand so look out. I had to stay by the pool for most of the week. My bites took well over 1 month to heal. They actually left scars on my legs\/arms. The food sucked!!!! By the last 2 days I was eating nothing but veggies. I couldn't wait to come home and have some normal food. We stayed at the Palace so we had the luxury of being able to try all of the resorts. All of the food was nasty. The buffet at the Casino made all of us sick with some kind of stomach bug. Don't eat the deviled eggs. The mexican restaurant at the Beach was really gross. We did win some money at the Casino however :0) There is not much to do while in Punta Cana. Our Apple Vacations rep told us not to do any of the excursions that were not offered by Apple as some visitors in the past had gotten hurt from inexperienced operatiors. Kinda scary. The resort grounds are nice but once you get off the resort grounds it's a totally different story. They plow their garbage on the streets like we would plow snow. I am happy that I went for the experience but I am never going back.
