{"text":"Out the way but worth the stay The Whampoa Harbour Plaza is a little out the way as its not in the central Kowloon area but the Star Ferry across to the island is only 500m away so it still easy to get to. Its actually quite relaxing after a hard days sightseeing to have that 15 min boat ride to escape the main island. The hotel also offers a shuttle bus to the bottom of Nathan Rd. The bus also stops at Hung Hom railway station (although the bus driver was a little weird about picking people up from that stop).We had harbour view room (9th floor) and its was fairly luxurious with a great deep bath which was awesome for soothing weary bones! This was our first stop on our RTW trip and it set a high standard for the others to follow. The buffet breakfast was good but a little pricey as the Pacific Coffee Club just up the street does a decent croissant and coffee (plus free internet) for a third of the price.As for sightseeing we had an actioned packed first day where we managed to do Victoria's Peak and a little of the main island early in the morning and caught the ferry to Lantau Island to visit the big Buddha (Po Lin Monastery) in the late afternoon. HIghly recommended but only if your fit and healthy otherwise split this over two days.As for dining, we splurged a little on Aqua at 1 Peking Rd for dinner which has some awesome views but it's a little pricey. The local shops and bakeries are just as good though!
