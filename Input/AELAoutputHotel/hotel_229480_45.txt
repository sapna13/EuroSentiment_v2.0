{"text":"OK, but expensive We stayed August 2-5, and August 10-12, 2006 in room 920. We booked directly using the hotel website and paid 141 euros for week nights and 124 euros for the Friday nights. Additionally, we paid 5% and a fee to Master Card. It seemed like a steep cost, especially after having stayed two weeks in Las Vegas at the Mega Resorts for next to nothing. Also, we were not able to receive a lower rate for use of the Entertainment Card, which is listed on their web site.The best aspect of this hotel is the service. We especially appreciated the concierge men, who helped us on twice: once to locate a quality hotel on the Island of Terschelling and a second time to find us bubble wrap so that we could pack our numerous jars of cranberries from Terschelling. (We could not bring liquids or gels on the flight on August 12th.) Also of service were: the lady at the front desk who put us in a room with a view and the numerous people who gave me attention when using the safety deposit box, which I needed as I was carrying valuables that I did not want to carry in a purse on the streets.Room 920 had not been renovated. It was OK, but sort of old and in need of renovation.My friend joined the Priority Club. I expect we will stay their again. She really loves the place because of the location outside of the city.I think the buffet breakfast was the best. We got up early every morning and ran down for a delicious cup of coffee and eveything imaginable.What I did not like about it was: there is no way to open a window and the room really needed some fresh air. Also, I wanted a pool. I was so tired when we got there, and a refreshing swim would be nice.I expect to be back there again. I can't wait for a delicious breakfast and the tram ride into the city center!
