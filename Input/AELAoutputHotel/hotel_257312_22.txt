{"text":"Perfection; Deserves a 4th Star! When you are greeted outside by name by the owner of the property, you know you've reached someplace spectacular. Simpsons is actually a refurbished home from the late 19th century. It's located on tree-lined Challis Street which has an adorable bookstore, great restaurants (Fratelli Paradiso!) and an easy walk to the tube. The scent of fresh lilies was the first thing I noticed in the foyer (and in our room). The foyer opens onto a small sitting room\/library with tons of books, well worn and soft leather chairs and sofa, a computer tucked away in the corner with free internet, a cozy fireplace and sherry\/port for your pleasure. What a perfect way to be welcomed home at the end of the day. To get to our room, we walked up a beautiful oak staircase, noticing the exquisite stained glass windows. The Cloud Suite, was on the 2nd floor right at the front of the hotel with pretty views of Challis St. The room had a comfy king bed, 2 person jacuzzi tub, (sealed over) fireplace, a beautiful stained glass window, a small loveseat  coffee table, closet with iron  board, DVD player, alarm clock and writing desk. There is AC, although being fall\/winter we didn't turn it on. The only flaw; the shower door leaked a lot of water onto the bathroom floor. Complimentary breakfast (cereal, fruit, toast  jam) was served with a hot beverage of your choice (tea, French press coffee). It was such a nice way to start the day.The best part of Simpsons is the amazing staff. They make you feel like you're a friend of the family. Vanessa patiently and tirelessly answers all the guests questions during breakfast on everything from restaurant recommendations to directions. She'd answer the same question over and over again and always with a smile.I believe the highest compliment you can give a hotel is to send them more guests and believe me, I will be telling everyone I know about this gem.
