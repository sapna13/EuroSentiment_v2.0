{"text":"the good, the bad and the ugly Suggestions:!)Rent a car! It's an American territory - most signs are english or easy spanish, roads nothing different than lots of other places.2)Get used to the idea of bugs - there are even cockroaches-it's the tropics! Bring some Deet -ingredient bug juice if the biting ones particularly like you!3) Appreciate that this is a travel experience, it's not going to be what you have at home - or else, why travel?We are a family of four - with two late-teen daughters. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and a daughter going off to college. We looked forward to a place away from the Waikiki of San Juan party environment. We found that the resort is lovely - and although far away from most everything - we enjoyed the peaceful, lovely atmosphere. TRANSPORTATION We had rented a car, because 1) in doing the research, including these reviews, the fees for the transportation to and from the resort to the airport were as much - or more than - renting a car for a week!! This was a great decision , EXCEPT that the DAILY FEES for parking were NOT DISCLOSED TO US IN ADVANCE ,by the resort or Travelocity, and this added an unpleasant surprise of an unbudgeted expense for a week! (unless we had used AVIS - they have an office at the resort -and rental charges probably include those fees) 2) Also, the car allowed us to explore on our own; the east end of the island offers quite alot of activities! (the rainforest is great and so close, the luminescent kayak trip is work but SO worth it, and several swimming beaches close by) and we could get our own food - good  cheap restaurants nearby on the hiway or in other towns - instead of paying the exorbitant prices at the resort! And we could go into San Juan when we wanted (*take the toll road - for $1.50 TOLL it saves MANY slow miles of stop light travel)We did eat one dinner at the resort @Asian restaurant $20.00 - 45.00 pp range, very good and 'gourmet -type (small delicious portions)but very $$$$! Also the breakfast buffet there $25.00 pp \/ $16.00 for continental(=no hot food)ROOMS: The resort was not particularly busy the last 2 weeks of August, but we still were relegated to the units farthest away from everything (bungalow 7) we figured it had to do with booking through a discount broker, although they denied it. The rooms were great; the musty, tropical air is what you find in the caribbean- it's very much expected. AND bugs of all kinds are also tropical, I doubt there were bed bugs(claimed by another reviewer) -because I didn't get bit, but my husband did- and he always gets bit wherever we are) more likely it was no-see-ums that are everywhere in the tropics in the late summer !If you want exterminated and sanitized accomodations - stay in the 30th floor of a high rise american hotel!I did object to the fridge- apparently electronically controlled (ie: they know when you pick something up) filled to the brim with outrageously priced waters  booze ( no room for your stuff) and the candy tray -out on top -with equally exhorbitant prices $5.00 for a .75 cent candy bar.The walk was pleasant when we did walk to the main pool, sometimes hot if it was a muggy day, but sometimes breezy!The golf cart transportation was fairly regular and the staff running the carts were very attentive - or possibly it had more to do with having two cute blonde young ladies with us! The pool was great -almost too warm- and since we live in Calif, we were not looking for A Beach like we have, (again, we read the reviews) we were satisfied with the wonderful snorkle beach they have and the many colorful fish we saw!! All in all we enjoyed our stay and did not want to leave as soon as we had to..The Parker familyCamarillo, CA ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1781,"mention":"toll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_chip_cookie"],"startOffset":1777},{"endOffset":1781,"mention":"toll","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_chip_cookie"],"startOffset":1777},{"endOffset":3013,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":3008},{"endOffset":3090,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":3085}]}
