{"text":"Superb hotel with the most fabulous staff i've come across Where to start..As the other reviews have mentioned before me, we were picked up at the airport, greeted at the car (by name) upon arrival by the wonderful ladies at check-in and whisked up to our 1 bedroom suite where we enjoyed a lovely cup of tea and a chat about ever-changing Singapore over the last 20 years with our wonderful butler Placidus.I could go on and on about the beautiful suite, the exquisite way the hotel is decorated and the outstanding handmade chocolates, pastries and other delicacies prepared right in the hotel including the most amazing orange juice (you have to try it to understand) and the divine breakfast prepared by Ernest Ling in the Summit Room, but the most outstanding aspect of our stay in the Valley Wing was the impeccable service of the Shangri-La staff.Each member of staff we came across seemed to know us by name and we spent many hours in the hotel lobby chatting with each of them (while sipping champagne and other exquisite Australian wines). Everyone was delightful and friendly and it was a wonderful place to come home to each day.I can honestly say there is not a hotel in Australia that offers such outstanding facilities and service. While the hotel is aesthetically incredible and a true 'home away from home', we would return to the Valley Wing at the Shangri-La Singapore simply because the staff made our stay more than perfect. It was truly the most enjoyable hotel experience I have had and I would never stay anywhere else.
