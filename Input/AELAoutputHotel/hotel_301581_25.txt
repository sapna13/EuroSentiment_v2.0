{"text":"New name but same quality experience... Recently stayed at the Fairmont Singapore for 3 nights. Have stayed at this hotel every year now since 2002 and athough the name has changed our experience has not. When I found out that the hotel had become a Fairmont (from previously being Raffles the Plaza and before that the Westin Plaza) I was slightly apprehensive about any potential changes, especially after reading some reviews, but can honestly say that we were as impressed as ever. If anything I think the customer service has gone up a notch - certainly in the lobby area the staff seemed more attentive. I always book through a local Singapore agent and have never experienced a problem with a booking and manage to obtain an all inclusive rate. I would strongly recommend booking a room in the South Tower as these are more modern and are well worth the extra few dollars. One of the many things I love about the Fairmont is that you can step outside your room onto the balcony and take in the atmosphere and city buzz from above and the views are just amazing. For someone who used to live in Singapore I think that the location is just perfect - shopping centre and MRT attached (just 3 stops to Orchard Rd), within walking distance to Suntec City, the Esplanade, Sim Lim, Bugis, Boat Quay, as well as all of the 'just over the road' places such as Raffles Hotel and Chijmes. I did pay more this year for the hotel but it seems that all hotel rates in Singapore have gone up and this one by no greater proportion than any other. Have also stayed at the Oriental Hotel, The Fullerton, Mandarin, Pan Pacific and others but keep coming back to the Fairmont. Can't wait for next years visit!
