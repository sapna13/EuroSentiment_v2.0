{"text":"Doubletree Boston is closer to Cambridge This is a lovely hotel, across the river from Cambridge. The concierge staff was very enthusiastic about making dinner recommendations and reservations for us during Restaurant Week and answering all our direction questions, even when we called from off site. On the other hand, several of the front desk personnel were less than informative and lacked a hospitable attitude.The location is isolated, however, right next to Route 90. You must take the free quick hotel shuttles to the set locations, Aquarium, Copley Square, Harvard Square; walk about a mile to the T, take a taxi or drive into Boston. We enjoyed excellent weather and were good walkers, but it is a factor for future visits. Despite the free chocolate chip cookies on check in, I did feel nickel and dimed, parking was $25\/day, $10\/day in room internet, $5 each Showtime program. My teenage son refused to buy soda there, it was $1.50. We did not have breakfast or any meals there, again due to the prices, $16.00 for a hot breakfast buffet. We did fine stocking up at the Whole Foods and Trader Joe's across the bridge, using the in room refrigerator and microwave. Excellent coffees and teas were supplied (free). We requested and received a river view room. The bedroom had 2 twin beds, which was okay. The living room couch opened to a fairly comfortable double bed. The decor was excellent, although I could have used a mirror in the bedroom. The HDTV in the living room had a GameBoy controller. The room was very clean, except near the refrigerator. The pool was on the small side, but enjoyed by the young set. The hot tub was fine. Apparently the sauna has not worked for a long time, but it is still on the hotel web site.For the $185\/nite I paid (AAA rate) plus parking, plus tax, I felt the hotel was market-appropriate. I needed a suite layout and chose this hotel, despite the location, because of the shuttle and did not mind the proximity to Cambridge. Check out the shuttle schedule- it does not make its hourly runs at 4 or 5 in the afternoon and stops fairly early in the evening.
