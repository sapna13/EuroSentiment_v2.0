{"text":"Great location I needed to go to Hong Kong for a business meeting in Central, but my husband and a girlfriend decided to tag along. Chose Metropark Wanchai for price and location. It was ideal on both. Our flight arrived at nearly 7pm, we took the Airport Express and then the free shuttle. Bus stops right across the street from the hotel, so dragging suitcases the few steps to the front door was not a problem. Checking in was a breeze, my husband went straight to a restaurant to order dinner, while my girlfriend and I checked in our belongings. Fortunately, our favorite resto for Peking Duck was literally around the corner - American Restaurant - and by the time we arrived, appetizers were being served. The hotel is very near where the action is, Lockhart Road, and deciding from among several bars and restaurants can be tricky. Pacific Coffee is right behind the hotel, so is a good choice for non-buffet continental breakfast and free internet which runs on Windows 98! Coffee is pretty decent, too.The hotel room was very clean although small-ish, but par for the course in HK, modern furnishings (newly renovated), flat screen TV but limited cable channels. The pleasant surprise was the size of the bathroom which was roomier than my own home TB! However, we noted moulds growing under the clear sealant around the tub - a slight turn off but not enough to put us off entirely. A can of Dettol can be bought from the 7-11 (also behind the hotel) and should solve the problem. We were on the 9th floor, the non-smoking floors are higher up - and was far enough up to insulate from street noise, which isn't as bad as on the Kowloon side.Did I say the best part about it was its location? It is a couple of blocks from the Wanchai MTR, a very pleasant walk away from the Wanchai Ferry Pier, and a slightly longer walk takes you to Queens Road East which can take you to several bus stops. And for those with a tech proclivity, the Wanchai Computer Center is down the road and across the street ;-)Service was very fast on the two occasions I needed something (an adapter and an extra pillow), but yes, the beds are a tad hard. Nonetheless, it was a very pleasant stay. All three of us agree.
