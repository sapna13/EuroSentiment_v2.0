{"text":"Style and Class I stayed at this hotel one night for business because of a recomendation from an associate. It is very centrally located, besides - the public transportation is very easy in Berlin anyway (trains and u-bahns). Not at all pretentious on the outside, but well received by some smartly dressed bellhops who whisked my bag promptly up to my room while I checked in. Decor in the hotel is very modern and neatly in its place. The front desk people were super helpful and I guess were having a good day, because they acted quite enthusiasticly behind thier counter as they worked. My room was a single and cost 150 Euro. It would have been 130 if you dont want the breakfast. So the term 'breakfast included' is a little misleading - you pay extra for it. The room was also very modern, with lots of glass and low furnature, but had a warm vibe due to the earthy tones and very roomy feeling due to the low furnature. Bath room was great - adorned with granite and glass - maybe on the small side, but for a single guy it had more than enough room. My personal favourite addition was the personal Lavazza expresso machines in each room. What better of a way to start and end your day than with a frothy fresh Lavazza expresso!The breakfast was supirior to all I have had in Europe and the US. Second to non with the vast selections of the buffet, plus made to order omletts if you want. All of this topped off with thier signature service. No sooner had I sat down - I had a coffee in front of me and silverwear to start my meal.My stay was short, but one of the top experiences with a hotel while on the road. Thanks Swissotel!
