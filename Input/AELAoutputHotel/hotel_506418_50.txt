{"text":"Not A Good Value! We spent a night last weekend at the Hotel Vitale. The location is great -- across the street from the Embarcadero  the Ferry Building\/farmer's market. We took long walks -- to North Beach and Coit Tower in the morning, and to Union Square in the afternoon. The hotel has a hipster feel, and nice design -- although the bar was crowded with a large tour group of some sort on Saturday afternoon. The rooms are stocked with soap, shampoo, and lotion by Fresh, which we loved. Overall, however, we were not very impressed with the service and feel of the hotel. Most glaringly, we were awakened in the middle of the night by two telephone calls -- both times the line went dead when we picked up the phone. When we called the front desk to find out what was going on, the manager haughtily told us he was trying to check another party into our room and they had no record of us ever checking in. What is your name? he demanded. When we told him, he said he had no record of us signing the check-in card. Again, he told us that other people were trying to check into our room, but that the hotel computer would not allow him to check them in. Sleepily, we tried to make sense of all this -- and were finally able to disengage, but it was upsetting in the middle of the night. We had a hard time getting back to sleep! The next morning, when we asked for an extra half hour after check-out, we were given a firm no. I wouldn't stay here again, and for the price, one might expect a nicer attitude.
