{"text":"Large rooms, very nice staff, but not really a luxury hotel Our family of five spent four nights there in mid-March 2008. We had two rooms, each a one-bedroom suite, on a fairly high floor. This is a very good hotel in a fairly quiet area of Manhattan. The rooms appear to have formerly been appartments in this tall but fairly small building (only 7 rooms per floor). The staff was kind and helpful. The Barking Dog restaurant is attached to the hotel and provides room service. The rooms we had were quite large, with small fully-equipped kitchens, and nice views. The beds were quite comfortable, with very nice linen. Nice bathrooms too. However, the decor in the rooms is a little drab (brown, yellow, etc), and the hotel lobby is very tiny. The room service breakfast, served in styrofoam containers, was inexpensive and not very good. The Dumont is a nice hotel that is well run, but it does not look and feel at all like a true luxury hotel. It is surprising that it was ranked so highly among U.S. luxury hotels in the Tripadvisor rankings. It is really not that kind of a hotel, particularly by New York standards. But if you know what to expect, a very nice hotel.Pros: large rooms, very clean, nice view if high floor, kitchenette with a full-size fridge, very kind and polite staff, nice little deli\/grocery on the block, quiet area.Cons: not the look and feel of luxury, tiny lobby, room decor a bit old, lousy room service food and presentation.
