{"text":"Beautiful hotel but the service comes with attitude I just returned from seven days at the resort. It is beautiful -- the beach is fabulous and never too crowded, the water is supreme.My only negative comment was the service at the front desk. I had a very poor time checking in and out of the hotel. Upon arrival, I had to wait 45 minutes to even be served only to be taken to a room that did not have a working toilet. I was greeted with an attitude by the front desk clerk to which I was appalled by and after requesting the manager, we were able to switch rooms. The service is s-l-o-w......and yes, it can be relaxing but sometimes a little frustrating. I also found the waitress staff who worked at the pool area to be unfriendly. When we were leaving, we noticed a number of things happening at the hotel that were different -- guests were being greeted with leas, given neck-hangs with their keys and tropical cocktails in martini glasses. We felt cheated --- we definitely didn't get that treatment!The food at the restaurant is very good -- and very expensive. This was frustrating as we did not have a rental car and thus ate all of our meals at the hotel. Some evenings, we had to wait 30 minutes to even get a menu. The resort needs to make updrades to their service -- however, with it turning into a Whotel -- this point is moot. I would highly recommend a massage at the spa -- it was amazing!All in all, it's a wonderful hotel. But you can tell they are in transition. ","annotations":[]}
