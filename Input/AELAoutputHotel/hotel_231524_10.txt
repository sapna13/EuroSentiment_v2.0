{"text":"Not that great... The way people rave about this hotel as being somewhat of a diamond in the rough my expectations were high. However, this hotel is as basic as they come in an off the beaten path non-touristy neighborhood. The only thing I will leave here liking is the price. The beds are hard as rocks and the bathroom looks out of the 1970s. Only one channel in English on the TV, too. The worst part by far is the paper thin walls. We could hear the people in the room next to ours clear conversations all through the night, on a weeknight at 3am. A call to reception did nothing. Additionally, I second the reviewer who said the front desk staff were lacking personalities. I know it's a 2 star hotel but I couldn't even get one of them to call our tour company to confirm our Montserrat tour the next day. He just pointed to a payphone and even as I returned several times to ask questions on how to dial from inside the city, etc. he had no answers. I got another staffer to agree to make the call for me later that day, I left all my info with him and he would call the room later today. Yeah, we never got that call. Overall, this place is ok for a quick break as long as you know you're getting no frills at all. From the view out our window at the apartment block next door's laundry and into their kitchens to the crusty bidet in the bathroom, it's not at all glamorous. I would not return. ","annotations":[]}
