{"text":"All's well that ends well.... Our family of FIVE ( two parents, two middle schoolers, and a 3rd grader) stayed at the Marriott Desert Ridge Hotel during our week of Spring Break in early April. We arrived early Friday evening after a long day that had started 12 hours earlier; starting in Flagstaff, moving on to a fabulous day at the Grand Canyon and surrounding areas. Needless to say, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ look exactly √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºpiffy√à√\u2020\u2022?as we tumbled, crumpled and hike-weary out the large but not upscale rental car. As my husband snaked around the crowded arrival area I spied many immaculate, beautifully dressed √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ºhiny√à√\u2020\u2022?people coming and going from the lobby, I took a deep breath and as we trod upon the premises we were treated√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√î??\u201A√á¬®?WELL by the valet, bell captain, and assorted staff in the lobby.I had carefully read the room descriptions prior to making reservations. As any family of FIVE knows, it is a challenge making reservations for one room. However this time, I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have to forget, oop√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂, a family member and make it an even four to get a room, as rooms were noted as having a max of five with two queen beds and a sleeper sofa. We opted for the up-grade with the view. It wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ planned as a long stay, just a little nice RR after all the traveling, with a fun pool for the kids and admittedly √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨ovely√à√\u2020\u2022?grounds for the parents, so no worries for mom.Check in was fine, again courteous enough, etc. except I was advised no sleeper sofa. My third grader is small enough (we did it at Disney) so I figured no big deal, sleep on sofa as sofa vs sofa bed. BUT when we got to our room --two double beds (!!!) and NO sofa. The music was vibrant and clearly lively outside our balcony over-looking the pool. One person√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µarty√à√\u2020\u2022?is another mom√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ nightmare. I was not OK with the set up. When we asked for a cot, it took up so much space that other furniture needed to be removed.Another deep breath, and I marched to front desk looked for the person who seemed to be in charge and politely advised, NOT OK. Francesca (sp?) was very attentive and immediately got busy trying to find another room. I also offered to, happily, forgo the up-graded view to look out at a wall gain a sofa, and call it even. No exchange rooms were available√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®√ì√∂¬ÆUT undaunted Francesca kept working it. She offered some sort of penthouse (??!!) room with a dining table for six, and a murphey bed, my eyes started spinning in their sockets (no explanation needed for other moms) then she found it. The executive suite. One King (as if the 3rd grader doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ end up in bed with us anyway) and a sleeper sofa in the other room for the two middle schoolers. Perfection !!!!!! The room(s) were large, lovely (by any standards√à√\u2020\u2022?Belagio, Wynn, Beverly Hills Hotel for recent comparison) quiet, and the view the next morning, one for mental memory books. I advised Francesa that I was not looking for a freebie or a hand-out and she politely scoffed at the thought of anything other than an even exchange.Kevin Costner (in town for a charity event), quietly singing and playing the guitar under my balcony the next morning was an added bonus for mom (and yes, super handsome, !!! etc, in real life).We were treated graciously by all staff, problem-resolution skills seem to be honed, grounds were beautiful, and food was good to fine. RECOMMENDED !
