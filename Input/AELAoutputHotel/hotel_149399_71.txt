{"text":"Family with a 19 yr old from NJ We (my husband  19 yr old son) just got back from the Melia Caribe, July 11th-17th. After reading all the reviews we were on the fence about the Royal Service. However at check-in we decided since we had a teenager with us it would be nice to upgrade with the intentions of getting a larger room. They charged us $90 p.p. per night for the Royal Service. Price included a butler we never saw, a private section of the beach, a private pool  restaurant exclusively for the Royal guests. I specifically told them at check-in that we needed 2 beds. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ bi-lingual so we shouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have had any communication problems right? When we arrived at building 51 we discovered the Royal Service Master Suite they gave us only had 1 king size bed  a small sofa bed. The room would have been perfect for honeymooners or couples but not for a family with kids. In addition, this type of room didn't have a wall between the bedroom  bathroom so there wasn't any privacy. After the 2nd day of not being satisfied with the accommodations I asked for the hotel manager. He was very nice and agreed they should have known better. In the end they upgraded us to a 1 bedroom Master Suite. It was fully equipped like a condo but it still only had 1 king size bed so they brought in a twin size bed in the living room. By then we just wanted to settle down, and it gave us more space to move around. Was the Royal Service worth the money? We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ think so. What the resort did have was a Flintstone section with a kiddy play area. If you have kids I recommend you ask for a room in the Tropical side.The resort is huge but we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ find that an issue. From our building the private pool, VIP Lounge and the Gabi restaurant were just a few yards away. Otherwise you did have to take a golf cart around. There were also 2 trains to take you along the other sections. We really never had to wait for a ride. The private beach area included a bar and they did cater to us. The grounds were kept meticulously and were very beautiful. We found the people very friendly and the staff could speak pretty good English. Food = Average. There were times when we could only get late reservations at a restaurant but in general the service was always good. The Japanese, Dominican and the Capri (seafood) were the best; the American Grill the worst. The Gabi was very good for breakfast  lunch and if you were too tired from the sun good for dinner as well, however the Gabi is opened air, no AC.Entertainment and Bars = Average. Royal Service offered top shelf brands, but whether you were in the regular section or Royal Service they only served 1 beer, √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨l Presidente√à√\u2020\u2022?which we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like. The house wine which is included was average; you had to pay for better quality wines. The resort did offer plenty of bottled water and all the lounges, bars and restaurants were very accommodating with any drinks. We were disappointed with the nightly entertainmentt. Every night at 10:00 they had a different show. All I can say is it was just Ok. They did have a lot of lounges spread throughout and a small casino. We did have fun there. Beach Area = Average and the main reason we rated it this way was becasue of the seaweed. I don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ care what others have written it wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ 1 or 2 strands; there were clumps all along the stretch of the beach. Every morning we saw bags lined up on the beach with workers manually bagging the seaweed and carting it off but within minutes it was back. Otherwise it would have been a beautiful beach lined with straw umbrellas and chairs to relax on. Would we return? Perhaps but to another section of Punta Cana where there is no seaweed.
