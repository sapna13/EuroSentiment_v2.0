{"text":"Great Location I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights 3-5 May 2008 and chose the hotel because of it's central location as we did not want to be spending time having to get into the centre by bus or metro. There were 3 of us sharing one room which was very spacious, on the 5th floor at the front of the hotel. The beds were very comfortable (i like a hard mattress), we had 3 windows in our room so it felt very light and airy and we had great views of the city. We didn't use the tv or internet as we literally only slept in the room and were out all day and evening. The bathroom was a good size and plenty of space for 3 people to put their things (i have stayed in many hotels with tiny bathrooms). As other reviewers have said, the bathroom door is a bit strange and it could be a bit awkward if you are sharing the room with someone you don't know very well. The air con was the quietest i have ever know which was good. On the Saturday night there was alot of noise from outside (we heard nothing from other guests staying in the hotel) due to the central location and there seemed to be people partying out in the street all night! I imagine our second night, the Sunday, would have been much queiter but Real Madrid won a big football match and the city partied all night!! I was so tired from all the sightseeing and lack of sleep from the night before though, I slept through it!Our price did not include breakfast but the cafe nextdoor, Hontanares, does great snacks, fresh orange juice and cappaccinos. The staff at reception were very friendly and helpful and i would recommend this hotel for its great location but if you like your sleep and are staying over a weekend you may prefer to request a room at the back of the hotel.
