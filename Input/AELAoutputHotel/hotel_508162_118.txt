{"text":"Great resort for all ages Our family of 5 (hubby and myself along with 3 sons ages 19, 17, and 13) just returned from Dreams and we all loved it. The entertainment staff did a great job. As soon as you signed up for an activity and they knew your name they went out of their way to say hello and call you by name every time they saw you, which made us feel even more a part of the resort. We loved Mielko and Mickey Mouse. There were so many activities each day that you couldn't do all you wanted to do. We hardly sat down and relaxed at all, but of course that was our own choice. Others just sat and watched most of the time and had a great time too. Our 13 year old loved the Core Zone and activities there such as archery and air gun competitions. Our older boys loved water polo, sand and beach volleyball, Olympic games and pool games. My favorite activity was the Paella contest on the beach. Don't miss this one, it's a blast. I loved the dance lessons too. My husband loved water polo and the water balloon fight in the pool. The food was very good, not as big of portions as Americans are used to so be sure to order appetizers each meal. The Asian restaurant was incredible. One of my favorite parts was the cart of fresh fruit where you chose your fruit and the lady would cut it up for you and serve it on a stick so you could walk around eating your fresh mango or pineapple on a stick every afternoon. Yummy.Now the bads: the bus trip was a little rough...they don't drive like we do in the US, that's for sure. My son said if he drove like that he would get a ticket for reckless driving! The bed wasn't very comfy but they never are quite like home. There is a one hour gap every day when you can't get food and it's hard to get drinks (while they are getting ready for dinner) plan ahead for this and it isn't a big deal, but it's good to know about. They did not offer near all of the top shelf liquors of many (most) resorts so I had to adjust what I drank. The bartenders etc like you to throw them a buck tip every once in a while and then you can get a little better service as sometimes it is a little hard to get a drink. Just relax and realize you are on vacation and time doesn't matter here and all is good. The resort is on the Atlantic and not the Caribbean so we are not sure if this is why the water wasn't very nice (very rocky and not very blue) or it might have been because of the recent hurricanes. Either way, be sure to wear water shoes in the ocean as we got our feet cut right away. We have never been to the same resort twice because we like to have new experiences but this is one place we would consider taking our family again because it had something for everyone.
