{"text":"Beautiful view from corner deluxe room, 20th floor Waikiki has so many hotel choices that it helps to spend a little time deciding what is important to you. I decided that for us the top priorities were getting a clean, quiet room with a great view of the beach, a good sized room and bathroom, and avoiding the congestion of the construction areas. We booked a corner deluxe room at the Marriott and were very pleased. For the same price as a garden view room at the Royal Hawaiian and less than an ocean view room at the Outrigger Reef or Outrigger Beach, we had a great view from the 20th floor with a very large room (by Waikiki standards). Best points of the hotel: The corner deluxe rooms -- especially on high floors -- have a lanai on one side (facing toward the next hotel with a side view of the ocean) and a very large window covering most of the oceanfront wall. So the views are fabulous. It would be much better if the lanai were on the front, but strangely, the K tower (which is the one closest to the beach) does not have front facing lanais except maybe on the top floor. Also the corner deluxe rooms are unusually large for Waikiki rooms. Our room was clean and the beds are exceptional with many pillows and a down-filled mattress pad. Because hotel is at the end of Waikiki where hotels are across the street from the beach, the front view is really of the ocean and not of adjacent hotels. Because it is at the Diamondhead end, it is easy to get out of the hotel and onto H1 or other major roads. Air conditioning works well and we did not hear noise from the room on the other side. Staff was friendly. Like most major hotels, there is an ABC shop in the lobby plus a variety of other shops. Although there are no views from the main restaurant, we had dinner there twice and the food was perfectly acceptable. Unlike other reviewers, we never had to wait too long for an elevator.The less positive: The ResortQuest hotel next door blocks views toward the Diamondhead side and they have live music at their pool during breakfast and in the evenings. We were on a high floor and ran the air conditioning at night, so it didn't disturb us but on a lower floor or with the lanai doors open, this could be a problem. The parking garage is horrible, but that's probably true everywhere in Waikiki. The turns are very tight and the traffic goes both ways. You have to use the mirrors mounted on columns to see if other cars are coming and usually, one car would have to back up to allow the other to pass. Valet was easier, but my husband hates to have to call for the car every time we leave. On the plus side, we always found a parking space. The bathroom was adequate but not luxurious and strangely, there is only one light for the vanity area and the bathroom so if you go to the bathroom in the night, turning on the light may disturb your spouse.Overall, we were very pleased with the Marriott and would certainly return, especially for the corner deluxe room which is a good value for the price. Many of the negatives stated in other reviews are true of virtually all Waikiki hotels. This is definitely a place where is pays to do your research, and having stayed at a number of hotels in the area, we think this hotel is a good choice. If you want to be at the other end and don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ necessarily require a great ocean view, the Waikiki Parc (sister hotel of the Halekulani) is also a good choice.
