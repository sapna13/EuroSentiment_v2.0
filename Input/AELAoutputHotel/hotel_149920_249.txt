{"text":"Thanks Priceline! My husband and I had a sudden change of travel plans and needed to book a next day lay-over stay in San Juan. Fortunately we were able to get online and book on Priceline! We got this hotel for a bid of $120 a night, a significant savings from the $280-400 per night listed on the Marriott website. We even got a fairly decent room, in the tower on the 7th floor with a partial ocean view (the other part was of some very noisy construction of another high rise hotel right next door, but they lay off work at 5)Let me warn you, tho, the hotel does hit you with a few extra charges beyond what you've already paid thru Priceline, such as a resort fee based on percentage of room price, an occupancy tax of $10, and a parking fee of $14 per day.This hotel is located in the Condado section of San Juan, which is pretty much identical to Miami Beach, including a Starbucks, a Subway Sandwiches, and a Wendy's in the immediate neighborhood, just in case you've been missing junk food.As others have stated, the beach and the hotel grounds are lovely, with the whistling of the coqui frogs at night, and the staff gorgeous and helpful. We didn't explore the bar, casino, restaurant or buffett. We did eat at a 24 hour Puerto Rican diner just down the street, where we tried some very nice goat at a very reasonable price.All in all it was a fun nights stay at a great price for this area!
