{"text":"Five Stars for the Four Star My husband  I recently stayed at the Sofitel NY based upon the reviews from tripadvisor. Needless to say, we were not disappointed. I must preface these comments by stating that I am a hotel snob,  mind you, the Sofitel is not a five-star hotel, but it does not claim to be. (Although some of the service we received was better than some we have experienced at certain 5-stars.) Location: The Sofitel is situated 44th  5th, making it just about the perfect location for walking to just about anything (Times Square, Broadway, 5th Avenue, Empire State Building, Rockefeller, MOMA, etc.). Though it is a fair (but entirely manageable) walking distance to Central Park. Service: The service we received was prompt  unobtrusive. Our rooms were cleaned meticulously morning  evening; I requested once for extra towels  note was made for the remainder of our stay (unlike some other five star we've stayed). (We also appreciated the bottles of Evian  box of chocolates each evening.) The concierge was helpful at recommending restaurants  obtaining reservations. Ammenities: The fitness center was sufficiently equipped with treadmills, weights, etc. Our room was a suite on the top floor with a view of the Empire State Building from the bedroom  Rockefeller Center from the sitting room. The rooms themselves are not especially large, but more than sufficient (though more storage space would have been nice). The beds were quite comfortable. The bathroom was spacious enough (not huge)  extremely well lit. The least appealing aspect of the hotel is Gaby's where we found the food to be mediocre at best. Not bad, but not worth eating there twice. Would I recommend Sofitel to friends? ABSOLUTELY. For the great rates you can get on the rooms, I don't think you could do any better.
