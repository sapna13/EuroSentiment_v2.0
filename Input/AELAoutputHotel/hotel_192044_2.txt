{"text":"very pleasant stay We just returned from a christmas stay at the london bridge Hotel. When we arrived, we were given a room that turned out to have a broken heating system, The manager was very apologetic and did what he could to remedy the situation including the loan of an electric heater. The next morning as the heating was still not fixed he moved us to a room which was functioning perfectly and was beautifully decorated. The hotel is very clean and well appointed. We booked the deluxe room as we were a family of three and found the room spacious, though the bathroom was too small for anybody but one at a time. The breakfast buffet which was included in the room price was terrific, though one morning there was an extremely long line waiting to be seated. The hotel is in an acceptable location if all the subways are working, which unfortunately was not the case when we were there! The London Bridge station is across the street from the hotel and would have been perfectly convenient if there had been service on the Jubilee line! Certainly not the hotel's fault.If you are really interested in the theater or Hyde park then this is probably not the most convenient solution for a stay in London.If you are interested in Borough market or the Tate modern museum then it is a great location. Looking at other hotels in London and their prices there is no question that the London bridge hotel offers a wonderful value for the price. ","annotations":[]}
