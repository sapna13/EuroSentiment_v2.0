{"text":"A+ Visit! We stayed here as part of a package. The hotel\/casino is in Condado, conveniently located to lots of tourist stops and within a very short walking distance to the beach and other hotel casinos; plus, it's easy to find. The property is lovely, and the customer service is simply terrific. Our room was comfortable and clean, with a sleep number bed and a balcony as bonuses for us. The staff is very friendly and hospitable in the hotel services areas (front desk, housekeeping, valet), casino, and restaurant. The people of Puerto Rico are so sweet and humble in their pride of their homeland, with lots of people giving us their wishes to enjoy their little island. We went to several other hotel\/casinos during our stay, and definitely thought the Radisson had the most fun atmosphere--clean, friendly, lively, no waiting on drinks (or the yummy little warm sandwiches provided in casinos!), and great live music was playing every night, with dancing in the bar and foyer--so festive! There is a lot of saving of slot machines here and in every casino, but that's just the way it works down there and should just be accepted as part of the culture. The drink system is a little different, too, with the waitstaff appearing to obtain some kind of permission or voucher from the pit bosses; a player's card will ensure free drinks, but otherwise, I'd say you should probably let the pit boss know you're a hotel guest. Our stay at the Radisson definitely contributed to us having a wonderful trip to this beautiful island, which is American enough to be comfortable and Latin enough to be different and exotic.
