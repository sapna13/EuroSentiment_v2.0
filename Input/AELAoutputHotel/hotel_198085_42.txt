{"text":"The best part of Paris First, let me say that my wife is very picky about the hotels she stays in. After the first couple of nights at the Terrass Hotel, she told me √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??he Terrass Hotel is the best part of our visit to Paris√à√\u2020\u2022? We stayed in a Junior Suite and it was very clean, very classy and had a balcony that looked to the west and south, giving us a good view of the Eiffel Tower. This was a five star room if ever there was on. The Junior Suite has a separate shower and tub, king size bed in a room by itself and in the other room, a pull down single (used by our son). Our friend stayed in a standard room, which she enjoyed as well.The only problems we encountered were the fact that they were doing some remodeling just off the lobby which had somehow disrupted their internet service, They did, however, have wireless access in the lobby, for which they gave me a passcode free of charge. The hotel staff was VERY attentive, giving us a great recommendation on a nearby restaurant, the Pepone, a great Italian restaurant, run by Italians. One day my son and I caught the train out to Disneyland Paris, leaving my wife and her friend to √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√°end√à√\u2020\u2022?for themselves about Paris. When they asked how to catch the bus, the concierge, rather than risk confusing them, walked them across and down the street to the bus stop to be sure they got on the correct bus. Try to get that kind of service at a chain hotel! The staff√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ English was very good, all the way down to housekeeping.We did not use the restaurant, as we are not big on French food or restaurants (mostly pizza and French fries). During our stay, you had go outside to the street to enter the restaurant, as they were remodeling access way from the lobby to the restaurant. They have a terrace bar\/restaurant on top of the building, which has a beautiful view of Paris. You must go up their just before the hour at night to see the Eiffel Tower √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Üparkle√à√\u2020\u2022? It was closed most of the time we were there because of rain, but you still have access to the terrace. The hotel is not centrally located, but is very close to the bus stop and about three blocks from the Metro. The taxi drivers weren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ usually familiar with the hotel (maybe it was my French), so get the concierge to draw you a little map with the address to take with you to show the driver. All and all, it was one of the best hotels I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe ever stayed in and we HIGHLY recommend it.
