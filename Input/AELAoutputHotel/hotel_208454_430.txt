{"text":"My favourite hotel ever! Booked the Sofitel as part of a package on Expedia, so can't comment too much on the price, apart from to say that it seemed very reasonable.Overall this hotel was the best my partner and I have ever stayed in. It was fantastic - felt very posh, but didn't make you feel inferior when you were wearing your trainers and ear muffs on your way out!The location is awesome, a 5 minute (maybe less) walk to Times Square and lots of other New York attractions. Getting a taxi was so easy, especially because of the great guys outside the hotel who would go into the street to stop you getting snowed on or blown over in the wind. Didn't try the food in the hotel, because there's a lovely diner just down the street which serves brilliant breakfasts, and who wants to eat in a hotel at night, when you can hit the New York streets!The room was lovely, very clean and very spacious. The bed was the most comfortable bed ever, we called it our marshmallow because it was so warm and squishy. Housekeeping came in twice a day to sort the covers out, turndown service I think its called, she also brought Evian water which was a nice touch.Bathroom was perfect, bath and seperate double shower with pedestal sink and mirror with lights around (felt like a movie star!). Very quiet at night, had no trouble going to sleep, even though the street was a busy one. And no noise from other guests coming back to their rooms either. All in all, the hotel was fantastic, and if you can get a good deal, I would recommend it to anyone!!
