{"text":"Great Five Days at the Ritz My husband, 11- year old son and I had a great five day stay at this hotel. The service was fantastic-- at the pool, in the hotel, and in the restaurants. We met friendly people every day, and the atmosphere was very relaxing and convivial. We ventured off the property a few times to eat dinner and lunch in an effort to cut down on what are very costly meals on campus and found a couple of good places within a two block radius. However, the area is very quiet and there are very few options in walking distance. The restaurants at the hotel are quite good, especially Mare's.As it was a school break week, there were tons of kids who found each other and dominated the activities at the pool. The pool is very pretty, but it is not very deep and there is no slide or anything like that. Didn't matter--the kids had a great time going between there and the hot tub (and the beach, with a parent tagging along behind them.)We had a standard room with a pool view, although it felt more like facing an inner courtyard--albeit a pleasant one. The room was clean and well-appointed, but small, and the lack of a balcony --or even a window that we could open --was perhaps the one thing that drove me crazy. I felt hermetically sealed in. I had read complaints about noise from the airport. While the sound is deafening outside the front of the hotel, at the pool, the beach, and in the rooms it is not noticeable at all, which is pretty amazing. We actually liked the proximity to the airport, made the trip very easy.All in all, the Ritz Carlton is a lovely place, and one to which we would return. ","annotations":[]}
