{"text":"Best resort I've ever stayed at! My boyfriend and I are in our mid-twenties and found this resort to have every component for a great vacation. WHERE -We stayed in the Premier section (couples only) and found it incredible! This section has its own pool, restaurant, bars, Internet, etc. We were always able to find a chair by the pool, not too busy and not too quiet. A good mix of families, couples, young and old(er). We ventured to the other pools at the resort and found it a little too crowded.FOOD- The food was fantastic, better than I ever imagined. Try the a la carte restaurants. Japanese and Italian were our favorite, they make the food there as authentic as possible.STAFF- Super nice people, would do anything to make our stay comfortable. Always ready with a smile and 'the usual'!ENTERTAINMENT- Night life started in the main square around 10 and ended shortly after 12 or 1 (depending on which night). After that, the nightclub was the hot spot. The casino was our place of choice.RESORT- Very well kept. Always looked its best! The only not so great thing was its size: a little too big. We were just starting to find things the day before we left. But I'd rather too big with too many options, than not enough. Another reason I'd love to go back! Although it was large, they had very frequent transportation throughout the resort. Never waited more than two minutes.I would recommend this resort to anyone! I've traveled to many islands of the Caribbean and never had an experience like this. I'm picky about food and cleanliness and I was very impressed!
