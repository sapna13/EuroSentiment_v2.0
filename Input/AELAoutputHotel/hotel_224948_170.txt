{"text":"Travel Agent's review My husband and I just returned from a wonderful 4 nights at the Omni, and have nothing but good things to say about the hotel.Arrival - we opted for public transportation, taking the BART from SFO airport to Montgomery st and walked up the street to the hotel (maybe a 10 minute walk) It cost us $5.15 per person rather than $42 for a taxi from the airport, and it took about 40 minutes.Check in\/out - I had notified the hotel that we would be arriving early (10am) and we received our room right away. We were also permitted to check out late, at 1pm.Staff - were fantastic, very friendly and helpful. I had notified the hotel that it was my husband's birthday, and they sent up a bottle of wine (which was pretty good), a fruit and cheese platter and a birthday card. We had nightly turndown service and were given a weather report for the next day, and chocolates.Room - beautifully decorated room, comfortable king size bed, nice ammenities in the bathroom. There was a desk and an armchair with an ottoman - perfect for relaxing and putting your feet up after a long day of walking!Location - in the financial district, but within walking distance to all the sights (if you like to walk!) The hotel is very close to North Beach (Little Italy) and China town, where we enjoyed a few meals. The ferry building\/market was a short 10 minute walk, and pier 39  Fisherman's Wharf were about a 25-30 minute walk away. We walked everywehre, and never found anywhere too far or more of a 1\/2 hour walk. Concierge gave us maps and directions to all the places that we wanted to visit. There were also a few good nightclubs and pubs just around the corner from us.* Sign up for the free Signature guest program - you get juice and a paper every morning and nightly turndown service with a chocolate!Sights \/ recommendations* Alcatraz - we did the night tour (booked in advance), it was cool, and kinda spooky to be there at night.* Pier 39 - the sealions were one of our highlights, you could watch them play \/ fight for hours! We ate at Bubba Gump's (just for the novelty of it) but the food was lousy and overpriced.* Fisherman's Wharf - nice to walk around, lots of souvenir shops and fresh seafood stands.* Giradelli Square - go for the sundaes, they are worth the $8!* Lombard St - worth the walk up this hill \/ crooked street* Tonga Room - just up the street (hill) from the hotel (at the Fairmont Hotel) we went for the $8 happy hour buffet, well worth a visit for an early dinner, and the atmosphere is pretty cool, especially when it rains.* AT  T park - saw a Giants game (bought tickets there), what a nice park, with beautiful views of the bay (if you get the right seats - we were on club level)* Ferry Building \/ Market - there was always some kind of street performance going on there.We'd definately return to the Omni!
