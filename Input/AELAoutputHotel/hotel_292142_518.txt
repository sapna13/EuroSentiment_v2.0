{"text":"So Much Space I have been meaning to do this review for a while so it's a little late......We loved the Affinia, we were on a budget but wanted to push it a little bit to enjoy our stay and not have to worry about the air conditioning breaking down or hearing the neighbour going to the toilet, we were not disappointed, not only could we not hear the neighbours toiletry habits we couldn't even hear the street below, no sirens, nothing!We stayed for 6 days and the main thing about this hotel was the space and comfort. It was the largest room I have stayed in in all my mid budget travels. It had a kitchen which came in handy with our budget, the bathroom was modern with great complementaries (even mouth wash). It was the best night sleep I have had in a hotel ever, it was hard to drag myself out of it some mornings. We had a large desk that doubled as a dining table with internet connections and all the mod cons. The location was perfect (5 mins max to the empire state, great restaurants and bars in any direction and metro\/trains)The staff were very friendly and helpful and were prompt and efficient, it was the world cup and the cleaning lady has loads of insight into the world cup teams, my boyfriend would get updates from her on the games he missed due to too much sight seeing.We did the typical sightseeing things, we got on the double decker buses that toured around Manhattan, the tickets lasted for two days and doubled as a taxi ride to our favourite places as we could jump on and off as we pleased. There was a torrential rain while we were there in the middle off summer and it was great fun sitting on the top deck in our rain coats and under our brollies while water rushed beneath our feet flooding the below decks, everyone was laughing or crying, it was great fun. We just jumped off when we saw something that looked interesting and jumped back on when we were ready.We didn't use the hotels restaurant or room service as every morning we would get up go to 'our favourite' cafe, pick up coffee, warm croissants and freshly cut fruit only 1min walk away, grab a paper and go back to the room for a relaxing breakfast. Our kitchen came in handy to store leftovers for later, make that extra cup of coffee or cook up a quick snack if needed. Usually we wouldn't be back to the room till late afternoon \/ early evening and once there we'd freshen up and go our for dinner at one of the many local restaurants of our choice, we would just walk along until one took our fancy, one night we found and great tapas bar which amazing cocktails and spent the night listening to live music and drinking huge pina colads. The hotel staff were always ready to recommend a bar or restaurant to try, they would grab a cab for us and tell the driver were to go if it was too far to walk.It was such an amazing trip and made even better by the hotel. I've been to New York before and the hotel I had stayed at was clean and tidy but tiny, cramped and rushed. The Affina made New York living fantastic and I cannot recommend it enough!!!
