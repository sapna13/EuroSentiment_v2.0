{"text":"Super Choice in San Francisco We decided to stay at the Larkspur (formerly the Cartwright) after reading a review in a local newspaper. We then checked it out on Trip Advisor and felt it would be a good fit. Overall, this was an excellent choice from start to finish. We arrived by car knowing that the hotel does not have its own parking, but after unloading our bags we were directed to the parking garage by the staff. It was close, convenient and reasonable for San Francisco at $27 a day if you get your ticket validated at the front desk. Our room, at the back of the hotel, was clean, quiet and very comfortable. Yes, it was small, but we had more than enough space for two and never felt cramped. The bed was super comfortable, one of the nicest hotel sleeps we have ever had.The staff was friendly and approachable throughout our stay. Every night from 5:30 to 6:30 there was a complimentary wine bar that offered a nice chance to unwind before dinner and meet other travellers. Altogether a real treat.Naturally, location matters and the Larkspur does not disappoint. Right by Union Square, it's close to lots of restaurants, the cable car line, buses, shopping, etc.....not to mention you can pretty well walk to anywhere you choose to visit.To top things off, we thought we got a great rate on our room. San Francisco has lots of good hotels, but if you're looking for a cosy, boutique experience and you don't mind not having some of the amenities of larger more expensive hotels, this is a fabulous choice.
