{"text":"Rude Staff ! First of all I've sent in customer feedback to the manager of this hotel addressing all points I've raise below. Apparently customer feedback is not a great priority of this hotel as it has been several weeks with no reply.Let me mention that I received a very good deal on Lastminute.com for my room. 3 days before I was due to arrive I called the hotel to confirm my booking and let your staff know that I will be arriving late. The staff I spoke to on the phone and the staff who checked me into the hotel I found to be extremely rude. She wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ make eye contact, wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ make small talk, was very abrupt and treated me like I was some worthless customer off the street. She asked for me to leave a $100 deposit for my room in case of incidentals. While I appreciate the need to make sure I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ not going to trash the room, raid the mini bar and do a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√ªunner,√à√\u2020\u2022?the booking was made under a business name. It was a corporate booking; the hotel had my credit card number, name, employer, my address and other contact details. Never in my career in hospitality and the hotel industry have I heard of hotels asking for a deposit unless the entire stay was being paid for in cash. I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ assuming the girl I spoke to on the phone and the girl who checked me into be one and the same, because all other staff I had contact with on reception and in your restaurant\/bar\/caf√ã√\u2022√ñ to be pleasant and helpful.My room was nothing really more then a standard hotel room, it was clean and it was tidy. I had requested a non-smoking room when I made the booking however I learnt when I found my room that I was given a smoking room. I would also like to point out that Vibe was the first hotel I have ever stayed in that did not contain some sort of locality guide or information on the hotel. I appreciate that the hotel is in one of Australia√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ largest cities and it would be impractical to list even one quarter of the attractions however listing services offered by the hotel such as your rooftop pool (which I only learnt about today when looking at your website) may not be such a bad idea. The room did include a menu for Curves; however I learnt that half the items on that menu did not exist.I would like to congratulate their housekeeping staff, although I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√òrash√à√\u2020\u2022?my room, I did leave a lot of personal belongings around the room. The housekeepers managed to clean the room well around my belongings which I appreciated.With the right adjustments to customer service I believe Vibe Hotel on Goulburn Street could be a great hotel. Unfortunately at the moment most guests appreciate polite and helpful staff. It only takes member of staff to be rude to ruin a guest√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ entire stay. Everyone appreciates that people have √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥ff-days√à√\u2020\u2022?but after reading other reviews on your hotel it appears this may not be the case since there is an abundance of the same sort of complaint.
