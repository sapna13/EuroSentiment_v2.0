{"text":"Recommend this hotel! We were so overwhelmed with all the hotel choices and having never travelled to Paris before, we didn't know what area, etc! We were VERY pleased with our stay. It's a short walk from the metro station. Free wireless in the lobby (albeit not as fast as I'm used to) with your own computer and also computers in a tiny area for a pricey fee (like everywhere else).The breakfast was good. Nothing fancy but lots of choices. I pretty much had yogurt, toast and fruit everyday, but there were bacon\/eggs; cereals, pastries (of course!)Staff spoke very good english (and since we speak little\/no french, that was great! ) As an avid runner, having Luxemburg park so close worked out welll b\/c I wasn't comfortble running through the streets (too many stoplights, traffic and uneven surfaces) So my 6pm routine was running to the park and after my run ...stopping off at one of the many markets along the way for wine and cheese to bring back to the room. We didn't use the mini bar items but we liked having a fridge to access. A free safe was definitely a bonus too! There were hundreds of eating choices within a few minutes' walk. (And a McDonald's at the end of the street for you travelers that can't go without McMeals...) There is also a post office at the corner too but when we realized it was closed on Fridays and we were leaving the next day, Hotel staff were happy to take care of it for us.The rooms were very cute\/nice (comfortable beds, good size bathroom and a shower\/TUB - we needed it for soaking after all that walking!)ONE small caution: We forgot our travel clock and there wasn't one in the room. So we utilized wake up calls. This is not an automated system and they called us over 30 minutes late one morning.
