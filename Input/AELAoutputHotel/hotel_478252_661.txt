{"text":"Another great stay at Gran Bahia I was here last year at the end of April and had a good stay. Having just returned from my second visit, I must say it was even better. My boyfriend and I were there for five nights. The weather was perfect pretty much the entire time (although a couple of nights were a bit humid) - everyday was sunny with a nice, comfortable breeze.What was better than last year:We learned while checking in (Club Golden both times) is that if you are a return guest, they give you VIP status. This means more attentive service. They called each night to make sure everything was fine.What wasn't as good as last year:The water was still beautiful but it seemed a bit more turbulent which means less clarity near the beach due to the fine sand that gets kicked up. Also, there was some sort of algae. It didn't get in the way, only a nuisance, and the hotel cleaned the beach each night, so the buildup on the sand was minor.What was the same as last year:Good food for the money. I personally enjoy the buffet and El Charro, the Mexican restaurant. Key thing is setting your expectations for what you pay for. I'm normally a foodie and have no problem spending $150 per person on dinner. For $1290 for two people for five nights all inclusive, this is no Four Seasons. But it is excellent value for the money.Friendly service. Everyone here works so hard to keep the grounds clean and guests happy. Of course, it helps if you can speak Spanish, but as with any foreign travel, if you respect them and recognize that you are visiting their country, they will return the friendliness.Overpriced lobby shop. Pack more sunscreen than you'll ever think you'll need unless you're ready to spend $15 a bottle for a cheap brand.I'd definitely recommend staying at Gran Bahia Principe in Punta Cana.
