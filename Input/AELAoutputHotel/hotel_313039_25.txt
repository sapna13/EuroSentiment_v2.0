{"text":"great city! We stayed in accevi villarroel for five nights in June 2007. As a young couple, we were looking for somewhere relaxing, yet somewhere that was within walking distance of the city, and we were extremely happy with our choice! We found that the hotel lived up to everything that we had expected, and more! The hotel is situated in a lovely area, we felt extremely safe at all times of the day and night. we got the bus from the airport to the hotel, and it was very easy to find- using a great map that we got at tourist information at the airport. the room was fab- we were very impressed by the size of the room and the bathroom. the air conditioning was excellent and the bed was very comfy! We had a tv with a good selection of stations, a cd\/ dvd player, and loads of little extras, from bottle openers to sewing kits! we found that the standard of cleanliness in the hotel was excellent. the pool is very small, and is surrounded by other apartments, but the sun deck is lovely, and it was so nice to be able to relax under the sun after a long day sight-seeing! the waiter service to the pool is excellent. we had six full days in barcelona, and we were kept extremely busy everyday as there is so much to do and see. the tourist bus, the bus touristic is excellent, and a two day pass is great value, as it is not possible to see everything in one day. Overall a great hotel,which we would definately recommend! ","annotations":[]}
