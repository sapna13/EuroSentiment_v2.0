{"text":"Good value, good location The family-run Owl is an old favourite of ours and it did not disappoint. We stayed for 4 nights (third year in a row) in a large family room. Twin beds for adults and bunk beds for children. The staff are always friendly and helpful. Small lounge\/bar and breakfast areas are very good. Buffet breakfast is always well-stocked and frequently replenished. Could do with a bit more variety (fresh fruit and yoghurts perhaps) but was good enough for the price.The room was fine. Bathroom a bit small and my sense of smell detected that a smoker had been in the room recently. However, this is the Netherlands and in smaller hotels exclusive non-smoking rooms have not necessarily caught on. Furnishings are ok but perhaps getting a bit dated.The hotel is in a quiet side street (there are a number of hotels in this road - more spring up each year) and it is a matter of a few minutes walk from the Leidseplein, park and museums. The tram for the station is also very close. For my young family it is far away from the bawdy side of life that tends to blight certain areas of the lovely city, especially near the station and with the proximity of the restaurants and facilties at Leideseplein the location takes some beating. The Owl has character and is worth considering for a short family break.This is not a budget hotel but we found the facilities and location to be very good value at the price. ","annotations":[]}
