{"text":"Below Average Paradisus What a rip off. I took my daughter here to check it out, because I am a travel agent. The staff knew this upon my arrival, so they immediately upgraded us to Royal Service. I can't imagine what our stay would have been like if we didn't have this service. The greatest benefit is that you get to use the private pool area with the beautiful palapas. That is, if you are lucky enough to get one or grease the pool attendant early enough in the morning. The other benefit is the rooms are larger and most have a view of the water. Ours didn't.Our room had the most disgusting smell - reminiscent of a barn. The beds were hard and uncomfortable. Look out for the bugs. We were on the first floor, and I could hear feet pounding above us in the late evening and early morning. Nothing bothers me more.The food was mediocre, at best. Everything is the same, day in and day out. We made reservations for the a la carte restaurants, which, after the rigamarole of trying to get a reservation, should have been fabulous. In actuality, the food was the same as it was in the regular dining areas - only the linens were different. We walked out of the Japanese restaurant, because no one came over to serve us, after waiting for 25 minutes.We avoided the general pool area, because hearing the noise from a half mile away was enough to tell me I didn't need to partake in the activities. It was full of loud, drunk, obnoxiouos people who have no regard for personal space.If your travel agent steers you in this direction, run, don't walk. There are many, many wonderful places and resorts on this magnificent island. After 72 hours, we left for the comfort of El Conquistador, and all was well.
