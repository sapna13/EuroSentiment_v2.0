{"text":"Perfection!! We just returned from a week at The Ritz Carlton in San Juan. Let me tell you what a beautifully maintained property it is. We were amazed at how clean everything is and how many people are working constantly around you!!!We took our two children, aged 6 and 9. They loved the Ritz Kids Club. It is pricey, but they went two afternoons and one evening. They went to the pool, went to the beach, played games, did arts and crafts... They loved the staff and had to be pulled away each time. We had a pool view room on the club level. What an amazing view. We were upgraded from city view (which is actually airport view) I called the hotel three days before check in and had a nice friendly conversation with a front desk clerk and requested it. Upon arrival, they told us that we would receive the upgrade, but that the room would not be ready as they could not evict the previous occupants!!! They were very gracious and gave us an interim room on the club level and paid for our lunch at the poolside restaurant. When our room was ready, they called us and gave us our keys and we were set. Great service!!!!The room had luxurious bath towels, and Bulgari shampoos and a soft bathrobe.The club level was well worth it. We ate breakfast and lunch there everyday. We only ate dinner out and saved tons of money!!! The breakfasts had juices, fresh fruit, danishes, toast, bagels, hard boiled eggs, meats and cereals. Plenty!!!! The lunches were soups, salads and different sandwhiches. They had huge freshly baked cookies that we ate daily! After dinner we would go to the club for coffee and desert. The club staff looked after us so well and went out of their way to help us with everything.We went to see the Caribe Hilton, the Marriott and the InterContinental. None of the grounds or beaches compared to the Ritz. The lobbies were also not as luxurious as the Ritz'.The service at the hotel was impeccable. We met the friendliest and kindest staff that went out of their way everyday to say hello to us and help make our stay pleasant.We loved the frest fruit and complimentary bottled water by the beach and pool. We had a wonderful time and are counting the days till we can go back!!!
