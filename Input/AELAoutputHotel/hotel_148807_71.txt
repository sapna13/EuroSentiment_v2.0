{"text":"Beautiful Resort but Scuba Diving Not Available - DIVERS READ! We just returned from a nice visit to the Copamarina last week. The grounds are beautiful, room was nice, and overall we had a good time. The main issue we had was that scuba diving was not available all week. When we checked in on Tuesday we were told that there would not be any diving available until Saturday, the day we were flying back to the US. The hotel employee was very nice and said that May is a slow month so the scuba employees decided to take a job all week repairing a reef that had been badly damaged. She said that we could go diving through a different dive shop that is 30 minutes away. She did not say anything good about the shop, but simply said they do diving. We would have to drive there or they could call us a cab. My husband and I do not dive very often so we always research dive shops before we go diving with them. We had already researched the Copamarina and felt very confident that this is a solid dive shop with a good reputation, however we did not know anything about the dive shop that is 30 minutes away. We did not bring our laptop and the Copamarnia does not have any available computers, so we did not have a way to do any online research. Therefore we decided not to go diving. I guess we could have driven the 30 minutes and tried to find out more about the dive shop, but we had been stuck in horrible traffic in San Juan for 3 hours and simply did not want to get back in the car. We came there expecting to dive onsite, not have to drive 30 minutes to a dive shop that may or may not be reputable. If you are not a diver, I would recommend you stay at the Copamarina because it is very nice and peaceful. We did not do the all inclusive meal plan, but I might consider it if we go back because there are not too many places nearby to eat. I thought the food was good and we enjoyed the open air cafe and the music at night. The only other issue we had is that you can hear everything in the room next door through the connecting locked door. The first night we woke up at midnight because the people were talking and when they sneezed at 6:00 am it was so loud I thought someone was in our room. I complained and was moved to a room that had a vacant room next door. However, during high season this might not be possible. The doors are very thin and need some insulation. I guess the bottom line is that if you are a diver and plan to dive, I would not stay there. Our experience is not isolated if you read the other reviews it happened to another reviewer in March of this year. However, if you are simply wanting a nice vacation in relaxing area then the Copamarina is a good choice. Feel free to email me with questions.
