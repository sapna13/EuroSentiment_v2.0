{"text":"this is a winner Has a brandnew feel to it. Nicely sized rooms with extremely clean modern marble bathrooms. Wellness center, business center and a good breakfast room. I didn't have breakfast but other guests said it was very good. The hotel has a positive vibe and makes you feel right at home. I have stayed at other places in Barcelona and this was the cleanest and most welcoming. Staff at reception is extremely helpful. They made loads of reservations at restaurants for us, recommended great places and had an answer to every question. They truly made an effort to please. I have stayed in many 5 star first class hotels around the world and even though I dreaded and expected this to be basic, I couldn't find fault with anything here. It isn't the Park Hyatt or the Mandarin Oriental but on a budget is truly the next best thing to it.Everything is brand-new, fast, roomy elevators and good marble staircases in well lighted hallways. The Metro is 200 metres away and the Ramblas in short walking distance. There are cafes and a Kentucky Fried Chicken on the very same street, but why bother when the city is full of delicious Tapas restaurants.All in all Barcelona is choc-full of unfriendly taxi drivers and shop staff who'd rather chew nails than serve you, but the Apsis Milleni was a wonderful place to come home to. It might not be a design hotel and the furniture and carpets in the rooms were a bit dark, but everything else was light, clean and modern. I have paid far more money for other hotels in Barcelona that were nowhere near the standard of the Apsis. Unless I will treat myself to a Design temple next time I will be returning to the Apsis Milleni again and will recommend it to anyone going to Barcelona. It is great value for money and everything looked exactly as it did in the pics. This is a good choice for any trip, may it be business or pleasure.
