{"text":"Amazing Holiday Me and my Friend stayed in this hotel from 1st May - 15th May and had an AMAZING time!We are two 18 year old girls from Birmingham\/England and had the best time ever!!!We didn't no what to expect at all but it was much better that what we imagined.When we landed we had an hour journey to the hotel which was a bumpy ride but i was too busy looking out of the window at the locals to let it bother me. When we arrived at the hotel we checked in very quickly with no hassle (apart from getting chatted up by the receptionists) but trust me we got used to that.Our room was really nice and was cleaned every day.We went to a couple of the restaurants but mainly eat in the buffet which offers a veriety of food each day. I had one day where i had a bit of an upset stomach but i think everybody gets that, i didnt let it bother me.The pool was really nice but very hot were as on the beach you get a really nice breeze. the beach is LOVELY we took part in the danicing and sports in the daytime on the beach.We went on the Outback Safari, The shopping trip and the trip to Saona Island they were really good. The outback safari was really good we had so much fun and Saona island was like going to PARADISE!!!We watched the shows every night they were really good and then we went to the Disco. We LOVED the weekends when the Locals came to stay at the hotel....they filled the disco and are GREAT dancers as i found out. Ok they loved me and my friend as we were two young English girls travelling alone but they didnt bother us, we talked to all of them and danced with them and made a few friends who i speak to every day on MSN and will be meeting in October when we return to the Dominican. They liven the place up, they mean no harm.The entertainment staff were really friendly,a nd very popular with some of the young women travelling alone lol we made friends with all of them and they came to the Disco most night's with us.The bar men were really nice to us and had a drink ready as soon as they saw us walking towards the bar.We met some lovely people......Dean and Julie, Dave and Dot and Cliff and dianne who we are going to stay with this weekend!!!We never felt like it was just the two of us on holiday because we were always wih different people.In October we are going to stay in the Occidental Grand Flamenco....for the simple reason that they have the club called Mangu on site. but i think we are going to spend the whole two weeks comparing the holiday to the Sireins hotel because it was such a nice hotel.Anyway i would recommend this hotel to anybody of all ages, it has something for everyone. I will deifintaely be returning int he future.
