{"text":"Fantastic Grand Mirage We have just returned from the Grand Mirage Resort in Bali having stayed there 14 nights after a week in Singapore and Bangkok. It is fair to say that from the very moment we arrived at the hotel the experience of first class service and attention to detail became evident.We stayed in an ocean view deluxe room on an all-inclusive package. The room was very well maintained spotlessly clean and very well furbished. Going out on to the balcony to have the most beautiful and, dare I say it, romantic panoramic view of the ocean. The all-inclusive part of the bargain was faultless, the mini-bar, room service and all restaurants and cafes on-site were refreshingly included. The food production and service was maintained at a very high standard from the afternoon tea to the huite cuisine Italian restaurant.The entertainment was very much Bali culture to modern music and was well structured and managed. The hotel also provided tokens for water sports, both motorised and non-motorised, and the expertly conducted beach massages.The beach was spotlessly clean and was covered by waiting staff taking drink orders. All the towels and sun beds were also provided free of charge.The Thalassic Spa that also sits within the hotel grounds is another sublime facility. The treatments are carried with totally professional expertise in an environment that epitomises relaxation. The hotel also provided a very generous voucher for the all-inclusive guests to partake in this wonderful and relaxing experience.It was the silver wedding anniversary for my wife and I and the hotel staff went out of their way to make things special for us including a beach dinner, a cake and flowers. The holiday of a lifetime was made√à√\u2020\u2022√ì√µ√™ust simply that.
