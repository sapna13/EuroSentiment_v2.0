{"text":"Excellent value, fantastic service Fantastic amenities and service at this place - easy access to the computers in the business lounge, we used the bar a few times and the service was great, the front desk staff were super helpful and helped out with maps and suggestions. The lobby is great for meeting people - a well-serviced bar and comfortable seats to wait for a friend.The rooms were excellent - very clean and comfortable - included a safe and robes, and even slippers, and the bathroom was nice and big and clean with plenty of space for a couple trying to get ready at the same time for a day's walking or a night out on the town! It was more luxurious than we expected and worth every penny.I left an item of clothing by accident in the room and didn't notice for a few days after I got home. I emailed the hotel, worried that i had seen the last of my favourite (and not cheap) piece of clothing and they followed up promptly, without drama, and they sent it to me safe and sound without issue, even though I was in a different country by then.They went the extra mile when they didn't have to and it pretty much summed up our experience when we stayed there. We found it easy to get around even though the hotel is not super central - the underground is only a few moments walk from the hotel and we used it every day to get to the sites we were visiting. So in effect, the location was really convenient as we would've had to pay a lot more for this standard of hotel if we wanted to stay in the centre of Barcelona. This was a real treat for tired travellers and well worth the stay.There's a great little tapas place not far from the hotel - gorgeous food but we recommend booking ahead if you want a table guaranteed. It's across from one of the train\/undergound exits and had a few outdoor tables and small plants outside.. can't remember the name though unfortunately!
