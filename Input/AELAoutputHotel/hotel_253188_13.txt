{"text":"Never again! We stayed here for two nights during a layover in Amsterdam. I have travelled a fair amount and have stayed at a range of hotels from luxury properties to hostels in my younger years. Never have I stayed in a hotel as filthy as the Rembrandtplein. Granted, the location is extremely convenient to all the sites of Amsterdam and is situated in a pretty canal with beautiful church bells ringing in the distance. However, I would never stay here again and strongly recommend others to stay away as well.We were travelling as a group of four and had originally requested two twin rooms. Upon arrival, we were given room 7 and our companions a room on the 3rd floor. Immediately upon leaving the reception it was clear that this hotel is in dire need of refurbishment. The condition of this hotel cannot be described as charming outside of it's architectural gems such as the breakfast room ceiling and steep staircase. Our friends requested another room immediately and after a second request were given room 18 which was larger and appeared to be somewhat cleaner than their original room.Our room looked over an internal courtyard - more like an air shaft. The ground was littered with various garbage including cigarette butts and unused tiles. Upon entering the room we were immediately shocked by the obvious filth in which we were staying. The bedspreads were stained and had cigarette burns, the carpet was equally stained and the ceiling was grey with dirt. Perhaps it was a blessing that half of the lighting was inoperable as it would have certainly revealed more of the room's dirt. The bathroom was even worse, the tub surround and ceiling covered in black mould. The tub itself was relatively clean but the ledge had obviously not been cleaned for some time. We finally took a shower our last day before departing for home and made the mistake of using the shower curtain to prevent water from splashing onto the small floor. Once the hot water and steam from the shower came into contact with the curtain I nearly gagged from the stench that arose. It was a mixture of urine and such dirt that the smell permeated the entire bathroom and even our room.The neighbouring room was occupied by a number of males and the marijuana smoke was so thick in the hallway it entered our room as well. The only thing that appeared to be clean were the sheets - we did not unpack and tried not to touch any of the other surfaces at all. Reception indicated that they clean daily and thoroughly but this is not the case at all - the lamp bases were obviously filthy and the wardrobe dusty as well. Breakfast was average at best. Orange juice, coffee and tea were accompanied by scrambled eggs (ok) and the saltiest most fat riddled bacon I have ever eaten. There was ham and cheese however, the cheese slices were obviously dried out indicating they were sitting there for a long time. Reception was friendly enough however, we asked for wake up calls both mornings and never received them. We ordered a taxi for the morning of departure and it was not ordered until we reminded them again and a call was made.This hotel was definitely not worth the 75 Euro we paid per night. Due to the fact that we were staying only two nights we did not want the hassle of finding other accommodation but I would never stay again - not even for one night. Stay far far away from this hotel - it is not worth your money!!!!
