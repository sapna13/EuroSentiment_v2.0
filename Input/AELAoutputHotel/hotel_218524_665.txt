{"text":"Our Best All Inclusive Vacation Ever My wife and I, along with another couple, just returned from a nine day stay at Excellence. This was our fifth stay at Excellence and by far, the best. We have stayed at other all inclusives in Jamaica and elsewhere so this is not a one dimensional review. No resort is one hundred percent perfect, but we feel Excellence is as close to perfection as you will find. The staff is no less than wonderful. They are gracious, friendly, polite and fun to interact with. Some speak english better than others, but we never had a problem communicating with anyone.  The rooms were clean, comfortable, roomy and the mini bars were full of beer every day. I should mention water and juice as well. The food in all the restaurants was very good. There is a variety of restaurants and menus. You will not go hungry or thirsty. The only mixup we had was one person in our party received a Chicken Burger instead of a Cheeseburger. She was going to send it back until she tasted it. It was so delicious so she kept it. The entertainment has improved over the past six years and the shows are enjoyable to watch. The pre and post show entertainment is very good as well. Domingo on the Sax along with his keyboard partner are great. Dave The Jamaica Man is awesome as well. (There are some mosquitos at night they don't bother me but you may want to bring some bug wipes) Some of the best entertainment comes from the service employees. Get to know them. They are really fun to be with. There are so many I can't mention them all. But, I have to mention a few: Amado at the Martini Bar, Dionel and Rafelinaay and the rest of the crew at The Swimup Bar, Altagracia on the beach, Confessor in the Grill Restaurant, Kelly who serviced our minibar and so many more. Our trip wouldn't have been so wonderful without the gracious hospitality of Junior Rodriguez (Reservations Manager), Victor Doreteo (Restaurant Manager) and of course, Robert Puello (Excellence Club Manager). We can't wait to return again next January.Eugene  Marcia Mattioli Dave MushyMassachusetts ","annotations":[{"endOffset":928,"mention":"Burger","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":922},{"endOffset":954,"mention":"Cheeseburger","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cheeseburger"],"startOffset":942},{"endOffset":1984,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":1980}]}
