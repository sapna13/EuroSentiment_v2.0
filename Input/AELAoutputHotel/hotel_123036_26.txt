{"text":"Our new favorite hotel in Seattle. Our ultimate accolade? Had our flight been canceled we would have LOVED staying another night. Or two. Or three. As it was, we stayed 5 nights and felt right at home. It was a crowded week in Seattle so we couldn't get a suite, but the King room was ample, with desk, easy chair  ottoman, and the most comfortable bed in the world. This is not an exaggeration. It is the most comfortable bed in the world. Bar none, even ours at home. The bathroom has double sinks, fast flushing toilet, and good shower. With the incredible QFC market across the street, and a good breakfast free every morning, our lives were made easier.Also, cable internet in the room so the wifi difficulties we encounter everywhere did not exist. Downstairs are 2 computers with CD readers and printers - free and usually available. LOCATION: Two blocks from the Space Needle and Monorail. Going into town? Take the monorail: $4 R\/T for adults, $2 R\/t seniors and you're on Pine Street in 5 minutes. Within a few feet of Macys - a block from Nordstroms - 3 or so blocks from Pike Market. Flying in? Save yourself wear and tear. Don't rent a car at the airport - it takes forever and costs a bundle. Take the shuttle or, best, a towncar* $35 each way total - and worth every cent - to the Inn, rent a car from Budget on 7th Ave - they'll pick you up at the Inn. Cheap. Easy.Inn Parking is $10+\/- a night and the stalls are very small. Our Impala was a very tight fit - and some crazies park pick-ups and SUVs in the underground. Think small car. *We were recommended to use 'Dale' [--]. He was great and I'm saving his card for our February trip. ","annotations":[]}
