{"text":"Loved it! I loved it! At first I was skeptical because I felt like the pictures were overated and was torn about where to stay. But I will say that I had no regrets. If you have a really contemporary, chic, and down to earth personality, then this was the spot for you. I am very picky and I will say that I felt accommodated. The only things I did not like was the management and the location  They seem very tight on giving you anything extra as far as special accommodations. For instance, we had a late flight and we did not realize that check out was at 12:00 so we wanted them to accommodate us with a room for a few hours and they wanted to charge us over $230 for the one night. But on the flip side they did upgrade the room when we first check in because they did not have our room ready to full oceanview. I also heard someone complain about that he always stays here when he comes to Puerto Rico and this was the first time he did get any special treatment. So I think that management was very stern this go around. Plus housekeeping threw out our bottle of rum and management came upstairs to verify how much liquor was left in the bottle before they gave up 6 coupons for free drinks.  It was located away from the other hotels so alot of the buildings around it was run down. Since it was not near the other resort hotels you had to walk about 15-20 minutes to participate in any of the water sports.  But again I liked the hotel itself. So sometimes you have to choose your battles. This hotel is definitely for people who can appreciate that Miami flavor and I would not recommend this place to someone under the age of 13 and not to someone who is over 50 unless you are young at heart and very down to earth. So I hope all this helps! ","annotations":[]}
