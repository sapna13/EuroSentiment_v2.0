{"text":"Number One in Amsterdam Right, where do I start√à√\u2020\u2022√î??\u201A√á¬®?br\/>We booked this hotel purely on the reviews on this site and not let down at all. We spent ages looking at all sorts but this was spot on. Before we left Osam (Manager) E-mailed me with the directions to the hotel from the airport and he was spot on. Once at Central take Tram 15 or 13, 3rd stop and it stops right outside the hotel. Once there we rang the buzzer and the door opened we saw √à√\u2020\u2022?the famous stairs√à√\u2020\u2022?which aren√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ that bad in all honesty. Our bags where taken to our room and we had a drink on the house :-) and given maps of the City. ( we found very useful )Our room was excellent and we had everything we could ask for. The room was spacious, clean and the bed was very comfortable. We had a balcony, which I highly recommend and a walk in closet. The bathroom is a nice size and the shower is very powerful.We had the option of breakfast but only had this once as they stop at 11.00 (After a heavy night, the last thing you want is breakfast so we wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother that much.) The staff are very friendly and there 24 hours a day, which is reassuring. We had a bit of a mad moment with Space Cakes and Osam helped us out and I am VERY Grateful.Overall out Trip was very good but the whole Nadia Hotel Experience made it even better. We can only say positive comments about this hotel and you will NOT be disappointed.I would just like to thank Team Nadia and say a massive Thank You.
