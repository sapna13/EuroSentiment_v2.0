{"text":"Sleek business hotel with good weekend rates My husband and I stayed for 2 nights at the London Bridge Hotel in mid-October, in an executive king room. We chose it due to its location (in Southwark, near the Borough Market, Southwark Cathedral, Shakespeare's Globe, etc), and the positive review in the Rough Guide to London.The hotel is furnished in a very sleek modern style, but comfortable nonetheless. It is very business oriented, but has lower rates on the weekends. We did not eat in any of the hotel restaurants, preferring to go to the Borough market instead (see following paragraph for more info). The room was very clean and had a full range of amenities one would expect of a 4 star hotel. The service staff were pleasant. The rooms are well insulated from outside noise, but the room became stuffy quite quickly if the air conditioning was not on all the time. Opening the window helped a lot, but a lot of traffic and fan noise came in too. One downside: the hotel charges a hefty daily fee (10 pounds per 24 hours) for access to the wireless network - a 4 star hotel should be providing this free. A big bonus is the hotel's location: it is only a 5 minute walk from the Borough Market, which is open on Friday afternoons and all day Saturdays. I would highly, highly recommend the market for anyone who appreciates artisan baking, free range and organic meats, cheeses, organic vegetables, and market atmosphere. The area around the market is also lively on weekends with numerous pubs, cafe's and restaurants, all within easy walking distance. As well, the major tube and train station of London Bridge is right next to the hotel, providing easy access to all parts of London.I would stay at the hotel again, but definitely only at the weekends, to take advantage of the better rates.
