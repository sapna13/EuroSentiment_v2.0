{"text":"Nice business hotel in the heart of Times Sqaure You wouldn't even know that there was a Hilton in Times Square unless someone pointed it out to you. It is very nondescript from the outside. When you walk into the front door, you are only on an elevator level (not the lobby level) so it doesn't look like anything except a bank of elevators. When you take the elevator up to the lobby there is a nice bar, restaurant, seating area and the reception desk. When you go up to your room you take another bank of elevators. Sometimes during rush hour there can be a bottleneck with the elevators since everyone has to go from one bank to the other to get in and out of the hotel, so you kind of have to plan ahead if you have theater tickets! The room is nice size for NY standards, quite spacious and well appointed. The hotel is fairly new so the rooms are modern and up to date (no ugly floral bedspreads that would give you the creeps). The beds are super comfortable Hilton signature beds. We had a nice city view looking out onto 42nd Street from the 26th floor. I imagine that the low stories do not have much of a view so try to request a high floor. If you want to avoid the hussle and bustle of 42nd Street every time you come and go, just enter through the other side (41st street) which is quiet and uncrowded. We walked out onto the 42nd street side one time and that was the last time we did it. It's just a mob scene, but the good news is you can avoid it completely. If you are going you are going to NY to go to Broadway shows and to be in the middle of the action, you will love this location. If you want a quieter, more residential scene, then this is not going to suit you. If you stay here, just accept crowds and traffic as part of the scene.
