{"text":"Book a club room!!! Fab fab fab hotel - great location, service and facilities. Can't fault it at all.We stayed here for 3 nights en route back to London from Australia during our honeymoon. As it was our honeymoon we booked into a club room which was well worth it as we got delicious complimentary breakfast in the plaza club lounge each day and fab 'free' cocktails, proper French champagne and canapes each night from 5pm to 8pm. A further nice touch was that we were offered to use the lounge for cocktails etc in the evening even after we'd checked out. Check out time is 1pm standard which is better than the usual 11am or 12 noon.We were put in a corner room on the 25th floor which was amazing as we had dual aspect double balconies, a large lounge area, large bed, desk area etc, and the usual robes, slippers etc. Also we had champers, chocs, fruit and flowers - don't know whether this was standard or because we were honeymooners.The facilities at this hotel are fantastic and the service top notch. I would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it to anyone . It is quite a 'businessy' hotel but although we were on our honeymoon we still thought it was fab and much better than some of the more traditional 5 star honeymoon hotels we'd stopped at in Oz. The inc bar on the ground floor is fab, and the hotel is connected to the Swissotel Stamford the Plaza via the Raffles City shopping mall, which is good to go to for dinner or drinks from the 72nd floor - apparently the tallest hotel in Asia. The location was fab, v central, opposite the old Raffles hotel. Taxis and the fab MRT are very cheap in Sing though so everything is at your doorstep when you need it. I'd recommend the Night Safari and a trip to Sentosa to go to Underwater World which was great. Also Clarke Quay is great for bars and restaurants, try Clinic, and have a go at the reverse bungy if you're an adrenaline seeker...
