{"text":"great hotel... but... We booked this hotel based on the review we read. Everything seemed perfect...The resort is quite beautiful. Nice hotel, beautiful rooms, great swimming pool, nice choice of bars and restaurants.First impression was good, but...The hotel is located on a part of the island that is very windy and not calm water. We were expecting a very clear and calm ocean but we arrived and it was red flag on the beach. The beach is very clean with white sand but the ocean is so agitated that we could not swim. We are not scared of water and waves but we heard from a guest that a tourist had died the week before because of the strong waves. Very few people were going in the water after that.Even though the rooms seemed cleaned, the cleaning was done really fast (as in many other hotels). There were opened bottles of water in the fridge when we arrived.So... this is a great resort if you do not particularly enjoy swimming in the ocean and you prefer the swimming pool. there were several a la carte restaurants but the French Restaurant (Chez Isabelle) was closed for renovation. January is the peak season in Dominican Republic and they managed to close the most popular restaurant!the food was very good (especially in the Spice restaurant - asian cuisine)Overall, the resort is beautifull, the food is good and the service is good too. although, do not go there if you really like swimming in the ocean (at least not in the winter). I recommend this hotel for couples without kids who want to get some sun and warm weather and stay by the pool or go on the beach without swimming in the ocean.
