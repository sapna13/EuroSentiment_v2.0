{"text":"Not Bad - could have been better I stayed at the Barcelona Princess Hotel on business in mid-October and here are my comments.On arrival it looks an impressive building, out in suburbs with quite a lot of building work going on around the hotel.We had a delayed check in by an hour or so, (system failure) conceirge offered free drinks which was a nice touch. Finally got to room and air-con was broke, took 2 hours to fix. Free Mini bar not replaced every day. Being a smoker in a smoking room you expect an ashtray, NO! Asked at reception and was told to use a drinking glass instead as they don't have them!!!!Room was clean enough with a great view of the city. Watch out for the shower, it leaked under the seal and flooded the bathroom!! Uber modern, or trying to be so not the most functional room you'll ever stay in.The lifts were a nightmare, only 3 and with the hotel being full it took upwards of 5 minutes waiting going up or down at times....badly designed! Only ate breakfast once and once was enough, good selection but the food was lukewarm at best and expensive.Staff in general were efficient if not that friendly except the two guys working in the foyer bar. Both were more than helpful and very friendly, they make some excellent cocktails as well :)Ideal location for business trip, convention centre across the way and superb shopping centre Diagonal Mar right next door. Good tapas to be had here! About 20 mins from Las Ramblas etc, centre of town. Tram was confusing at first but got the hang of it, trams stops right outside the hotel. Metro at Glorias stop takes you all over the city but be prepared with your map and expect a few line changes.Too conclude our stay we took the tourist bus around the city, excellent value and an ideal way to spend your day. Nou Camp was fantastic as was Port Olympic, good food and night life.Good hotel but as I say, it could and should have been better for a superior 4 star (as advertised). Probably won't stay again but it served the purpose well enough.Finally, watch your wallet as two guys had theirs pick-pocketed within yards of the hotel!!!
