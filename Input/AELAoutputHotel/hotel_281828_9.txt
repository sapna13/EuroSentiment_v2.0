{"text":"Nice to see how the other half lives :-) We are not Fairmont sort of people - we tend to fit in at the Comfort Inn  Suites - however we did decide to splurge for our last two nights in Seattle and stay at the Fairmont Olympic - and it was really lovely. The valet parking was efficient and friendly - those guys outside are the hotel's best ambassadors! The check in was efficient - and although the elevators are quite small as another person mentioned, they were really, really fast so our waits were not so bad.We had 3 meals in the Georgian - 2 breakfasts and 1 dinner.For breakfast - we would recommend the Banana  Strawberry French Toast - forget about the calories and order it - its an amazing dish. The dinner we had was probably the most elegant of any we have had - ever -- and we can't say how it would compare to other spendy restaurants, but we did enjoy it - and were made to feel very comfortable in their dining room.We had a suite on the 7th floor - no view, but when you look out the window you see hundreds of other rooms without a view, so you are not alone. The room was nicely decorated, spacey - especially the bathroom - and truly comfortable.Thanks to this hotel for having CBC available on their TV - we got to stay in touch with the Olympics while there, and didn't miss anything! The pool and fitness area is divine - and if we return, we will spend far more time there. We found Seattle to be a great shopping city - and within walking distance are some great shops - Coach, Nordstroms etc. We left our mark there too :-)My only niggle was room service - it wasn't so good. I ordered fish  chips and expected it to be the best fish  chips ever. It wasn't. It tasted like any old room service dish from any old Sheraton or Holiday Inn - and cost twice as much. For us, this was a treat - now we go back to our middle class lives and enjoy our memories. We'd love to do this again - and maybe we will someday!
