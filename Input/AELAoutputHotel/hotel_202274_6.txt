{"text":"Good and convenient Stayed one night at the Sheraton since I had an early flight from Frankfurt airport (Terminal 1).Check-in was not utterly efficient, even in the SPG queue - however I was awarded an upgrade (as SPG Gold) even though this was an Expedia booking (many Starwood hotels do not upgrade you in that case, so this is a good point for this hotel)Upon arrival, there was a room service used plate next to my door (not the nieghbouring one), which for one second led me to think that I had been allocated an already occupied room.The room was spacious and well equipped with a good working area and comfortable bathroom. A bit soulless like often for airport hotels (the Sheraton Towers at Heathrow being only slightly better), but neither tired nor gloomy.Strangely I was unable to find the Hotel telephone number anywhere (I needed to be called back from a landline) so eventually my contact had to look for it on the Hotel website (a bit of a joke really).It took me some time to get an answer from room service but once I ordered the food was delivered on time. I was very pleansanty suprised by the quality of the food: one of the dishes was definitely restaurant quality (and I am not an easy guest). This I had very rarely seen\/tasted, especially at airport hotels.Well above average.Check out was very efficient (well what would you expect at 5:40 am) but front desk staff were very helpful in helping me with how to navigate corridors leading to Terminal 1 - for this the hotel is extraordinarily convenient.Overall, very satisfied - would have been a 5 without the minor glitches I mentioned.
