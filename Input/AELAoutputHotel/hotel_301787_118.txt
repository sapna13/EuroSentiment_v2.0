{"text":"An Amazing Escape Everything about this hotel was wonderful. I cannot possibly understand the complaints of other reviewers. The sound of a gong announced our arrival at the hotel and three gentlemen began to play traditional Indonesian music as we walked in between two rows of beautiful Balinese dancers on our way into the lobby. Once in the lobby, we were greeted by a friendly clerk who instantly brought us over to a couch where we were given chilled scented towels and a delicious flavored iced tea to refresh us from our journey to the resort. My girlfriend and I were quite impressed by this entrance!We had a Deluxe Studio Room which was very large and equipped with a plush couch and a large plasma screen TV. The bathroom was done in marble and has a large two person soaking tub with complimentary bath salts that any couple will enjoy after a late night. All of the rooms are also served by butlers, which was a nice treat. Upon arrival your butler will press three items of clothing for free and delivered to us a complimentary platter of delicious tropical fruit. In addition, the butlers will deliver to your room complimentary tea or coffee served on a silver tray anytime day or night. We frequently took advantage of this and enjoyed tea on our adequately sized balcony that looked over the lagoons that snake throughout the property. (Be sure to book a room that overlooks the beautiful lagoons). The rooms are situated across 4 floors. Rooms on the first floor that face the lagoon have direct access from the room deck into the lagoon. While this is a nice little treat, these rooms cost a bit more and do not seem to justify the increased cost.We took breakfast at the resort's buffet restaurant Cafe Lagoon. The breakfast buffet was very large and rather impressive, try to get breakfast included in your room rate. It had traditional American, English, and European items such as omlets, pancakes, rashers of bacon, grilled tomatoes, and a wide assortment of fresh baked breads, meats, fresh fruits, and cheeses. In addition, the buffet had traditional Indonesian and Japanese selections. The beach that the resort sits on is nice, clean, and the water is a clear green-blue color. Having visited many other beaches in Bali, it appeared to be just as nice as others. Throughout the grounds are extremely comfortable bales with day beds on them where we enjoyed having lunch delivered to each day. The Atisaya spa was great and I would recommend booking treatments with your special someone in the couples spa suite.On our last night at the resort we arranged for a private candlelight dinner in a secluded part of the resort that was absolutely beautiful and definitely won me some points with my girlfriend. I would recommend doing the same if you can, it was a nice treat.I would guess that the resort was maybe half to two-thirds full when we were there. Unlike other reviewers, I cannot see how that is a bad thing. Sure the restaurants were never even half full but that fact always almosted guaranteed you prime tables at restaurants and additional privacy throughout the resort.All in all this resort is a beautiful and peaceful sanctuary. We found the service to be friendly, prompt, and fantastic as our butlers and waiters remembered our names and preferences even after the first day. This place was absolutely perfect for a peaceful and luxurious tropical getaway. We cannot wait to go back.
