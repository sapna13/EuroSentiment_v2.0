{"text":"A Little Gem In A Perfect Location Myself, my wife, and our two good friends stayed here for two nights at the end of January. We booked the hotel via Hotels . com with help from Trip Advisor based on previous reviews.Most hotels are quite pricey in the centre of Paris, however this one is definitely value for money. Only a 15 euro, 15 minute, cab journey from the Gare Du Nord, it is also easily reachable from the nearest metro stop apprx 200 yards away. In advance of our stay, I emailed the hotel to check a few things, and like some of the other reviewers, found Yohan to be extremely helpful and very prompt in his replies. It is the little touches like this that make all the difference. The hotel, although quite small, was immaculate, and the rooms were spotless. All the staff were friendly and were always there to assist if needs be. The location was even better than we were led to believe, with the Arc De Triomphe on the doorstep along with all manner of shops, bars and restaurants. We also spent a day at Disney, and were very fortunate to also find that the metro stop by the hotel is a direct line to the park (about 40 minutes) but makes it extremely easy to get there and back if you are heading up that way. Paris is a great city to walk round, and the Eiffel Tower is around 35\/40 minutes walk away, and the Louvre around 50 minutes straight down the Champs D'elysees.All in all, we can thoroughly recommended this hotel and would definitely stay there when we next venture into Paris. Although eating and drinking is often very expensive in the city, the Eurostar return trip via Ebbsfleet only cost √ä√£¬¢59 per couple with a promotion, so there is really no excuse not to explore this great place!
