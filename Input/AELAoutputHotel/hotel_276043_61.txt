{"text":"Loved this hotel - hope to go back one day We stayed at the Berlin Marriott from July 3-9 on vacation and had a wonderful stay. The hotel is very modern, rooms are average for Europe and the bathroom was about the same size. We had a nice view of the city. We decided after reading some other reviews to stay on the Executive (Concierge) Level and it was well worth the extra money. The breakfast each morning in the Executive Level Lounge was good, with two hot entrees, breads, cereals, yogurt, coffee, juices and tea. The Lounge was open all day and it entitled you to complementary snacks and drinks all day as well as free use of the three computers in the business area. It was wonderful to be able to email the family at home and tell them that we had arrived instead of having to call home! Every evening there was a cocktail hour from 5:30 to 7:30 again with two hot appetizers and numerous other small dishes along with complementary, beer, wine and alcohol. From 7:30 to 9:30 they served desserts and we enjoyed those tremendously each night. Some people made a meal out of the appetizers and desserts. Dinner at the Midtown Grill (hotel restaurant) was excellent! Steak cooked to perfection, chicken breast perfectly done, just can not say enough nice things about the Grill. The whole staff was very cooperative, friendly and eager to help with directions, information or other needs. We highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay there again some day.
