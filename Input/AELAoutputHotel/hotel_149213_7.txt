{"text":"Nice Beach-Service Could Improve This is a beautiful resort and the food is above average for an all inclusive. Our vacation, however, did have some problems. As many other reviewers have said, our reservation was mixed up. Despite calling and verifying the day before we arrived, when we arrived we were told that we were not booked at the Barcelo Bavaro Beach but at another hotel up the road. It was a twenty minute and $22 taxi ride away. That didn't cut it for us since, besides verifying it before we left home, we had all of our excursions set up to pick up at this hotel. Anyway, we ended up getting a room but the front desk was not sympathetic and pretended not to speak english. Another day, I needed assistance in calling one of our tours. Needless to say, the front desk did not help and would not make the call for me. I ended up doing it myself and - luckily - the tour operator had someone that spoke english who answered the phone.I would stay here again but, keep in mind that the service is not as friendly as others I have seen. You should speak Spanish to go here. Many of the wokers did not speak english and I think we would have gotten better service if we spoke their language. I think they avoided talking to us at all. The rooms are clean. They have tile floor and have that carribean smell that most hotels have in the humid carribean. The food was great and the beaches were beautiful.I caution you, though, to schedule your tours in advance as we found it almost impossible to get a tour operator even though they were supposed to be stationed at the hotel. Also, note that the Dominican Republic seems to operate on its own time table. Our taxi - scheduled for 11:00 - showed up at 12:00. Our tour for 6:30 a.m. showed up after 7:00 and our bus to the local zoo for 2:00 showed up at 2:45. As long as you know this going in, it won't stress you out.
