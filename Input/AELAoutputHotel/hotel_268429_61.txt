{"text":"Loved the Coral Princess Date: Oct. 8, 2007Reviewer: E Hawk, South Carolina, USAMy wife and I stayed overnight at the Coral Princess while waiting on a cruise. We wish we could have stayed longer. The hotel is an excellent value, and the staff could not have been more pleasant. The only negative is that the rooms are a bit small. But, they are VERY comfortable, and totally clean. The A\/C worked perfectly, which is an important item judging by reviews of other places. Internet service is available in the room, and the TV, while small, has plenty of channels and great reception. The area offers so much to do, you may not watch much. We didn't.The area is loaded with restaurants. We'd never been to Puerto Rico, and wanted to try local dishes. The staff recommended the Cafe d'Angel (I hope I spelled it right.), which was very close by. It was superb! Try the mifungo. You won't regret it. The hotel also serves a Continental Breakfast which was very good. The Condado Beach is only an easy 2 minute walk. Shopping is nearby, as you are close to a main thoroughfare. We felt comfortable walking in the area, even at night. Everyone we met was friendly and helpful, and no one seemed to mind speaking English. Some reviewers had different opinions on that, and perhaps we were simply more fortunate. I think tho', if you are pleasant to the people there, they will respond the same.As I said, we only stayed overnight, so we can't give a complete description of everything. I do know that if we return to San Juan (which we hope to do), we definitely plan on staying at the Coral Princess again. ","annotations":[]}
