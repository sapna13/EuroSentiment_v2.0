{"text":"mixed feelings I enjoyed my stay however i have mixed feelings about club med. I was already there so the only thing was to make lemonade with the lemons i was dealt. The location can't be beat - it's a 5 minute drive to the airport and cannot hear airplanes passing by. There are plenty of things to do. There's a big spacious pool and a very nice beach. The G.O.'s are friendly - like the cast members at Disney. It's a good place for families and independent children. The areas that have been remodeled are very attractive. However, they have not finished and the rooms have a very potent musty smell. The a\/c in the rooms is kept at a high temperature despite my efforts of keeping the thermostat to 50 degrees, it only reached 75 - and that's after maintenance fixed it!!! The gym also has difficulties with the a\/c - it's also kept at a high temperature. The restaurants one has a\/c (again kept at a warm temperature) and the other does not! After being outside at the beach\/pool all day you want a place to cool off - you will not find it.For example, after two days i was tired of the same buffet offerings despite the fact that they have two restaurants (serve only buffet). The phone line in my room did not work during my 7 day stay! Apparently they had problems with a cell or telephone line... Service is rather inconsistent. When it's good it's great, and when it's not it's terrible. For example, when we arrived we were greeted and a bellboy helped us with our baggage without even asking. However, when we left despite the fact that i was alone with various bags at check-out (and there were plenty of employees who could help) they did not. The employees at the lobby just ignored me completely. Kind of don't let the door hit you on your way out .
