{"text":"bad attitude, wrong information, go somewhere else ! I choose this hotel after reading the review by Lonely Planet's (2006) and this site. The only good thing about this hotel is it's location - smack in the middle of old Florence. We ordered a superior double room with breakfast for three nights. Arriving at the hotel with a car is complicated due to the street layout of old Florence. The GPS was not helpful as where directions from locals. when I called the hotel they where uncooperative on the phone. when we got there we realized we have to take the baggage to the fourth floor of the building in a small, old, smelly elevator. we then received a small, dark, dump room looking at one of the inner courtyards. The bed was two single beds, the bathroom small and smelly and the toilet seat broken. The TV set was the size of my cell phone screen and the cupboards had no shelves. when we asked for another room with double bed and a normal cupboard and bathroom we recieved a hostile response. They told us all the rooms are the same and that they have NO double bed in the establishment and that we should use the extra bed for putting our cloths on. We were shown two other even smaller rooms at same condition so we stayed in ours. The breakfast is a joke - Heated coffee, factory croissants. A shame for an Italian to even look at those. When we contacted our travel agent (who called the owner) we recieved the owner's response - the bathroom is great, they don't like our other rooms, I don't see the problem.The worst thing about Pendini is the attitude we received from the stuff and the owner. I could probably stay in stables if someone smiles at me and try to make me comfortable.For the 120 Euro per night + 25 Euro parking you are better off staying at any other hotel in the area.
