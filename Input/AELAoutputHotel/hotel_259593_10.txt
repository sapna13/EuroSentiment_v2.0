{"text":"Incredible--Magnificent Seven! Hotel ZaZa was awesome! It was our one year anniversary and I didn't have time to take a real vacation, so I thought a stay at a local spot would hopefully be just as romantic. I had booked one of the one bedroom Magnificent Seven rooms, but when I called to see if I could get in at an early check in time, the guy in that suite apparently was refusing to leave. So they offered a complimentary upgrade (mind you, this was still well before the normal check in time) to a two bedroom Mag Seven suite--the Crouching Tiger Suite. It was incredible!! The decor was awesome, I mean, a little over done for a room in a house, but really amazing for a hotel. Full kitchen with appliances. My only complaint was that the coffee pot wasn't clean, there was still a left over substance in the martini mixer, and a martini glass wasn't clean. But I can get over that because I wasn't planning on making a martini or coffee. But there was a dishwasher in there if I wanted to clean it myself. There was also a washer and dryer, which was great for swimsuits after the pool.They even brought us complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries because of the inconvenience. All this after upgrading us! We got in-room massages which were incredible as well. Everyone was very friendly and attentive. Service was always quick and on-time. They really did go above and beyond to make our one year anniversary special. It's something that we will never forget. I highly recommend Hotel ZaZa--especially a Magnificent Seven suite!
