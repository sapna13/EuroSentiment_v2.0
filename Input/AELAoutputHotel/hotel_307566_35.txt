{"text":"Awesome, best resort in South Kuta!!!! My girlfriend and I stayed at the Patra for the first time at the end of October 2006 for 12 nights. After walking through many hotels from Legian down to the Patra, the Patra stood out to us the most. The Patra had the largest grounds, it's huge! The main three pools are awesome and are extremely clean, the service from the staff is great and the pool boys are always happy and friendly and are always willing to go out of their way to help you in any way they possibly can. Our rooms were spacious and very, very clean. The concierge was great they always had our wake up calls perfectly on time and they would give us a call when we had the shuttle bus booked and we were running late so we didn't miss it. They even have buggies to pick you up from your room and drive you around the resort to where ever you want to go, Even when we came back to the resort at 4am after a big night out in kuta they would gladly take us back to our room from the taxi so we didn't have to walk. Thats's service!!Breakfast has eveything you could imagine and more from egg to chicken tandori, we also would get a pizza and drink deal for lunch by the pool which was perfect as we didn't have to leave our deck chairs. The hotel has a shuttle bus 5 times to Kuta a day and to walk into Kuta is 15minutes along the beach which is beautiful at sunset. By the end of our trip we made many friends at the Patra and after 12 night there it still wasn't enough as we didn't want to leave!! I would recomend this resort to anyone and we will be staying there again early 2007.
