{"text":"Too bad service was so bad I liked staying at the Gallery Hotel because it's located in a nice area of Singapore (within walking distance to one of my company's partner's office) and the internet is free. The rooms are almost kind of modern, or at least they probably were when they first opened. But this last stay at the Gallery Hotel really soured my experience and I don't think I'll ever stay there again.When I checked in I didn't get the room type I wanted. I requested a non-smoking queen\/king bed through Agoda and they were out of them when I checked in. I asked them if they could upgrade me to the next sized room with one bed, and they said they'd check. But when they found out that I had booked my room through an online service they said sorry, no. They did offer to upgrade me with $60++ SGD more per night which I declined. I really didn't know that booking through an online service would mean that would be less motivated to keep a loyal customer happy.Anyway, the stay was fairly uneventful until I got stuck in one of the elevators. The elevator had not worked for over an hour (it wouldn't open on the 5th floor) but there was no sign for it warning guests. When I took the elevator up it got stuck and I had to call for help. They admitted that it wasn't working but only for the 5th floor. So they asked me to go up to the 6th floor and then walk down the stairs. I was really shocked that they would keep an elevator operating knowing that it wasn't working and with no warning to guests. In fact, the engineers didn't even tell the manager (he didn't know) until I made a fuss.I think sometimes you get a sign to not stay somewhere anymore, and the elevator incident was my sign. I hope that the management at the Gallery changes because it's too good of a hotel to be performing so poorly. It's really too bad because the housekeeping staff is excellent and very helpful, but they have these kinks that shows inflexibility and lack of concern for guest welfare, which so damages the hotel.
