{"text":"Love the Royal Magda Hotel! Just returned from a month in Paris and Italy and I must say that the Royal Magda was a highlight of my travels! I was with a large group of people that are all different ages and have different preferences and everyone loved the time we spent at this hotel!First, the hotel is in a great location about 1.5 blocks from the Arc di Triomphe and the Champs Elysees. It is easy to walk everywhere, get to a major metro line, and never once felt unsafe (even at 3am). The hotel itself is new and clean with a great sitting area by the bar to hang out and have a glass of wine with friends. There are 5 or 6 floors with a lift that was of typical size for European hotels. We were able to fit 2 people, 2 bags and a wedding dress if it helps! The rooms are the same size as all Paris hotels and wonderfully clean with great and very clean bathrooms. There is a safe and tv on the wall that gets both cnn and bbc news. The rooms have AC so you can have a nice cold room, even if it is hot or muggy in Paris! Even though it is a great hotel at great rates, the best part of the hotel is the concierge, our new friend Yohan. He was the only one working during the day while we were there but I hear Flore is just as great. Yohan planned everything for us from helping wiht hotels, flights, restaurant reservations, what to do and see, directions, tours, ect. And he is just great to talk to and hang out with!
