{"text":"Very bad service The property itself is very lovely (especially at night when it has gorgeous candlelight) but be prepared to hike to your rooms. The beach is not very appealing but the pool is nice. Did not appreciate the cabanas-to-rent signs for only something like $100 a day but my daughter tells me this is commonplace.The staff are all very friendly and I hate to write a negative review but I must. There was a dispute over our bill and they said it would be taken care of but I was not contacted by them just saw the bill on the charge card and have no clue as to how they arrived at that figure. When we first arrived there was apparently only one bellman on duty so we had a 30 minute wait to get to our room. There was no in-room safe so I waited at the front desk for assistance. By the time I got to the counter itself, it had been a long wait and then I was told that I would have to wait for security to show up to escort me to the safe. The whole episode took over 50 minutes at the least- I was pacing in the lobby and went up twice to beg for a time update, it was that bad. When it was time to check out we called for a bellman and waited. Finally I got fed up and took my own bag out to the car. And then waited and waited for the rest of my party. Eventually I drove up to the check in\/check out area, got out and inquired. As this was taking place my son and his friend finally arrived in the cart. I let the staff know that I felt I could have crawled to the car with the baggage in my teeth and made it quicker than their service!The casino is pathetic. Some machines were not programmed yet to pay out in paper so if you wanted to cash out you had to wait for an attendant, who was on break...One lady pointed out to me that the bingo game is only for the locals as it is all in Spanish, she was disappointedThe restaurants were fabulous but only 2 open at a time and very overpriced. It cost me over $120 every meal for our party of 3.I must say that when I wanted to use the internet at the business office I noticed a sign giving their rates. I was prepared to pay but the woman at the desk said no charge. I went back during their business office hours before we checked out to print up our airline tickets but the office was closed. Thank goodness the staff at the Royal Service were able to help.Overall a very nice place but be prepared to wait and don't plan on any time frame.
