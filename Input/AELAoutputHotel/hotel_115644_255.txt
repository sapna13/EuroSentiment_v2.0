{"text":"A little gem in busy Union Square Having decided on Union Square we were looking for a reasonably priced hotel for a well earned Christmas break. After reading the reviews of the Chancellor we booked it direct with them (cheaper than other so called discount travel sites). Upon arrival we were really pleased with the location and also the look and feel of the hotel. The staff were extremely helpful at check-in and also recommended local places to eat which we used and were very pleased. The room was very clean and being up on the 14th floor at the front corner we had an excellent view of not only Union Square but also the skyline beyond the bay. Bed was extremely comfortable, room had all the facilities we required and very relaxing. Room isn't the largest compared to some of the larger hotels but is more than adequate for what we needed given the amount of time actually spent in the room ie sleeping (did I mention the bed was very comfortable?)Staff at the hotel were all very friendly, knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions. Loved the individual feel of the hotel compared to chains we have stayed in previously eg the rubber duck in the bathroom was a lovely touch (especially as we had a Santa duck). Cookies and hot beverages in lobby were always plentiful no matter time of day. Overall would highly recommend this hotel. You can't go wrong for location, atmosphere, price, convenience, friendliness, cleanliness and beautiful old architecture. Would definitely stay here again should we return to San Francisco.
