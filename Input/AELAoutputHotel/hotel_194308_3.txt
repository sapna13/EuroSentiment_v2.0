{"text":"Best Boutique Hotel in Paris My wife and I are from Canada, visiting Paris for 7 days as part of a medical conference. We stayed for the first 3 nights at a large hotel in Montparnasse (Meridien, similar to a large Hilton or Marriott) but knew that for our last 3 days we wanted to stay in the best area of the city, in the Latin Quarter, close to landmarks, an easy walk to anything cool in Paris.We did our research, spoke to friends who had stayed in Paris, and took an educated gamble on this hotel. We are in our late 30's, married for 13 years, and were leaving our kids at home for the first time.There truly could not be a better hotel for us. We've travelled throughout US and North America, and have a good feeling for what we wanted. The problem with Paris hotels is often that they have small rooms and staff is not friendly. Nothing could be further from the truth at this hotel.The rooms are very reasonable in size. We paid a bit more, stayed on the top (5th) floor, in the Edith Piaf room. Very large, nice Queen bed, nice bathroom. Lots of light. Not a great view, but you don't stay in a hotel for the view. The staff is really, really nice. Always smiling. We speak French, but they speak English very well. The breakfast is wonderful: eggs, bacon, sausage, croissants, fresh-squeezed orange juice, etc... Every day there is a nice fire in a very large fireplace. Every time we got back to our room, there was a little treat: A bottle of champagne our first day. Chocolates our 2nd day. Tags for our bags the 3rd day. There is a very nice little bar downstairs, with Jazz on Thur-Sat nights. Think about it: sitting by the fire, sipping on a glass of wine, surfing my laptop (free WiFi) while a Jazz band plays 30-40 feet away.We saw many other hotels in this area, and I can't think of a better place to stay. The location is really the best. You can walk anywhere. There are great restaurants nearby (try Le Christine just 200 feet away).Fantastic place to stay. Can't see how anybody, even if you have crazy extravagant tastes, would be disappointed.
