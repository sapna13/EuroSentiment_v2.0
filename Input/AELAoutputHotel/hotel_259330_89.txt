{"text":"Don't waste your money Our friends were getting married in Punta Cana at the Majestic Colonial and we booked out trip too late and there were no rooms available at the Majaestic. The travel agent said Grand Paradise was just as nice and next door. All lies, well the just as nice part. My husband and I requested a room with a king size bed and were placed in a room with 2 queens. There was no remote for the television and the phone was sticky and had a nasty smell that was unidentifiable. The food was horrendous and no one spoke english. We requested a room change and had to wait 2 nights before being moved. We were also charged eight dollars to get a remote control for the tv. We made reservations for their Italian restruant and were denied service because my husband had on flip flops, yet he had on long pants and a button down shirt. Meanwhile they allowed another man in jean shorts and a tshirt with sandals on in for dinner. We were annoyed but I reasoned that their Italian food would have sucked anyway and we live where they make the best Italian food at home so who cares. As I said before our friends were at the Majestic Colonial so we went over there to see them and we shouldn't have. As soon as you walk in you know how much the Grand Paradise is lacking. We felt like step children the rest of the week. If anyone wants to go to Punta Cana stay at the Majestic. If it is booked, wait until you can get a room. It coss more but who cares? Have a nice vacation where things are done well instead of medicocre. Majestic is more americanized also for Americans who are wanting to converse with other guests in English. (No offense to any one else) Bavaro had my husband and I representing the states. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide where to stay.
