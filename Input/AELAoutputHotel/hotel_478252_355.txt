{"text":"well we just got home Well we just got home from a 1 week stay . We traveled with a group of 10 friends. I found this resort way to big ,we have traveled some where differerent each year for the past 6\/7 years .The resort was very well looked after, very nice rooms ,grounds were nice ,beach was awesome ,lots of bars where you got good service.Food was probably the worst food of any resort we have been to other than the japeneseand the paris which were awesome food.Our friends were spread out through the different 4 resorts in this complex ,our fault probably as we should have e-mailed and requested rooms close together ,seem to have spent alot of time trying to meet somewhere. Shows were good, overall it was a very good trip first holiday we have been on with our close friends although i iwould not return to this resort because of the food and size. We prefer to go somewhere different each time we travel.The world is big! We went on a tour of the countryside it was very good for us we got to see how the dominican people live. Started out bought candy to give to the kids (fun at first then i felt disgusted that we were letting very young children run for a km to dig candy out of the bush as we just throw it from the truck ,stop and the kids swam the truck to get candy )Well time to go hope this helps. Oh and watch the people at the buffet it can get pretty rough in the stampede for food (Busy) please contact me for more info if you wish ","annotations":[{"endOffset":259,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":255},{"endOffset":284,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":280},{"endOffset":1066,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":1061},{"endOffset":1066,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":1061},{"endOffset":1066,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":1061},{"endOffset":1189,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":1184},{"endOffset":1189,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":1184},{"endOffset":1287,"mention":"candy","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Candy"],"startOffset":1282}]}
