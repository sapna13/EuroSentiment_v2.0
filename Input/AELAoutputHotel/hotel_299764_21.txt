{"text":"A wonderful experience at Marriott Courtyard Ginza. We just returned from our 7 day stay. This was a fortieth anniversary vacation trip. Loved the hotel.1. Though this is a Marriott Courtyard, it is comparable to a full service Marriott. Don't let the older outside facade deter you.2. The wonderful staff made this this a truly exceptional experience. No exceptions-all the staff. Free coffee in the lobby. 3. Business center offered free internet. It was wonderful to send daily e-mail to family and friends. Kept up with news and sports. Airport bus dropped you off at the hotel. Two hour ride in, one hour ride back. 40 miles to Narita airport.4, Less than a 10 minute walk to Tsujki fish market. Do walk through the market by 0600. Go all the way to the back to catch some Tuna auctions. We found they were not closed to the public. A must experience. Sushi breakfast at the fish market was very good, but very crowded and expensive. Market was a truly unforgetttable experience. Still worthwhile to visit by 0800.5. We ate the lunch buffet at the hotel, and for $20, we considered it a good value. We ate breakfast at Dennys across the street. Open 24 hours, and a very good French Toast or eggs, bacon and sausage was $4.50-$5.00. Coffee was $3.20 extra and very good. Free refills? Sometimes. 6. Three block walk to the shopping in the heart of Ginza. We loved buying food in the basement floors of the major department stores. Restaurants are on the top floors. Convenience stores were plentiful, open 24 hours, and had some nice food and drinks. Canned coffe and canned soft drinks were very good, and averaged $1.20.7. Hotel had wonderful detailed guides to key attractions, including easy to follow subway directions. Subways were a fun experience, and very easy to use. Don't miss the subway experience. We paid for each ride. We didn't consider daily passes a good deal. Too many different lines.8. We loved the hotel's high tech toilets. Goodbye to toilet paper. Would love to have one in my house. Even Mc Donalds have these. 9. We would love to return, but the long plane ride from Dayton Ohio was very exhausting. Tokyo is much less expensive than Europe. It is a value destination, where the savings on hotels and food, pays the extra plane fare. Unlike Europe, you can enjoy wonderful dining without breaking the budget.
