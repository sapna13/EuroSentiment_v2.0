{"text":"Average I stayed at this hotel for 7 nights at the end of July we arrived having come from the Oriental In bangkok (IMO a really supberb hotel) we flew to singapore with Jet Star Asia, an airline i would certainly recommend as well as also being a budget one.On arrival which i didnt think was particulary warm, we were shown to our room which was a courtyard roomI was very surpissed to see that the rooms do not have a private balcony, what they call a balcony is in fact a table and two chairs on the open walkway, so obviously no privacy.Only the suites in the hotel have private balconys and these cost about 2 thousand pound a night Id also like to point out that there is no difference between the Courtyard \/ Palm Court and personality suite rooms only the view and some more antique detail in the room are the difference.This was confirmed by the hotel manager.The rooms are a good size they have a parlor, bedroom and large bathroom\/dressing area but they are dark with limited natural light.They do not provide bottled water only tap water in a jug, i thought this was poor.I thought the room was tired and the bathroom towel\/robes were definetly tired , bathroom products i would say are produced on a mass scale and used by all hotels belonging to the raffles group, they were not individual to the hotel.We were introduced to our butler, there not really butlers but take the role of guest relations, dont expect them to unpack your bags or do stuff like that.Ours were ok, but quite serious, i didnt like the butler call button as it took ages to get a response and the hotel discourages you ringing the front desk.The day we arrived it was our wedding anniversary and they never mentioned it, but on our return to the room at 1am we had a room covered in rose petals and a bottle of champagne, a very nice touch but somewhat unusual as we had been in the room until 9pm and were to tired on our return to really enjoy it.I found the room very noisy as noise cascades through the rooms due to the woodern floors\/walkways,following a request to be moved to a quieter room we were upgraded to one of the royal suites in the hotel which was lovely. This was following a serious complaint, having been sprayed by the toilet and getting locked in the bathroom as well as misleading information i had received from the hotel. However the average joe bloggs cant afford these suites , so my review is based on what i actually paid for.Had i have not prepaid my stay, i would have checked out, i didnt find the staff friendly they appeared somewhat surly and everything was so slow.I ate at Longhouse SteakBar and Doc Chengs both were excellent.I wasnt keen on the Longbar, a bit overrated, but the live music was good, the live music also was good at the courtyard, but again service was irratic.The hotel complex is overrun with tourists and maybe this is the problem, they lose sight at looking after there resident guests.internet access is also not free, phone calls were cheapI visited the Ritz AND the Oriental and found the staff more on the ball and prefered the decor of these hotels.The person who paid for a bentley to take them back to the airport must be mad, they charge about a 100 uk pound for a ordinary hotel car for airport collect and return transportation (15 minutes) which is a rip off, based on a cab at 6 pound each way, which they order in advance for you. Breakfast in the Tiffin Room and Room Service was a shambles, at the Tiffin Room it varied, the cold food was good but the hot food was pretty poor and a limited choice, they never cooked our eggs properly , they were either too runny or brokenMushrooms covered in garlic.Room Service was a case of what will arrive today, we only ever ordered an american breakfast for two, and we had anything from 4 eggs cooked like a cake to half the items missing and salsa on the plate, toast was one slice each. We gave up on the Tiffin Room and had a bizarre room service breakfast instead for 5 of the days we were there.I liked the pool although the lads were really nice it was always a bit slow, and we always had to make up our own beds.The spa was very good but pricey.I wouldnt return, instead i would look at hotels such as the Ritz.Raffles is living on its name not on its product or service.
