{"text":"Lovely holiday would return Just returned from 2 lovely weeks at the Sirenis. We flew with First Choice excellent leg room and individual seatback TVs so all my 3 children liked that. The transfer was in air conditioned minibus and direct and journey took about an hour. Check in was quick and smooth. We had booked the Sirenis as it was one of the only hotels that could take 5 of us in one room. We had two double beds in the main bedroom and a sofa bed in the lounge. The room was clean and our maid looked after us really well so we tipped her as reward for this not because we had too. A picture from the children went a long way too, the following day we had swan towels and flowers on our beds. The food was really good, the buffet had superb choice and the children loved the pasta man where they could choose what pasta they had and what went in it. We tried the speciality restaurants and the booking system was improved whilst we were there and the queue took about 15 minutes. You could book for the speciality restaurants which are A La Carte everyday, one booking per day so effectively you need never eat in the buffet. The Steak House was superb. We also tried the chinese (not so good) and the pizzeria really good too.The pool was massive and so warm the kids spent most of the day in there. The beach was great too, not quite as I had imagined (pure white sand) but nice and clean, palm trees, plenty of sun beds and the sea was warm so what more do you want. You did need to be up by about 7am to get decent sunbeds with shades.The kids went to the Kids Club whilst we were there. It was on from 10-12 and 3-5. The kids loved it and really liked their play leader. I was a bit more sceptical. She seemed a bit too relaxed for me, but hey I'm a Mum. Klaudia also took them all for tea in the buffet one night which gave us a nice meal on our own.Before going I was a bit worried after reading some of the reports on here, and if you wanted to be picky you could find things to moan about. Towels on sunbeds, birds do come in the restaurants sometimes and the restaurants are also really hot but you are in the middle of the Caribbean and the setting is beautiful so relax and enjoy it.We feel really chilled and recharged after two fantastic weeks.
