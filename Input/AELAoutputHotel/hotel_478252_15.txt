{"text":"2nd trip to the GBP Bavaro and loved it as much as the first This was our 2nd time at the hotel and we loved it!!!We will be the first ones to admit, the check in process is slow and the worst part of the trip. But knowing that when we got there, we were prepared for it and enjoyed every second of the trip after it. The beach is fantastic. It is clean, huge, soft sand. There are always plenty of chairs for everyone. Being our 2nd time there, we were upgraded to the diamond club. The private pool you have access to with the diamond club is fantastic. Always a seat in the shade, warm water, etc. The food is great, no matter what other ppl say. There is always a huge choice of what to eat. I assume the ppl who complain about the food won't be impressed with anything. We ate at the Japenese restaurant - loved it. it is very entertaining to watch the main dish cooked infront of you.Also ate at the French - best food of any bar none.We tried the new Italian restaurant by the new Villas in section 70 - it is a lot better than the other italian restaurant by the pool (we had that one last year). We would go back.Finally, we also ate at the Mediterranean restaurant. To my surprise, i am a picky eater and loved it. The Mousakka there was the best thing i have tasted in a long time. Don't forget people, you are in a foreign country and not everyone will speak english. But when we ran into waiters who didn't speak english, they tried very hard to get what we wanted and if they didn't understand, they got someone who spoke english. You are on vacation, and the staff always tries very very hard, so be patient and enjoy yourself here.For those who haven't been there, the stores on site are expensive. When you are facing the sunken ship in the beach, if you walk right past the Riu resort, etc. for about a half our, there is a market of vendors on the beach you can haggle with. We will be back for a 3rd visit next year.
