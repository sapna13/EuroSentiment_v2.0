{"text":"My new favorite in downtown Dallas Spent four nights here in early June 2008 and was simply knocked out by the great service, friendly and helpful staff, and the uniqueness of this hotel. Unlike most of the big chain hotel options available downtown, there are no cookie-cutter rooms at the Hotel Lawrence. Each guestroom's decor is different; no two are exactly alike, and the rooms include little extra comforts (like the bathroom fully stocked with everything from organic shampoos and lotions to cotton pads to Q-tips in a cute little glass jar, and a full-body spray adjustable shower with dual heads). The rooms are small, which is a drawback, but this is common in historic hotels where the original rooms have been preserved intact (which, historically speaking, is a good thing.) My room was clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated.Built in 1925, the Lawrence has been restored with care. The owners have shown a lot of love for this old place; they have researched the hotel's history and understand it's importance and proximity to the heart of Dallas. Several great photographs of the Hotel Lawrence's past adorn the walls, telling visitors the story of it's evolution from railroad hotel to tourist destination.My room was 1001, located in a corner niche' of the 10th floor. Although it was right by the ice machine and the elevator, that noise never roused me (although a few late night noises from the ghosts which are rumored to haunt the 10th floor did!). The room also afforded a great view of the Old Red courthouse and Dealey Plaza - and of course, everything is within easy walking distance. Only drawback is parking - street parking is often available nearby, or if you don't want to feed the parking meters, there's always easy self-parking at the train station next door for five bucks, or a valet parking option the hotel offers for $15.Another plus is that this is not a noisy hotel (not much outside street or traffic noise can be heard), not a party palace like the Hyatt Reunion. It's quiet, low-key, laid-back, and easygoing. The staff is so helpful - if you need *anything* at 3am, they are there for you! They also offer a free shuttle van to help you get around downtown and are always going the extra mile to make sure your every need is taken care of. Also liked being able to turn off the a\/c and open my window - most of the big chain hotels have those hermetically sealed windows! The Lawrence also offers a nice breakfast in the morning for free with Starbucks coffee, have a good restaurant in house, a business center with free hi-speed internet, a small workout room and pretty much everything you need. If you want a swimming pool, however, might want to look somewhere else. For my needs, the Lawrence not only met but totally exceeded my expectations. I will definitely return here on all of my future trips to Dallas.
