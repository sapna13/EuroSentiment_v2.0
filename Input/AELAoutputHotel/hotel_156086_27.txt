{"text":"Marvelous Hotel This is the first hotel that I have had no complaints about since they tore down the Millenium Hilton in NYC. The rooms were wonderful,the maids were excellent, the bathrooms were spacious, the building has its own water filtration plant, so you can not only drink the water, but you can favorably compare it to the tap water anywhere in America, the building itself was a work of art, and the building was filled with art. We were there for Santa Semana (slow time for business) so the hotel was filled with tourists who all were delighted by the marvelously low cost of their stay. I disagree with the comment about the concierges. They (especially Jorge Ortiz) were quite helpful: along with finding out which restaurants were open and helping us get they good seats for the Ballet Folklorico, they also stepped me through a scenario that involved getting a group of four non-Spanish speaking people back to the hotel after watching Luche Libre in a slightly rough neighborhood at eleven at night (that was the highlight of the trip, and I wouldn't have dared do it without their explicit instructions on how to have a safe walk to safe neighborhood with safe cabs. The guides offered by the hotel area bit pricy: To round out a perfect Mexico vacation, I can only suggest that you stop by the lobby of the Majestic, and hire Emilio, Emilio is an eighty year old man who knows everybody in Mexico City and everything about Mexico City, and will show you things that even people who grew up in the DF have never noticed or seen.
