{"text":"We had a good time We were there July 11-15. The weather was great, hot but you are on the beach so who cares. The hotel was really nice and the a\/c worked wonderfully. We were promised block 5 or 6 through Apple Vacations but were placed in block 100. The only problem with our room was that the safe wouldn't lock and I didnt feel comfortable leaving the room without it locking so we had to wait 15 Dominican minutes which translates to 2 hours. That is how it seemed to be there pretty much all the time. Once I got used to that I was fine. Block 100 was okay, but we had 2 double beds and ants. We were moved to block 6 the next day and it was amazing. We never had any problems. The maids were wonderful always working. The food was horrible. I lived on rice, toast and fruit pretty much the whole time. Our 2nd or 3rd day into it we found a gift shop with Lays potato chips and that helped a lot. I highly recommend that you bring your own food. We liked to starve to death. We brought the Bebba Kegs and they had never seen them, but they filled'em up!!! The beer was really good. I think it was pretty strong. Anyway the frozen drinks were really good coco loco was yummy but too sweet so I pretty much just had the beer. Ask for Santiago at the pool bar he is wonderful. The entertainment staff has to be the hardest working group of people I have ever seen. They work from 9am-2am or so. They are on the beach, practicing for their show that night, dancing in the front of the resort, and after their show they are at the disco dancing some more. They always have you dancing. My favorite person was Richard, he has so much personality. The beach party was fun too. We went on the sting ray\/shark excursion and I do not know how to swim, but I did it and it was amazing. I highly recommend it. After the snorkeling they take you to a private beach where they serve you more drinks and just have a good time. Keep an open mind and you will be fine just bring your own food. We went with another couple and had a fabulous time. It is going to be what you make of it. We would go back!!!
