{"text":"Good location I stayed at the Westin for 5 nights at the end of a month long trip throughout North America. I was generally happy with the hotel in the end, although my initial check-in experience was terrible.The lady at the front desk was extremely rude. I was two hours early for check-in and realised I would probably be unable to go straight to my room however she was exceptionally dismissive and almost annoyed that I had dared show up early (unavoidable due to flight times). As it was my first trip to New York I went to the concierge to see if I could get a map and some pointers to walk around until I could come back and check-in. Again I was faced with a rude and unhelpful staff member.However, that said this was my only complaint. By the time I returned there were new staff on the front desk and the gentleman could not have been more helpful or polite. I settled right in and was very happy with my room which was very large and had an extremely comfortable bed. I was very happy with the lobby bar, which had excellent staff and a nice atmosphere. It was clean with very fast elevators and I am a big fan of the in-room coffee machine.Obviously it is in a good location for broadway shows and plenty of tourist action. I managed to get a very good price on the room so it was definitely worth it and I would stay again and recommend it, however had I paid more, the intital check-in experience would have definitely turned me off from returning.
