{"text":"Mixed Thoughts About Affinia Dumont I have mixed thoughts about giving the Afinia Dumont a three star rating rather than a four--it may well be that the hotel situation in Manhattan is so terrible that a four is justified by comparison, (I've never stayed in a Manhattan hotel before, but if you stayed in this facility in San Francisco, Honolulu, Scottsdale, etc. you would have no trouble rating the Dumont as a Three at best. Consider the advice of those with more Manhattan experience.We stayed 8 nights Aug 26 - Sept 2 07. Arriving Saturday night we were given a 4th floor room by an apologetic night clerk who assured us (without prompting) that we could be moved to a higher floor the next day if we asked. This deserves brownie points even though we didn't move. We loved our corner room with windows on two sides giving great views of 34th St, including the Third Avenue intersection. A personal choice. I mention this because of another review suggesting staff was not helpful with this kind of situation.Very Good Overall:Location on 34th: 1 1\/2 blocks to #6 subway line (one stop Uptown to Grand Central Station and all points everywhere. A few stops Downtown will give you easy transfers to express subway trains headed to Wall Street etc.. Don't underestimate importance of this.Room size: Big! The reason we chose this property after seeing TripAdvisor reviews.Bed - The King was excellentBathroom - Very attractive and functional except for the modest counter space.Work desk - big.Electric outlets - lotsExcellent staff attitude, friendliness,and response to requests everywhere--front desk, concierge, spa\/exercise room, housekeeping.Very good exercise room (good treadmills (3), eliptical trainers (3), and bikes (2), each with individual TVs. Weight machines and free wieghts are more than adequate for all but the very serious lifters.) When I was there (around 5 pm daily), there was almost never more than several other guests in the room.We enjoyed neighborhood restaurants and the hotel restaurant.Improvement needed:Antiquated television - Purchased at a garage sale?Neglected KitchenGood:Small gas range and oven Freezer-over refrigerator.Small coffee maker (with coffee packets supplied daily).Cups, plates, and glasses for 3 or 4Frying pan, 2 sauce pans, small glass bowl serving dish, 1 spatula, 1 can opener.Bad: Not much else in the kitchen. Not even a sharp knife to cut cheese with. No additional mixing dishes, serving dishes, measuring cups, juice or beverage containers. Tiny antiquated\/underpowered microwave (despite lots of available counter space available for something better). No dishwasher (there is plenty of space for regular one and more than plenty for one of the small ones that was just installed at my office at home).Internet connections:We never got it to work--used dial-up instead. (Admittedly I gave up quickly, but I rarely have a problem.)The phantom Business Center. Their web site lists a Business Center as an amenitity, but it doesn't exist unless you count the single work station in the small front lobby ($6 for 20 minutes).I defer to those who have much more Manhattan hotel selection experience.Feel free to contact me. --Jeff ","annotations":[{"endOffset":735,"mention":"brownie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_brownie"],"startOffset":728},{"endOffset":735,"mention":"brownie","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate_brownie"],"startOffset":728},{"endOffset":2178,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2172},{"endOffset":2178,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2172},{"endOffset":2197,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2191},{"endOffset":2268,"mention":"pan","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pan-bagnat"],"startOffset":2265}]}
