{"text":"Left after 2 days Being from Vancouver, I normally travel to Mexico and don't necessarily need or expect 5 stars anywhere.My travel agent recommended the Sirenis for myself, 28 yr old female traveling alone with my 5 year old. She assured me it was recommended for families. We arrived at 8pm at night on a Thursday (December 13). Check in was a long line up and we were all hot and tired. I was told where my room was, given a map and sent off. Our room was like a mini suite, 2 beds, but dated. It reaked of cigarette smoke and the curtains, lamp shade and shower curtain were lined with the smoke stain. The smell was worse. I was afraid to take off my shoes because my daughter pointed out a few bugs within minutes. We went to the buffet while waiting for the check in line to disappear.Nothing looked good or fresh and it was french fries and buns for us.I told the front deks of my issue with the ground floor and the smoke and they told me to return in the morning. After no sleep because the bed was so hard, i gave them $20 to change my room.They moved us to the opposite end of the resort (section Q) Not bad for just me, but it's tough to tell a 5 yr old we have to walk 15 minutes for a bite to eat, check the internet, etc because there is no shuttle service at all and the resort is massive.....And then the locals came.....bad enough you can't sleep cause the beds are so incredibly hard, can't eat because the food wasn't appealing and can hardly access your room because the key cards had a mind of their own......but you can't get service because the locals got priority.the icing on the cake was being locked out for the 3rd time because our key didn't work and it was now 11pm. Luckily my dear neighbours walked to the front desk and took care of it for me. I left Saturday afternoon. I couldn't find our tour rep (limited hours) so I called the Bahia Principe Punta Cana and paid an arm and a leg for the remainding 5 days, but we are here now and it's so much better.The beach at the Sirenis is nice, but once you've seen better, you know it's not that nice. At least here, I can convince my girl to go back and forth to restaurants, shopping, the beach, etc as they have an amazing train service. The beds are great and I will leave the rest for a review where it belongsYou get what you pay for at the Sirenis, not much.
