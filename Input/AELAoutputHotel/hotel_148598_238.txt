{"text":"Beautiful pool area, but serious drawbacks Recently stayed at the Rio Mar with my fiancee. The grounds and the pool area are beautiful, but we were disappointed with a lot of things. As can be expected, the prices at the hotel restaurants are outrageous, and the food is nothing special. They know that you're 1 hour from San Juan and 30 minutes from other restaurants, so the prices are very high. The most disappointing part of our stay was the golf. We saved up and had our one big splurge on a round of golf at the Ocean Course (there is also a River Course, but there was a tournament going on when we were there). First of all, there is only one par 3 hole that is on the ocean - and it's surrounded by construction as they are building new condos all around it. The other 17 holes are no where near the ocean. And they didn't even tell us that they were seeding all of the greens, so we paid $150 per person for green fees even though the greens were perfectly brown and sandy with seed. It was very disappointing. Though the course may have been special back in the '80s when Greg Norman designed it, it is very run down and is not worth such a high green fee. In conclusion, if you want to lay by a nice pool and be on a nice beach, you will enjoy this hotel, but for anything besides that, I highly recommend that you rent a car and go explore the real Puerto Rico outside of the hotel compound.
