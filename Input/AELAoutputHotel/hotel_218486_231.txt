{"text":"Paradise. An Excellent Hotel with an excellent staff to match!! All that I can say is WOW!. This hotel is by far one of the best if not the best resort that I have ever had the pleasure of staying at. Let me explain.....I stayed there from March 25th to March 30th \/07and my brother and I were greated with nice drinks from the door. I know that is normal in the hotel business but the way they did it they did it with style and class. The hotel staff was extremly polite and was very attentitive to our needs. They welcomed us with open arms. The only problem that I had with the hotel was when we first checked in our A.C. did not work that night so our room was extremly hot in Bloque 8 but we delt with that for that night and even then it wasn't a big problem because the woman in the customer service office right by the front desk (I forgot her name but she was a very very nice woman I guess she was a front desk manager) had no problem switching us to another room which was in Bloque 7. The A.C. worked extremly well in that room. Room 7226 it was to be exact. The room had a nice pool view and I was just amazed. Okay enough about the room being that I didn't stay in there long enough. The beach was clean and filled with white sand.The water was clean and blue. Most of the guys that try to sell you an excursion was cool but evry now and then there is one that didn't take no for an answer. But after me telling him I'm just here to relax he respected that and went on to the next guy .One of the most coolest guys that I had met there was the bartender Pedro. This guy could make a drink and he also give you service with a smile and he would try to talk to you in english the best way he could but still keep working in the process and will not mess up your drink. But luckily for me I'm a African American that speeks spanish a little so we were cool. Thank You Pedro for showing us a good time while we were there.Another gentleman that we had met was Leonardo.He was one of the recruiters that you will see when you get there. Very nice guy , professional and just plain cool...Leonardo thank you also for your hospitality and looking out for us on a daily basis. Leonardo would give suggestions to my brother and myself on what to do and totell us about the other hotel poperties. This gur was nmot rude or too pushy if we didn't want it he knew how to step back and change the subject without getting on our nerves. Thanks again Lenardo!!!!!Even the housekeeping lady was excellent , the massage women were nice to talk to as well. And guys don't be cheap tip anyone that is servicing you keep in mind our dollar goes a long way and they really appreciate tips no matter how small or large.Take care of Pedro and his crew.I cannot see how people was talking very bad about this place. I'm quite sure the people that had something bad to say about this place had to have been......how may I say it?mmmmm......very irrate people themselves or their competitors.The whole hotel treated us like stars and I like that.!!Two thumbs up Ocean Bavaro and I'll see you soonChauncey Shearin Bloomfield N.J.
