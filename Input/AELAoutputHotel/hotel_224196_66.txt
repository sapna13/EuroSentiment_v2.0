{"text":"Great for Familty R We spent our spring school break at Montana. Our party included,myself, my wife and three children 13, 11 and 8 years of age. We go someplace warm every year and prefer smaller, less crowded resorts. We don't need entertainment, casino's and the like just a clean and beautiful spot to rest. Montana was perfect for this and we would come back. The facility was beautiful. Our two bedroom apartment was clean and well kept. The staff was friendly and the beach was very nice especially if you like to snorkel. Montana's decor was done by someone with taste - its very nice,I would call it upscale Polynesian. The beach chairs were comfortabel and plentifulof the variety that you don't see everywhere.... really first rate. The towels and bedding the quality you would find in an expensive hotel. The resort has great tennis courts and two nice swimming pools. If you are going for glitz and to party into the night don't go to Montana - not that there isn't a beautiful oceanside bar with great drinks and music...( try the MOHITO) but this isnt Atlantis (Paradise Island) and we were happy about that. The one negative was the resort restaurant. Eclipse is on the property and occupies a beautiful spot right near the beach. Unfortunately this gourmet establishment is overpriced and the service from the kitchen is slow and inconsistant. Entrees never came out at the same time - half out party was finished by the time the other half of the food came out. All the food took an inexplicably long time and you can expect to spend $50 per head without much to drink. After eating here a few times we decided to avoid it. We don't go to the Carribean for gourmet meals, we would have been happy with a restaurant that didn't try so hard to pretend it was an upscale Manhattan eatery..Eclipse fails at this. Eclipse needs rework.The good thing is that you can go up the road to eat at more casual places with more Puerto Rican fare - the Ocean Club is the best we found - the rooms at Montana also had good kitchens so if you are with a family go to the Supermarket down the road and take care of some of your meals this way - rent a car.Overall though Montana was a great place and we will probably return next year.
