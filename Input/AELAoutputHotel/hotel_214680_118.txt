{"text":"Hidden Treasure! When my wife and I were planning our Honeymoon, the first place we thought of was Hawaii, of course. My wife had already been twice, but this would be my first trip to the islands.We researched for months, looking at every hotel, flight, activity and combinations.Finally, I found the Park Shore on travel-hawaii.com. At this time, in 2005, Park Shore's website was almost non-existant. Travel-hawaii.com got me a DEAL on this great hotel. $97.50 a night! And this is for a Partial Ocean View room, which is now around $200\/night.Even at today's rates, I would highly recommend this hotel. It is on the end of a stretch of hotels, so one side is facing a lovely park, with a great view of Diamond Head.It is directly across from a beach that is wave proof. (The sea is blocked off so there aren't any big waves.) And a beach that used to show movies on Friday nights on a huge screen. I think they still do in the summertime. My wife and I got to sit on this beautiful beach and watch Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.The Park Shore has a pool and sundeck, but why waste your time there when you are 15 seconds away from the beach? We were there in August, and it was not even close to crowed on this end. We had our choice of spots on the beach.Also, if you are interested. It is a short walk into the main strip, but far enough away that the noise is of no issue at all.Just a tip. Lulu's Surf Club is attached to the hotel, and it has seats that face the ocean, plus they serve the greatest breakfast!Thumbs up to Park Shore!
