{"text":"Wonderful hotel and service, in a great area My wife and I stayed at the Le Walt for 7 nights in a deluxe room on the 6th floor. The hotel was a delight -- spotlessly clean, very comfortable bed, and a decent-sized room (for Paris). This was by far the best of four hotels I've visited in Paris, and would be my first choice for future visits. We were there on business (me) and vacation (my wife) and the hotel served very nicely for both purposes.Our room was very quiet and clean, with an armoire, comfortable bed, desk, small table, 2 chairs, and a bathroom with shower\/bath combination. Because we were on the top floor, the ceiling was slanted near the wall, which cut a bit into headroom but provided nice dormer windows. Bathroom was very clean and functional, but the shower\/bath was a little cramped and tended to splash water around (there was no shower curtain).As for room quiet, I'd note two things. First, the hotel is on a relatively busy street (Avenue de la Motte-Piquet) and rooms are on either the street side or back side facing a courtyard and the backs of apartments. Our room was on the back side, which we loved -- there was no traffic noise and it was very nice to feel at home by seeing people in the other apartments. On the street side, on the other hand, the higher-floor rooms would have views of the Eiffel Tower. So there's a tradeoff there. Second, because the hotel is over a Metro station, there was occasional rumbling from trains. Those did not bother us at all, but light sleepers on lower floors might notice them.The area was fantastically convenient, both for foot travelers (like us) and for those who prefer public transportation. For foot travelers, its location in the 7th puts it within 30 minutes of the Champs-Elysee, Louvre, Musee D'Orsay, Eiffel Tower, Invalides, and just a little longer to Latin Quarter and Notre Dame. For those who prefer less walking, there is a Metro stop literally 20 yards from the hotel, and you can get almost anywhere in the central part of Paris within 20 minutes. There is also a taxi stand around the corner.Nearby Rue Cler is a wonderful market area with many shops and restaurants. Wonderful, that is, if it were not somewhat overrun by tourists thanks to its being featured in a guide book. Still, it was very convenient for breakfast, wines, cheese, delightful restaurants, etc.I'd like to correct a couple of misperceptions that appeared in other reviews. First, the hotel does have internet access in the rooms. In fact, it is free access, through an ethernet port (requires a cable, available from the front desk). WiFi is only available in the lobby (for a fee). As long as you have an ethernet port, you will be OK. Second, the devices in the bathrooms are electric radiators, not towel warmers. Of course one can use them for towel warming, but that's not the primary purpose.The only thing that did not live up to expectations was laundry service. It was expensive (e.g., 9 euros to do a shirt), wasn't available on Sunday or Monday, and my pants came back with spots (which the hotel happily fixed, but took another day). I'd recommend to seek out another laundry service; there are several we saw nearby when walking around.Finally, the hotel had excellent service. Front desk and most other personnel were fluent in English. I especially appreciated the concierge service provided, which helped us make reservations at several restaurants (which is usually possible to do in English, but we were making them well in advance).All in all, the Le Walt was a great experience and we found it to be a good value -- expensive like everything in Paris, but well worth it. We look forward to returning.
