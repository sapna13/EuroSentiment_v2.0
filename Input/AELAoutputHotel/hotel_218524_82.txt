{"text":"4th time and still 5 star to us Sorry for a late post. Me and my husband spent 10 days from Septmeber 3 to September 12. We go to Punta Cana 2 times a year. This is our 4th trip to Excellence and this was one of the best trips. When we arrived we were greated wiht a warm smile,drink and wisk away to the excellence club. to our suprise we where upgraded to an excellence ocean view suite. Beautiful room, the maid was great always leaving little towel figures and the the gentleman he stocked our fridge was great we ended up calling him KIT KAT man he was always leaving extra kit kats for my husband. Room service was great.The pool was wonderfull never had an issue with getting a bed or floats. Juan and felix are top notch service around the pool. Juan got to know us that when we where at the pool he knew what we drank and brought it to us very attentive.Food was good i am a picky eater but was able to find something to eat.If you get a chance and want to get gifts go over to judys she is on the right hand side of the resort on the beach. She does not hassel you we got alot of good gifts at a cheap price. She speaks very good english.If you are looking for a very romantic quiet place to be with the one you love this is the place. We do tip well when we are there, and we take school supplies,toys for the kids we give them to the maid. I always take gifts for the maid to lotions ,jelwery. They work very hard for very little. I feel lucky to be able to visit thier country and they are the nicest people you could meet. We are going back Feb 2009 cant wait.
