{"text":"First NY Hotel worth its price! We stayed at The Benjamin for our wedding anniversary. And I have to say, they either exceeded most of our expectations or met them. The service was prompt and friendly. The concierges were very helpful AND cheerful when we asked for their assistance prior to our arrival. They even called back to confirm our requests- Great Job! The hotel package we got from their website included a spacious yet cozy 350 sq. ft.Studio Suite that had a fully equipped kitchenette (no stove), breakfast included, and 20% off on a Spa Service for $350\/nt.  Our Anniversary was made special by the lovely note from the manager, the box of assorted Godiva Chocolates, and other appreciated small details such as: choice of 10 types of pillows to help you sleep, turned down bed service, lowered lighting, classical music in the background, truly clean marble bathrooms, lovely clean scented toiletries, and a well-appreciated umbrella (It rained for 2 of 3 days we were in NY.) The kitchen was a godsend- loved access to the freezer and microwave, and that bottle of Veuve Cliquot ready to be open was just a lovely touch.  Since we checked out the Spa on our last morning, we did not have enough time to enjoy the Spa services. (Bob's wife: There was a Gentlemen's Package of massage, facial and feet rub that would have been a perfect gift to my husband if I had known about it earlier and had set 2.5 hrs. aside.) Things that need to be update would be a printer connection using a USB port.  We will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. We are definitely coming back to The Benjamin when we're in town.
