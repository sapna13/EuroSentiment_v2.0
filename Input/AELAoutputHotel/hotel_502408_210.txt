{"text":"Just keeps getting better!!! My extensive traveling brings me to New York city numerous times a year and my hotel of choice is the exceptionally comfortable, clean,convenient midtown location and accomodating hotel AFFINIA 50! I am at present at the hotel since a minor ailment,forced an extended stay,which the staff quickly and seamlessly arranged. While working, I decide to browse some reviews and was surprised and appalled by some of the comments and immediately decided to write my own review.For over 4 years, I habitually stayed at one of the GRAND DAME hotels in midtown about a block from the Affinia. The service and rooms ranged from poor to superlative with ever escalating rates. On a whim, I stopped at the Affinia and asked directions from TANIA the concierge. She was professional, informative and fun and invited me to make my next stay here. Lucky day for me! The rooms are lovely (I have been in 4)and large . 15-20 minutes is the standard timeframe for issue resolutions including plumbing, kitchen appliances, bedding etc. ALL OF THE STAFF, bellmen, housekeeping, concierge, front desk are professional and genuinely caring with strong and efficient manager(s) like Sandra. They never fail to acknowledge you by name, remember any special requests or issues (food allergies) even surprising me on my birthday with special treatment - SOMETHING NEVER DONE BY THE OTHER HOTEL WHERE I SPENT MUCH TIME AND MONEY$$. I recommend this hotel to everyone travelling to New York and have brought friends and family members to stay!!!!!P.S. KUDOS on the addition of the mini-bar service. ","annotations":[]}
