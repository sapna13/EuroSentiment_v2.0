{"text":"For a special experience in a spectacular location For the past 17 years, my wife and I have been returning to this beautiful island - each time exploring new towns and the island culture. Having traveled extensively throughout the island experiencing what each town had to offer, when we arrived in Isabela and encountered Villa Montana, we knew we would return here each year with smiles on our faces. It's one of those places that combine the sophistication of a European spa with the simplicity of walking along miles of pristine beaches and enjoying beautiful sunsets.Villa Montana√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ location is ideal for those who prefer short rides from the airport - 15 minutes from Aguadilla√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ airport. When entering the resort, you are surrounded with some of the most spectacular vegetation on the island. The large natural boulders placed strategically throughout the property are enhanced with beautiful native plants sprouting from them. The produce grown on the property garden is used at the beachside restaurant! How fresh tasting is that...The staff, lead by the resorts owner, Jessica, and its GM, Cynthia, is pleasant, attentive, always accommodating, and willing to listen to guests. The resort has the feel of a small condominium community. The two restaurants on the property are, in our opinion, the finest in the area. We had the opportunity to view a beachside wedding one evening. When the groom entered the area on horseback, it proved both unusual and most interesting.Because our villa had a full kitchen, we located fisherman in the area selling the local catch of the day (usually snapper and yellow tail)--and then came home to cook it for dinner. What memorable meals!The wi-fi connectivity is first rate. Golf courses are 15 minutes from the resort. Take time to look at the night sky here √à√\u2020\u2022?the experience is not unlike being at a planetarium!What's really enchanting here are the beaches. The property is located on the beach with its beautiful blue Atlantic water. Whether you choose to windsurf, snorkel, scuba dive, bodysurf or just swim, you will find it here. The beach is never crowded, and the water invigorating.My wife had a dental emergency one year while we were staying at the resort. The staff was able to assist her immediately and arrange for help--which was most reassuring. Our only reluctance in writing this review is that our little secret 'Garden of Eden' will become better known - making it more challenging for us to book our future stays! ","annotations":[]}
