{"text":"A Fantastic Hotel... in a Fantastic country! We stayed for 3 days in Singapore on route to Bali for our Honeymoon, and we wish we had stayed here longer! The hotel is lovely, the staff are so helpul and the pool area is great - you do not for one second feel as though you are in the middle of a city! We stayed in the Garden Wing and our room was a good size with a balcony over-looking the pool area. We ate at the restaurant Blu one of the nights and it was great, a bit pricey but well worth it. It is then really nice to go through to the bar area and have a few champange cocktails as the views from the bar and restaurant are amazing! We had breakfast at the Line, again, you really cannot fault anything about this place - the choice of different types of food has to be seen to be believed and although it is buffet style, the turnaround of food is so quick that nothing gets cold! I never thought I would eat curry for breakfast though... :) ! When we go back to Singapore.. and I say when because we definitely will, this will be the hotel we stay at, without a doubt! p.s. there is an area of Singapore called Clarke Quay which has really cool bars\/restaurants\/clubs - it is defintely worth a visit. We didn't find out about this place until our last night there which was a bit of a shame!
