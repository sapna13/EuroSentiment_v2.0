{"text":"Wet holiday at the coqui The Coqui inn was exactly what I expected after reading the various reviews. An affordable and safe place to sleep while on vacation. I visited Puerto Rico for five days in June and spent 3 peaceful nights and one interesting night at the Coqui inn. The first day we arrived our room wasn't ready (we arrived at 1, so we weren't suprised) so we headed to the beach and a bar for a couple of Medallia's to start our girls weekend out. When we arrived back to the inn our room was ready and appeared very clean. There were no wash cloths, only towels, but it has been my experience that many caribbean hotels don't have wash cloths, no problem, we picked up sponges at the drug store close by.Our first night the toilet ran all night, when we awoke the next morning our room was flooded with two inches of water!!! We yelled from the balcony like damsels in distress and a very nice man came up to check our room. He showed us the problem, fixed it and promised our room would be clean in no time. We went to the beach, and when we returned everything was good as new! ( I had left my suitcase on the floor overnight, fortunatly, it is waterproof, or I wouldn't as happy) The people at the coqui inn were very nice and I would stay here again! If not for the water problem I would have given this hotel a four for it's value and location.
