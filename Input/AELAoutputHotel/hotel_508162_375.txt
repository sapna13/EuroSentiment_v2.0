{"text":"Very good vaction We stayed at Dreams from April 24th to the 29th.This is our 2nd time in Punta Cana, 1st at Dreams. The resort is well layed out. The lobby is beautiful, grounds spotless and lush. The pool is by far the best we have ever encountered. The way it runs the lenth of the resort with curves and coves make it so there is alway plenty of room to swim and lay in a lounger. The water was the perfect temperature. Cool enough to refresh you when you got in but not too cold so you did not want to stay in it. Loved the floats the resort provided around the pool as well. We never ran into a lounge chair shortage at either the pool or beach. We would get to the pool at 10am and could always find a chair in the sun. The shady spots were a little more hard to come by but even then there were plaenty of them till about 9 am. Like everyone says, the staff is great. They work hard and always have a smile on their face. We did not encounter any language barrier whatsoever.The beach was nice. Not the best we have seen but not the worst. We did walk a couple of miles in both directions. Not much to see but still a nice walk. The sand is soft and fine.The food is about average for an all inclusive resort. We ate in the French, Mexican\/Latin, Steakhouse, Japaneese and the Buffet. We liked the French best followed by the steakhouse and Japaneese. We did not like the Mexican\/Latin at all. We actually left our meal and went to the buffet insted. The buffet is one of the best we have ever been to at a resort. The breakfast spread has everything and anything you could think of, and then some. The dinner at the buffet had something for everyone. The deserts in all the resturants were average at best. They looked great but the taste did not live up to the look. Lunch on the beach was burgers, dogs and nachos. Again, just average. Lunch in the buffet was better but you had to be indoors in the middle of the day to eat. The steakhouse did serve lunch and was open to the air. The food there was good.Bars were all nice but, we feel they all dilute the alcohol except the lobby bar. There is no way you should be able to drink 5-6 drinks from the pool bars and still have little or no effect. Drink just 1-2 in the lobby and you can feel the effects. We were not the only ones to comment on the watered down alcohol, even the top shelf stuff.The weather was good. We had a bit of rain the 1st evening and a half day of stedy rain on the 4th day, otherwise it was sunny and Hot with temps in the upper 80'sWe were pleasantly suprised to see the widely diverse guests both in age and nationality. Everyone was freindly and outgoing. I think the workers attitude wears off on the guests. The workers never pass you by without an Hola!We never got to the spa but did use the gym on 3 occasions. They have some great equipment in there and we were able to work off all the food and drinks we were having. Loved the self serve ice cream machine and poppcorn machine.We watched 2 of the shows while there, the magic show and love show which was a version of the dating game with audience participation. That one was our favorite.Would we go there again? Probably but the only reason we would not is because we like to experience new places. We would recommend it to anyone.
