{"text":"Great Tour of the city The good aspects included the general scenery and landscaping. The grounds were well maintained. The staff in general was very pleasant. Walking on the white sand beach was also a must do activity. By far the best thing to do was the trip to Santo Domingo, truly rich in historicity and old world charm. The Japanese restaurant was also a positive experience. Room service was mostly good. Good general ambience.The not so good aspects were:1.If you have a sinus problem or are a non smoker this is not the place for you. My wife and I were surrounded by smokers everywhere even in places that had some semblance of non-smoking signs. This was the worst aspect and I would not return for this reason.2.The huge property uses shuttles which become a necessary evil on very hot days. Sitting in the shuttles usually meant ingesting a lot of fumes.3.I found that the rooms were not well lit. During the days this was not an issue as you could open up the blinds but during the night there was barely enough light to read comfortably.4.The food was average. I had stomach problems and had to settle on white rice and bread by the fourth day.5.Plan to carry basic stuff like Advil and Pepto-Bismol as you will pay dearly in the shops for these amenities.6.The airport was a nightmare. It was too small to handle the volume of passengers. There was no AC and once again my wife and I were subjected to cigarette smoke.
