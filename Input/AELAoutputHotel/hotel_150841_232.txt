{"text":"Iberostar Bavaro This is my 2nd trip to the Iberostaar Bavaro and my wife and I loved it as much this time as we did the first time. The food is UNBELIEVABLE!!! I am a New Yorker living in NYC and I have eaten in New York's finest restaurants so if I am saying that the food at the Bavaro is great then you know from where the critique is coming. I just can't for the life of me understand how anybody from anywhere can have anything bad to say about the food!!! But one thing is for certain- NOBODY gets sick from the food (whether or not they like it) and that is a HUGE plus since there are tons of people returning to NYC from the Dominican Republic who have nightmare stories about getting food poisoning. As for the nightly entertainment it is fun. Hey it's not a Broadway show by any means but it's fun. It's like a good high school show with better than High School show dancing. The pool is very nice and the pool bar makes VERY strong drinks so be careful. The beach is pretty. It's hard to find a chair but you will find one. The ocean does not have big waves. It's kind of calm- Not like where I am from in Queens, NY. There are many people from Europe staying at the Bavaro. Mostly from Germany, Belgium,  France. I would say that Americans are in the minority. We found 2other couples from, Baltimore and Philly who we hung out with day and night partying. After the nightly show is over eveybody goes up to the bar in the front lobby and has drinks for a while. Then it's on to the disco for a little partying. If you didn't think there were singles anywhere in the hotel this is where you will find every last one of them. It's a pretty jumping place and crowded too.  At the Bavaro there are 6 restaurants and the Buffet. Earlier when I mentioned the food I was referring to the Buffet. But the restaurant food is even better! Out of the 6 we love 2 of them- Jambalaya and Gourmet. The hotel staff are the nicest people you will EVER meet! When I came to Bavaro the first time I thought they were faking it because being from NYC I couldn't imagine people being so kind but they truly are lovely people and it makes the trip that much better. All you see all week are smiles and Hola's. We paid around $113 per person($226 for my wife and I) per night. For this price where on earth can you find anything similar!That does not include airfare. I would be happy to answer any more questions from future trip goers.Benett  Pamela PearlmanWhitestone, New Yorkbenettp@earthlink.net ","annotations":[{"endOffset":178,"mention":"New Yorker","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/New_Yorker_Hotel"],"startOffset":168},{"endOffset":1885,"mention":"Jambalaya","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Jambalaya"],"startOffset":1876}]}
