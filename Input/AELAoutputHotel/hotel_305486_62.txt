{"text":"Singapore on the way home We came to the hotel from Malaysia. The check-in was ok and we were ok with the room facing the pool. The breakfirst was ok. After a day in the city we came back to find that no bathtowels were to find. I called the frontdesk and said We did get any towels, can you please bring us towels The lady at front desk sounded very tired and not friendly at all. After 15min, the doorbell rang, I opened the door. Outside is a man from the hotel staff not looking happy and the gives me the towels and walk away with out a word. I then realised that they have just given us one towel, so i call again. Aftert five minutes someone is banging on the door, very angy. The same man with an angry look and it feels like that we should be happy that they answered the call at all. Beside from that the hotel is ok. In their internet kiosk they don't have a printer and it coats 5 singspore dollar to use for an hour. In the same building there is a little store that sells drinks, candy and other stuff. There is coats for internet 2 singapore dollar an hour.The hotel is on subway line from the airport and it's not heavy to bring your stuff to and from the airport. The nearest station is only five minutes away.Would I stay at that hotel again ? No, I would pay a little more extra for better service.
