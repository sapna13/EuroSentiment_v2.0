{"text":"Great Value! We stayed in the Catalonia Bavaro, in the latter part of January 2008.We booked last minute, got a good discount, (canadian) $677 each, plus the departure taxes. And for this we got a week of paradise. The entrance foyer is very impressive. An open sided structure. with lots of water features and marble floors.The grounds were lovely, and very well maintained. Great for a stroll.The staff, all of them, from the Security, service personel, and the Entertainment staff, were the best we have met yet.  It is the staff and their courtesy that makes this resort a success. There are hotels in the Dominican where obviously the staff are not happy, and it shows in their attitude. The food was good and I must mention the fish dishes were excellent. Just don't expect an 1 chop or large steaks in the buffet resturant. The food budget in the main lobby resturant obviously does not have the finances for such. The salads were wonderful. Great breads, and lovely omlettes. And according to our scales, we certainly didn't starve. I did notice that when the senior people were off duty, such as Sunday morning, the service and the cooking slightly slipped. And there was not a pemanent roving manager to see to filling up the more popular dishes, or spoons for the yogurt, etc., Perhaps the excutive could look at this area.For the amount of people that came off the bus, the reception dealt with our check in fairly fast. Do yourself a favour, and adopt a laid back, 'manyana' attitude once you get to the airport prior to departure. Relax you will get your room, and you will get your luggage etc., just remember you aren't the only people to have arrived.And bring your manners. We are in our 60's, and we found that we were the ones to shift over into a single line, when meeting oncoming people in the pathways. We really had no option, it was that or be walked over. When it comes to getting a drink they do concentrate on serving domestic brands of liquer, so pop into the Duty Free coming and get your favourite tipple for your room. What else made up this vacation, a clean, comfortable room, lovely gardens, beautiful beach, yes there is seaweed, but that's a natural phenomenom in a bay that is protected by a barrier reef. And did I mention sun, more sun, and blue, blue skies, and NO SNOW to shovel.
