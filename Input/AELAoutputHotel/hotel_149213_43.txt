{"text":"5 day Getaway We just left the Resort, it was a well rested vacation. When you first arrive to Punta Cana International Airport, there is a $10 entrance tax you must pay. I've read peoples review before I came on this vacation basically people have high expectations, you get what you pay for. Not every member of the staff speaks english, but they are willing to try to communicate with you. Everyone was nice, and very attentive to our needs. During the weekend it was very busy, but during the week days it was peaceful. I came down during the Salsa Congress, lots of dancers, lots of energy, lots of fun during this weekend event. If you stay at the premium hotel (Bavaro Palace) you are allowed to use all the facilities from all the hotels, except the 2 premium restaurants that are not included.If you decide to go to a Restaurant that is above your hotel tier you must pay $20 per person to dine.The trollie that took you to each facility ran every 20 minutes or so maybe a little less, but everything is within walkin distance, it's a nice walk after a big diner. I felt very safe walking at 11pm at night. Be sure to pack atleast $100 singles, to tip people, tipping is a must especially when you want good service, the staff will remember you at each meal. I gave our waiters $3 at each serving, $5 to the maid everyday in an envelope. Bell hop $1 per bag. Bartender $1 per drink.Packing essentials: Sunblock or tanning lotion, bug spray, swim trunks, snacks chips, nuts etc. A bag of chips that cost 99 cents cost 2 bucks here. Coca Cola in the airport was $3 for a 20 ounce bottle. Camara or Camcorder. Room: You can order internet service for a daily fee of $5 not bad at all, cable is $8 per day its not worth getting, you get an additional 3 english channels, and you get to see Bourne identity 10 times in one day. There is a safe in the room, which you set the combination.
