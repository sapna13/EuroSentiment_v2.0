{"text":"If you don't speak spanish expect to fork over the money! Beach- Atlantic side- not very apealing for a beach lover.Service- Resort Staff DOES NOT favour english speaking guests. Guests being brought in from Spain seemed to be favoured. It may have something to do with the GM being from Spain. English speaking guests are served last at the bar regardless of how long they had been waiting. You would have to actually show money at the bar in order to be served. Food\/ was good. Lots of variety. Rooms-be very careful in ground room floors. Sliding glass doors open from both sides. Not like in North America. Ensure both sides are locked and check every night before you leave your room. Although your representative may ask you to check out the night before your flight...this does not mean you have to give back the key to your safe. Take extra precausion on this night. Our room was robbed as was the room next to ours. We had a digital camera stolen and a bottle of perfume stolen. The room next to ours had 400.00$ USD stolen. Another passenger also had a camera stolen. We filled in reports but have yet to hear anything. The problem is that they make us pay 15$USD for a safe which should be manditory if there is so much theft going on in this hotel. I believe this hotel has gone down hill considerably since the change in ownsership. It was much better as the Sunscape Punta Cana Grand. All the pools with exception of the one located by Block #7 were dirty and warm. There was a frothy foam in the adult pool. Check in\/front desk staff should be able to speak more then one language considering the diversity of guests. I'm not racing to go back here anytime soon. If I do I wil lhave to learn how to speak spanish. ","annotations":[]}
