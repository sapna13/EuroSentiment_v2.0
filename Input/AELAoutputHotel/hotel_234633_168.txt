{"text":"Staying at Residence Foch? Read this..... Lovely hotel...no 'city' noise at night ! We stayed at Residence Foch after reading review in the Daily Mail and Tripadvisor and booked as birthday treat for my partner. Hotel Lobby is lovely and the greeting was genuine and very warm...not what you expect in a large city! We stayed in room 10, which is very small but beautifully decorated.. A little more storage would have been nice...if you are travelling with more than one average size case you might struggle ! Bed lovely and comfy..for us as we like them firm...thought the two champagne flutes were a nice touch..iron  ironing board, air con, safe and hospitality tray. The bathroom was large in comparison and with good facilities...great shower, hairdryer, new sink area  lovley big miror etc..if I was going to be picky (which I am) the old tan tiles were dated though. It would have been good to have a little more info on checkin...no prices in the room for the goodies in the mini bar...but it did come in useful for storing some fab pate  cheese that we snacked on ! We booked breakfast - despite some negatives in the reviews...we thought it was fine..good coffee, breads, preserves, croissant, cereal, yoghurts, fruit, cheese and ham...you can boil your own eggs if you like! Not bad for 11 euros in comparison to cafe prices! Thanks to Isabelle for the tip on the restaurant nearby 'Bistro Saint Ferdinand'...33euro menu, 3 good courses inc good wine and coffee..try this one for sure..the Creme Brulee was amazing! The hotel stairways and stained glass windows on each floor are lovely...any other critisisms...well, minor ones...might have been nice if they had recognised my partners birthday as they knew it was a special occassion (the restaurant even managed to put a candle on his dessert and we only mentioned it in passing to a waiter !) getting ice was a a bit of a task...we couldnt have an ice bucket but was given a glass..but we had to bring it straight back and you are between two metro stations...take comfy shoes ! Other than that we would stay again... On Paris...take time out to have a beer or two at a pavement cafe and 'people watch'.. dont do the top floor of the Eiffel tower...massive q's up AND back down to 2nd floor and view not that much better..we did it thursday afternoon and we waited over 45 mins at the top! in fact 2nd floor is open and you get better pictures with Paris in the background...DO go back and see the tower at night! Do research on what you want to see at the Louvre and go EARLY...masses of tour groups make it a bit of a 'scrum' at times...there is SO much to see, trust us, make a plan before hand or you'll get fed up trying to find things! We bought the 5 euro headset tour...not worth it as so much not listed. NotreDame...amazing from outside...dingy and we felt a bit dissapointing inside...be brave and do the metro, get a 'Mobilis' ticket for the day (zone 1  2 under 6 euros). Enjoy!
