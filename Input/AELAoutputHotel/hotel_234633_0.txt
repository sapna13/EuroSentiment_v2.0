{"text":"Bang for the Buck! We found this hotel through tripadvisor. In our slang, no horse run. This place offers the best value for money. If you are looking to pay for things you do not need, then it's better you look across the street for another hotel.We were greeted by the staff at the reception, one of them Jean-Louis (hope i spelt it correctly). I did not manage to get the name of the other staff. They were most friendly and helpful. Jean-Louis even took the effort to orientate us to Paris, informing us on the what not to miss. He even drew the paths on the maps, mapping out the areas and the routes. As he noticed i brought along my young daughter, he quickly put the hotel's name card in her pocket, just in case she got lost. The service here is definitely top notch.Now for the room. Nothing fanciful, just a comfortable bed and a newly refurbished shower. And the room+shower was very clean. To us, this was what was necessary, as we would not be spending 24 hrs in the room. The free wifi was definitely a big plus as well. I have no idea why some hotels still do not provide this for their customers. Perhaps this is what separates the wheat from the chaff.Location wise, this is situated near to both porte malliot metro and rec, which is most convenient. As you can get around Paris via metro and rer, it is vital you stay around them.As the title states, this cosy hotel definitely provides bang for the buck! ","annotations":[]}
