{"text":"We want to LIVE at this resort!!!!! I got married here on July 26, 2008...it was the best decision I've ever made! We brought along 32 guests  we're all planning to return on me  my husbands 1 year anniversary...I mean, we CAN NOT wait! Ana was awesome as the wedding coordinator  far exceeded my expectations. We paid for the excellence gold pkg but I brought a lot of things with me that were included in the pkg (photographer, makeup, hair) so Ana made sure to offer something else in order to have our money well spent. To be honest, it was so cheap anyway, we weren't even planning on asking for a discount! And the food for the reception was incredible!I have NO idea how people are complaining about food. We're from Louisiana, where we're known for our flavorful food, and my husband  I thought the food was great. Being that we got married there, we got a private dinner on the beach...that was by far the best food I've eaten in a long time. It was 2 HUGE lobster tails, a steak (kind of like a filet),  mashed potatoes...which I must say their potatoes are FANTASTIC at any restaurant in Excellence. Especially the pumpkin potatoes! Chez Isabelle, the French restaurant, was my #1 fave! A lot of friends with us agreed. Mexican was awesome, Italian was awesome,  breakfast in Toscana was the 1st thing I thought about as soon as I opened my eyes. Ok, bottom line: food is perfectly fine!HECTOR  DONELL at the Blue pool bar were the BEST! I miss you guys!!!!!! But don't worry, we'll be back next year!Okay, so I must be honest, we had ONE problem. The honeymoon suite was SOOOOOOOOO not worth the money. First, it looked exactly like everyone else's room but had a jacuzzi  bed on the balcony....well, our fault, b\/c who wants to get in a hot tub outside in the middle of the summer? That was pretty much what you paid for  well, we booked in November, so we really weren't using our brains! Also, our air conditioner wasn't working too well. I complained but they told me just to make sure all our doors were shut....needless to say, they were shut, our air conditioning just sucked! A mgr came one day  said it would be taken care of by that night  was actually kind of [--]. Well, it wasn't working that night, so I went to the front desk  whoever it was that helped us went ABOVE  BEYOND what we expected. He got us the most incredible room, with a very powerful air conditioner, also included in the excellence club. I WISH I could remember his name just to send a thank you  let the rest of the staff know how helpful he was to my husband  I!I really could go on forever about how great this place was!Food: GoodService: GreatEntertainment: Mostly good...night club dancers were GREAT!Wait staff: IncredibleRooms: GoodI have recommended Excellence Punta Cana to every single person who has asked about my wedding....even those who haven't ! GO! You will not be disappointed!
