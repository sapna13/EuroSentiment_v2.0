{"text":"Nice casino but rooms are very noisy A little background: we are a couple in our early thirties looking for a romantic beach getaway. We are not clubbers and were looking forward to quiet evenings at the restaurants as well as in our room, but that was not to be. For comparison, we have been to hawaii, riviera maya mexico, and las vegas and my hope was that this vacation would be a small combination of all three.RoomsWe arrived on a saturday night and our first room was on the third floor (no second floor) and we could not sleep a wink due to the club where the music did not stop until 5:00 a.m. This was compounded by very loud neighbors who were up til 6:00 a.m. partying. The doors connecting the rooms are super thin and as the rooms are not carpeted, you could easily hear every conversation! I think the club only operates thursday - saturday but our first night was not pleasant. We changed rooms to the 9th floor (the highest available) the next day after we requested a change. While waiting in line to complain, there were several people waiting in line about to complain about the exact same thing.Other than the noise issue, the rooms are ok as they are modern with small bathrooms and no counter space in the bathroom.PoolsThe pools are nice with nice lounge chairs and surrounded by palm trees. You can access the beach through the pool area, but beware of bug bites (there is a warning in each of the rooms). We got bit several times, so make sure to wear mosquito repellant, which is offered through the pool service area.RestaurantsMost of the restaurants are expensive except for the pizza place which has good food at reasonable prices. The pizzas and burgers are good as well as the puerto rican special. The Italian restaurant is romantic with good service except for the fact that during the night we dined, there was a very loud family that ruined dinner for several patrons. The thing was that it wasn't the kids that were loud, but it was the adults. There were several couples that asked to be moved but unfortunately there wasn't any other tables available.There is a breakfast buffet that is around $23 for omeletts, pancakes, and other regular stuff which isn't bad, but gets old after one day. We mostly ordered from the pizza place and you could even take out from the place.CasinoCasino is small relative to Las Vegas, but they always had one craps table, one roullette table, and two or three blackjack tables going. The minimums are usually $10 and the dealers are not the freindliest bunch.LobbyThe lobby is nice with great nightly entertainment every night. We would always hang out at the lobby and listen to the live music, which is great. Overall the hotel was ok, but the noise issue was a huge deal for us as we were looking for a relaxing, romantic vacation. If you are looking for a relaxing, quiet vacation, with really good service this might not be the best hotel.
