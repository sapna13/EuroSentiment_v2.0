{"text":"Beautiful Modernista Style building in horrendous location! My wife and I picked The Vincci Condal Mar because of its close proximity to the Forum, where we would be attending the Primavera Sound Music Festival. We were quite impressed with the modern, modular look of the hotel from the pictures we saw on the website. And, I will admit, once we arrived at the Hotel, it was quite simply a marvel. Unfortunately, the hotel is located in a very industrial area, with a factory literally right across the street. We were told that it was located in an up and coming part of Barcelona, honestly though, there is nothing √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√âoming up√à√\u2020\u2022?in this part of Barcelona except for the thick clouds of smoke emanating from neighboring Factory√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ chimneys. The Hotel is also about a fifteen minute, seven block walk from the nearest metro line. The hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ website states that it is 500 meters away from the metro line, that is an outright lie.  On the bright side, the hotel rooms are very clean and also maintain that cylindrical shape of the hotel, which we thought was very neat. The staff is also courteous and helpful, if asked. It is probably one of the better hotels we have stated at this price range; it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ just a shame about the location. A taxi into the more picturesque parts of the city cost about 12 euros.  If you are a tourist who plans to see the city, Barri Goti, Gaudi architecture, and Las Ramblas, you are better off staying closer towards the center of town. If you are a business traveler attending a conference in the Forum area, you are still better off finding a hotel closer to the Diagonal Mar Shopping area, as this hotel is nearly one mile away from the Forum area. Overall, the hotel is a wonderful architectural spectacle with good service, clean rooms and comfortable beds, but there is a reason why this hotel is so nicely priced. The Smog! The area is so miserable that it makes it hard to recommend this hotel ","annotations":[]}
