{"text":"Ok, but wouldn't return My wife and I recently spent our honeymoon at this hotel, after reading all the positive reviews we couldn't wait to go. Unfortunately our stay was a bit of an anti-climax.Check in was fine, the receptionist was really friendly etc. As honeymooners we asked about a possible upgrade and were told yes this was ok as long as we were willing to pay an additional $100 per night.........we didn't take her up on her kind offer!!! (the brochure states honeymooners get a free upgrade when available)The room was lovely, very spacious, air con VERY good and the fridge had beer!! We did notice several damp patches in the ceiling though, so did the maid when she was cleaning one day when we were in there! Apart from that we have no complaints, apart from channel 96 only showing adult films on one day!! :-)The beach is lovely, probably the best we've ever seen, spotless soft white sand and clear blue sea. It is picture postcard stuff and it really took our breath away when we first saw it.The grounds are immaculate, the friendly gardeners will offer to climb up and get you a coconut too which is a nice touch.We found a few problems though which put us off ever going back to this hotel, maybe not the DR but definitely this hotel:THE STAFF:Whilst most were very courteous and friendly there were the odd few who gave you the impression this was too much like hardwork! The pool bar gentleman is one, also the gentleman who works the lobby bar was only interested in serving you if you were lining his pocket with dollars. There is a certain favouritism to Spanish guests too, whilst I have no problem with the Spaniards I object to waiting at the bar and then a Spaniard appearing from nowhere and being served immediately. It's not as if we didn't tip on a regular basis, much more generous than most but it didn't seem to matter. THE FOOD:The buffet is probably your safest bet, I found the food pretty good in there although my wife didn't and subsequently lost half a stone on our trip. There is a different theme every evening and I found the food to be of a pretty good standard. I never eat veg at home but the veg here was amazing, so was the rice and all the meat dishes. (if you're a very fussy eater then perhaps this hotel isn't for you) The a la carte restaurants aren't worth going to, the Chinese is pretty bad, Tex Mex steak didn't taste like steak to me, the Mexican in the other hotel is average but the Italian is probably the worst meal I've EVER had.My biggest problem of all was certain cliental, for a so called 5 star hotel I find it disgusting that people smoke in the pool and flick their ash in the water. I also don't understand why people took the time to walk to the lunch buffet at the Mare Nostrum (beach restaurant) and then walk back and eat their burgers, pasta, sausages etc IN THE POOL?????!!!!In my eyes the hotel consisted of 80% Spanish, perhaps 10% American and the remaining 10% a mixed bag of other nationalities. The staff seem to favour certain nationalities, one in particular and I find this pathetic in this day and age.To sum it up, nice beach, beautiful weather, the sea and pool water are like a bath, the buffet very good, and the rooms are very spacious but a little TLC would make them immaculate.My review is honest and to the point I feel, please feel free to get in touch.
