{"text":"Great hotel with great view My wife and I have just returned from a 7 night stay at the Hotel des Grands Hommes. We stayed in the deluxe room on the 6th floor that included a balcony with a spectacular view of the Pantheon. We booked the room on the hotel website and received a substantial discount. The room and lobby were very nicely decorated. The deluxe room size was adequate based on European standards, but I imagine a standard room would be tight. There was no alarm clock, iron\/ironing board or coffee maker in the room (as is typical in US hotels). Not a problem as long as you are prepared, though it is much more difficult to buy coffee in Paris (without sitting down in a cafe) than it is in the US. The wireless internet was a great amenity and worked just as well as my internet connection at home. We were able to stream Sirius satellite radio while we were in our room. The TV size was adequate but only received one English speaking station (BBC Worldwide). The English-speaking staff were courteous and helpful. The A\/C worked fine, but note that you must stick the key in a slot by the door for the electricity to turn on.The hotel is near many restaurants and nightlife, yet was relatively quiet at night since it was not on a busy road. Make sure to head east of the Pantheon toward Rue de Mouffetard (5 minute walk). This area is packed with cafes and bars. Of course, with the American dollar so low, everything is expensive. Expect to pay around $35 - $40 for a simple breakfast\/lunch for 2 at a cafe (prices include tax and service) or $8 - $10 for a beer. A moderate dinner for 2 could easily cost $70 - $80 without drinks. You will get much more for you money if you buy take-out food and eat it outside or in your room. If you eat at a cafe, make sure to check if they accept credit cards and if service is included. As a rule of thumb, if the menu is not translated into English, then the staff probably does not speak English very well or at all.Overall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel immensely would definitely return in the future. The ideal location and views definitely made our Paris experience much more enjoyable.
