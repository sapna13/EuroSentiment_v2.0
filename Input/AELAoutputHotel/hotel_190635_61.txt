{"text":"Out of this world, felt like being in a James Bond movie!! I was fortunate enough to stay at this hotel for a mere 3nights on part of our honeymoon. All I can say is I cannot believe there are any bad reviews for this place, it was so utterly beautiful. We were very lucky, booked with expedia, got a great rate, just a normal room, but I mentioned in the request box that it was our honeymoon, and any extras would be welcome!. It was with disbelief that when we checked in, the lady on the front desk took us into the lift ,and showed us how to insert our special key, to get to the 2 top floors, as we had been upgraded to an exclusive room on the top 2 floors, which only the lucky few, very rich, had access to. There was a special lounge on this floor, with 360 degree views and free drinks and food whenever you wanted! We had champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries just before we went out for the evening, and I felt like I was in a James Bond Movie. The skyline looks so gorgeous at night, and the hotel staff just make you feel as though you've won the lottery!! The room was a corner room and had floor to ceiling glass windows,all the way around, with a small lounge area, large bathroom with double shower wet room, bath, and every gadget you could think of. We could lie in our fabulous, sumptuous beds, and using a remote control, bring down electronic shutters to all the windows! They even had their own cd called Barcelona Nights for you to play! The sound system was excellent. The view from the room was just incredible at night. I was very impressed with the design, and detail of everything, and the service, and breakfast were excellent. The outdoor swimming pool was surrounded by double-bed sun loungers, with thick mattresses., which I thought was a lovely thought- free fruit and iced water, towels, were all waiting for you. It is true though that it was a little noisy with traffic, as you are not that far from the roads, although you can't see them, (you are kind of, underneath the incredible big bronze statue. )But you can't really complain, as you are in the centre of Barcelona and I think it kind of added to the excitement of the city! The beach is only a short walk over the busy road, and is lovely soft sand, but no shade (atificial beach but you couldn't tell! )so watch out! We were also able to walk to restaurants in the evening. Just a tip to say that we took an open top bus tour which was a great way to see everything, but I was devasted to find that when we arrived to go around gaudi's palace, they only accept cash at the entrance, and we had missed all banks as they all shut for siesta around 2.30pm and hubby forgot pin!!. So we have an excuse to go back!! I truely hope so!! To sum it up, total luxury, will greatly appeal to people who appreciate art and culture, or want something extra special, quality and service. Not a place to take young kids though, its just too posh!
