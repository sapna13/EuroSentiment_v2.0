{"text":"Great for the business traveler! I was in Mexico City on business for the week of January 7 - 12, 2007 and everyday was great. Was upgraded to the Executive Floors and in a nutshell the only difference is your breakfast and drinks are included. There is some renovations being done currently on some Executive floors, but you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hear them at night. OVERALLOverall the hotel staff is excellent, always trying to lend a hand or offering to gather your bags. I did not see many tourists at this hotel, as I got the impression that it caters to the business traveler. Loved the idea that you can access wireless internet from anywhere in the hotel. This is great if you don't want to spend your evening in your room working.FOODThe breakfast buffet was my favorite since you can't go wrong with fruits and scrambled eggs. For dinner the Japanese restaurant on the second floor is the best. The service is great and the food is really good as well. There is a another Sushi type of restaurant on the main floor near the shops and I would not recommend it. The service was horrible and the waitress did not understand English. We got up and left after we asked for bottled water and couldn't understand what we wanted. GYMThe gym and pool area are modern and the hotel has the latest cardio equipment. Word of advice, bring your own headphones if you want to watch TV as you do your cardio as people sweat and their sweat is left of the headsets....pretty disgusting.Aside from that if I have to return to Mexico City, I would definitely return to this hotel.
