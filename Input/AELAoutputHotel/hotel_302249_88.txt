{"text":"Generally nice but make sure you stay in a Villa! Generally a nice resort, but initially we were put in one of the rooms in the main building where unfortunately the sound proofing leaves a little to be desired. In the first room we were allocated we could hear the footsteps rather too loudly, while in the second we could hear the neighbours through the adjoining door. This quality of sound proofing is not what you would expect from a five star hotel - the noise sensitive should be very wary! Also, the main building was frankly not particularly beautiful. One other minor complaint was that the staff are constantly trying to get you to go to one of the hotel restaurants - when it happens once or twice a day, fine, but when it happens five or six that's a bit much.However, we were moved to a villa and that was really nice - here we found the privacy that was lacking elsewhere.The food was very good at the RC. Dava was a particularly nice gourmet restaurant, while the Thai themed one was top notch too. The buffer dinner and Balinese dance on the Wednesday was very good - and the best dance we saw while in Bali. Breakfast was pretty good, as were the poolside snacks. As for external restaurants, we enjoyed a decent Friday buffet dinner (six on the beach) at the four seasons, while La Lucciola was a good italian in Seminyak. It's also well worth going to dinner at one of the fish restaurants on the beach at Jimbaran bay.We did a lot of shopping for antiques and handicrafts. It's well worth checking some of the antique and handicraft shops in Seminyak, Kerobokan and near Jimbaran bay. Particularly worth checking out is Cempaka near the Bali Galleria near Jimbaran, plus a lot of the wholesale outlets on the same road. Cempaka is not cheap, but their mix of main comtempary crafts, furniture and ceramics were the most interesting we saw while there.
