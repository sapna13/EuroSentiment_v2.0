{"text":"Pretty good for price Location: Yes, it's on a very steep hill, one that has a staircase up the sidewalk, so be prepared! Lots of good restaurants nearby, and close to a subway stop- maybe a 5-10 minute walk. Easy to walk from here to a lot of Kowloon.The Airport Express bus is K5- get out at the Empire Hotel stop.Accomodation: We had no problem checking in and getting our room. Although the internet description said rooms have in-room safes, some of them don't. Don't worry, though, you can use your own safe-deposit box at the front desk. There's a fridge in the room, a kettle, some teas and coffee as well. Internet was free- we had a wireless connection that the hotel provided a username and password for every 3 days. We were also provided with a power adaptor when we requested one. Housekeeping service was very attentive whenever you needed something, like when our kettle stopped functioning, they brought us a new one in just a few minutes.The bathroom is terribly dated and small. I felt like I walked in to my parents 1970s bathroom and the blowdryer looked like some kind of vacuum! Quite a riot actually! But the water pressure and hot water were always fine. The bed was like a rock as well.However, overall the room was adequate given we were barely there, and it was very clean.Overall: We couldn't get in to the YMCA Salisbury, so I think this was a good second choice. The staff were all very helpful and our room was more than adequate. I would recommend staying here to others.
