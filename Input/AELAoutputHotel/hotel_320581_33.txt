{"text":"Great Experience at Sunroute Plaza Shinjuku! Just got home to Canada after a 6 night stay at this hotel. The entire hotel has been very nicely renovated and is in a terrific part of Shinjuku. Shinjuku Station is not exactly next door to the hotel, but is only a block away at a large intersection (which is where we conveniently caught the limo bus back to Narita). However, there is an entrance to the same station right next door to the hotel, so depending on which line you want to take, it is really convenient. Our room (1129) was smaller by North American standards but was extremely comfortable with a queen size bed, desk area, chair, tv, etc. No electrical adapters are required for North American appliances. The room provides:Heat\/Air ConditioningAlarm clockPhoneIroning\/Steam boardFlashlightHangersLAN wire for in-room internetElectric kettle, green tea, cups, etc.Laundry bagsGoofy nightshirts and slippersToilet with all the bells and whistles (bidet, etc)Hair dryerShampoo, conditioner, liquid shower soap - all in large bottlesShiseido foaming face washBath sponges, toothbrushes, toothpaste, razors, hairbrushes, Q-tipsShorter but deep tub with showerAn awesome bathroom mirror that de-fogs no matter how steamy your showerEach floor has a room with an ice machine and vending machines selling drinks, beer, nuts, etc. International newspapers are provided on each floor by the elevator.The restaurant on the main floor has a great buffet breakfast from 6:00 am to 10:00 am at 1500 yen a person which is much less than most other hotels I've been to. We didn't eat there other than at breakfast, but note that a small draft beer at its bar is 500 yen. A Coke is 600 yen...(which we couldn't figure out).We also checked out the bar on the 2nd floor which opens at 5:00 pm. Wine is expensive, but draft beer is in the same neighborhood as the restaurant downstairs. The bar itself is intimate and really nice. It was a good place to rest our feet after a long day of walking if we just wanted a nightcap instead of painting the town red.Area-wise, the hotel is in a great location, and the North American 'emergency' amenities are all on the same block (am\/pm, McDonalds, Starbucks, etc).Lastly, the staff at the hotel were all extremely helpful and friendly, from the desk staff to those cleaning our room each day. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone! :D ","annotations":[{"endOffset":865,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":862},{"endOffset":1675,"mention":"Coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":1671}]}
