{"text":"Relaxing mini vacation I vacationed at this resort from Nov 17-20, a short mini stay. I travelled with two of my friends. We are in our late 20s. I will keep this short and try to offer information that others left out. I think this place is fantastic and HUGE!!! This is a plus because you can visit the other hotels' amenities and use them. Front DeskThe front desk staff is great. Especially Hector, he was very responsive to all our needs.PoolThe best pool can be found at the palace property. I believe the Bavaro's pool isn't so nice and is rather small as compared to the palace's pool. Not really a problem, just an observation.RoomsAlso, the rooms were great. We had trouble finding a compatible socket for our electronics. However, we ended up finding the U.S. type sockets behind the TV. We just unplugged the mini fridge at night to recharge our cameras. Our room was huge as compared to other properties. There were 3 of us girls in one room and we never felt like we had to fight for the mirrors. Fantastic!!!The GroundsThe entire resort is immaculate down to the blade of grass.The Tram\/Mini trainThe property features a little trolley to shuttle you from various points around the three properties. This train was more livelier than the disco. It was one of the best features. Also, my friends and i enjoyed the music they played on this shuttle so much we actually bought a copy. The driver will have CDs for 10$ you can buy. Very worth it. Listen out for Mantequilla--very upbeat tempo and wonderful.BugsI am bit everywhere i go and this was no exception. Please bring bug spray for the pesky mosquitos. I didn't and i have many bites on my leg. All in all we had a wonderful time. Make sure you get a massage. The prices were a steal (52$ for a hour)!!!! The dominican people were very nice and accomodating. The only drawback was the food. I have an extremely sensitve stomach and was sick one night from something. Not quite sure if it was from the liquor (not very good quality) or the food (possibly from sitting out and not air conditioned). Just bring some pepto and you should be fine.
