{"text":"Good service not included Reservations Not Honored: A group of 12 women decided to enjoy a classy resort and de-stress. We planned months in advance and booked rooms with two beds. After a fairly long travel day, we arrived to find that our rooms were not going to be two beds after all, but instead a bed and a sofa pull out couch. We tried to get this reverted, but to no avail. there just are no rooms like that left. Little did we realize that one of our more seasoned travellers simply slipped the guy a $20 and he found a room that she wanted. Supposedly if a room opened up they would call. It did and they didn't. Discounts: We had received a group discount for golf. However, we had to produce the letter about this when we arrived at the course. It was like this every step of the way. Simple things: They delivered our luggage, but we were able to walk back to our rooms faster than the luggage arrived -- an hour later. We booked our meals right away. However, one night they closed a restaurant for another party and rebooked us. The restaurant manager was actually a bright spot in the bad service we kept encountering. He rebooked us to a restaurant of our choice. Security: We found it odd that we had to shout out our exact room number, when there were bungalow labels. This was required on a shuttle or the casino. My friend tried just shouting the bungalow, but they didn't go for that. We were not surprised to hear of SEVERAL thefts. (Our group did use the safe provided and were fine.) Hygiene\/utilities: The sinks and showers were clogged. How elegant does it feel to go into the shower after your friend and stand in ankle deep dirty water? A staff member was commisserating with a friend who asked how she dealt with all the angry people day in and day out. (We were not the only ones at the desk with problems.) She said Yeah, can you believe they call themselves 4 star? This is how it is all the time. I've never worked for such a bad place. We really just wanted something comped like perhaps the $60 ride from the airport, but in the end got nothing.Positives: The grounds are quite beautiful, the breakfast nice (though often lukewarm coffee), many of the staff who did shuttle or porter service were actually helpful and friendly. The pool was lovely. The rooms (although QUITE a hike if you get the 800s rooms) are attractive.
