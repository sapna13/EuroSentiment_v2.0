{"text":"5 star but they need to pay more attention to little details My family (husband, sisters and father) travelled from Hong Kong to Singapore for the 4-day Chinese New Year holiday. The hotel overall was fine - large room and really nice view of PSA (container port) from the bathtub. I thought they could have paid a little more attention to tiny details, such as the 2 broken lights in our bathroom as well as the broken light bulb in room. Housekeeping came 3 times to fix the lights but if they paid more attention they would have noticed the broken lights.Most 5-star hotels in Asia will provide 2 bottles of complimentary mineral water every day, some will provide 2 bottles every morning and every evening (total 4 bottles a day). We are happy to purchase our own but this hotel gave us 2 very small bottles of complimentary mineral water on Day 1 and that was it! If you're the Ritz Carlton you don't want your guests to remember you as the hotel who was too cheap to give their guests complimentary mineral water (yes, I know the tap water is safe to drink in Singapore).We asked guest services if any hawker centers were open for breakfast and the words that came out of the lady's mouth was, it's the 2nd day... It's the 2nd day of WHAT? When you're the Ritz Carlton you may wish to consider thinking about your response from the guest's point of view before responding with just any response. You want to your guests to feel like you understand them and you've gone out of your way to help them. That lady definitely needs more training on how to handle guest inquiries.When we checked out the lady who checked us out spent half the time talking on her mobile telephone with someone else and asked me for my room number twice (although I had given her my room number when I approached the desk). She obviously couldn't multi-task (I wasn't expecting that) but I would have been happy to wait for her the finish her very important telephone call. BTW, the 3 other people manning the check out desk weren't doing anything and I would have been happy to have someone else assist us. Again, that left a bad impression.Finally, when we arrived at the airport we discovered that the taxi we took was the more expensive type, flat rate SGD35 for the ride. As we are not from Singapore the bell captain did not inform us that there were two types of taxis (regular vs luxury). I only discovered the difference when I interrogated the taxi driver about the price (I recall spending less money for the taxi ride to the airport on a business trip 2 weeks ago!).I will stay at the Ritz Carlton Singapore again but I hope they'll pay more attention to the little details next time.
