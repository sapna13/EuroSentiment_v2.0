{"text":"Still a Great Place This was our third time at this resort and we enjoyed it as much as the first time. We took our son and his wife and 2 boys aged 8 and 15 with us this time. It was the first vacation as a family for all of us and everyone had a great time. Our daughter-in-law had the time of her life and did not want to come home. Our son had a blast at the pool bar and learned the hard way the the sun and heat dont mix well with the booze all day!!! The two boys had a great time and cant wait to go back (hopefully in Feburary). The youngest boy spent most of his day in the pool and eating at the snack bar we have never seen him eat so much!!! The older boy went on the catamarans and had a blast he also spent of his time in the pool and at the swim-up bar as he found he could get all the coctails he wanted (no booze). The rooms we had were in the middle of the resort so it was handy for going to the pool or to the buffet or for the shows at night which everyone enjoyed.We had no problems with food or water.Everyone found lots to eat at the buffets or the snack bar. We will definately be going back to this resort and have recommended it to several of our friends!!! If you get to this resort say hello to JOSE MIGUEL at the front desk, and JOSE at the pool bar!
