{"text":"Excellent hotel We recently returned from a 2 week vacation in Italy. We spent 3 nights in Venice and stayed at the Al Ponte Antico Hotel. This hotel had received good reviews in the forums and I would like to provide another.We liked the location of this hotel and thought it optimal for staying in Venice. The hotel is on the Grand Canal near the Rialto Bridge. I had read some forums recommending staying off the Grand Canal due to noise. However, I think the positive aspects of staying on the Grand Canal outweigh any negative. Our room had windows opening onto the canal and there was some noise from the water traffic, but this is nothing like that of a motor highway. The room was insulated enough from noise at night and we were willing to put up with a little noise to be able to look out onto the Grand Canal whenever we wanted. Being on the Grand Canal also allows for direct transfers to and from the hotel by water taxi and eliminates lugging bags through the streets. The Hotel has a great view of the Rialto Bridge, but is a far enough walk away from the bridge, which is one of the more crowded areas in Venice. The central location allows easy access to all parts of the city either on foot or waterway.Our room was large and comfortable for 2 adults and 2 teenagers. The bathroom was small but nice. The room was air conditioned which was a blessing as it was hot and humid for much of the time we were in Venice.The best thing about this Hotel is the service. The owner Matteo is extremely helpful and friendly. He has trained all of the staff to be the same way. All of the staff speak English if that is a concern.We would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again if (or should I say when) we return to Venice. ","annotations":[]}
