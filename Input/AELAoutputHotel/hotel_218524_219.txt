{"text":"Great trip to Excellence Resort We just spent a week in Punta Cana, DR Excellence Resort. I read a ton of reviews on this site to help us plan our trip.For the ride in, we had private transportation. It was a 1 hour ride. It was worth getting private transportation as there are no stops. No waiting for our room because we booked a club level room.This was an anniversary trip for myself and my husband. We were looking for specific things---no children, nice pool and beach, variety of restaurants, and a clean well maintained resort. I feel we definately got that at this resort.I have looked at other reviews where people complained about the food. We had no problems. Food was great. If you go to a 3rd world country looking for a 5 star meal for the price you pay to go to these resorts, well then you are just plain unrealistic. Our room was clean and well maintained. We got a oceanview room, but it really was not oceanview. That piece was not worth getting that level room, because we thought we would have the beach right in front of us, and we didn't.The service at the resort was great. We were waited on, but not excessively to the point where it is annoying.The shows also were not broadway, but we were not going there for a broadway show. My husband and I are New Yorkers and we loved the entertainment and it kept us happy. As for the club level, it appears we did get some things that were worth it, such as movies to rent (no fee), internet access, and the seperate concierge desk from the other people on the resort. We also had towels for the pool always available to us. While on the resort we found out towels were hard to get a hold of. We were able to get them from the concierge. Our cleaning lady also made sure she left beach towels in the room (this also could have to do with us leaving her a tip daily). We tipped all the staff even though it was not expected. After the ride in, we realized how terrible the poverty was there. We gave tips to the cleaning lady, bar service, restaurant staff, and bellman.Last year we stayed at Dreams Cancun. This resort was comparible. Each have their own positives and negatives. Bring bug spray (the mosquitos are terrible) and sunscreen...the shops are so expensive!
