{"text":"Traveling alone to PR and staying at the Ritz All I have to say about the Ritz is  Pure Luxury ... If you want to stay at a really nice hotel and be treated like gold than you have to stay here. I dont know if they treated me good because I am a cute female traveling alone or because that's how they treat everyone. But I totally loved it there. You know the minute you step into the hotel that you are at a hot spot.The Hotel from the inside and out is BEAUTIFUL. The hotel staff is the most nicest, polite and helpful people I came across in a long time. I guess most people arent that lucky from some of the reviews that I have read on this site.Anyways traveling alone is always a scary thing... I mean I feel like everyone would be staring at me and nobody would talk to me... WRONG!.... Everybody was wonderful. From dining at El Mulino the service was undescribable. The waiters all male made sure that I was okay and kept on asking how my food was. I didnt mind. I liked the attention. At least two of the waiters struck up a convo with me which i thought was nice since i was eating alone.The conceirge desk was helpful with getting me more info about the tours. The hotel staff outside (the ones getting you cabs) was extremely friendly, everytime I left the hotel and returned they always welcomed me back saying How was horse back riding?I was thinking in my head how could they remember that I went? I mentioned it to them briefly before I returned three hours later.Very attentive staff... Maids who arent even assigned to clean your room, say Hi and with a smile. You dont see that around alot...One thing i didnt really like was the Spa, mani and pedi was expensive and not really worth it. But I was going to get one even if it was expensive or not.Go there, Trust me you will NOT regret it.
