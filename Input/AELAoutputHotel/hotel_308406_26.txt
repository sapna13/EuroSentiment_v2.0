{"text":"Loved the Grand Mirage We stayed at the Grand Mirage for 3 weeks in Dec\/Jan 08. Overall we had a fantastic time. The rooms were great, very clean, and our view of the ocean was fantastic. As in other reviews, I agree with the seaweed on the ocean front, but the staff does its utmost to keep it clean for the guests. The Pool area was great, but they could use a few more deck chairs around the pool.The food ample and well done. The buffets were plentiful and there was sufficient selection throughout. the a la carte restaurant, La Cascata (Italian cuisine) was phenomenal and we ate there several times and enjoyed our meals thouroughly.As we stayed through Christmas\/New Year, the staff pulled out all the stops to ensure that everyone had a great time. The show for New Years was second to none in our travels. The Thallaso spa was also fantastic, both my wife and I went for a massage treatment and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The best thing that can be said about our whole Grand Mirage Experience was the staff. We have never encountered such a helpful, friendly staff in all of our travels. Everyone went the extra mile to ensure that we received the best possible care and all of our wants were addressed in a timely\/efficient and courteous manner. All I have to say about the staff, from the Manager down to the kitchen help, was that they were superlative! My wife and I travel extensively and in all our travels, we have never visited a hotel that possessed a staff of that caliber. Well done to all.The sights of Indonesia were also a joy, we visited many of the attractions from the Volcano, Rice terraces, Temples to elephant riding. All in all a fantastic time and I would recommend Bali, and the Grand Mirage to anyone. ","annotations":[]}
