{"text":"Excellent stay at Melia Benoa We have just returned from the Melia Benoa and had a great time. The staff were excellent and very friendly and extremely polite. If you wanted anything, you just had to ask. The hotel is located just outside the North Gate of Nusa Dua and has a free shuttle bus (every hour during the day) to the Bali Collection, a group of shops, restaurants and supermarket about 5 minutes away. The pool was lovely with a swim up bar and the grounds in the centre of the hotel had ponds with fish and fountains which was very picturesque. Our room (8159) on the first floor overlooked the gardens and was quite spacious with a small balcony. The rooms were clean, air conditioned and the hotel supplied 2 bottles of water in the room each day. The food was good. Plenty of choice for breakfast (fruit, toast, croissants, juice, freshly cooked ommelettes etc) and there was buffet lunch each day (but you could also choose from the a-la-carte menu when you wanted). There were buffets for eventing meals several times a week with a free cultural show (Barong dance, Balinese dancers etc), but you can order off the menu at any time for dinner as well. There is a 'posher' Italian restaurant restaurant too. The only problem with this one is that if you are on all inclusive blue, some of the choices were not available (without paying extra)! So plenty of choice on the food front! There is a pleasant bar near reception and you can have cocktails and most drinks that you want. The wine is basically Aussie red, white or rose from a box - so not the best place for wine buffs!  You can get on to the internet (to email etc) and you get 15 minutes free if you are an all-inclusive blue customer. After that it cost about √ä√£¬¢1.50 for 15 minutes on other occasions.  We had a massage at the hotel spa (prices can be bargained down from the advertised rates) which was very pleasant.There are plenty of sun beds by the pool and on the beach.   When the tide is in, the beach and sea looks lovely, but it's not quite so picturesque when it goes out. However, the sea is pretty safe for swimming and there are jetskis, wind surf boards etc to use. Next door to the hotel is a little market selling sarongs, T-shirts etcA taxi from the hotel to Kuta costs about $11(about √ä√£¬¢6). If you go outside and get a Blue taxi these are metered and it will cost you about 50,000 IRP (just over √ä√£¬¢4). There are millions of Taxis!We had a lovely stay at the Melia Benoa and would recommend it. All inclusive was a good choice here as there are not many places to eat right near the hotel (it's quite a quiet area). Also, I think that children may not find there is enough to do here. It's more geared to couples looking for a quiet break.
