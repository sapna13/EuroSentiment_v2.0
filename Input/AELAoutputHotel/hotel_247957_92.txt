{"text":"Good Trip To The Occidental Grand We stayed at the Occidental Grand in Punta Cana during the last week of Feb. 2008. We are three couples from Nova Scotia, Canada. We are all in our early to mid thirties. We booked through our travel agent here at home and we went via Air Transat Vacations. We booked  Premium Club, which was well worth the extra $$$. We had Rum and fruit plate in room upon arival, bath robes; slippers; turn-down service every night with some sort of treat included; and we recieved nightly beach towel exchange service in room. We had our own breakfest resto above the pool, which we only used once. We had reserved areas on the beach, which again, we didn't use. We had our own seperate check-in with welcome drinks. Porter service directly to our Premium Club Building with luggage delivered to our room. We had different color braclets for Transat Premium Club, which ment we were mostly all Canadians, and when you went to the bars, the bartenders would flip a glance at your braclet, and with a few $$$, they would come right to you, a few tips ($$$) would go a long way.We were in building 24, room 214, which was renovated. Absolutly no complaints with the room. Shower at its best was good, low pressure and not very hot, which is not unusual for Dominican. Mini fridge stocked daily with beer, pop, and water. Coffee maker, celing fan, cool air conditioning, safe ($$$), iron, hair drier, tv, patio and furnishings. In all, room wrer good.The grounds were kept in very good order. Gardeners working very hard every day mowing, trimming, weeding,etc... They also liked the beer we took to them that was out of sight and out of mind.There was some renovations going on during our stay as the resort in getting up there in age. Painting, carpentery, masionry,...etc. This wasn't bothersome at all. The resort is getting old, not old enough to complain about, but there is a lot of updates happening.There was plenty of room in the pools, one which has a swim up bar. We didn't spend much time there as we are beach people.Plenty of bars to choose from, although, during our stay, they were all quite bussy. (Flash some $$$). There is one close to the beach, one on the beach, one in the lobby, one at .........., see the pattern.The food was fair. We only ate at the buffet resto, as we rarely use the a-la-cartes. There was a fair amount of selection. You wont go hungary. Breakfast was our favorite ,as usual, good Canadian breakfast. Resto over swimm up bar served hots and hams, fries, onion rings, salads,.....etc if you are fussy for lunch.Great pizza up stairs for a late snack. (Recomended) Another buffet at beach bar for lunch also.The beach is  Playa Bavaro, what can I say, It's the best. 20 min walk to right is the famous markets, to the left, more resorts.Walk out the drive way 10 min, and your in town with more shopping. Perfectly safe in the day time for sure, although I would stay in a group.There is a disco that is open to the locals every night, we only went once as it opens a midnight and we are early people to rise and early to rest.In all, I would say this is a good resort for your money. I've been to many others, and this is not better, but as good.
