{"text":"ok hotel Just spend 5 days at the Palace in Madrid. During the day there was hammering from construction, which was a nuisance. Insulation of the walls is bad, one can hear the next room neighbours talk (or the TV sound). I got a Premium Room through the Starwood Member Program, but since this room was located at the 6th floor with rather small windows (seemingly all rooms on that floor have these window sizes), I asked to be downgraded to a Deluxe Room. I then received a room with a beautiful bay window and plenty of daylight on the 1st floor. This room was not renovated (the other was), but I preferred it and the difference to the renovated room was also marginal. Long corridors. Ask for a room close to the elevator. Not enough light for reading in bed, lamps on nightstands are not bright enough. Two lamps in the closet were broken and I asked for a repair, but that never happened although it was promised right away. When I arrived, I saw, that there were two lightbulbs broken in the chandelier in the main lobby. These were still broken, when I left.Water pressure in the shower is not constant, it gets stronger and weaker in intervals.Breakfast was ok. The offerings overall were, what can be expected from a better hotel. Good service. Cheerful and most helpful concierges. Location is good, if you want to go to the Prado, Reina Sofia or Thyssen museums. The good days from the Palace are over. Now it juggles unsuccessfully conventioneers with aspirations for fabulousness.
