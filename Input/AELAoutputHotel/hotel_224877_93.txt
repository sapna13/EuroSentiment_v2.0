{"text":"Could be much better We spent 2 weeks at the MO (12\/21-01\/03) and had many bad surprises, like a crowded pool and no seats at the beach (except if you tip the beach waiter to reserve it), what I think is totaly unacceptable when you're a guest.I saw for exemple many daybeds reserved for an entire day without anybody on them...and some clients could not enjoy the beach, ridiculous !Go for a deluxe bayview room, they are much nicer than the ones in the back of the hotel.Room service will charge you even a glass of milk for your baby (10 US $) if you don't make complaints to the manager.Service at the Cafe Sambal for breakfast is very good and the buffet too.Sushis are very expensive (almost 100 US $) for one party !There's a very good market on the island where you can eat or buy food and drinks. Read carefully each line of your check when you checkout, they tried to put 1500 US $ not due (like valet parking, mini bar, ...)If you want to get great service you have to make complaints every day about everything, and finally you forget about it, because you don't come for that and you're fed up.I think this is more a business hotel than a tourist hotel even if the clients are more tourists than business men, that's the reason why there's a small pool, a small artificial beach, small restaurants, small bar,...It is surely not mandarin oriental class !
