{"text":"The truth about the Waikiki Parc hotel ... This hotel is pitched to the cost-conscious, independent traveller who prefers a boutique style of hotel. The Waikiki Parc is a safe, clean hotel. The staff are extremely friendly and they go out of their way to make you feel at home. But the real beauty of this hotel is its location - it's a stones throw away from the new restaurant precinct, the beach and shopping strip. I have stayed at several of the five star hotels in Waikiki including the Royal Hawaiian and the Moana Surfrider and I believe this hotel is on par with them.The beds are comfortable, there is lots of natural light and the small lanais means you can enjoy some truly magical sunsets.But be warned that this hotel doesn't offer the same trimmings as some of its five-star counterparts; for instance, there are only about three items available through room-service and there is no mini-bar, as such. Whilst the Waikiki Parc's services are limited, the good news is that it relies on the Halekulani for things like room service, dry-cleaning so the standard is very good. The rooms do have a bar fridge which means you can stock your fridge with anything you desire (the ABC store is just round the corner).Like many hotels in Waikiki there is an issue with the noise (mostly back-up alarms) so it's probably not the best hotel if you are a late riser. The best room to book is the deluxe ocean view room (it is worth the extra expense) but make sure you ask for a room on a high floor on the right side of the hotel facing the ocean. The hotel has recently been refurbished. The foyer and the furnishings have been updated and the Nobu restaurant is a nice addition to the hotel.This hotel is great value for money.
