{"text":"Might as well just book a room at the Hilton Let me first start off by saying, yes, this hotel is in one of the seedier parts of town. However, anywhere in Downtown SF is going to be somewhat seedy. I booked a room here because they had mentioned that it was recently renovated..... Didn't see much of that. The rooms looked like it just had been re-painted. There were cracks in the molding, an old radiator heater that I've only seen on old TV shows, tiny bathroom, extremely tiny elevator that I wouldn't even take if I was going downstairs. However, the stairs weren't even that much better. Granted, I have somewhat big feet(size 13), but I felt like I could, slip off at any moment (and I wasn't even drinking!) Air circulation was horrible. The windows opened a massive 3 inches to a wonderful view of a brick wall and dark alley. When we checked in, I asked about the wireless internet access. He charged us the 9.95, but forgot to give me the password. Apparently his attention span is only 1 minute. Luckily we were only there for one night. We do not plan to EVER go to this hotel again, and suggest that no one ever stays here unless you've completely run out of options. If I have to give advice, suck up the extra money and stay at the Hilton. The Hilton is EXPONENTIALLY better in every aspect.Once again, DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!!!! It's cheaper for a reason.
