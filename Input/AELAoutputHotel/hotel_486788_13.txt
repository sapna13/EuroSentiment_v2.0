{"text":"Not a good choice Ok so after living on the island and having family there,reading the reviews didn't scare me that much. you are talking about a small island where the crime rates are high, and minimum wage is 5.15. as far as the neighborhood goes i personally knew what to expect from different parts of the island. you have to use your street smarts when traveling to puerto rico. don't get me wrong i love the island but there are nicer places to stay less than 5 minutes down the street that didn't have people hanging in the entryway in the middle of the night and just looked more safe and comfy. the staff was nice though. the room was very small and the whole 3 nights we stayed the sheets were not washed once so you could feel the gritty sand on the sheets. i could tell they were clean when we got there cuz you could smell the bleach. the elevator is small and very slow. the parkinglot behind the hotel wasn't great and i would never go out there alone at night. the ac didn't work all that great. they did clean up our rooms daily though but not the greatest. no bugs though! it wasn't horrible but it wasn't great. as a puerto rican american all i want to say is travel the island and enjoy it. it's a beautiful place. but if you're looking for a romantic,cozy get away for you and your partner then the coral by the sea isn't for you.
