{"text":"Awesome and so Relaxing I don't even know where to begin, my wife and I had such a great time at the Kahala. We went there on our honeymoon 5 years and knew we wanted to return for our 5th year wedding anniversary. I had made a reservation online and then confirmed it on the phone and requested a patio or lanai room overlooking the dolphin lagoon. When we checked in we were a shown to a room with a lanai that had a view of the ocean but the view was primarily overlooking the front entrance and the parking turnaround. I wrote a letter to the manager and dropped it off at the front desk the next morning. About 4 hours later, the hotel manager, Mr. Lee, called me apologized for any inconvenience and said to stop by the front desk and they would arrange for us to move to a room with a dolphin view and a lanai. I was very impressed with his response and how nice he was, and that he had a bellman waiting for us to help us with the move. All the people at the Kahala reflect that same helpful spirit, Ian and George who are waiters at the Plumeria on the breakfast shift go out of their way to make sure you have everything you need. Even while you are being seated they go to get your choice of beverage. Joy is the hostess at Plumeria and she truly is a joy, trying to make everyone feel welcome. If you need anything at the beach there is man named, Lloyd, who will help you with anything you need and at the restaurant Hoku's our waitress was a woman named ,Iris, and she very helpful and nice as well. One night we went out for dinner at the original Roy's and we were pleasantly surprised when the manger, Zameer, remembred us. He used to be a restaurant manager at the Kahala and remembered when we were there for our honeymoon 5 years ago. He immediately made us feel we were at his house and not at a restaurant. I highly recommed the original Roy's. The weather was perfect while we were there. Early November seems to be a downtime at the hotel as well. It was so peaceful and relaxing. They were still finishing up a little construction work but I imagine it will be finished by the time their Christmas rush arrives. The new beds they had were absolutely incredible. My wife and I were sad that it had taken us 5 years to get back to the Kahala and will hopefully make our next visit in a shorter amount of time.
