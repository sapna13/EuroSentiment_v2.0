{"text":"Will eventually be a Dream I just returned from a week at Dream Punta Cana, this was my 3rd time in Punta Cana. Each other time we stayed at the Riu Palace Punta Cana, which is a gorgeous resort. This time around we went for a wedding. Resort- Is beautiful, it is covered with palm trees, and has one of the largests pools i have even seen. The pool travels throughout the resorts, which is good because the only really loud part is closer to the beach by the pool bar. So you can party or escape to a more quiet part of the pool. They are still renovating the property, so you will see men working in the yard all over the place. However they are doing it to better the resort, and dont get in the way for the most part. Rooms- Are nice, we had a four poster king size bed. Beds are hard, but confortable. Washrooms have bathtub with shower, but its kinda strange because they dont have shower curtains, its a glass window that doesnt cover the entire bath. So water gets all over the floor. Again, not a huge deal. Food- The buffet was ok, we only went twice. This resort had MANY a la carte restaurants! First come first serve basis! which is nice, we didn't have to wait for anything! Make sure you go to the Japanese! its the best of all of them! French was no bad, but not good, and Mexican  Italian were also just ok! They have 24 hour room service if you miss a meal, or want to eat in your room! Its great, and very convenient! Service-Was either really good or really bad. I noticed that the bar served men first, and you got better service if you had cash in your hand everytime. If you gave them a $5, they DID NOT remember you the next time around. You had to pay for service each time. Which was terrible. Piano Bar- They have this guy come in on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday night, he is hilarious! Adults only entertainment, and so worth putting the kids to bed! dont miss him! Wedding- We had a perfect day, and the wedding coordinator was excellent! They set the beach up for the ceremony, and the terrace up for the reception. Food was ok, but cold, I don't think they were equipped for a party the size of our (90 people) a few people got sick from the food. Could have been bad seafood, or too much to drink... Drinks at this resort are great, they have mixture, and premium alcohol. The resort was over booked, and half way through the week they were asking people to move to another resort to make room for the new group coming in. They had also run out of towels at one point, Front desk told me I would have to wait until after 9 to get clean towels. (Maybe if they didn't waste 2 towels in each room making towel art...)BEWARE of Terantulas! We seen a few, try to request your room is not on the ground floor, 2 people from our group found them in their rooms! Beach here is really nice, the sand is soft, and the water is warm. This resort has a long way to come before they can live up to the new Dream Reputation. We had a nice time, I would not return here, or recommend this resort.
