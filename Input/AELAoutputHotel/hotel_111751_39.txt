{"text":"Opulent and exclusive We knew we were in for a special experience when the GPS (sat nav) directed us off Sunset Boulevard and through the gates into the secluded enclave of Bel-Air. Driving up Stone Canyon Road one glimpses impressive mansions nestled behind huge manicured hedges.It is hard to believe when you enter the property that the overladen freeways and heavily built up suburbia of Los Angeles are only a short distance away. The low scale of the hotel nestled in the canyon provides a sense that you are in a tropical resort.Our stay was only one night, in January, yet we were lucky to enjoy sunny blue skies and balmy warm temperatures.We arrived at the hotel around noon and received a warm welcome from reception and immediate access to the room. The room was a deluxe guest room with a terrace and wood burning fireplace. Due to the warm temperature we unfortunately never lit the fire. The room was small, yet cosy, and newly refurbished. During the night we opened up the doors to the terrace and enjoyed the fresh air of the canyon and silence.The room was quite a distance from reception, however, we loved the walk past the beautifully manicured gardens, restaurants and pool area. There appeared to be only a handful of guests at the hotel compared with the many friendly staff bustling along the access ways. Due to the design of the hotel it may well have been full with the majority of the guests rarely leaving their suites.On both days we chose to have lunch by the pool rather than the busy outdoor restaurant. Again we almost had the whole area to ourselves not to mention a bevy of waiters keen to please. After a couple of weeks visiting family we found our stay at the Bel-Air to be one of total relaxation. A special treat. ","annotations":[]}
