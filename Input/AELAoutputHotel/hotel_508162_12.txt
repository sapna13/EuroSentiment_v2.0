{"text":"More than what I expected Our family group of 7 just returned from Dreams Punta Cana and we just loved our stay.We had read a lot of reviews and wore not so sure, since some wore a bit scary. But take it from a us,(we are very picky travelers) you will enjoy it. Not only did we have a great experience during our flight (Sunwing Vacations), but the resort was increadible.The grounds are very clean, well maintained, well staffed, and strickly run.Our rooms wore in excellent condition, clean sheets everyday.The towels wore stocked twiece daily. The fridge was keep full with pop and beer everyday.The restaurants are well staffed as well, keep in mind that these are restaurants and just like back home expect to get the portions that you would if you wore to dine at a fine restaurant. We tried everyone expect the Bourdou because we did not have proper attier for the restaurant. One that is very popular is El Patio (mexican) Make sure you get there early or be ready to wait.But our favorite was the World Cafe. It has a great variety of food for all. For those who complaint about the choices; you should stay home our cook your own meal. You can not say that you go hungry because thae amount of food and variety available is unreal. They even have a Kids Buffet Area with kid's favorites.The pools is awesome very long, cleaned everyday and kid friendly; our 6 yr old daughter was able to go everywhere (standing) without a life jacket. While we are at the pool, there would always be staff askinging if we wanted drinks. The beach was keep clean and staff would walk about to make sure that every was ok. At the beach there is a BBQ stand were there is always hot dogs and hamburgers and fresh fruit and pop for those who want a lite bite. The is plenty of chairs and also the gigantic beds on the beach are for anyone to use.The entertainment staff is the best. Great shows and audience participation\/incentive (dreams money\/prices) for those who win the games. Our favorite entertainer was Micky Mouse, great guy and very friendly toward the kids.We really enjoyed our stay and can recomend it to anyone.The only thing I recomend is that you take more than enough US money, because the is no cash advance features on site and the some bank will not accept foreign credit cards or debit cards either.  Overall excellent resort and defenite well deserved reatings ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1679,"mention":"hot dogs","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hot_dog"],"startOffset":1671},{"endOffset":1694,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1684},{"endOffset":1744,"mention":"lite","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Miller_Lite"],"startOffset":1740}]}
