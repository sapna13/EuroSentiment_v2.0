{"text":"Central Located for Amsterdam Sights Stayed here for 2 nights visiting a friend in Amsterdam, overall a good standard 4 star hotel with feather beds and a cosy (smallish) room with plenty of facilities. As it is situated on a busy road - trams, bikes and cars - I would advise asking for a quiet room at the back of the hotel - 501 was great romantic room and of course if you require a non- smoking you must request. Non-smoking is only in the breakfast room and some guest rooms (22 Euros each for breakfast was expensive we thought, so popped round the corner to a great non-smoking coffee opposite the church and directly opposite the tulip hotel.Room - clean, tv, writing desk, minibar, robe, slippers, large bathroom with good shower and toiletries, kettle with tea\/coffee etc plus free bottle of water on arrival,24 hr room service. Iron and board on request and anything else you may have needed!5-10 mins walk from train station, we only had one case so was fairly easy, they did offer us to store luggage once you check out and want to sight see. Staff - friendly and very helpful. 5 mins to Dam Square and Amsterdam overall was easy to walk around, most shops don't open until 11-12 so it seems quiet in the back streets!In De Waag - Neuwemarket - Fab restaurant - ate there 2 nights - fairly pricey but very worth it, red meat, vegetarian and yummy deserts. Great atmosphere, if you want a romantic meal best asking for one of their quiet corners at the end of the restaurant it also caters for large parties and is worth booking in advance.Trams, cars and bikes makes crossing the roads a bit of a challenge so keep you eyes peeled, few near misses!!!! Cold and wet in January so unless you have to I'd wait for the spring, bit like most european places!!!
