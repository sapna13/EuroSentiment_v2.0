{"text":"Nice design I stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in the end of August 2008. The room was a executive floor room on the 29th floor, with a nice view of the Sydney skyline. Included in the rate was breakfast at the Westin Club. The location is certainly central. Placed in the middle of Pitt street, it's a 5 minute walk to the harbour. It IS a central business district style location, and not touristy, but i preferred it that way.The hotel is part of the huge Martin Place 1 highrise, which also features the main post office (historic building), super markets, shops and offices. The lobby and reception area is nice. and modern and well lit. There is a lot of people in the lobby area at all times.Checkin was quick and easy. No problems. There seems to be lines at the usual check-in and check-out times, but I arrived very early, so that wasn't a problem for me. As part of the room charge, they allowed early check-in (7 in the morning), so that was great.The room was nice. The design is obviously contemporary which I personally prefer. The build quality and look\/feel of the recent renovation, wasn't really that great. In the details, there are certainly room for improvement. Bathroom fixtures mounted a bit crooked, mended paint jobs, a spot of mold in the shower, etc. I mean, honestly, they are small points. TV worked good, reception was good, some pixelation once in a while on the cable\/satellite feed. Lighting system was among the best I have seen, very easy to use, and well marked. The bed was sort of a mixed experience. I noticed the gentleman on this site, who mentioned he couldn't get a nights sleep in the bed - I sort of agree. The bed is very very soft. If you are used to a firm bed, it will be complicated getting used to. Also, it seems that one matress was firmer than the other, im not sure if this is by design, or because one has seen more use. The curtain between the bathroom and room was a cute novelty detail.Internet connection was wired only. They provide a (short) cable in the room. Phone system was easy, as everything goes to a call center sort of function, and that was brilliant - instead of the usual 8 numbers you have to call.Cleaning was sort of ok. The first day I arrived the floor was dirty because someone had installed\/repaired something in the vicinity of the TV system. so there was little white bubbles from the electronics wrapping + some screws and a loose jumper on the floor. Sunday cleaning never happened, as the staff left early, but monday cleaning was much better. No fresh flowers. Anemities are simple and not really luxurious in any way.Room service food was poor. I tried 3-4 different dishes and they were pretty sad. Even the classic room service burger had low quality meat, dry, boring and tasteless. The complimentary water appeared on two out of five days. The minibar was replenish 3 times. Room service and minibar prices were OK compared to the location and country. I guess the real question here is - is this a 4 star hotel or a 5 star? I'd say its a upper end 4 star. And at that it's good. It's no where near international 5 star level. Prices are fair - so take it for what it is. :) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":141,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":137},{"endOffset":223,"mention":"Club","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Club_sandwich"],"startOffset":219},{"endOffset":2353,"mention":"white","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/White_bread"],"startOffset":2348},{"endOffset":2727,"mention":"burger","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":2721}]}
