{"text":"Beautiful Hotel..small areas of improvement First of all this is a beautiful hotel and I would completely agree with the other reviews. The rooms are gorgeous and the beds are so comfertable. The bathroom is gorgeous and so is the remainder of the property. The concierge is so helpful make sure you get your taxis through them and do not flag down a taxi. They provide you with nice cars and the rates seemed like the were the same price and in some cases less than the cabs on the street. If you need to be picked up take a card from the concierge and call them again to pick you up. The front desk staff was a huge dissapointment. They were snooty and taxing to deal with. We got put in a room that was right above the construction and since we were on vacation we didnt want to wake up early but had no choice since they wouldnt move us. Additionaly our curtains had to be drawn the entire time since the workers literally waved at us when they were open. So if you go ask for a room away from the pool construction. Additionaly REVIEW YOUR BILLS CAREFULLY..there were errors on our bill including a $18 forced tip for housekeeping. It was a fight with the front desk to resolve. The breakfast buffet is divine especially on Sunday dont miss it..Stay away from the Med. restaurant La Griglia it is horrible. The bar is wonderful in the lobby too.
