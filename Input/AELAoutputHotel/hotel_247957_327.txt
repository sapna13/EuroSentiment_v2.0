{"text":"Fabulous Holiday I have just returned from this hotel after a fantastic two week holiday. I have to say after reading the majority of reviews on this website I was extremely worried. All I can say is TAKE NO NOTICE OF THESE BAD REVIEWS. The following are just a few points I want to raise to counter-argue people's false accusations:1) To say the staff do not speak English is rubbish. The staff were polite and attentive. I, as an English speaker find it only polite and common courtesy to say the odd few words in Spanish which the staff really appreciated. The staff are after all human and should not be treated as slaves as I witnessed by some of the hotels guests.2) The rooms are perfectly adequate. The beds were really comfortable and there was plenty of lit wardrobe space. The rooms are particularly spacious and I always had hot water.3) It is true that the safety deposit box cost $30. However, I have no complaints to pay this money as the contents I put in the box are worth a lot more than that.4) I honestly cannot believe what some people have written about the food. The breakfast is possibly the best I have ever seen. There is everything from American style pancakes and crepes to freshly made smoothies. Lunch again is super. I strongly recommend the beach restaurant for lunch which provides a full buffet and also serves pizza, pasta, burgers, chicken, fish etc. The snack bar was great for those who wanted fast food. The buffet restaurant on the evening was super with lots of variety and constantly replenished. I have stayed in many all-inclusive hotels and always had to book for al-a-carte restaurants so I do not find the fact that you have do so at this hotel out of the ordinary. The Oriental is amazing and the Brazilian was pretty good too. My least favourite was the Italian and did feel the pasta in the buffet was better cooked. Throughout my two week stay neither myself or any of my party suffered from bad stomach which after hearing many stories on my flight home cannot be said about many other hotels in Punta Cana.5) The staff are constantly cleaning. After a short sharp shower the staff were out sweeping up the water. The pools were cleaned every morning and I can only assume those who comment that this was never done only ever surfaced after 9:00am.The beach is stunning and there is something for everyone. The entertainment was fantastic and the hotel have their own band. I would definitely recommend this hotel.
