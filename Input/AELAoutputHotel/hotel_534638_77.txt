{"text":"Sofitel: sun, sand and sooo relaxing! After much deliberation we choose the Sofitel to stay during our last 2 weeks on Bali. We stayed there from 16 September to 1 October 2006. We were a little bit hesitant after reading some of the reviews on this website but as the location of the hotel is exactly what we wanted and we could get a good deal ($125 p. night including breakfast for a deluxe room) we booked it anyway. We had already been traveling around Bali for 2 weeks and this was to be the √à?√¨relax√à?√¨ part of our holiday. We arrived in the evening and were very impressed by the enormous lobby with its beautiful orchid arrangements. Check-in was very relaxed with a welcome drink and a cold towel and very courteous.The room, nr 323, was very beautiful with nice colours, fresh flowers and a welcome fruitplatter. There was enough room in drawers and cupboards (and we had to do some improvising in other five star hotels p.e. in Thailand). The bathroom was also good, with a separate shower stall. The windows and balcony offered a view of the sea (though interrupted by trees). We had no problems with the airconditiioning.The grounds of the hotel are really beautiful with flowers everywhere, ponds, bridges and a second, hidden pool. The main swimmingpool is large and very comfortable with nice sunloungers and umbrellas. Near the beach they have double sunloungers: very nice to relax with your significant other!The breakfast is delicious with a choice of fresh juices and the a la carte dishes (included in the price) are really special: p.e. the pancakes with strawberries in schezuan pepper milk, or the poached eggs provencale. The buffet itself is also very good with lots of choice in fruits, pastries, breads, cereals and eastern hot dishes.We had dinner twice and lunch once in the hotel as the prices are really high, more than European, but the quality of the food is excellent. But almost every evening we had cocktails at the poolbar and they are very good.We really do not understand some of the reviews on this site about the staff. During our stay the staff was wonderful: always smiling, knowing us by name and very attentive. Balinese people have a good sense of humor and the staff is no exception. However, they take their jobs very seriously and will do everything to make your stay comfortable, from the gardeners to the duty managers.The hotel offers a free shuttle bus to Kuta 5 times a day and we used it a few times: always on time and a nice service.The location of the hotel is very quiet: right on the beach and not near the restaurants and bars of Seminyak. Its quiet location was one of the reasons we choose this hotel.For dinner we always took a taxi to a restaurant in Kuta or Seminyak. We can recommend Rumours, Zanzibar, Ryoshi (for the food, not for the service!), Trattoria and of course Gado Gado wich is next to the Sofitel. We had a wonderful stay in Sofitel Seminyak and are seriously thinking of going there again next year!
