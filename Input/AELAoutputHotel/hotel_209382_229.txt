{"text":"Pricey for what it was We arrived at the Millenium UN plaza after a long journey from Glasgow in Scotland and had 2 cancelled flights. We were looking forward to a swim and some nice food when we arrived. It was quite late when we arrived and the airline had lost our luggage so we asked for some tooth brushes and toothpaste but just received combes. That was a little dissapointing for a $400 a night hotel. We enquired about breakfast iun the morning and found out it was $17 a head per helping of food. WOW!. The hotel is sourrounded by nice little cafes which are much better valur than the hotel and the food is better. The room service was $75 dollas for 3 standard meals and of them were just starters and they didnt come as it said they would pon the menu with bits missing and not very hot.ything free it is $9 for a 450ml bottle of water! If you are looking to eat in the hotel you are looking at app. $100 per day per person. The location is not bad about 20mins walk from times square and 25 mins from maceys. The grand hyatt hotel is 2 mins from times square and a higher class hotel and the rooms are at least $50 dollars cheaper than the millenium. The millenium looks good online but it is not as good as described. Dont go unless you are not bothered about spending a fortune. I went expecting to pay $249 per night flor the room only afor 3 nights and they put some extra charges in which you are not told about and i ended up spending almost $2000 for the room alone.
