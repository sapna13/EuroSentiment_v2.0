{"text":"Wonderful hotel if you are on the club floors I stayed at the Intercontinental Grand Stanford for two weeks while working in Hong Kong. I had a wonderful time. I arrived at the airport tired and bad tempered after the flight from Seoul, and went to their courtesy desk in the arrivals hall. They seated me in a hotel limo and away I went with no delay. The check-in was smooth and courteous (even deferential). I stayed on the club floor with a harbor view (which was incredible). The hotel is not flashy\/glitzy, but is rather elegant in an understated kind of way. There are two very good fine dining restaurants in the basement level and a public bar on the lobby level which seemed very lively and fun.You should stay on the club floor. They have a cocktail hour every day at 6pm - 8:30pm. If you ask for a glass of champagne, they crack open a bottle of Veuve Cliquot Ponsardin!!!! You can keep drinking the glasses of champagne for 2 hours, and the club lounge steward will keep cracking open those bottles.....The club lounge has three rooms (one 'library' one sitting room, and one dining room\/bar room). They are at the top of the hotel and overlook the harbor. In July 2007 they are due to open a new, larger and grander club lounge.....Concierge service is efficient (even at getting cabs in rainstorms!!) and the hotel has an ample fleet of cars for the use of club guests.There is a wonderful informal buffet\/restaurant on the mez. level that does good meals (I tried it for breakfast, lunch and dinner and it was always very good). It can get crowded for weekend brunch (locals go there a lot) but they seat hotel guests first, so it isn't a problem....There is a ferry pier right outside the hotel with a speed ferry that goes to the Central piers every 20 mins, so if you don't feel like walking along the waterfront to Star Ferry, you can just use the one outside the hotel. There is also a large open air shopping area accross Mody Rd so there are convenience stores, pharmacies, etc all nearby. This was a relief to me since I had been on the road nearly a month by the time I arrived at Hong Kong.When it came time for me to leave HK, the club lounge reception arranged for me to keep my room until 7pm. At 7pm I went to the club lounge and the staff there sent bell boys to collect my luggage, then they sent for a receptionist to bring me my bill which was presented to me while I was sitting on a couch in the library sipping champagne and looking at the harbor view. Finally, when I was ready to leave, they called the front desk and had a car waiting for me at the hotel door.I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone.
