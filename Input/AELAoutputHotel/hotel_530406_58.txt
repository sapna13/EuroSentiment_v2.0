{"text":"Awesome stay at the Ocean First of all this was my first trip in the Dominican, we stayed at the Ocean sand me and my gf my sister was staying at the Ocean blue from the 6th to the 13 th of April 2008 . The resort looks very nice I would say even more then on picture. I was impress by the immaculate ground over there Check in\/out : Very quick we arrived there at night took us 2 minutes to get our keys and we were ready to go.It is normal ifyou arrived on a bus with a big group of people that it will be a bit longer.Rooms: large and very nice did not had anything missing or broken in my room, each room has a safe the bathroom is pretty nice also villa 10 and 6 are the one closest to the beach It depend what you want ,to be closer to the beach or closer to the lobby area\/a la carte restaurant and buffet.Buffet: There is 2 one close to the lobby witch is very good lots of choices and another one close to the beach witch is a bit less choices but still good.A la carte restaurant : No reservation everytime I went around 1825 never had to wait to eat , I went to the Mexican, Italian , route 66 witch is probably the one I though was the worst all the other one were great , good service , good food. For the men the Italian , the Dominican and the El bodegon you have to wear long pants.Bars: they have a lots of bar on the resort if you tip I am not going to lie it helps a lot one of those is the sports bar witch is open till 6AM with snack available after 2300 the Lobby is very nice with a big bar and always music played at night. Bars by the pool is also good but I did not like the fact that little kids were in the pool were the swim up bar is there is a lots of pool to take them.Beach: Very nice a lot of sun chairs never had to worried about it.Entertainment: plenty of stuff to do on the resort the Team at the ocean sand\/blue is simply awesome there is show every night at Showtime lots of game to play by the pools.Finally I would recommend this resort to everybody because it has a lot to offer the staff is very friendly the resort is simply beautifull. I do not understand people complaining about the resort I had an awesome stay there from day 1 to day 7 and I will be back next year for sure.
