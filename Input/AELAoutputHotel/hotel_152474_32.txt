{"text":"Again, a great experience I have written several positive TripAdvisor reviews for Hotel Catedral, having visited since 1993.I was there again last month and would say everything all over again. The administration of this hotel is far beyond negative comment. The location, the restaurant, and the cleanliness of the rooms, cannot be challenged. Add to that the fact that many staff remember and welcome me, and I am home again!If you want to see the heart of Mexico City (or go anywhere else by Metro, which is nearby), and do not need pampering (pool, jacuzzi, etc.), this is the place. Hotel Catedral does not pretend to be a resort or anything other than what it is. It is an affordable and clean place with easy access to the wonders of Mexico City, some of which are within a block of the hotel.The restaurant, which first drew me into this place in 1993 with its sign while I was walking on the street, is superb. After that accidental introduction, I learned from a friend in Mexico City that it was a place to go for lunch for downtown workers. I saw that again this time. Your restaurant\/bar experience will be shared with many locals, including people from the government if you want to converse with them. In December, my breakfast included eleven choices.Does Hotel Catedral pretend to be gourmet or cutting edge? No! Actually, I would say that it is gourmet without pretension.Check the price, decide whether you need glitz and glamour, and, again, check the price and location. ","annotations":[]}
