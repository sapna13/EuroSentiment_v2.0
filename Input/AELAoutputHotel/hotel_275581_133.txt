{"text":"Third visit to this lovely hotel - excellent as always This was my third visit to the city inn - and I will be returning again in the summer. Stayed on the weekend March 14th-16th.As always, service was top notch, staff extremely friendly and helpful especially Paula at reception who ensured I had a wonderful stay since it was my Birthday.We have stayed in both a suite and a club room both packages are excellent value for money. I love the club package because of the late check out at 4pm √à√\u2020\u2022?it means you can have a good rest before you check out.The rooms are extremely modern and clean. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat in the restaurant this time but have done on previous occasions the steak was lovely. We had breakfast in bed and found the charge to be reasonable given the fact that some hotels charge double the fee.The hotel is in a wonderful location √à√\u2020\u2022?and placed right next to the Tate Briton, Westminster and the houses of parliaments are also very near by, if you are fit its also well placed for a Buckingham palace, Leicester Square and downing street which can be reached by foot within one hour √à√\u2020\u2022?its especially nice to have a walk by the river which is just 5 mins away.What makes this hotel the best is the staff who are so helpful and genuinely want to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Its like staying at a five star but without the price tag. The bar is lovely as well √à√\u2020\u2022?some of the best cocktails in town!! Loved the heel kick have to come back for more.Would recommend this hotel for a weekend break in London.
