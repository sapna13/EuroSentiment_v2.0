{"text":"Terrific location Just returned from three night stay at HCC Montblanc.Could not have a better, more convenient location for wanting to do alot in a short time. Very easy to get to from the airport using the Aerobus to Pl Catalunya. Cost 3.75E at machine right outside door of arrivals hall. Bus every 10 minutes. Can also purchase ticket on board if you have correct change. Machine accepts Visa\/MC etc cards. Hotel is less than5 minute walk from drop off point but not in the middle of the hustle bustle of the major shopping area.Hotel is located on a busy street. If street noise (and it is a noisy street) will be an issue, ask for room at the back. Pleasant lobby area. There was an error in rooms assignment for our group but they quickly, pleasantly made necessary adjustment - everyone was happy.Room was very clean, pleasantly decorated, nothing WOW but more than met our needs. Actually more than we needed - never used the exercycle in the room. Weather was very warm and so was room. A\/C turned off for winter season. We just opened the window for ventilation (room on 6th floor so security not an issue). Even with windoe open, street noise not bothersome. Heard lots of church bells and bords but didn't distrub our sleeping.Roomy bathroom. Very nice big bath towels. The shower curtain takes some finagling to ensure you don't wash the floor when you wash yourself. In room safe. Internet available in lounge area. Request password at front desk.Excellent cold breakfast buffet. Even Cava for those needing a little sparkly to get your day going. Breads, meats, cheeses, cereals, fresh and preserved fruits (excellent melons), local specialties (tortilla, Catalan bread), really good coffee, yoghurt, sweet breakfast pastries. More than ample selection. While no hot foods (other than toasts), if you can't get your fill here, I'm not certain you can be satisfed.There is a piano bar and restaurant in hotel but we did use. Small swimming pool open in season (could have been this weekend - it was warm!).We walked everywhere we went (Picasso and Xocolata Museums, Sagrada Familia, Casas Mila  Batilo, Cathedral, Musica Palau, Las Ramblas, Bari Gotic, Born neighborhood, harbor) except for a bus to Parc Guell. Probably could have walked there too but time was beginning to close in. Very good dining options in small neighborhood places going away from the touristy Las Ramblas. Seldom werethe menus in English but we did well with VERY rudimentary Spanish and polite requests for help from the locals.All in all, a very good quick visit.
