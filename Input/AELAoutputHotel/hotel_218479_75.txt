{"text":"Wouldn't Recommend It wE JUST GOT BACK FROM THERE ON jAN.12 .iF YOU DON'T SPEAK SPANISH YOU CAN'T DISCUSS HARDLY ANYTHING AS THEY HARDLY SPEAK A WORD OF ENGLISH. Our tour operator rep was great though. If you want service this isn't the place to go. The workers hardly ever smiled or acknowledged you unless you spoke first (a friendly hola even would be nice) they never gave hardly any service in any of the restauants. The beach bar was the best place to get drinks but you had to get your own most of the time unless you tip heavy i was told. They also don't speak much english so make sure what you are getting. The beach is very nice with its white sand and the reefs to break the waves. Very good for swimming and sunning. Lots of loungers. Rooms were very average and if you want service every day we had to hang out or sign.Hit and miss if you don't.Mexican restaurant only place to get something eat at times. Restaurant opening and buffet times lousey hours.Mexican riviera was twice as good except for beach. Friendliness would go a long way to improve rhis resort and a little english lessons for some of the staff. When you fly into Punta Cana airport also be ready for a step back in time.You have to walk off the plane onto the tarmack in then stand in line to get into the so called terminal. Overall don't go here unless you are used to below average places and only want to sun and drink without much service.
