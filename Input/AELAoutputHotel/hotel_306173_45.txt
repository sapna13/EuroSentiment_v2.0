{"text":"Could have been better... I was told the hotel was the number 1 in all of asia but was shocked to find out that all these was far from number 1. I arrived on an evening flight after a long time on the plane from london to be greeted by lazy bellman and cold receptionist. It was a totally blown off experience. The bellman was not carrying my bags properly and my toiletries came falling out of my bag. The receptionist was terrible. Didnt even looked at me while handling my check-in formalities. During the stay, I asked for directions to the train station as I was rather interested to find out more about singapore's underground system. I approach this tall duty manager who had an english name but looked indian to me. He wasnt very helpful and brushed me off as he was busy on his cell before handing me over to a malay girl who's english i couldnt understand. Luckily there was this staff who could help me and he showed me the way to the train station. As i was pretty much disturbed, I did not take down the gentleman's name. It was later upon my return to the hotel in the evening that I realized he was a security staff. as told by the concierge that the security staff wore grey. I am grateful to that staff who helped me out of that situation. If it was not for him, I would not even think of visiting the fullerton. Front office services were really bad but at least there were other staff who showed that they care. Hope that I would not have to face the same cold services again on my next trip.
