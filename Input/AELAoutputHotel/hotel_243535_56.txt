{"text":"The Fusion is the place to stay when in San Fran! I booked a vacation trip to San Francisco in the middle of September, and I was desperate to find a nice place to rest while visiting. After reading horror stories of hotels in the vicinity, The Fusion stood out from the rest. Since my apartment was being sprayed for bedbugs, the last thing I wanted to see was anything crawling in my hotel room, other than myself. I was not disappointed. The Fusion was prompt and courteous during check-in, and I was in my room no more than 15 minutes after my arrival. The room I got had a twin bed in it, and was on the 2nd floor. The bed was clean, smelled good, and had clean sheets. That was my first concern. After sitting in the room for about 30-45 minutes, I didn't notice a single thing wrong with it at all, nor did I see anything else in the room with more than two legs. If you are staying for more than a couple of days, I would advise putting the Do Not Disturb sign on the door immediately upon entering the room, and keep it there until check-out, to avoid anything mysteriously coming up missing in your room. I am just paranoid like that, but believe me, it works! Check-out was just as prompt and courteous, but as a note to fellow travelers; please consider doing your own research on where to go and what to do ahead of time, to avoid being disappointed, or disturbing the nice employees at The Fusion. While i'm sure they'd be more than helpful, the internet is the most valuable resource for the out of town traveler. Do yourself a favor, and print up an agenda of where you're going, along with plenty of maps, and you will enjoy yourself 100 times more!!! I love The Fusion, and I will be coming back again.Derek Jordan ","annotations":[{"endOffset":154,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":150},{"endOffset":154,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":150},{"endOffset":154,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":150},{"endOffset":1386,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1382}]}
