{"text":"3rd Time The Best Riu Palace Macao September 02 √à√\u2020\u2022?09, 2007Three couples from Detroit using Apple Vacations and USA3000:Flights: On time with no problems. I knew beforehand that USA3000 had changed their meal policy and now charged $5.00 for a snack box.Customs  Immigrations: No problems, with our bags coming within minutes of us arriving at the carousel.Transportation: When we arrived at our bus we were told we would be stopping first at one of the Barcelos and then the Palace Macao and the Riu Bambu. The driver, fortunately for us, missed the turnoff for the Barcelo, so the Palace Macao was first. Our return bus showed up on time and we were some of the first people for our flight dropped off at the airport.Check-in: There were only the six of us checking in at the Macao. We were given our bracelets and then told to come back in a couple of hours to get our room keys. They did give us our room #s though, so after a drink at the lobby bar we went to check out our rooms. We found they had given us three rooms on the main floor overlooking the back of Caribbean Street. I had emailed the hotel ahead of time and got very nice responses back from the asst. hotel director. This was our 3rd trip to the Macao and had requested rooms in the center of the building overlooking the pool.We went back to the front desk and told them the problem and then the reception manager gave us three rooms exactly where we requested. Before dinner this first day the asst. hotel director found us in the bar and asked how the rooms were. He seemed surprised when I told him my story and he then said of course you are in a suite, no (I am a Gold Card member)? I said no, but we were happy with our room and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ want to change.Weather: It rained one evening while at dinner and then one morning for about 15 minutes, which drove us from the beach to the pool bar to wait it out. The temperature was very warm, with high humidity, but there was always a nice breeze off the ocean. Around the pool it was very warm.Food  Drinks: This trip we ate all our dinners at the buffet. They still keep to the two seatings rule with men required to wear long pants. This was not much of a problem as the dining room has a\/c. We found the food to be good as in past trips. We ate most of our lunches at the Caribe Grill, which is directly on the beach. We also ate once at the Pizzeria, but for some reason that day they had no pizza.We always spent our days on the beach directly next to the beach bar, under one of the umbrellas. Very good location for drinks and there are restrooms in the Caribe Grill close by. The water was very warm and very mild √à√\u2020\u2022?no undertow and no waves. The water was very clear.Other: We walked over to the Punta Cana Palace a couple of times after dinner. They allow Riu guests to walk around, but will not serve them if you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e not a guest of the PCP. The lobby is very nice (and cool).That√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ about it. We all enjoyed our stay and are looking forward to a return visit.
