{"text":"Not bad, and cheap! I visited the hotel in december with my boyfriend and my parents. We arrived friday and stayed for the weekend. Wen we arrived the reception staff were very helpful and assisted to us rite away. They also said they had tried to get us rooms as close as possible (this being the same floor, around 2 corners, but luckily we wern't too bothered).The hotels location is excellent we couldnt have hoped for better, litrally 2 seconds from Dam square and the same from pubs and restaurants and about 30 seconds from the nearest coffee shop if your looking for that sort of thing.The rooms themselves were clean and well kept. It appeared to us that all the rooms were smoking rooms, but luckily you couldnt smell anything in any of our rooms. Occasionally you could smell it in the corridors but well this is Amsterdam an its legal so i guess you could get that in any hotel.The corridors as other people have mentioned are a little problem, you can hear everything in your room. But well it didnt spoil our sleep. Breakfast was included in the stay and wasnt bad compared to some i have been offered. The staff were quick in filling up the empty plates etc as an when they were empty. There wasnt a huge choice but i have found that quite common in european city hotels.The hotel was great for the money tho. If your looking for cheap, central and a good nights sleep this is the perfect place to stop.
