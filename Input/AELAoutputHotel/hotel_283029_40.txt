{"text":"Beautiful hotel, great stuff and location We come to the hotel for 5 days and 4 nights, 4-8 of July.The hotel is cozy and beautiful, as if some one accommodate you in his own house. The stuff is excellent and very welcoming, helping, guiding and always smiling.Rooms are very beautiful and designed.For me, the problem was that the rooms are too small (and I'm talking about the king executive rooms) which made me feel a little in claustrophobic. We had a room with balcony which made the situation a little better.My suggestion, if you do care about the room size, is to take the king executive rooms in the second floor, without balcony, but with much larger space in the room itself (Room number 30). I must say as well, that my wife really liked the room in spite of its size. The location is beautiful, very quit on one hand and very close to the laidsplain on the other hand (3 minutes walking distance).I personally, love to seat in my room, to look out, and to live the city what you can not do here.On the other hand, if you need a quit place after a busy day to relax and in the same time to be very close to the main events, this is the place to come to.I ordered directly with the hotel and not through any internet site and got a much better rate then all the sites offered.I recommend this hotel and think it is a wonderful place to be at during your visit in Amsterdam ","annotations":[]}
