{"text":"Very average hotel I actually spent a day at this hotel , visiting my ex-husband when he was in town...I cannot believe people who reviewed this hotel expected so much! The price for most nights is average $165 and it is , after all, a 3.5 star hotel! given that Sydney is not that cheap (to stay in or near the city centre) I am not sure why people would expect so much. It used to be a TRAVELODGE for goodness sake! Travelodge = AVERAGE in my extensive travel experience of the world. Why anybody coming to Sydney would particularly want to stay in this area I dont know, I wouldnt .... but then I am a local Sydneysider...Look there are lots of alternatives to staying next to what locals know as drug park  i.e. Rushcutters Bay Park. This park is known by locals to be full of syringes from addicts hitting up after wandering down from drug  hooker central (Kings Cross) which is a mere 5 minute walk from this hotel. Yes, it's not far to get to the city centre, Opera House, shops, QVB etc but if you research a bit more and be realistic about what price buys you in hotels then disappointed you won't be next time... when you DONT book VIBE Hotel Rushcutters Bay. I would never recommend this hotel to out of town clients or friends of mine. My ex-husband was only staying at this hotel as his (Mean) company put him up there on business. He wouldnt have chosen it himself in a fit!There are so many great places to stay in Sydney... if you went up the road to Woollahra, a much nicer suburb and looked at The Hughenden Hotel (boutique hotel) for a similar price as VIBE then you would have a much better experience!
