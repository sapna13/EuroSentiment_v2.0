{"text":"Great Hotel for Honeymoon The Grand Mirage Resort is ideal for a Balinese honeymoon. We stayed at the resort for 10 days in February 2007. Upon arrival we booked the Cinnamon cloud spa treatment for couples at Thalasso Bali. It was romantic, relaxing and an ideal way to recover from our jetlag.The beach and pool facilities are well cared for and the atmosphere is very relaxing. Also, the ocean and pool water were very warm. There were usually nice places to sit, despite all of the beach towel place holders. The Balinese massages on the beach were one of our favorite things about the hotel. HINT: If you buy 5 massages in advance one is free. We would highly recommend the massages! My wife and I also enjoyed the American breakfast each morning near the pool. The hotel also served continental and Chinese alternatives if you feel eggs, waffles and bacon are too heavy for breakfast. Because the breakfast was so filling we often skipped lunch and then ate dinner outside the hotel. By far our favorite restaurant was Bumbu Bali. It is in walking distance from the hotel (7-10 minutes). The restaurant has cultural performances on certain nights, but book in advance. Most restaurants will send a car to the Grand Mirage to taxi you back and forth at no additional charge. Looking for (Oleh-Oleh) souvenirs? There is two-story convenience store about a 7 minute walk from the Grand Mirage. There is no haggling and prices are clearly marked. We found that the wood carvings are comparable and much cheaper than those at workshops visited on the tourist excursions. We hope you enjoy your stay in paradise.
