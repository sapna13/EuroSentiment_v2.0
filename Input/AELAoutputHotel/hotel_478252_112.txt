{"text":"Wonderful Resort After reading the previous two reviews, I felt compelled to write my own review of the Bahia. I stayed at the Bahia from July 6th to July 13th in the Diamond section.Check In: We arrived in the early afternoon and were directed to the Diamond check in. There were no line ups and we were given a welcome drink with alcohol. Surprisingly, our room was ready and our requests had been followed. Our 4 ala carte dinner reservations had been booked with the times we requested. I had e-mailed the Diamond club with our requests a few days prior to arriving.Room: Our room was clean and comfortable. The only bugs that we saw for the whole week were very tiny, harmless little bugs much smaller than ants.Service: We found everyone who worked at the resort to be friendly and very polite. We had one problem on the second day. Our room had not been serviced until the late afternoon (5:30 pm). I don't know why this happened and it certainly didn't happen again. A concierge came up to us at the Diamond pool and asked us if we had any complaints and we told him about the room not being serviced. After that, we had our room serviced twice a day (morning and evening). New towels were delivered twice a day and chocolates were left on the night table. We received two phone calls during the week from reception asking how we were enjoying our holiday and if we had any complaints. We had towel art and flowers in the room every day. The waiters at the bars and the restaurants were excellent and attentive. Water glasses and wine glasses were refilled without having to ask. Food: We actually found that the food was much better than we were expecting it to be. We ate most breakfasts in the Italian restaurant where there was probably 10 people there at the most. It was very quiet. We ate lunch at the beach but not at the main snack bar. We found another restaurant overlooking the beach that served better food. Half of it was under construction so I don't think that many people knew that if they kept walking a little bit further they would find that the other side was open. We were pleasantly surprised to discover that the main buffet was open before 7 in the morning so that we were able to have some breakfast before going on an outing and before going to the airport. Fruit was plentiful and delicious at each meal. There was a wide variety of choices.We enjoyed the restaurants. We ate at the Gourmet, Steak House, Italian and Japanese. We also had the option of eating lunch at the Italian restaurant which we did on one occasion.I did not ever have to ask the bartender to put alcohol in my drinks. I saw the rum being put in each time.The lobby bar was lovely to sit at and enjoy an after dinner cocktail or a cup of tea.Beach and Pools:The beach is beautiful. We went for a walk and a swim before breakfast when the beach was empty. We spent most days on chairs under the shade of the beautiful palm trees. The ocean was much more refreshing than the pools which seemed to be too hot. The Diamond club also has their own pool which was very quiet. I did notice people who were not from the Diamond section were also using the pool but it was never crowded. InternetWe took advantage of the free 20 minutes per day of internet use in the Diamond Room. I would definitely recommend staying in the Diamond section but I should mention that there is presently construction going on close by and you can hear hammering if you are sitting by the Diamond pool.
