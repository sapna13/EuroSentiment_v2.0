{"text":"5 stars, no complaints Me and my family stayed at the grand palladium abvaro from dec 20-27, 2006. We went for a christmas family vacation. From the moment we arrived, we knew that this place was paradise. The front desk was helpful, courteous and quick. Check in was easy and fast. Our rooms were ready immediatly we checked in just before 3 pm. We were located in Villa 61 which was halfway between the main lobby and the beach. It was close by to everything and we never had to walk for more than 5-10 minutes to get anywhere. We had a juniour suite which was beautifully set up and very well maintained. I actually enjoyed spending time in my room. No bugs at all!The service at this hotel is fantastic. There are employees everywhere and they are always ready and willing to help. The service at the bars and restaurants is excellent. No complaints about any of the staff. The maids were excellent in cleaning the rooms and making sure everything was stocked in the mini fridges. The food at this hotel was above average. We ate at the Cathedral for breakfast and dinner everynight which was the main buffet restaurant. There was always a large variety of foods. No one every got sick from the food at all. The buffet was clean and had a great selection of foods. The beach is breathtaking, the water is crystal blue and the sand is white. There were alot of waves but it was enjoyable to lay in the sun and catch some waves. There were many pool bars, it was never hard to get a drink or anything. Close to the beach there is another restaurant where we ate lunch, they also had a nice outdoor area to sit as well. The pool area was also great. There is a pool bar which was cool. The pool are is spacious and the service to get drinks is great.The entertainment staff was excellent. They were always up for a fun time. The shows were entertaining alot of good dancing. The disco would open up at 11:15 and be open till 2 am. it was always a fun time, with great music!Overall this hotel is a 5 star. We had no complaints at all. It was a great choice and i would reccomend anyone looking for a fun enjoyable vacation to stay at this hotel. You have nothing to worry about, its a great place!
