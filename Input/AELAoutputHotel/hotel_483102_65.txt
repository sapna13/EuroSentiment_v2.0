{"text":"Wonderful staff and location Stayed 2 nights in H10 Universitat over the weekend and really liked our stay. I initially booked the hotel through a booking website but decided to contact them directly, and in by doing so, I got a better rate inclusive of breakfast for 2 persons at 140E per night. Initially, the booking websites were quoting 160E per night without breakfast, so it's best to contact them directly first. I also requested for a nice large room with view on the upper floors, and when we got there, they were able to grant our request and gave us room 701 - a nice big room (twin beds together but not a problem) with a nice terrace facing Ronda Universitat and minimal traffic noise because it was high above the street (8th floor was the highest). I guess we were quite lucky that this room was available because some rooms are indeed just half the size of this room with no terrace at all. Our room was pleasingly comfortable and clean. Wide assortment of bathroom amenities, and shower stall was spacious. A huge buffet breakfast is served at the basement with a nice assortment of warm food (bacon, sausages, eggs etc), cold cuts, cheeses, fruits, cereals, yogurts, pastries, breads, and juices. They do serve brewed coffee or tea in a pot, but do ask for their cappucino instead. I live in Italy and I must say, they serve really great cappucinos! Location wise, this hotel is great. It is right off Plaza Catalunya, in the heart of the city so everything is close by. The street it is on is a major street so it is safe and not seedy. You can easily walk to Las Ramblas, P de Gracia or Rambla Catalunya, take your pick. Restaurants, cafes, shopping, transport are all close by. When you check out, you can leave your bags with them until you depart for the airport. Good thing is they have a locked left luggage room and they issue tags. Some hotels don't issue tags and some just leave the bags in the lobby where people can just walk off with it. Above all, I think what will make me come back to this hotel is the service of the staff - from reception, to the breakfast staff, to the cleaning staff. Everyone was smiling and ready to help. It seemed they enjoyed working in this hotel and because of that, they were able to give great service.Would recommend and come back as well.
