{"text":"Great Family Vacation I previously wrote the review classy lady several months ago and in that review, I stated that I would bring my family in July for a one week vacation. Well, I made the trip last week with the family (wife plus 3 kids [three year old twins and seven year old daughter]) and The Regent took great care of us, from the beginning to the end. We stayed in an executive suite (which has a pull out bed in the living room and a King in the bedroom) that worked out perfectly for us. We received fresh fruit each day and turn down service at night. We started each day at the breakfast buffet beside the pool. There is a great range of food, to include a different selection of noodles each day, all your breakfast food (eggs, bacon, sausage), freshly baked bread, fruits, and an asian section with fried rice, curry, etc.During the week, the concierge helped us plan visits to the zoo, night safari, sentosa island, and Clark Quay. I would suggest having them arrange a car (40 sing per hour) to take you around town, we had them take us to Clark Quay for a river ride and then over to Raffles for lunch.They will also arrange to have a car pick you up at the airport and return (not the hotel limo but a really good service in a mercedes for 60 sing).My kids loved the pool (just refurbished) and my wife and I enjoyed the service (you get served ice water\/lemon with fresh fruit and a scented cold towel). We finished off our stay at the Summer Palace restaurant and had a wonderful Chinese dinner.This is truly one of the best hotels in the world.
