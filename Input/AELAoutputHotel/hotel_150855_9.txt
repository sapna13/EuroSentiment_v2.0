{"text":"Family Bonding! What an experience! Sun, white sand and family! Punta Cana is fabulous! What would I recommend to others?... This resort is good for teens\/adults (ours are 12, 15 and 17) but there wasn't anything for younger kids to do. You can buy blow-up pool toys there but they are pricey - we brought our own - (you can leave them behind). Plan on doing some excursions (we HIGHLY recommend the dune buggy experience with swimming in an underground natural pool!) BUT wait till day 3 to go. You need at least that much time to get into the swing of things, get your body used to the food, the laid-back pace and to start on your tan! Don't bother bringing your blow dryer - they have them in the bathrooms. If you really need to plug something in, the front desk rents plug adapters for $1 US for your stay. The nightly entertainment was totally lame so be prepared to be creative with your evenings with the kids. DO take advantage of the bricked sidewalk that runs along the beach from one end of the Riu properties to the other end. DO take advantage of the pools\/eatery's offered at the other Riu resorts you can play at. The a la cartes were nothing special - just the same buffet choices in a different location. If you are a vegetarian - learn how to ask is there meat in this? in Spanish - most everything does have meat. DO take the Spanish classes offered. DO take your free scuba lesson in the pool. DO play water polo (it's a hoot!). If you can, DO stay for 10 days. One week was definately not enough and 2 weeks would have been too much. 10 days would have been perfect. And please, DO set your alarm for 5:30 am the morning you are leaving. Get up and walk down to the beach chairs, settle in and watch the sun rise. The only sound is the waves crashing and you can see at least a trillion stars (including the big dipper - which is upside down). These peaceful moments, with my family, was the perfect way to end the trip.
