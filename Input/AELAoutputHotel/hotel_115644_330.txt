{"text":"Great stay. . .yet again! My husband and I stayed at the Chancellor for 5 nights (7-12 September 07). This was our second visit, and part of an anniversary trip, so I contacted Wes the manager before we travelled and he helped me to arrange a special treat for our arrival. Not only did we find a bottle of wine and a special gift for our anniversary, but some beers and nuts for my husband (he is a simple pleasures kind of guy!) The hotel room (1103) was great - we had a corner view of Union Square, and although we could hear the cable cars quite clearly, they just added to the experience of San Francisco. We purchased a pair of MUNI passes from the tour desk and made full use of them during our stay. We travelled regularly on the cable cars (which were quite busy, but another part of the San Fran experience). We also walked down to Market Street and caught the F Line historic trams, which go all the way along the Embarcadero to Fisherman's wharf. Top tip - take the $20 trip across the Golden Gate Bridge - it only takes 1 and a half hours, but you get to stop off at the Palace of Fine Arts and take pictures of the city from the other side of the bridge. We also took a $10 sunset cruise under the bridge, which was well worth the money, if a little chilly!!Anyway, back to the hotel - I didn't get the chance to meet Wes in person to thank him for his help in making our stay special, but I didn't really have the need to speak to any of the staff apart from at check-in, as we had no problems the entire duration of our stay. That said, whenever we made our way through the entrance foyer, we were always hailed with a greeting by whoever was on the check-in desk. Little things like that, along with the jars of sweets and rubber ducky, made our second stay at the Chancellor just as good, if not better, than our first.We had no reason to stay anywhere else when we came on this trip, and we still have no reason to change on our next visit. Look out Chancellor - we'll be back!!
