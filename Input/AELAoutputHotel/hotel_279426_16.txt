{"text":"A boutique hotel with elbowroom Maybe I'm used to tiny NY hotels, but this was as modern and stilish as many boutique hotels, while leaving enough room to move around. We were in 4 using a 2 double queen, so the extra space was well welcome. It is a few blocks from Union Square where we took the cable cars to move around town. Tip: if you plan to use the Muni system, get the 'passport' which is a day (1\/3\/5) ticket for all transportation and you'll save a lot of money.Reception was nice and friendly, checking in and out was made easy. Valet parking is a rip off but I guess that's SF. The room had nice elegant furniture and a nice and extremely clean bathroom. Beds were comfy. The room offered a water heater to make coffee or tea but they also had free coffee in the hall where the wi-fi system worked very well.We were on the 6th floor and we had no noise there. Their a\/c system is indeed a bit weird, it's basically like a portable unit, which tends to be a bit noisy - but we are europeans, and SF temperature was good for us without needing to use it. I doubt it gets very hot there, but if I had, I would rate it like just above an average a\/c unit noise - it would not scare me but not everyone sleeps the same way.We had breakfast twice at Dottie's true blue caf√ã√\u2022√ñ, I'd recommend it but get in line early and skip weekends. Sears also was ok, they have the dollar pancakes which kids enjoyed. We dined once at the Grand caf√ã√\u2022√ñ in front, very good food and nice ambience (but a smaller menu). They have good pizza for the kids.We may return next year, to SF definitely I'll book here.
