{"text":"simply awful!!! Do not stay here! I found their website and the place looked gorgeous! I think they used fake pictures because this place does not look like their website. The cleaning staff was mediocre at best. They imply that they provide you with beach towels, and they will, for a daily charge. The apartment we were in had a decent layout, but the pillows were very mushy and very worn out. The bathroom was small and only had a shower stall with low water pressure. THere were a couple of missing planks in the floor that my daughter kept tripping on. We were told there was a view of the ocean from our room and there definitely was no hint of water to be seen. There is a LOT of noise! There were dogs barking day and night, staff doing laundry(which was right next to our room) roosters and chickens making their noise. UGGGH I am a pretty positive, go with the flow person. I wish I had something good to say about this hotel. I guess maybe that it was $125 per night and when you split that 5 ways, you have a cheap place to stay. I wanted a nice place to stay. The do have a small store where you can get beer, milk, DonQ, some staples like bread, peanut butter and jelly etc... Check the dates though, a lot of their stuff was close to expiring. We did have a balcony porch to sit on, but it was not exclusively ours.
