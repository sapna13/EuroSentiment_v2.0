{"text":"Fantastic luxury hotel Have just returned from a fantastic trip to NYC, the Sofitel was the icing on the cake! Booked based purely on all the good reviews here on trip adviser and all were greatly deserved. We followed the advice to join the Sofitel Loyalty program and received a free drink voucher on arrival and a 4pm check out time which was well worth it due to our evening flight. We also emailed the hotel prior to arrival to let them know this was a birthday trip and received on the 1st night a bottle of champagne, chocolates and birthday message from the hotel management. All the staff from reception to maid service provided excellent service. The location was just off 5th avenue and having stayed near Maddison Sqaure Gardens on previous visits you could definitely tell this was a more upmarket area. Our room had a fantastic view, the comfiest bed we have ever slept in and the bathroom was pure marble luxury. The fresh flower, candle, french toiletries and separate bath  huge walk in shower made all the difference after a hard day sightseeing. The free evian water left each evening along with the next day weather report were greatly appreciated.The bar was a little expensive but only to be expected in a hotel of this quality and city prices. It was a great place to meet for a quick drink prior to a night out, the coctails were delicious and the olives\/cheese snacks a nice touch. We did not try room service or Gaby's restuarant but as we will definitely be visiting this hotel again will give it a try on our 1st jetlagged evening. The Red Flame diner a few doors down was perfectly Ok for breakfast, very fast service but we have had better coffee shop food elsewhere in New York. Yes, the Sofitel is a bit more expensive than other 4star alternatives in New York, but could definitly justify the extra cost for all the extra quality and attention to detail, this was more like 5 star stay by New York standards. I don't think we would book in anywhere else when we visit this amazing city again.
