{"text":"Avoid this hotel rip off I am writing this from our hotel room just before check out as free hi-speed internet is one of the best services of this supposedly deluxe hotel - along with its unbeatable location on Waikiki Beach. We have been here 4 nights and the free internet and convenience of walking downstairs onto the beach are not adequate compensation for the terrible check-in experience we suffered - where the hotel held us hostage to higher rates than those quoted by phone  email with a snooty manager who when we protested suggested we might look for less expensive rooms elsewhere - as we checked in after having reserved back in May 2007 - Plus the paper-thin walls between our partial ocean view room (if you go out on the 4-foot balcony on the first floor - any hotel's worst floor as we know from many international travels) and the juvenile party goers next door... Every time the toilet flushes anywhere near us the noise is like a small freight train next to the beds,,. At least the kids quieted down when I phoned their room at 11 pm and politely asked them to be a bit more quiet. Anyway, you get the picture. We reserved with local Hawaiian friends for a dozen people in May and on arrival we got the worst service I've experienced; the worst floor in the hotel; a very noisy hotel that seems to cater more to the younger crowd (ie 20 somethings) - which would be fine if the rooms were adequately insulated: 4 of our rooms complained to me about this... for a deluxe price.The breakfast buffet is good at Duke's Canoe club but at $15 per person a bit steep; don't bother with the lunch buffet and for dinner go to the Hula Girl upstairs - pricey but so is all of Waikiki on the beach and it's excellent food  service there. In short, why pay nearly $300 for a noisy, semi-view room on a low floor over the noisy air conditioners when you can have a much nicer experience nearby and simply walk through the ground-level Public Beach Access lobby to the beach (I suspect they had to do that to get the building permit!) and\/or go to Duke's Club etc. for a meal etc. ?? I certainly will not return here.PS I do wish trip advisor would list all the right on the beach hotels here in Waikiki together so one could easily compare them - it would have helped me with our decision last May... just a suggestion.
