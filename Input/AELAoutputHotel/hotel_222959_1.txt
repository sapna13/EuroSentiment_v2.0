{"text":"Customer svs was great! Unfort, my hubby and i had a tough year on the health front. After 2 hospitalizations we checked into the Ritz Carlton, BPC both times (we actually live in NYC).The staff at the front desk could not have been more amazing. They had no idea what we had been through but we must have looked a bit tired, etc. They were incredibly gracious and gave us a wonderful upgrade. The breakfasts were deelish, the views of Lady Liberty were beautiful and the beds were really comfy! Some peole have suggested the hotel needs to be updated. we stayed in a suite so not sure what the standard room looks like but ours was really quite lovely. we thought it to be the same quality as any other higher end hotel and would def go back. It isn't brand spanking new so if that is super imp than a another hotel may suit you needs a bit better-still, though, i have been to other 4S and RC's that were a lot more tired.I think we paid around $15 per day for internet svs and will agree w other posters: it is ridiculous to have to pay for wifi.I think the front desk mng was MIKE and he was AMAZING! The gentleman who took my room svs order everyday was super accommodating to the diet restrictions the doc had recommended. In the past few yrs we have stayed at a variety of FS, Cap Juluca, Sandy Lane and the Ritz BPC had the most gracious staff of all.
