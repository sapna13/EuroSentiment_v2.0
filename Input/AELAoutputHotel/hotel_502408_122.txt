{"text":"Awesome Awesome Awesome for a Girls Weekend! I stayed in the Affinia Dumont a few years back for a bachelorette party. When planning another bachelorette, I contacted the Dumont, but they were completely full. I was put in touch with Joe from the Affinia 50 - it was a pleasure to work with him! He set us up with an amazing two-bedroom suite on the top floor! This type of room setup had two queens in each bedroom, two living room areas, two huge bathrooms, and two kitchenettes. Granted, we definitely didn't need two kitchenettes, but having the two bedrooms and the two sitting rooms was definitely a plus! We also had a balcony off of one living room that overlooked the busy NY streets.The location was wonderful - we hopped around from bar to bar after having dinner downtown. We also walked to and from Grand Central Station. It was great!I don't even feel as though I need to say this, but the hotel was welcoming, the rooms and bathrooms were clean, and they were attentive to our every need. They set us up with taxis and had them waiting for us when we came down. The minibar was stacked with everything you could ever imagine, but it was expensive. We brought our own mixers and booze so that we could have a drink while getting ready. We brought some snacks and had them in the fridge for our return. There was another bachelorette party there as well. Great getaway for the girls! ","annotations":[]}
