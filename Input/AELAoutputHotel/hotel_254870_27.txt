{"text":"Great location, wobbly wi-fi I spent 5 nights at the H10 Montcada in March 2008. While not perfect, it was fine and I would stay there again.The location is central, right by the Jaume I Metro station. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ about a ten-minute walk to Placa Catalunya, where there is a great variety of subway and train service. Ten minutes in the opposite direction and you are at the waterfront.I had a room on the sixth floor, on the corner (room 603). It was not huge but adequate, with two twin beds and, yes, the mattresses were firm. The downside of being above a subway station is that you are above a subway station. I could hear and feel the rumble on the sixth floor, but I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ lose any sleep.I was pleased that when I arrived first thing in the morning they had a room for me. Your results may vary, but at least they did not make me wait until the official check-in time. The front desk staff were fine at all times.The shower was good with plenty of hot water and pressure. I did not try the fitness center.My biggest semi-complaint regards the wi-fi. (I say only a semi-complaint because I was not expecting wi-fi at all, so whatever they had was a bonus.) My room was on the fringe of the sixth floor signal. Sometimes it was good, but other times I had to sit on the (uncarpeted) floor right by the door in order to pick it up. ","annotations":[]}
