{"text":"Would definitely use again I like this hotel and would definitely use again. Nothing out of this world but value for money and well located.It was clean, with housekeeping everyday. The maid was lightening quick and room was done by the time I got back from breakfast. Rooms a little on the small side but I had a double room to myself so not a problem.The bar is nice and the service good, staff are very friendly. The reception staff were ok, a couple of them were a bit frosty at times.Didn't eat in the restuarant but it was fully booked most nights and the food looked really nice.My room was over the bar and main entrance and if you have the window open it was a bit noisy Friday\/Saturday nights. My sisters room was at the back and it was quiet. Hotel seemed to be very warm even in November, although it was mild anyway. The heating was off but still needed to have the window open all the time.Breakfast was excellent, lots to choose from, good service and something for everyone.I had some problems with the TV, couldnt get any films (although they are 11 euros to watch!) Just 4 channels of football and 2 adult channels. I spoke to one of the friendlier female receptionists on my way out that evening who said she couldn't sort it as she was on her own but would make sure it would be done the day after. When I got back in that evening it had been sorted! Although when I came to check out there was a film on my bill but they took it off after I explained the problems I had been having.There are two lifts at the hotel and as far as I can remember would be easy for a wheelchair user to use the main entrance.The hotel is well located for the Ku'damm and a few minutes walk from the nearest U bahn station. Bus stop a minute away and all the train\/tube\/bus services were excellent and regular. Suggest you get the tourist ticket which lasts a few days, also gets you discounts. We bought ours at the ariport, you need to validate it in the machines when you start to use it. After that you only need to show it on buses occasionally, they dont have ticket barriers for trains\/tubes as the fines are hefty if you get caught withouth a ticket!We did have a few problems locating some authentic german cuisine (apart from the Hotel restaurant). There are lots of Burger Kings, Dunkin Donuts etc if you like that sort of thing, also plenty of Chinese, Spanish etc. If you want to try German cuisine then you are lucky that 'Marjechellen' is not far away at Mommenstrasse 9 (turn right out of the hotel, cross over the traffic lights then first on left). This was recommended in an AA travel guide and is absolutely fantastic. A strange little restuarant, they could easily put in more tables but haven't and the service is wonderful. You need to see for yourself what I mean! My brother in law had the pickled beef and said it was the best meal he had ever tasted, ever. I had the Konigsberg meatballs which were lovely. Soup was great also. For 3 of us it came to about 70 euros for 3 courses and drinks, so reasonable.Another restaurant we tried was 'Die Grille'. Cant remember the road its on, but out of hotel, turn left, left again at end of block, then right after the beer garden, and its down on the left. The ghoulash soup was a meal in itself and wonderful, service good and even cheaper than Marjechellen.Hotel is quite near 'The Story of Berlin'. This was one of the better things we did, really interesting and lots of interesting interactive stuff for kids. Also included is a trip to the nuclear bunker under the shopping centre nearby which is still operational and they do a tour of this in English, they will tell you the time when you buy your tickets.Not all the rooms have a bath, but the shower in my room was excellent.Would definitely use this hotel again.
