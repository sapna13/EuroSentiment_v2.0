{"text":"beautuful resort...but i do not recommend it unless you speek spanish! My wife and i booked our trip to Majestic in April, and were there from july 21st thru 27th. after 3 months of anxious waiting, it was a very big let down! I wil note that the resort itself is beautiful. The pool is awesome, the beach is perfect! The room was clean and large with a great view (We had an ocean front\/view).Now for the negatives:1. I will start with the language issues first, because in my opinion, this is what really made our vacation as bad as it was.Not only do 95% of the staff speak Spanish ONLY, but 95% of the guests as well. As stated in a review before mine, it is very hard to meat people, drink at the bar with people, and get involved in the pool games and activities when you are truly the only Americans and English speaking out of the group. To give a perfect example, they had bingo at the pool, and the letters and numbers were called in spanish only! now, im not a big fan of bingo, but this is just an example. When the staff does try to translate, which isnt very often because they must not feel the need being that all the guests speek spanish, you cant understand them anyway! My wife and I like to meet people, and spend time socially with other people, and we found it almost impossible. For this reason, we chose not to do any of the excursions! And for this reason, we will not go back to Punta Cana. Last year, we went to Cancun and had the time of our life. I highly recommend Cancun...the RIU CARIBE was awesome...to anyone!2. The food. I expected a lot more from a 5 star resort. Yes, they had lots of choices, but the taste of the food was not very good! The meats were very rough, seafood not very good. I dont know if I was spoiled ffrom the RIU in cancun last year, but this did not match up. I STILL have an upset stomach!3. The air conditioning in the room did not get cold enough. I like to come in from the beach or pool, where it is very hot, to a nice cold room. The air conditioners here max out at a certain temperature (19 degrees celcious) and that is it! i had trouble sleeping most nights because the room temperature was very unconfortable. After the first night, i tried explaining the problem to the staff, and nothing got fixed. I realy dont think it was a problem with the air conditioning unit...i just think that they set it so that the room will not get any cooler than the 19 degrees celcious. It may be fine for others, but not me. And my wife is always cold at home, and she agreed that it was way to warm.4. Night club played Spanish music only!I wasnt going to write a review, because i am not a negative person. But when you spend 2 or 3 thousand dollars on a vacation that you only get once a year, you expect more! And when you dont get it, theres really nothing you can do except wait untill next year! It was a big let down! I hope this review helps. If you are Spanish Speaking, you will have a much better time here! Again, it is a bautiful resort, we just couldnt get passed the launguage difference. Next year, back to the RIU in Cancun!
