{"text":"Marco Polo Prince - great location shame about the rooms I stayed here for a very hot and steamy week in August on a business trip. And I can say that the experience overall was only satisfactory and no better.The hotel itself could not be situated any better. It is built into the Harbour City mall, and what a place that is! 700 or so top brand name shops that you could seriously bankrupt yourself in - Hong Kong is not the shopper's paradise it probably used to be, but you can still shop till you drop!Unfortunately the Marco Polo Prince probably lives off it's location - whilst the main hotel areas are perfectly perfectly presentable, the rooms themselves are in need of a makeover. That's not to say that they're bad, everything is there and cleaned as best they can be, but you know that a hotel is a step or two behind when you're handed an actual key (yes a key! How often do you see one of those these days?) for your room.The breakfast buffet was only average at best. On the first day that I was there the cereal that I chose was stale and way past it's best. And when trying the hot alternative, the bacon was so overcooked that it exploded into a million pieces as soon as it was touched with a fork. If you'd had to pay HK$120 for it, you would have been very disappointed.The lunch buffet I had at the Prince Deli was awful. It was in theory a beef goulash that I'd chosen, but it more closely resembled something that I'd feed my dog. By contrast the bubbles lounge bar served an excellent lunch, gnocchi as a main course followed by a delightful cheesecake and coffee afterwards.The staff were throughout the hotel were friendly and helpful, particularly the reception staff and bellboys (one of them was very helpful in elbowing me to the front of the taxi queue to get to the airport in a hurry!), so it was just a shame that the rooms and food don't quite live up to the staff's enthusiasm.
