{"text":"Loved it! My husband and I have been to this hotel two years ago, and we both thought it was wonderful. Our room had a jacuzi, and a very nice balcony, overlooking the swiming pool and a very nice garden. Gardens are just amazing, very well kept, with abundance of coconut palm trees, you can even get a real coconut cut up, and enjoy coconut milk by the pool for free! The beach was lovely, although, beware that the sea is not too calm, and waves are prety strong-not suited for bad swimmers or kids, by my judgment. The beach is miles long, and you can enjoy long walkes on white soft sand, it is very safe, we did not feel threatened there. Hotel itself is a huge complex, and you can use the facilities of all the parts, but if you are not overly active, it is not necessary. The food was just amazing. They have a buffet for all the meals, and if you go all inclusive, there are snacks throughout all day. Drinks are also abundant, with many coctels to choose from. My only bad experience was with a maid, who did a wonderful job so we left her a tip every day. However, one day I left 50$ in my bag, in a purse which was put in closet (away from her sight, or where she had to clean), and when I returned the money was missing. It was my own fault that I did not use safe, but, my advice-put anything of value in the safe, or cary it with you, or you will loose it. It made me uncomfortable knowing that someone was searching through my things.All in all, it was a very relaxing holiday, in beautiful suroundings.
