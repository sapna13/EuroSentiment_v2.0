{"text":"Good and Bad GOOD POINTS.Great Hotel , Friendly staff no problem with communication.Premium drinks Great choice at Buffet.Big pools no problem getting a bed.Beautiful Beach.BAD POINTSRooms are a little tired.Not exactly 24 hrs .The sports bar stays open until 04.00 with a few snacks.Not all Theme restaurants open every evening at least 2 closed every night.Food not hot in the Buffet Cold food being put out (I advised the Chef that the fresh new dish of chips were cold,very helpful, he took away my plate came back in 5 minutes with hot hard burnt chips ?}One pool swim up bar closed for the 2 weeks we were there.Constant drilling as the Theater was being dug up ,hence shows were in the lobby bar, meaning there were few seats, very busy bar and this meant no where to sit and talk.Sun bed covers very grubby, beautiful sand ruined by guests to lazy to use an ash tray, and I smoke.FOOD POISONING on the 2nd day of holiday meant a miserable few days in the room cramp vomiting and diharea could not eat the food or enjoy the Alcohol for the rest of our holiday and spending nearly all my time on the toilet.despite just drinking fluids , and a 24 hour stay in the HOSPITAL. on drips anti biotics etc.Great experience.!Perhaps I was unlucky but other people suffered bad stomachs,I am a experienced traveler and have never been so ill before. The Hotel has a lot to offer but I had a miserable time, apart from the great people you meet whilst on holiday.
