{"text":"Pleasant Experience I had a most pleasant experience while staying at the Royal Hotel. Check-in was Nov 30th and they had a room available for my early arrival. The front desk staff , as well as the bellman were friendly and spoke English.The room itself, tho a bit narrow, was clean, providing twin beds, a table with 2 chairs, ample closet and shelf space, a safe, and a refrigerator. The frig was filled with various drinks and snacks. The only problem was if you wished to purchase your own water and store it inside, they would remove it. Did not like that. A televison was also available but I did not turn it on so can't comment on what was available for viewing.The bathroom was large enough with a nice tub\/shower, good water pressure with plenty of hot water, nice sink area with room for personal items, and a hair dryer.Computer access was wireless and easy to use. You could buy minutes or get the daily plan, which was the most cost efficient. Naturally you would need a converter if you are from the states.The hotel was definately convenient to Los Ramblas, which was right out the door. Tho my room faced that street, the noise was minimal even with the window slightly open. I was located on the top floor so that may have helped cut down on noise.The hotel was also convenient to the subway system, restaurants, shopping (with a grocery store just a few doors away) and to the port, which was where I would be headed after my stay.The only drawback is the lobby area. It is on the narrow side so at check out , it was a bit tight with many people attempting to leave at about the same time. To their credit, the bellman did hussle to get everyone a taxi and on their way.The price I paid was about $240 per night. Some might think it was too high or maybe a better deal could have been available through a *cheaphotel\/priceline* site. I was ok with what it cost.I would not hesitate to stay there again.
