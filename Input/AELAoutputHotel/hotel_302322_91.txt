{"text":"Wonderful Stay at the Harbour Plaza We stayed at this hotel for 12 nights, spending Christmas  New Year in Hong Kong. We booked 2 harbour view rooms and the hotel arranged inter-connecting rooms that provided more moving space as a whole. Here's a more detail review.Location:Granted this hotel is not smack in the middle of everything (i.e. MTR, shopping, Nathan Rd etc..) but it is in a very nice upscale neighbourhood with shopping nearby and waterfront area with great views of the harbour. We prefer retreating to this area especially after a long day venturing out to sightsee and being in other crowded areas all day long. Lobby:The front area and lobby looks grand and the staircase is decorated practically everyday with different wedding parties (there were weddings going on everyday that we were there). Front desk staff was efficient and polite but what stood out was one of the door man who remembered my name since the day we go there. Every time he opened the door for us, he√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l mention my name which makes you feel special. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ little things like that stands out and you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l remember this. Room:The room is large for Hong Kong standard. We booked a harbour view and really enjoyed the view and seeing ships of all sizes coming and going. My 3 yr old liked the inter-connecting rooms for us and my parents as he can run around in both rooms without going outside into the hallway. The only regret was the room did not face the main harbour where the festival of lights (Christmas lights on buildings) and the fireworks display were held on New Year√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Eve. Not sure if any rooms in the hotel do face that direction or maybe for the more expensive suites only. However, I do know that for hotels that face directly at the main harbour where you can see everything will cost a lot more than the Harbour Plaza and rooms are likely to be smaller as well. The d√ã√\u2022√ñcor of the room is standard and the furnishing is also standard. It also shows some wear and tear in a few places but overall it was clean and in good shape. Service:Service (House keeping) is on and off meaning sometimes is good and sometimes not so good. For a hotel rated as 5 stars, service should be top notched but sometimes this is not the case. Nothing major but little things that get forgotten (more than once) should not occur for a 5 star hotel. For example, since our son shares the room with us, we asked for an extra set of towels for him but this is forgotten once every few days. There was also a small fruit platter which we were told at first it would be replenished everyday but when it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ, we asked again and we were then told this was only for the 1st night but since we asked, they would replenish it again and this occurred for another 2 days but then stopped. We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ bother to ask anymore as we can buy our own fruit at the local supermarket nearby. In general, staff was polite and helpful.Transportation:Hotel provides a small shuttle bus to TST but gets filled up quickly but will not drive off until the schedule time even if the bus is already full. They should at least increase this service especially for peak periods. Taxis are available and fairly cheap compared to North America and you can also walk to the pier a few minutes away to take the ferry across to Hong Kong Island. I like this way the best. However, since the ferry stops running after 8pm, if you are returning late, you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√≠l have to rely on other means of transportation.Restaurants:We didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try the hotel restaurants as we eat out most of the time but we did have drinks at the hotel lounge late in the evening. The buffet looks good and I really wanted to try it but never got around to it. There are also many restaurants around the area and the prices are obviously a lot cheaper than at the hotel. Since we speak the local language, there√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ no problem for us but even for tourist that doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak Cantonese, it shouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be difficult as most restaurants there have menus in both Chinese  English language.Conclusion:Overall, this is a good hotel and I wouldn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ hesitate to recommend this. You will not regret by picking this hotel. Hope this helps√à√\u2020\u2022?\/p> ","annotations":[{"endOffset":398,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":394},{"endOffset":4087,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":4080}]}
