{"text":"Unforgettable honeymoon Before deciding where my fianc√ã√\u2022√ñ (at that time)  I should stay in Oahu, we researched reviews posted on here. Reviews had mixed thoughts on the Kahala, a lot negative. Thank goodness we kept with our gut feeling  proceeded w\/ reservations. Upon reading the new reviews, it has got me wondering if people who wrote some of the reviews are employees of competing hotels in Oahu, or just people who expect too much  are never happy anyways.I am in my mid-twenties, and my husband is in his late twenties. We love to splurge on our trips, and we never hold back when it comes to making ourselves comfortable. We are also generous w\/ compensating for services provided to us. My husband  I spent 1 week at the Kahala from September 9\/07-September 16\/07. We heard good things right away when the shuttle took us to the Resort. We had originally booked for an Ocean Lanai View because it was mentioned in numerous reviews how breath taking the view is. However, upon check-in, we were instantly upgraded to an Ocean Lanai Suite; the bonus was that it was a corner suite! Check-in went smoothly, once we entered the room, it was absolutely luxurious! Complimentary Champaign was being chilled; the temperature in the room was absolutely comfortable. Room amenities were generous, and there were enough towels in the 2 bathrooms for 6-8 people. The bed was a king bed √à√\u2020\u2022?extremely comfortable (I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¨ so missing that bed!). From the balcony was a gorgeous view. To the left was the Diamond Head  to the right, was Koko Head. Below, we were able to watch people swim with the dolphins, and the ocean view was beautiful! Because our room had the view it did, we had no desire to swim in the pool or go to the beach. What we loved most about the Resort was the staff. House keeping, Concierge, and Valet were excellent. House keeping was extremely thoughtful enough to even organize our clothing when we left them unfolded on the bed. They made sure that twice a day, fresh ice was replaced for us, for both rooms of the suite, and room amenities were replenished daily along w\/ fresh towels. We left tips every day for our House keeping staff, only b\/c they provided us with such excellent service. Concierge service was absolutely reliable  friendly. We loved the concierge service. They assisted us w\/ deciding which tours we should do, which malls to visit,  provided us w\/ clear directions to various places. They even made dinner reservations for us at Roy√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ (a must to dine!). Valet was efficient  always willing to help us w\/ our bags. The staff is absolutely courteous  friendly. On our last night at the Kahala, my husband  I had a private dinner for 2 booked in our room. We were late coming in as the sunset sail ran longer than expected. Though we were about 20 mins late, the food was set up in our room, and we received a phone call from my husband√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ cell to confirm dinner was in deed that night and to make sure we were safe since the dinner was scheduled for that night √à√\u2020\u2022?like I said, wonderful service. The food was excellent. No matter what we ordered for room service, it was gourmet. Breakfast was delicious. We never missed the breakfast buffet. The hotel also provides a shuttle to Waikiki, absolutely convenient! What my husband  I appreciated most about the Kahala was the fact it was secluded and the staff does in deed trouble themselves in referring to you by name. We enjoyed the peacefulness, unlike the busy crowd in Waikiki. We were in luxurious ease here at the Kahala. We were pampered throughout out our stay  intend on returning. If you have any questions, please e-mail. I do believe that people tend to mention more terrible things than what actually happened. I was impressed w\/ our stay here and do recommend The Kahala!
