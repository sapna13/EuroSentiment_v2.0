{"text":"Loved Casci--service was top notch We actually found Hotel Casci after a night spent in our first hotel, with which we were not very pleased. We lugged our bags over to the Casci, asked if they had a room, and what the price would be. Imagine our surprise when not only did they have a room, but we would be saving hundreds of euros over our previous booking, which was loud and uncomfortable. The rooms are sufficient--nothing fancy at all, but you don't spend a ton of time in your room.More than anything, what made the Hotel Casci stand out for us was the service. Just coming in to the greetings of Ciao! made us smile. And they knew our names the first time and every time we checked in. I felt as though they genuinely wanted to help make our stay amazing, and it was. We felt like we were staying with a friendly family, but still had our privacy. The breakfast was very cute and filling. I loved the addition of eggs that could be hard or soft boiled. The recommendations and reservations that were made for us made our trip to Florence out of this world. We can state honestly that our visit was single-handedly enhanced by the staff at the Casci--they were more than willing to make suggestions, make reservations, make phone calls for us (am still so perplexed by the Italian phone system) to confirm reservations and such. We loved them. If someone is looking for top-notch service where the staff geniunely cares about you, this is the place to go! I also loved that there was internet access on a computer in the front near the check-in desk. ","annotations":[]}
