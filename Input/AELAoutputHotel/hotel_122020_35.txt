{"text":"A Bargain at Twice the Price CPI is my favorite inn in NYC. Everyone is welcome and the diversity of visitors having morning coffee in the breakfast room can be as interactive of an event as you want -- there's no forcing of dialogue as in some BBs. Fresh pastry and bagels are brought in every morning and it's well attended to by staff; therefore there aren't crumbs, banana peels, and used mugs ever competing for space at a table. The owner, Jay, even makes fresh bread every morning.The staff is extremely kind, generous, and helpful and the rooms are elegant in their simplicity and clean clean clean. The neighborhood is full of restaurants and conveniences and the property is less than a block away from the subway. CPI is a wonderful place to call home in the city -- and upon returning from a day at work or touring, there are chocolates, cookies, and tea. There is no elevator, so if you have a lot of luggage, the staff will assist (or if you carry your own bags this can ameliorate any guilt after discovering those bottomless cookie and chocolate jars). I've stayed in almost every room in the inn, and each one is a retro treat with movie posters from ages past. Rooms facing the street have white noise machines, which block well most ambient noise. The guest rooms across from the bathrooms can be a bit noisy, though, but it is overall a very quiet inn that's personalized but not intrusive in its service.
