{"text":"Horrible service and dirty rooms When we booked this hotel, we specifically asked for a room in the recently renovated tower building of the hotel. The availability and reservation was confirmed to us in writing. However, as we were checking in, the hotel clerk informed us that they oversold the tower rooms, and they could only put us in the garden area.We asked to speak to the manager who had a very unpleasant dismissive attitude towards us, but finally promised to try to move us to the tower the next day. The garden area room was old looking, which could have still be OK, but on top of that it was really dirty - pubic hair in the bathtub, hair all over sink, two chipped nails on the floor, etc. Have never seen such a low level of cleanliness even at a 2-3 star hotel, but that was a 4star! We requested twice for somebody to clean the room, and even though we were promised a quick clean-up both times, nobody ever came. The next day we were moved to the tower after bugging the manager about it, which was nicer. But I would never stay at this hotel again and would avdise you to skip it as well. It's understaffed, the staff is really unpleasant to deal with, and at least some of the rooms are badly cleaned.I submitted my feedback to the hotel after the trip, but nobody has even sent us a standard e-mail to apologize for the bad experience we had ","annotations":[]}
