{"text":"No drink after midnight and before midnight drink with rats running around We arrived at the hotel looking forward to checking in after the long journey from the airport,the hotel is in the middle of nowhere.The room was very small and not five star standard,we asked to be changed and they wanted us to pay for an upgrade but since we paid 3,000 euro to travel from Spain I said no but I still wanted a better room.We then were moved to an acceptable room in I block by the beach.Still not 5 star.We have been to dominican four times within a year and was very suprised to find the bars that are open at night situated in the hotel reception.By 11.15 the overhead fans were turned off and most nights by midnight the bar was closed and the prevoius tips given meant nothing.It was incredibely hot ,cloth stuck to you,normally in other hotels you would be sat in a beach bar watching the waves roll in,not here all we watched was rats running around the bar and reception.We have travelled the dominican extensively, hire a car and drive about and nowhere else have we seen rats.We asked to get moved hotel and all was well we had a great second week,when waiting on our rep to make the moving arrangements,they had a visit from the health inspectors so I dont think we were the only ones to notice the ratsTo sum up save the disapointment get a different hotel and have the fun holiday you deserve and payed forLorraine ","annotations":[]}
