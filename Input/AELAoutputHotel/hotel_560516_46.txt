{"text":"Wonderful Resort! We just returned from a fabulous week at The Cayena Beach Resort (2\/10-2\/16\/07). It was our 2nd trip to Punta Cana and we much preferred this resort to the other resort we stayed at along the same beach (Bavaro Beach). We arrived into a clean and friendly airport and a cab to the resort was $30 US and took 1\/2 hour. The resort was very clean and beautiful. Our room had a few small issues (drain in bathroom sink not working properly  missing curtain on front window). We alerted the front desk and within 1\/2 hour, both issues were resolved. I do not agree with previous reviewers about the pillows; our bed and pillows were quite comfortable. There is a computer in the Cayena lobby that guests can use to check email, etc. The location of the resort is very nice; it is a gorgeous beach (white sand, turquoise blue water) and the resort provides you with lounge chairs under huts for shade if you want it. The weather was perfect every day and there was always a nice breeze off the water, so we never felt too hot or uncomfortable. We took part in the 1\/2 hour catamaran ride (one of the staff takes you out for free) and loved it! We also tried parasailing and it was wonderful. It was run very professionally and we felt very safe (it was $89 US for 2 people) The resort has a few stores and it is also a short walking distance from a market located right on the beach. There were many vendors and they sold all kinds of souveniers, art work, jewelry, etc. Of course, we were able to bargain with them quite a bit, and we came home with some nice rememberences. We chose to eat all of our meals in the large buffet restaurant due to the large selection of foods. The food was quite good for the most part. Our favorites were the pasta and stir fry stations, although at times the lines were a bit long for these stations. There was always plenty of fruits and vegetables, meats, etc to pick from. The meat was sometimes a bit tough, but there was always something else to try if that was the case. The staff was wonderful and very accomodating. We definitely felt well taken care of. At night there was always some kind of entertainment. Again, the staff was wonderful and always tried hard to be entertaining- some shows were quite good and some were so-so, but we still always had fun. I have already been highly recommending this resort to family and friends, and I'll look forward to returning again in the future. If there was any thing I would change- the only 'blender' drinks they had were pina coladas and bahama mamas (in machines). They were very good, but it would have been nice to have other frozen drink options as well. (they would make any mixed drink you asked for and of course had beer and wine as well). All in all, we loved this resort and had a wonderful, relaxing vacation!
