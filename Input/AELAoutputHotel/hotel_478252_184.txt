{"text":"Not a dissappointment\/But not the best I've had. WARNING: AIRPORT IS A RIP OFF! Travelled the week of April 25th to May 2nd. Please be advised that if I seem picky on some issues, I've travelled to a Sandals resort, and nothing compares so far.The Good: Italian, Mexican, and Japanese Restaurants AMAZING! Refilled glasses before they were empty, allowed my husband and father to both try cooking on the big grills, showing them how to do it. Quiet\/Nice rooms, nice buildings. The beach is amazing, all the pools are amazing. Lobby is very nice and a good place to sit and relax. Trolley service is amazing, as it is a big resort. Drinks were good. Service from the people who spoke english was amazing. We travelled with our son who is 7 months old and got the best service and treatment for him. Everyone awknowledged he was around, and at every restaurant there was a high chair waiting for him.The So-So: Main buffet was good, however very repeatative. Service from those who spoke NO english. The maids and some of the restaurant servers spoke no english and it was hard to understand and sometimes frusterating for both parties. The snack bar at the beach was okay, but again variety of food was just so so. Entertainment was so so, put it this way I was tired while watching one of the shows and we left, if it was a good show I would have stayed and watched it. Becareful tipping the maid too much, as they will expect it every day, and if you choose to not do it one day you may get no re fill for the mini bar....haha!The Bad: The Brazillian, and the Dominican restaurants. The food was good; however, the service was not. Again the lack of english speaking servers was terrible. They took our drinks while we were still drinking them. Awful service at these places. Other than that it was a great holiday. We took many tours and they were all great. We got asked questions mid week about out stay and if there was anything they could do to help, we asked for some things and they were granted right away. We complained about a restuarant and given another a la carte.I would have to say that the language barrier was most of the problem, and we made a suggestion that those not being able to speak english should be offered either a french or english spekaing course, this would be easier for both parties.We also travelled with 22 people, 17 adults, 3 kids, and 2 infants. Occomodations were very good, and we were well looked after, my aunt with her 1 child was in a separte building from her other 2 children (in their own room), when asked to move they accomodated us.Would I go again to Dominican = NO......Would I go again to a Gran Bahia Principe = YES......Oh and 1 last thing, watch that at the airport check in they don't stand on the scale when weighing you're luggage. I caught the man standing on my scale. Apparently I was 8 kg. over....20lbs. I wasn't over going down with all the water and infant food I had to bring but I was 20 pounds over coming back with no baby food, or water. I think NOT! I asked them to re check and made sure that the luggage bags were turned to that I could see his legs as well..........and behold I wasn't over any longer....HAHA!I WILL BE SPEAKING WITH AIR TRANSAT\/NOLITOURS REGARDING THIS MATTER. THEY SHOULD HAVE A CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE THERE AT ALL TIMES.
