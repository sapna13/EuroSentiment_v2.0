{"text":"Great hotel. Awesome location. We just stayed at Langham Place in Hong Kong for 5 nites in May. It was a great location. Connected to a large shopping mall and a MTR station. To go to the MTR station, you can walk indoor all the way. The shopping mall has a supermarket. It was easy to get snacks and drinks. The food court in the shopping mall was great also. There are many great shopping places around the hotel. Within walking distance. In regards to the hotel, we love the room. It is a bit small for the price. For less $, you can get a suite (with a living room) at Eaton Hotel which is close by. But the rest of the room is great. Very clean. We do not understand how everything can sparkle after each cleaning. The shower was sooooo clean. The maid also goes out of her way to give us bottles of water when she sees us come back from a long day of shopping! However, it was a bit disappointing that the room smells musky if the A\/C is off for a short time. Try to keep it on. We also had trouble with getting both English and Chinese newspaper. They do not understand that we would like both; tried to explain 3 days in a row (and I speak Cantonese). My husband does not read Chinese even though he looks Chinese. In summary, we loved it despite these little things. We will consider going back there but will probably pay more for a bigger room.
