{"text":"The Jewel of Paris As a seasoned traveler to five star hotels in Europe and beyond, I was mesmerized by this little jewel in St Germain during my partner's and my 5 night stay there in late May\/early June. From the moment I contacted the hotel from Toronto to make various travel and dinner arrangements to the time that we left the property's doors, we were treated with the just the right balance of warmth and professionalism that all 4 and 5 star properties aspire to but so rarely achieve. To be sure, you could rest your head at Le Meurice or Plaza Athen√ã√\u2022√ñe and have every luxury at your disposal, but will every single member of staff greet you by name and tailor their service to your evey whim? Will a bottle of champagne with a hand-written concierge letter of genuine disappointment be waiting for you when a 3 Michelin star restaurant drops your dinner rsvp last-minute even though it is of no fault of the hotel whatsoever? And will your prized hotel have front desk personnel like Enzo, Jean, Audrey, and Frederic who will put various entertainment and dining options at your disposal without even asking? (As an example, my partner and I returned from dinner one night to be informed that, knowing we were often out late at night and probably interested in Paris's night scene, Jean had gone ahead and contacted some friends who owned one of the city's most luminous bars and that everything had been taken care of). And this is just about the service. The rooms themselves are a seamless mix of new and old: history abounds everywhere in this boutique jewel from the exposed beam chambres to the jazz bar frequented by some of Paris's greatest thinkers for more than two centuries; and yet when you're bathing in Hermes products and enjoying high definition television, it's hard to remember at times that you're away from home. The enchanting private courtyard flowing from the lobby spills into a stunning, original fireplaced family room adorned with accoutrements that remain true to the hotel's storied history wihout feeling stuffy. You can sense eveywhere you look in this property, and in everything you touch, that great thought and love has been put foward to making this the jewel of Paris.Rest assured, even if you're not choosing to rest your head and your spirit at the d'Aubusson on your next trip to Paris, I certainly will be.-Aleks in Toronto ","annotations":[]}
