{"text":"Good stay at the Atlantico We stayed at the Atlantico in a triple room for 3 nights in August and found it to be just as most reviewers here have described it - comfortable, clean  reasonably priced.The reception staff are very efficient and their English faultless. i wouldn't describe them as chatty but it just isn't that type of hotel. Everything is very business like. Our room was on the main road and the shutters did an amazing job of shutting out ALL the light. It wasn't completely soundproof but pretty good, and the aircon was fine.We loved the internet connection on the flat screen TV which cost a reasonable 8.5 euros for 24 hours and the satellite TV meant we didn;t miss out on Olympic action. Shower was great too. The hotel is near 3 different metro stops, all on different lines but to be honest, most places (galleries, palace, plaza de mayor) are walkable and at first we found ourselves going out of the way to get on the metro! If you fancy a swim, there are 2 outdoor pools (one Olympic size) at Lago, which is just 2 metro stops if you get on at Plaza de Espana at the bottom of Gran Via. They are unheated but were great in the August sun and we went twice.The only complaint i have about the hotel is that there was no room service, in spite of the information book stating there was and it would have been great to have had coffee in the room. Can't comment on the food as we didn't eat here at all - there is so much choice ouside!I would definitely recommend this hotel and will be staying here again.
