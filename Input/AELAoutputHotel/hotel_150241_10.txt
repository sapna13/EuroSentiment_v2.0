{"text":"Good for a stopover We had booked a one-night pre-cruise stay at the Caribe Hilton, but after I read about the resort taxes at PR locations with casinos, I decided to explore less-expensive options. Traveling with two young children and likely exhausted from a long day of travel, I knew that we were primarily after a place to crash. So after reading some rave reviews of the Hampton Inn, we decided to give it a try. The price was still high since we were traveling during peak time, but about $100 cheaper than the Caribe Hilton overall.The hotel is well-kept, but it is definitely modest and showing its age. The pool area, about which I'd heard raves, is very small and noisy from the nearby airport. We weren't looking for a day in the sun, but just the time we spent on the patio eating dinner was enough to take us back inside for the rest of our stay. Many families seemed to be enjoying the outdoors a great deal. Happily, we really didn't hear any air traffic inside our room.We had a suite with two queen beds and a study, which was just right for the four of us, giving us a little bit of room to stretch out. The room appeared to be clean, with the nice Hilton linens. The hotel staff was very friendly, even at 3 a.m. when we had to request fresh linens and towels after one of our children was sick. The gentleman who delivered these items refused any kind of tip.The grill by the pool had been a major selling point for us, and we weren't disappointed. The sandwiches -- burgers, grilled chicken, and others -- were fresh and juicy and delicious and reasonably priced. It was nice to have a tasty, hearty meal without leaving the hotel property. We would have been tempted to try the swim-up bar if not for the airport din. The free breakfast the next day was typical Hampton fare (identical, in fact, to the breakfast we'd had two weeks previously at a Hampton in Frostburg, Md.), but did the job for us quite nicely. We did not have much of a chance to explore the neighborhood, but we were told that the El San Juan extended casino privileges to Hampton Inn guests, so that could be a selling point for those interested in more of a vacation. A pharmacy across the street proved to be convenient when we needed OTC medication. Next door, however, were cockfighting arenas. Overall, I can't see spending more than one night at the property. It was hardly a vacationer's paradise or more than an appetizer to the beauty of San Juan -- just a convenient place to lay our heads for a night.
