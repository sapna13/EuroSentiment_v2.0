{"text":"perfect for the family My family of 4 as well as my father n law stayed at this hotel. Before i left on my trip i read the reviews about the hotel and not all were good. Well the people who left the bad reviews must be used to staying at the ritz carlton. This hotel was fantastic especially for my 2 boys. We had a deluxe ocean view studio. It had a kitchenette, nothing big but had the necessitys like a micro,fridge and even dishes. The room was able to connect to my father n laws room whos room was a bit smaller than ours but was just fine for him since he was alone. The view from the balcony was great the beach was literally right there. The beach was only 1 block away and hawaii blocks are small. ABC stores on every corner which made it great to pick up snacks on the way back from the beach. Pacific Beach hotel was across the street, That is where most of the touring companys pick up so that was very convenient for us. Overall the hotel stay was great and if you are traveling with kids and are on a budget this is the place to stay without having to worry about a run down hotel. There was flat screen tvs in our rooms as well. Ask for a corner room facing the beach or else you might get stuck in the middle and have to stare into the hotel across the street. Great hotel will definetly stay there again!!! We didnt even have to rent a car we were in the middle of everything!!!
