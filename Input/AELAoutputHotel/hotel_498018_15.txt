{"text":"Second visit! We stayed at the Hotel Icaria in June of 2007. It was the second time I had stayed there (the first was a business trip in 2006), but the first time that I had taken my partner there.The staff are very friendly  even though I tried my (admittedly ropey) Spanish upon arrival, they immediately replied in excellent English!The rooms were excellently presented and my partner was very impressed with the overall quality of the hotel. Hotel Icaria is five minutes walk from a crossover point for the Barcelona Bus Turistic (the red \/ blue \/ yellow open topped hop-on \/ hop-off sight seeing buses), basically you walk out of the reception and go left (towards the car wash at the end of the road) and then turn right (the stop is across the road). You can buy a two day ticket on board the bus for 24 euros and we used this service to get around the whole of Barcelona during our stay. It's excellent value!As for the hotel's other amenities, the bar  restaurent are very good (although not that cheap) and the pool is fine (although being so close to the Olympic Marina  beach we didn't actually use the pool.)I would recommend this hotel unreservedly, it is great value for money, it's close to the beach and marina, has good public transport links and the rooms are excellent.Our flight wasn't until after 22:00, but we were able to leave our cases in a secure room behind reception whilst we went off having a final days exploring before heading back to pick up the cases and get a taxi to the airport with no problems at all.One tip I would give, don't take a taxi from the airport, get the blue bus from outside arrivals which goes to Placa de Catalunya, then pick up the Barcelona Bus Turistic on the Blue Line  then it drops you off minutes walk from the front door of the hotel!I'm looking forward to going back again!
