{"text":"A quieter (nicer) hotel but close to Orchid We stayed at this hotel for a number of weeks over the past few months and happy to be returning tomorrow. This should say something. Very friendly staff who have knack of remembering your name and your preferences. The Club on 11 is OK though a little crowded sometimes, but if you dont want to eat a load is a great way of filling up both with a selection of small foods and drink - think its free till 2000 or so, then they charge. The rooms are OK, but probably need mordernising now - and there were gaps in the windows allowing noize to perculate but these were just small issues. The Buffet in Caspers is fine and should cater for International tastes. Wine can be expensive and they mark the bottles with Chinagraph which is kind of amusing - There is a couple of small expensive (my view) side restaurants doing Japenese\/Chinese meals but as I paid over 200 USD for one meal by myself just went once to each. There is a pastry\/coffee shop attached to the back where you can get the normal sandwiches and 800 Kcal cake fair - if not Coffee bean, Starbuckies are just 5 mins walk along a road with construction. The also a sectionalized at times high tea service with cakes and often a beautiful sounding harpist The bar is mostly smoking but you can get places where the HVAC is good and sucks it out before reaching you,; wish they would ban cigars - onetime the smell filled the whole of the place. The entertainment band (Jazzish) is fine and some good voices but they look kind of board most evenings - they start around 2100. There are a couple of shops one with Whisky and Cigars and the other is the Hotel souveniers - watch out even get close to the door and youll get sucked in by a vocal with a 20% sale finishing tonight! The gym has the normal hotel type machines and can be busy around 1800 but I still like it and does fine for me. The earphones are a little unhygenic and sweaty (ughh!) The swimming pool was quiet when I was there and although fairly small I still got the heart beat up with lengths - there is a pool side service from attentive staff. Hotel will arrange pick up. I have to say the conceirge service is excellent and go out of their way to support and find stuff for you - they even found and sent to my room a piece of 2 inch diameter pipe I needed for a project - free of charge. Love the flowers by the reception too. Taxis are difficult to get (same for the whole of Singapore) if its raining - give extra time.
