{"text":"Great Location Very Accomodating - Recommend Great Location next to two train stops - Universitat and Placa Catalunya (Plah-sah Cat-a-lawnya). Barcelona is a wonderful, vibrant, and exciting town. We were there for a short trip, but we really enjoyed our stay. I would definitely recommend the hotel. We paid about $100\/nt. But after looking just today at a couple dates, the rooms seem to be running the $200\/nt range. I was just happy to find a decent room that was under $300\/nt at the end of December, which was a definite feat..2-star hotels in decent areas were averaging $300\/nt during that time, but after reading all the reviews for the H10 on TripAdvisor and elsewhere, I felt confident that the room would be great at the $100\/nt price as long as we weren't in one of their known very small rooms.I emailed H10 Universitat to confirm that the room was paid for at the wonderful price I found, since I couldn't find that price even close on their website. I also emailed them to request one of the known larger rooms. We were accomodated very nicely. I believe we received one of the largest rooms for their hotel. I believe it was 712. Far enough away from the passing subway underneath the hotel.We received a complimentary glass of Cava upon check-in, and we also had access to the breakfast buffet - which was pretty good. One caveat about the breakfast buffet. On the day of our check-out, they wanted to charge us for the breakfast, but that makes no sense. Your check in time at 3pm doesn't allow you to take advantage of the breakfast buffet so you miss this day, but you expect to have it the day of your departure. After explanation, we did receive the breakfast free - although I didn't eat it because I had lost my appetite.Our room had a nice balcony, and we would leave the door open to hear the sounds of the city. The street is busy below, but we weren't in our room much. The room was very clean, and had the proper storage and amenities. I don't believe we did get the hot tea service to work, but again, it was a short stay, so we didn't request it to be fixed during our stay.The weird thing was the shower\/tub had half a glass door so water would splash outside the tub onto the floor. I was prepared for this in previous reviews, and it was definitely manageable with a quick swipe of a dry towel. I just don't get the weird shower door.Overall, I would recommend the H10 Universitat without hesitation. I don't know what similar hotels are priced during a normal season, so I can't compare. I'd say if you can get the room for less than $150, you might be doing good. The ease of access to everything was spectacular.As long as you are up to walking (and I have a bad knee), you can pretty much stay anywhere and enjoy being in that part of town as each part of town has an interesting flair about it. It doesn't take long to get to anywhere in Barcelona either by walking or taking the metro.We definitely want to go to Barcelona again...our earlier layover was in New York, and Barcelona blows New York away.
