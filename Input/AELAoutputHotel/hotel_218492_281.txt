{"text":"It was o.k. Punta Cana: Grand OasisDate: July 21, 2007Reviewer: A TripAdvisor Member, Mississauga, ON  We just got back from the Grand Oasis Punta hotel. The resort was very nice, beautiful gardens and lobby. They checked us in, bellboy took our luggage to the room. The room was fairly nice, simple, but overall clean. The cleaning staff was very nice and efficient, at least our lady was. There was a small T.V with about 60 channels, with some english channels. They provided us with one beach towel card per person. There were three a la carte restaurants (Italian, Tex Mex and Seafood) and one buffet restaurant. The food was great at all the restaurants, the service, a little better some more than others. They had one main pool which was a bit crowded at times, and I believe two other smaller pools throughout the resort. There were always employees around cleaning up and making sure that everything was tidy. There were a couple of shops. The people working in the shops were not that friendly, infact they seem like they don't want to talk to you and if you question something they'd start to argue with you, but the stands out in the open have really nice people willing to bargain with you so try to bargain if you can. Make sure to take plenty of nausea and upset stomach medication as we met many people who got sick, including myself and my mother. Buy travel insurance, if they need to take you to the local hospital you will be looking at $400 to $700 US in fees, plus the taxi fair of about $20 US. The beach was nice, but not very clean, lots of seaweed. They have a beach party on Thursdays where they serve all kinds of foods and desserts, and have a show. It gets packed so arrive early, I believe it begins at 6:30pm. There are also many snack bars, those were o.k, some of the food just sits there for a while so it gets dry looses its flavour, and some of they people working there can be so rude, almost as if they don't want to serve you. I read a review from another traveller and he\/she mentioned that the majority of tourists at this and possibly other local resorts are spanish. This is true. There were many spanish speaking tourists, and yes they can be rude, but I am spanish speaking and I did meet some people that were friendly. There were many tourists from other countries and backgrounds as well and they had the same attitude as well. But you gotta just see past that and just ignore them. I probably won't return to this resort as there are many others that I still need to visit and many other countrys that I would like to visit. But overall, it was o.k. Don't recommend it though.
