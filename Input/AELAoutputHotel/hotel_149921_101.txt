{"text":"LOVED this hotel and the safe beach!! We really loved it here, and like the other reviewers, wish we could have stayed longer! I didn't get a chance to visit the spa or make use of their free kayak\/pedal boat hours, the salsa lessons, etc. Next time hopefully!There were a lot of activities, the pools were great, sipping on the pina coloda drinks (everyday free pina coladas around 1pm for a hr at the swimup bar) in the hot tub looking out at turquoise waters and a warm breeze in the many palm trees was amazing! There is a free breakfast room on the 2nd floor in the towers(just use your regular room key), and use of their excellent espresso machine all day, as well as pops, waters, cookies etc and a happy hour from 5-8. The best part was the beach, absolutely gorgeous with the fortified city walls and san geronimo fort framing each side of it, so effectively creating a small cove. This means that the water is shallow and is safe for families to swim. As is the case in many coastal destination spots, the undertow can be dangerous and drownings can occur. THe beach here is perfect : secluded, private and safe. There was never a problem to find lounge chairs and they freely set up umbrellas wherever you wanted.FOr kids, there is a slide in the ocean at 4ft, small play structure right on the beach and another park near the tropical fish pond, a pond with swans, daily feeding of the fish at the pier, hammocks, sandcastle building competitions, infant pool, a giant chess board outside, tennis court, basketball net, an indoor games room, craft\/dance activities, a beach hut that lends out pails, shovels and water wings, etc. We will definitely be returning here!! The staff were very friendly and appreciated when you tried to speak Spanish.ps. the balcony in the room is quite nice to sit out and watch the waves.
