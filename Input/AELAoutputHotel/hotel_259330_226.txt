{"text":"Huge disappointment A few weeks ago, I was sitting at my computer just like you reading reviews about the Grand Paradise Bavaro. I was trying to make sense of the mixed reviews and hoping that I would not agree with the poor ratings because I had already booked my trip. Well unfortunately, now I am writing one hoping to prevent anyone else from the huge diappointment. First, let me make it clear that I am not used to a life of luxury andam not a hard person to please. I was just looking for some frozen pina coladas, enjoyable uninterrupted meals, and some relaxation. It didn't happen. My request for staying at the beach side of the resort was not honored the first night, so I had to stay club side where I had to take a shuttle to get to my room. While there, I was in a room on the first floor, which was a high traffic area. It seemed every hotel guest staying in this area had to pass through my hallway, whichwoke me up all night long. Some even felt the need to bang on the doors as they passed through. In the morning, I woke to a toilet whichwould not flush. I called the desk several times, made several visits and finally left after 2 hours and no response to see if my room on the beach side was ready. When I informed the beach side desk manager of all the troubles, he promised to upgrade me to an oceanview room and that I could check-out of my club side room. So, at about 11:00am we repacked again and moved our things to the other side of the resort. Unfortunately, when our room was ready at about 5:00pm it was not oceanview and not an upgrade but we were told that since we were without a room all day, they would not charge us the $2.50 for the keyto the safe--pretty generous huh? In addition, the attitudes of the staff at the desk were that we were troubling them with minor details,like NOT having a room. Pina coladas were watery w\/ ice-not frozen andall drinks were served out of those clear plastic disposable cheap cups,--soda and juice at buffet-warm, french toast--cold, hot tub--cold, hot dogs and hamburgers had a gray tint to them and sat in waterfor your taking--music--mostly dominican--besides that the beach and property were beautiful! On the way home our transportation picked up another couple from the Casino Real who said they had a wonderful timeat a beautiful resort with staff who catered to them!
