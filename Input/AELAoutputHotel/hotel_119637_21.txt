{"text":"You name it - they have it! This is difficult to imagine, but here goes: The staff was incredibly rude and mgt. firmly supports this behavior as I watched and listened in astonishment how they treated suppliers while in the lobby waiting to check-in. Next, being informed they were full and rates were $109.00 for two nights and $169.00 for other nights, I learned they were not full at all and I was still required to pay the night to keep my room. {I was unable to use 1st night due to travel weather in New Orleans}Moving on, the staff stated yes - we have internet√à√\u2020\u2022?in all rooms; they mean dial-up in the lobby and maybe a signal from a neighbor could be obtained. The room was musty, paint chipping on walls, linens that were worn-out, a bad smell from the bathroom drains and a small microwave and frig overloading the electrical outlet, located on the floor near the door added that special touch - in addition, old windows that would not open or close correctly. No A\/C and a fan requested helped.Knowing location is everything, staff stated this is a beautiful tourist area - they really meant hospital 1\/2 block away with fire\/ambulances arriving 24\/7 and homeless people sleeping outside of hotel, with urine and fecal matter on sidewalk with small 4-legged critters scampering about and in the wee hours of the night -let the party begin outside! Anyone hungry for a buffet breakfast?Finally, billing mistakes were the norm and staff stated parking is available - they forgot to mention where and cost\/payment method and how attendant may use your car for an errand. If you feel that, you have to stay here - try harder! This was absolutely the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in - anywhere. Why did I stay?
