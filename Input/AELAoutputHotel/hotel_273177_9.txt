{"text":"The other reviewers must have stayed in a different hotel! I booked this hotel without reading TripAdvisor's reviews, which I normally do all the time. Just after booking it, I realized my mistake and went online to check it out. Confronted with one absolutely terrible review after another, I was understandably anxious about my stay.Luckily, I can say that the previous reviews are completely unfounded. It may be that the place has come under new management, but I didn't experience any of the problems other reviewers had.First, the hotel staff was helpful. The hotel offers complimentary breakfast buffets downstairs in the mornings, and while it's nothing to write home about (coffee, toast, eggs, bacon, etc.), it's filling.I rented a double room with a friend for somewhere in the range of $40 a night (per person, so around $80\/night). The room was small, but neat. It featured free TV, with quite a few channels, including CNN, National Geographic and more. Shower supplies are provided (bath towel, shampoo, conditioner, etc.).The hotel also offers free internet access via a computer set up in the upstairs lounge. It was a nice gesture, so you can check email, or figure out places to go.The only downside was it was quite far outside of the city - a good 15-20 minute ride by tram. You can get there from the city center very easily, however, by taking the Number 21 tram. The stop for the Slotania is three stops after the Flughaven stop (you go under a bridge).Also, warning to marijuana smokers: There is NO smoking allowed in the hotel or its rooms. If you are caught, they kick you out. Just a warning.Overall, I didn't mind staying at the place at all. If I were to return to Amsterdam, I'd probably try to stay somewhere inside the city itself for convenience if it cost the same. The hotel was nice, but a bit too far for my tastes.
