{"text":"Desert Stuff Well, first I'd like to start by saying that GUYS YOU ARE STAYING IN THE DESERT.THE DESERT IS HOT IN THE SUMMER. A couple days ago we reached 117 degrees! 83 degrees vs. 117. Find a cooler Travel destination if you don't like the heat.I love the heat, I am an Arizona native and I live in North Scottsdale. I go to this hotel to chill out. Honestly, I would never stay here. The gift shop staff is appalling, they used the term (--) right in front of me to refer to a co-worker who'd gone to the bathroom. But they are not affiliated with this resort. The staff of the resort itself is inexplicably friendly. I walk by in my jeans, Im not a guest, lookin all ripped up and grungy, cause I can, and they all nod and ask how I am. I admit when I was wearing my work clothes (A very very very nice ensemble.. and expensive) I was treated SLIGHTLY more friendly. That was barely though.I wouldnt stay here overnight because it's very hotel- like. I would think it should be more RESORT-like. There are hundreds of rooms crammed on top of one another. But they have free Lemonade in the lobby!!!! And a LAZY RIVER!So if you guys want to cool off hop in the lazy river and grab a glass of Lemonade. It's FREE. It's lovely, but no better than most houses Ive lived in and my friends live in. So I wouldnt stay there but the friendliness of the staff and the fact it's a great place to hang out makes it worth stopping by. Remember, guys, this is ARIZONA. You are next to DESERT RIDGE IN PHOENIX. Youll see SCORPIONS AND RATTLESNAKES. Why? Cause it's THE DESERT.Also Id like to say the best part is that there are tons of animals all over all the time, we saw baby ducks and tons of jackrabbits walking around and they arent too shy to humans either so nature lovers!
