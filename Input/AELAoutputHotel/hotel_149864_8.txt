{"text":"Club Med during Thanksgiving We went to Punta Cana during Thanksgiving week with 2 teens, ages 17 and 14 and the grandmother. Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic is a beautiful village, very family friendly and newly renovated. The grounds are well maintained with views of the turquoise ocean waters.This is a French club in a Spanish speaking country so 3 languages are spoken in the village. Announcements are in French and English but many people come from France. Be prepared for a delightful cultural mix, 3 languages are spoken interchangeably and Americans are not in the majority. This was not a problem for us at all. The kids interacted with everyone and got to practice their Spanish.Food was incredible, plentiful and there was always a huge variety. We could never have enough of the tropical fruits. Every dinner there were several stations offering creative, beautifully served international fare. The most serious dilemma was what to choose for dessert. The pastry chef offered no fewer than 4 cakes, tarts or cremes in addition to the chocolate fountain, chocolate bread and cookies.Activities were non-stop and varied. One could sit by the pool or on the beach all day or instead participate in the Club Med organized activities like aqua sports in the pool, a terrific cardio-zumba class, evening yoga, etc. Or one could burn off calories at tennis, windsurfing, snorkeling, sailing etc. We all had sore muscles after 2 days from too much activity.This is definitely a family camp- lots of kids, many organized activities for kids of all ages although the number of English speaking teens depends on whether the U.S. schools are on vacation or not.,The nightly shows were mostly cabaret style- singing and dancing.Don't be surprised to see your tennis instructor who was hitting balls with you at 8:30 a.m. now at 9:30 p.m. dressed up in a tuxedo dancing across the stage. If you remember that the shows are just for fun, your expectations will be met.But the highlight for our family at night were the crazy signs done most nights to international music. The staff led everyone in a musical line dance to rhythmic, lively music from all over the world.At 10:30 p.m. the party continued at the beach bar with disco dancing. But we always left by midnight to allow a minimum of sleep before tennis lessons which started at 8:30 a.m.It was an incredible vacation for our family and we will continue going back to Club Med villages.
