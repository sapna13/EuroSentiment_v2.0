{"text":"Loved Rio Palace Macao We stayed at the Rio Palace Macao from April 21st - April 28th. We had a wonderful time and I cannot say enough good about the service and the staff. They were amazing. We do not speak any Spanish but found most of them could speak some English and all could manage to communicate with us.The room was perfect - I could not believe how quiet it was. The room was kept very clean and we had lots of towels, facecloths, pillows, and blankets. The air conditioning worked well. The food was always good - the buffet was so good that we only tried the Japanese food once - it was good but with so much selection in the buffet we didn't try any of the others. We never had any problem getting a chair on the beach or in the shade it we chose. The bar service on the beach was fine - I never had to get up to go to the bar someone always came and asked if I wanted a drink.We did the Monster Truck Safari and that was worth the money. It gave us a good view of the country - It was nice to meet someone so knowledgeable about his country and so proud of it. We learned a lot - Thank you Sam. The beach was wonderful and we enjoyed long walks on the sand. Caribbean Street shopping was really good and although we didn't require the services of a Doctor I felt secure knowing one was so close.The Animation group were a lot of fun and we enjoyed the entertainment nightly. They were certainly very energetic.We will definitely stay at the Rio Palace Macao when we visit the Dominican again.
