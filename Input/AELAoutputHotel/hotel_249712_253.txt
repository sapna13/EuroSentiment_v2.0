{"text":"For expense-account travelers and the wealthy The Westin is an excellent hotel if you are OK with spending $500\/night for your room (including taxes) or having someone spend it on your behalf. The $500 is just for a start, though, since continental breakfast is $20, wired Internet access is $15, the exercise facility is $10, designer water in the room is $7, and even printing your airline boarding pass is $1.50. If you upgrade (higher room rate) to the Executive room, then you get a 17 iMac in the room (nice touch!), a 32 LCD TV, and access to the lounge, which includes a continental breakfast.As for the location, you are literally on top of 9 subway lines, a block from 40 movie theaters, close to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, and within walking distance of all of the Broadway theaters. If you like the activity of the Times Square neighborhood, this hotel or the nearby Hilton and Marriott is for you. However, the Millennium Broadway and the Muse (Kimpton) are not far away, and they are considerably quieter. (I've stayed in all of these hotels over the years, but personally prefer to stay on the quieter Upper West Side near Broadway and the number 1 subway line).As I'm an urban survivor by nature, I didn't mind the frequent sirens on 42nd Street or 8th Avenue, but that might be an annoyance for some visitors. On the second night of my stay, we were awakened at 4:30 AM by a fire alarm and a sequence of announcements broadcast over a speaker system into the guest rooms. After 20 minutes, we were told that it was a false alarm. From what I could tell, the hotel staff treated this event as a routine occurrence, so make sure that you bring pajamas and a robe with you for a possible room evacuation.
