{"text":"Very nice hotel, great location This hotel is very classy. The lobby is suited for, at least, 50 people to sit comfortably in comfy chairs or couches. We had to wait 2 1\/2 hours for our room after flying in and the staff really tried to help any way they could. The family that was in our room got a late check out and stayed until the last possible minute! The hotel was crowded because of a wedding and our stay was close to New Year's so I wouldn't recommend staying during that time, especially if you have children! The breakfast buffet was near impossible but they will feed you as long as you are in the line, which was nice. The evening dining atmosphere is very elegant. Regardless of what you order, you are treated as if you ordered the special five-course meal! Very professional and knowledgeable staff. We did have room service one night and the presentation was top-notch. The bottom of the cart is filled with boxes that keep the food hot and the table setting was very elegant; for room service, this was presented very well. The only negative thing I can say for the rooms are that the hairdryers, literally, have a 12 in cord! Basically, they are pointless. Pack your own!! There is a pharmacy down the block for things you forgot but it is very expensive. Everything (famous landmarks) is within walking distance, at least, 20 minutes or more. But taxis and the metro are good alternatives. Unless you know French, I wouldn't recommend the charming restaurants on the side streets; stick to the more touristy areas. Just my opinion. Natives on the street and metro hardly ever smile; don't take it personally! I would stay at the Paris Hilton again and I highly recommend it.
