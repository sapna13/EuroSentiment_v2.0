{"text":"Cheapest Travel Agent recommended My girl friend and I stayed there in July 06, the location is a little far out from the hustle of downtown Singapore but still not far from places by taxi. The do have a shuttle bus going down to Orchid Road but we didn't go with that as times did not suit us.The reception staff we found to be not very helpful, i.e when we arrived there they didn't seem friendly and also when asked to use the internet they were not very responsive so I never used it.Located in the ritzy area of Singapore.The pool was great but probally not as quite as what I would of hoped -it is right next to main road!! The gym is equiped with exercise bikes, running machine and weight set.There is a great massage centre within hotel, just keep your husbands at bay with only limited cash for normal massage (if you get what I mean!!).The first room we had was okay but the toilet didnt flush so we were moved to a bigger room overlooking Raffles Club (not Raffles BAr). The bigger room was much nicer, though with both rooms an upgrade would do some good.We didnt eat in, but a service station is not far away so you can buy drinks and snack food there at a fraction of price of mini-bar.In my opinion there is other hotels closer and for much the same price so even though it was okay and userable prehaps look elsewhere.
