{"text":"Great location, reasonably priced, good service I abandonned our booking for Diva Hotel when I read the Trip Advisor Reviews of it and opted for Chancellor Union Square instead - much cheaper and consistently good reviews. The hotel is in a great location and the staff couldn't have been more helpful and pleasant (especially the decorator who was working on our floor that week - a really nice gent) . We asked for a quiet room and couldn't hear any traffic noise at all, so slept soundly. The hotel is quite old fashioned (in a nice kind of way) and its age and size inevitably make maintenance and upgrading a huge job, so don't expect perfection. Nonetheless it is clean and tidy and things like the bed linen were of good quality. My only (minor) criticism was that in the twin room we had there was rather too much furniture for the size of the room, which made it feel a bit cramped - there was actually ample room with a kind of separate storage room\/cupboard, but things like arm chairs and coffee tables in the main bedroom made it feel a bit corwded and you couln't really sit at them easily and comfortably. All in all good value and a good experience. Thought the warning leaflet in the hotel about cancer risks from chips and burgers was hilarious - symptom of the litigatious culture in USA. We had a great time in SF - we walked up adn down all those hills through most of the very distinct neighbourhoods. However, we were shocked by how many destitute people there are on the streets. Most seemed to be have mental health issues and weren't in anyway threatening - it is just startling to see this in the richest country in the world.
