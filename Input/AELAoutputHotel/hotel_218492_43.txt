{"text":"Do not worry!!!! We only got back this morning and stayed here for 2 weeks. After reading the reviews on here my fiance and I are very worried about this hotel. If you are picky and like to complain about trivial things then dont stay here. We had a room in block 5 overlooking the adult pool. The building does need updating but the hotel is being refurbished so it will get there eventually. (im glad we didnt stay up the posh end as there was some building work going on). The room was big and the bed huge, the television worked fine and in the second week there were loads of good chanels, the room is basic but unless you are going to spend the whole time in the room, who cares? The air conditoning worked well and the maid cleaned really well and topped the mini fridge up with beer, soft drinks and water. There were a few days when we didnt get clean towels until the early afternoon and there were a few ants in the room a couple of days. The buffet restaurant was a bit hit and miss, really nice food one night then not so good the next, the water and ice in there is fine it is all bottled! Breakfast is definately the best meal and they do try to cater for everyone. Some of the plates have chips in them and when we were late eating they did run out of plates a few times but they would be replaced after about a two minute wait. The grounds are kept really nice and the pools are really clean, the entertainment is good and the staff speak english but they do like it if you have a go at speaking spanish. The beach is lovely. We had friends staying in a 5 star hotel and we walked there a few times, took nearly 2 hours along the beach which was a really nice walk. We had a great time even in the tropical storms, we saw lots of people complaining about little things which they made into a big deal. If you go here expecting luxury and perfection you will be disapointed, go with an open mind and chill out you will have a great time, we loved it!
