{"text":"Everything You'd Expect from A Resort Vaca Just got back from the Cayena and had a blast! The Cayena is a smaller section of the larger LTI resort. As a guest at the Cayena you have a private area just for you! And, you also have access to the LTI. Also note, this is all-inclusive but @ $62 a day you'll get your money's worth.As a Cayena guest you have a private pool, restaurant, reception, and beach huts. The staff treat you like VIP's. The restaurant does not serve dinner, but the lunch there is great!The food is not five star, but you also have to take into account that you're not in the US or Europe. The buffets are good but alas buffets. The Estrella del Mar was not very good. I saw other people order off the non-included menu, but they didn't look much happier. The Trattoria was better with pizza a la carte as well as some buffet items. You can also pay for a bottle of nice wine. And, surprisingly, the pizza was very good. I would avoid most of the red meat, although I heard that the steak for lunch at the private Cayena restaurant was good. Myself, I stuck with mostly fish dishes and was impressed. PS- Don't worry about the water or ice they serve, filtered and fine, avoid the tap. Plus, they give you as much bottled as you need in your room and at the reception area.The people and staff are awesome, they end up being the highlight of your stay (other than the beautiful weather). Newton and Elvis were our bartenders who spoke both English and Spanish. Eventually we spoke Spanglish to each other. Give these guys a few bucks and they'll make your trip something to remember, especially if you like crazy frozen drinks. Also, you may want to bring a mug, I forgot and made more trips to the bar than necessary. The only guys that will grate on your nerves are the omnipresent timeshare clowns. But, once they know you're a guest they take the foot off the gas some, but it can be fun to watch them harass passer bys on the beach.The beach is near perfect. You will be approached by activity guys, just be honest, if you want to do something get a price, if not, just say so and they'll leave you alone. They are surprisingly good at remembering faces.I only left the resort to golf one day, which was good. It was set up by the resort staff and included everything in the price, transportation to the course, greens fees, cart, range balls. For the more adventurous I think making a day trip with a reputable company outside the resort would be fine. Just ask the staff who to go with and where.Overall, I was very happy with my experience. This is the perfect place to relax, tan and have some low key fun. Also, for Americans mostly, a lot of topless on beach, so don't be surprised. Here's to the Dominican people, cheers.
