{"text":"We'll be back to the Excellence My husband and I just returned from the Excellence two days ago and we can't stop talking about how wonderful our vacation was! As far as all-inclusive resorts go--this one was phenomenal! Not to mention that there aren't any kids around, so that is definitely a perk! We prepared ourselves by reading these reviews and we found them most helpful. After returning, we are completely surprised by the negative comments. People that complain about this resort would complain about finding a million dollars! At any resort or hotel anywhere in the world, you could find something that isn't 100% perfect, but if you dwell on the little mistakes or complain about it, then why go? For example, we didn't have washcloths one night and didn't get them until the next morning--big deal!! On the other side, our air conditioning stopped working and it was fixed within the hour. I won't remember the fact that we didn't have washcloths, but I will remember the fantastic service, the great food and the gorgeous environment. We booked a Junior Suite Garden view room without the Excellence Club and found it to be wonderful. It was always clean and had enough closet and drawer space to accomodate our needs. It was a nice, spacious room, and since we didn't spend that much time in it anyway, it was perfect.  The food was great. I wouldn't call it phenomenal, but it was really, really good. I recommend going to the Dominican Party on the beach (one night a week) and sample the authentic food, listen to the authentic music and allow yourself a little fun and dance with the staff members--its a lot of fun. Also, don't miss out on the daily lunch on the beach. They serve either BBQ or domincan food and it's a lot of fun. The staff members are above and beyond. I have never seen such genuinely kind and fun-loving people who work 14-24 days straight at least 12 hours a day. They are there to please you! Especially the staff that works the beach--I can't imagine walking all day in the hot sun and sand just to serve drinks. The activity staff is so fun to listen to and they really want you to join in, but the nice thing is--you don't have to play if you don't want to and they respect that. The beach is gorgeous and clean. There was plenty of space and huts\/chairs for everyone. The water was a bit rough, but very fun to be in and enjoy the waves. It felt cool after laying in the sun, but was warm enough to really enjoy being in it. The pools were beautiful and clean and just the beach--there is enough space to be away from everyone or to find yourself at the bar to strike up a conversation with someone. The drinks were awesome. You must try the mamajuana (the island drink), but beware--it's strong! Our favorite drink was the BananaMama--we drank them all day long! Don't forget to try the drink of the day each day--they are really tasty! The shows at 10:00pm are entertaining--especially the Michael Jackson show. It is all that it is cracked up to be! You can tell that it is also the favorite show to perform by the entertainment staff--they are really good and it's just a fun night.  The souvenirs are a bit expensive at the resort and they even bring in vendors at least three nights a week. For the best prices, you'll want to venture off the resort (on both sides of the beach) and there you'll find the little huts with local merchants. They are a bit pushy, but just know what price you want to pay and stick with it--just walk away if you aren't satisfied and they usually come down on the price. Try to bargain them down at least 50-75%. We had such an amazing time and we are already planning our return in the next few years. But this time, instead of 6 nights, we will be there a minimum of 10 nights. Thank you EXCELLENCE--you were perfect!!
