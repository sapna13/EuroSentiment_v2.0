{"text":"Dont stay here.... We have just returned from a few days at barcelona and stayed in the Spa Senator hotel. The only good thing about the hotel is that it is not far from the airport. If you are over to go to a football match the location is superb but if not do not stay here. It is very very far out from the centre of town about 1 hour to get to the marine or beach. The staff barr one guy were very rude and unhelpful! There is supposed to be free champagne on arrival but it is very well hidden and you have to ask for it - they were not impressed with this request! The decor of the rooms were horrible the walls and ceiling were a sickly colour greeny yellow!! My bed was also broken and creaked really badly everytime i moved. It gradually got worse and worse and i asked twice about getting it fixed and never heard anything about it they just took the details each time i went to reception and said they would look into it - but obviously couldnt be bothered to. There is a good continental style breakfast and they will cook eggs or omelettes but that is all the hot food. After 3 mornings there we saw someone with rashers and asked about them - they had them hidden behind so unless you knew about them you would think there was none. it was the beginning of October when we were there and it was very hot - but there was nowhere to sit outside the whole outside area closes the beginning of October until May so even though the weather was lovely you had nowhere to go to avail of it except to travel an hour or so to get to the beach!!The rudeness of the staff was the biggest off put it just does not put you in good form for your holiday when people are unfriendly.
