{"text":"I'm a Hilton Honors Member and will never stay here again I travel alot and I'm a HHonors Silver member and have stayed in tons of Hiltons as well as Hampton Inns, Embassy Suites etc. My 3 friends and I stayed the Caribe Hilton from August 29th to September 1st and I was disappointed by the quality of this Hilton. The first room I was given (we had booked two rooms for the 4 of us) smelled too musty and we refused to take it. It was in the HHonors tower. The front desk was kind enough to move us to a room on the 7th floor of the main building which as much nicer, odorless and had a great view. The breakfast buffet, which is a great spread, is a royal pain the neck as one has to wait sometimes over 35 minutes to get seated. It is very crowded and does not have the feel of a holiday resort. Our breakfast was included in our rate, but they ended up charging me for one day anyway..this was resolved at checkout.The beach is fake..no real beach here, they bring the sand in from somewhere. So you are better off hanging out by the pool, which is also very crowded.As we had also booked a Spa vacation, we had the pleasure of getting full body massages (which were super) as well as manicure\/pedicure treatments. I have no complaints about the Spa only that they need a better system of tracking what is included with the Spa package. Rooms were clean enough but the hotel seemed to be skimping on wash cloths..we had to request these twice.Overall: We paid $229\/person and this included breakfast + 3 spa treatments so it was well worth the money. But the smelly room, and crowded breakfast area means I will not return here. The first time I visited San Juan, we stayed at the San Juan Mariott and Stellaris Casino in Condado..now that was a beach resort, and perfectly clean and odorless hotel. That is where I will stay upon my return. ","annotations":[]}
