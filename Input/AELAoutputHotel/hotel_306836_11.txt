{"text":"Grand Bali Hotel, Sanur Just returned from a fabulous holiday in Bali again. When we arrived we stayed 1 night at The Conrad Hilton in Nusa Dua which was fabulous but quite expensive in Bali standards. The restaurants are also double the price of restaurants in Sanur and Kuta.We then took a taxi which cost about $10US to Sanur and checked in to the Inna Grand Bali Beach for 8 nights. We had stayed there before 6 years ago so more or less knew what to expect. We booked in the internet and the room rate was $65USD per room incl all taxes and American breakfast. Word of caution as people checking in on spec were being charged $130USD so make sure you book on the internet or call the hotel. We had a tower room which was clean but becoming rather tired and in need of some care, but we had a balcony directly overlooking the Indian ocean which was nice. The hotel was not busy at all as a result of the Bali bombings it seems and the locals are so desperate for tourists to return. The breakfast was ok but mostly catered for Japanese, Korean, Taiwanese etc but you could have eggs cooked to order, cereal, fresh fruits, toast, pancakes etc so quite good overall. Food and drink more expensive in the hotel as you would expect, so 15000 rupiah(about 0.80p) for a litre of beer outside and 35000 plus tax which was then 42000, about √ä√£¬¢2.50 in the hotel. Still not extortionate but money goes a long way outside the hotel. If your in need of Macdonalds, KFC or Dunkin Donuts they're just outside the hotel.Pool area still very nice and no problems getting sun loungers due to the under occupancy at the hotel. Last time we had to get down to the pool by 06.00hrs for a sunlounger but they were available all the time on this trip.The hotel staff and locals are as always very friendly and gracious and will do anything to help. The bars on the beachfront near the village area which is a 10 minute walk were very quiet every night and begging for peoples business. MOst closed around 23.00hrs. If you want nightlife then a short taxi ride into Kuta which will cost around $8USD and its al happening there till the very late hours, and every kind of bar available.All in all a great trip and the Grand Bali Beach is still excellent value, but you get what you pay for.....For real luxury and pampering then Nusa Dua hotels but they are more expensive and outside the bars are also double the prices of Sanur and Kuta.The Club Bali Mirage is all inclusive and located in Nusa Dua and good value at $135USD per night per room for 2 people.[--]All the best if you visit Bali and you'll fall in love with the island.
