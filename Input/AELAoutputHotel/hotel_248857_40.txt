{"text":"Amazing, beautiful, handsome hotel Mr. O took me to Berlin for a surprise weekend. We booked into The Mandala Hotel on the Potsdamer Strasse. There is also another Mandala Hotel but I reckon the location of the one we choose was best suited to the purpose of our break which was to sample the atmosphere of the German Xmas markets and do some shopping. As soon as our taxi pulled up in front of the Hotel the Concierge greeted us and took our bag for us to Reception. Then once we had checked in, he again took receipt of our bag and escorted us to our room; one of the Management Suites on the sixth floor. This included a kitchen, a walk in wardrobe, a living room with Study area, a patio terrace with views overlooking the Christmas Market below and two further built in wardrobes. I could move in there tomorrow!! The concept of the hotel is to create a home away from home and it certainly achieves that goal and then some. The bed was very comfortable and the great thing is in the morning there is not a sound to be heard from House Keeping going about their chores; no knocking your door or vacuuming the room next door, etc. Also a television placed mid centre of the room swivelled to allow one to watch television either from the couch or from the bed; not that we had much chance to watch television as there was so much else to do. Accompanying this was a powerful Grundig stereo system with a handful of music CD's to get one in the right mood.The restaurant on the fifth floor was full on the first morning so we had breakfast in the bar on the first floor which offered a wide selection of different beverages; fruit juices, lattes, cappuccinos, green tea etc. There was a wide selection of breads, cheeses, cold meats, different types of spreads and also one could order hot food from the kitchen; eggs, waffles (not to mention the small little fruit tarts and mini chocolate cakes!!). We managed to have a table in the restaurant the following day and the surrounding was absolutely fabulous; the sun came in through the glass roof top and also there were some very ornate interesting water displays. They had thought of everything including small stools for ladies to put their handbags on; which all restaurants should have as who wants to put their Bottega Veneta on the floor!!As guests of the hotel, we had access to the Wellness Spa and Fitness Lounge; located on the top floor of the hotel. In the Sauna Room there was a big window offering great panoramic views across Berlin. Also the walls were adorned with very sexy prints of men throughout which would make one sweat even if the work-out didn't; it couldn't have been more exciting!! Also there were Laundry Rooms on all the floors which housed a washing machine and dryer and an iron and ironing board, so one could do one's last minute ironing if needs be before one headed out into Berlin. There was even a television in the Laundry Room which one could watch while the Laundry was being done.The hotel's location is great; it's very close to a lot of the main cultural  political places of interest; the Holocaust Memorial, the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag, Checkpoint Charlie, the Tiergarten, the Sony Centre, etc. And not forgetting of course the Potsdamer Strasse itself. Also everything was within easy reach either by foot or by metro; the U-Bahn. Furthermore the market just outside the hotel was one of the best Markets we saw on our trip and to have it literally at one's doorstep was such a treat. There were ski slides and various other forms of entertainment at the market and Mr. O and I had great fun going down the ski slope on big inflatable rubber tyres.This is one of the best hotels that I have ever stayed in and we will definitely book into the Mandala Hotel again if we are back in Berlin which seems a certainty after this wonderful trip.G Lee ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1672,"mention":"tea","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tea"],"startOffset":1669},{"endOffset":1714,"mention":"breads","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Bread"],"startOffset":1708},{"endOffset":1829,"mention":"waffles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waffle"],"startOffset":1822},{"endOffset":1829,"mention":"waffles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waffle"],"startOffset":1822},{"endOffset":1829,"mention":"waffles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waffle"],"startOffset":1822},{"endOffset":1829,"mention":"waffles","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Waffle"],"startOffset":1822},{"endOffset":1874,"mention":"tarts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tart"],"startOffset":1869},{"endOffset":1893,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1884},{"endOffset":1899,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1894},{"endOffset":1874,"mention":"tarts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tart"],"startOffset":1869},{"endOffset":1893,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1884},{"endOffset":1899,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1894},{"endOffset":1874,"mention":"tarts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tart"],"startOffset":1869},{"endOffset":1893,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1884},{"endOffset":1899,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1894},{"endOffset":1874,"mention":"tarts","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Tart"],"startOffset":1869},{"endOffset":1893,"mention":"chocolate","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chocolate"],"startOffset":1884},{"endOffset":1899,"mention":"cakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cake"],"startOffset":1894}]}
