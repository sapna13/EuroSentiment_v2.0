{"text":"Convenient, Very Nice and Accomodating Booked my room through Rakuten.com (English). The room was very convenient to the Ikebukuro train station, a 3 minute walk once you find your way to the correct exit. There were 3 of us and the room had 3 separate beds which took up much of the space. We were on the 12th floor. The room was standard but only used it for sleeping. It had all usual Asian hotel amenities as well as free internet service in your room or down in the business center. The service of the front desk was very good like most of Japan. We didn't eat in the hotel restaurants as they seemed a little pricey for the buffet, $42 for dinner and $23 for breakfast, and my wife is quite picky. We did try the pastry shop in the hotel which was very good and reasonable. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance. In addition, we found the department stores all have a very large food stalls, vendors that one can eat fairly cheaply with wonderful choices for all tastes. The Tobu Department store is located within the train station. Lastly, great props to the hotel for allowing us to leave part of our luggage as we left Wednesday for Kyoto for 2 nights and didn't want to transport everything. We re-packed four suitcases into one suitcase, a backpack and a small Sportsac and left 3 suitcases at the hotel. The good thing is we missed the typhoon when we went to Kyoto and when we returned the weather was hot, humid but clear. We picked up our luggage actually 4 days later on Saturday and the hotel didn't mind at all. I asked if I owed them anything for the storage and they said no. That's an indication of the service you can expect in Japan.
