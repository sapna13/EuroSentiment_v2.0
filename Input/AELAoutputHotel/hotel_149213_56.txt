{"text":"Barcelo Babaro Palace  We booked our vacation for Barcelo Babaro Palace with MK Tours,they say one price on the internet, then when you call the price is about $400. more pp.The room was not a 5 star, but like a 2, it smelled, bathtub with mildew, doors and walls cracked, lousy decoration. But worst was the food, the second day my husband got sick with diarehea, not even Emodium stopped it till we got back. We met 4 other couples, all men in group got stomach virus as well, one had a very high fever. About 5PM, went to get beach towels, completely out, had to go see Guest services, took over an hour to get 2 towels. By 6PM, most rooms did not have hot water to bathe. The staff at the restaurants were not friendly, or helpful, we had to ask over and over to bring us cokes, or water, or butter. We wanted coconut ice cream, it is not placed out with the other ice creams in the buffet (so that people won't consume it). Incredible. Most of the time, the staf would tell me they did not have any, so I would go to the Supervisor, and then it would be given to me. Hotel is also very controlled, one can not get a taxi from outside to go anywhere, but have to use their services or MK Tours, so the charge is tripple. Ran out of sun protection lotion, here in the states about $8.00 for a good one, there it was $29. Other clientele complaint about their high prices even on Pepto Bismol, which should be provided by hotel, since it's their food or water that got everyone sick. MK TOURS was not help. In fact, we tried getting a tour, outside on the beach we could get it for $75. - another agency at the hotel for $85. but MK Tours wanted us to pay $90. We complaint, and they said they would give it to us for $85. We accepted. Got home and our Visa was charged $90. I booked 3 moths ahead, included Friday and Saturday stay to see Willy Chirino in concert, his concerts were changed to Sundays, so we could not see it. Going to the airport, the bus had to stop several times, as several people had to throw up. I would never go back to Barcelo Bavaro Hotels, or go with MK Tours. Horrible experience, the only wood thing was the Catamaran ride, excursion to Alto de Chacon, the beach with it's clear water and the nice people we met and became friends with. But overall, Cancun is much nicer, the hotels are 1st class, and the people are friendlier, even in the Bahamas, but not with Barcelo, who's owners are from Spain, and only care about their money.Don't Waste Your Money With Mk Tours, Or At Barcelo Bavaro Hotels, Management Does Not Care About Their Clientele, Or People Getting Sick.
