{"text":"Amsterdam weekend Stayed at the Novotel 30th August - 1st September. Arrived at Schipol 10.35hrs, bought All-in-one ticket which gave us train to RAI station, all tram and bus transport for 3 days (19.70Euros) each. Checked into hotel just before 12 noon. Very easy, staff on reception were excellent, in our room by 12.10hrs. Room spotless with tea\/coffee, minibar, adequate wardrobe and hangers, shelves and dressing-table space all good. Large double bed very comfortable and having stayed here on previous occasions, we found all the bedrooms had been recently upgraded and the rest of the hotel is undergoing work - it will not inconvenience you. The bar is cosy, on the ground floor and will not deter your sleep. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and good menu for the average appetite - go to Amsterdam if you want anything a la carte, because this menu is nice, good cooking but not O.T.T. and prices are good. Breakfast is brilliant, plenty of hot food, cereals, fruits, yogurts, juices, cold meats, breads and cakes of various types, and piping hot tea or coffee. Many different coffees and teas to suit all taste buds. The staff are all very friendly and the tables and cutlery are spotless. It is a very modern hotel and as others say, it isn't typically Dutch style, but it is so easy to get into town on the no. 4 tram, and much to see on the way, this will always be my choice of hotel. We both look forward to our next visit. Thank you Novotel.
