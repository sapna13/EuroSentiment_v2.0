{"text":"Good Location for Walking, So-So for Families w\/Kids My husband, 18 month old son and I stayed here for 2 nights in July. We would consider staying here again, if unable to find a better-value property.Given our short time in the city and young child, our priority was to be in a location that allowed us to sightsee on foot\/stroller and quickly return if we needed naps. The location was excellent for this. It is a 10 minute walk from the Centraal Station, so we were easily and affordably able to take a train from the Airport. It is also surrounded by restaurants, shops and small grocery markets. We had no problems finding a place to eat or pick up odds and ends. A 15-20 minute walk in any direction allowed us to see tons of attractions. A possible downside on the location for those families with kids is that it is quite close to the Red Light District which wasn't a problem as our son is so young, but might give rise to interesting questions and conversations if he was older...The facility itself proved to be less than we expected. Given the price we paid and the reputation of the Crowne Plaza (and stays in CP's in other locations), we were underwhelmed by the room's dated furniture and decor. The beds were comfortable however and the room appeared clean.One other note about the room--the in-room mini-fridge operates on a system that charges you for each stock item removed (we only found those instructions on the inside of the fridge). So, even though you don't consume a can of Coke, just moving it to squeeze a botte of milk in will add the cost of the Coke to your bill. We were presented with a list of such costs, but folks at the desk were obliging in removing the charges when we explained that we had not consumed any items.
