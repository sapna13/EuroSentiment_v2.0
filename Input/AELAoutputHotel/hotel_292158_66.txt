{"text":"Fantastic Holiday We stayed in the palladium punta cana from 3-18 July and we had a fantastic time. I have read a lot of reviews on this complex and i was worried but please ignore the people who have had a good moan, they must have been unlucky as we had no complaits. We stayed in room 4212 and had no problems with any of the room half way through the holiday my partner broke the toilet seat we didnt even report it and the next day once the cleaner had been it was fixed. and we wasnt charged for it. The cleaners start work at 8-5 so somtime in the morning it can be a little loud but we was up most days before 8. You can use all the other hotels resturants on the complex the best buffet for the evening we found was the bavaro it had a little more option, but the other buffets were fine. We tried all the a La Cartes except the Dominican,Italian a la Carte are amazing, the others were all very good we couldnt complain. The Staff are all very friendly there english isnt the best i must admit but your in there country so maybe try and learn a few phases if not dont worry as we didnt and we was fine. The beach was amazing but dont sun bath there the first day we burnt to a crisp! HA HA AS FOR THE TOWELS there is loads of people saying you have to get up at 6am to put towels down.... this is Crap! the latest we put our towels down was just after 8 to make sure we had a parasol and there was still loungers left. sometime when we got up late and didnt get down to 9 we couldnt get a parasol. we did our trips through the reps as you dont want to be ripped off by someone down the beach. we did Soana island and speedboats both fun. There wasnt meny english people when we was there manly american and spanish. Overall we had a great holiday and had no complaints.
