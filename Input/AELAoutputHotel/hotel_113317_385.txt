{"text":"Its the little extras that count The Casablanca Hotel, Times Square, New York.Trip Advisor member - Staffordshire, U.K.04-June-2007We have just returned from the Casablanca and really must thank all of the staff for ensuring that we had a good holiday. Everyone of them went out of their way to help us, and provided a professional and courteous service. The hotel is situated next to Times Square which is the busiest part of New York. After a day spent trekking around the city it was a pleasure to return in the evening to the complimentary cheese and wine buffet in Ricks cafe (between 5.30 and 8.00). Ricks cafe also provides free computer \/ internet use and free coffee from the vending machine 24\/7. The buffet breakfast is adequate to start the day with a choice of cereals, croissants and fresh fruit etc. We booked a Queen room but were upgraded to a King room on the 5th floor. The room was a reasonable size for New York with a nice bathroom, however, ask for a rear room if you are a light sleeper. The air conditioning units are fitted into the windows and if being used you can hear the outside hubble (it seemed like an emergency vehicle passed by every time we dropped off to sleep. We eventually turned the unit off and shut the window which made it a lot quieter, sleep or be cool, its your choice.Overall an excellent hotel in the centre of Manhattan. One word of warning! We could not get a taxi to JFK airport on Friday afternoon. Taxis stopped but refused to do the trip. After an hour we ended up takeing the bus from the Port Authority Depot 2 blocks away. Due to congestion (probably why the taxis wont go) the journey took nearly 2 hours and we only just made the flight.
