{"text":"Nice location, clean room, good service, noise problems I stayed for 10 days in a room with 2 queen-size beds with a nice view over the bay and GG bridge.The room was nicely decorated and very clean, and the beds were reasonably comfortable. Room service was prompt and friendly.The staff clearly pays attention to detail. Umbrella in the closet, NYTimes on the doormat in the mornings, coffeemachine in the bathroom (well, allright) with two fresh Starbucks coffeepads every day. Once the roomservice found out that I used both coffeepads in the morning, they silently upgraded me to three. It's those little things that make you feel at home.Free internet was available (by ethernet cable) which worked reasonably well, although the connection was sometimes slow and unstable.I liked that I could open the window in the room and get some fresh ocean air. Nice.The minuses are mostly about noise. The ventilation system would not turn off completely (the airconditioning could) and sometimes produced considerable noise, also during the night. The minibar produces a quite audible hum. The sound insulation between rooms was such that I could hear the neighbours having the oldest fun in the world in full detail. And the touristy environment means that once you open the window, you get some street noise (street music, idiots thundering around on motorcycles with afterburners) as an added bonus.If you are not bothered by noise (or wear earplugs during the night), the Argonaut Hotel is a very good place to stay. If it weren't for the ventilation system and sound insulation, I would have rated it as excellent.Tip: I was pleasantly surprised by the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. The historical ships just opposite the hotel are wonderful, especially the three-masted cargo ship Balclutha and the wooden ferryboat Eureka.
