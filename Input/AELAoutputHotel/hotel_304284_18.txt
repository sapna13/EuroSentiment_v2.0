{"text":"Reasonable rates and fantastic location! My sister and I stayed four nights at the Asia Center, and had a great experience. We made reservations a week before our stay, and were fortunate enough to get a double room. On the downside, the double room was located in a corner of the first floor, which also seemed to be storage place for sheets and cleaning materials. That was definitely a minus. The room also faced the small hotel carpark, which meant that we had to keep the windows closed and curtains drawn. However, the staff were happy to switch us to a room on a higher floor. They also loaned to us a portable air-conditioner so the room wouldn't get too stuffy.Now, for the pluses:- The hotel is a 5-minute walk away from the Aoyama-Itchome subway stop, which we found extremely useful. The Ginza line took us to most tourist destinations, while the Uedo line brought us to the Tsukiji fish market. It was so convenient getting around!- We stopped by the 3 coffee places we found between the hotel and subway station, and they all served great coffee and breakfast snacks.- The hotel is located in a neighborhood that gives off a tranquil and safe vibe. Also, if you get hungry late at night, there is a 24-hour convenience store situated close to the hotel.- Finally, the staff at the reception were very helpful and spoke English well. This was a BIG plus, esp. since I only know a limited number of Japanese phrases. They provided helpful instructions on using a hotel shuttle bus to get to Narita airport, and also gave us helpful directions on getting to other places for sightseeing.Overall, the biggest plus is the convenient location of the hotel. The rates are also very reasonable, so I will definitely stay here again during my next trip to Tokyo!
