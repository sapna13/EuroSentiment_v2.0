{"text":"loved it!!! i absolutely LOVED this resort. i have travelled extensively, and this was the best all inclusive I've been to. The restaurants were great, 1st night went to the Grill, and within 10 minutes a perfectly cooked steak was served, excellent, since we were very tired.The staff at the desk was wonderfull, the service from all the staff perfect. I had the sense that the employees take pride in this resort. I really liked the food, and the service was wonderfull. I spent quite a bit of time in the lobby, which is a perfect place to plop down late afternoon, read a book and have a drink in the deep shade. Amando, the bartender was wonderfull. Here's an example of what I consider great service, and it's something very small:I was standing about 10 feet from the bar, and Amando was obviously about to leave and go get something when he noticed me, and immediatley came over, asked me if I would like a drink, then took care of it with a smile. It's very small, but impressive. I tended bar for 8 years, and i couldn't beleive how he went out of his way. That's the way it was all week. Shout out to Reyna, the young woman who brought us drinks on the beach when the wind was blowing the sand like shrapnel!! She was always very sweet.The activities staff, fransisco, ricardo, Inez and the whole gang were very nice, even though I'm not much of a joiner.the room was immaculate, and the maid service very good. I could go on and on about all the small courtesies extended. There are plenty of chairs, plenty of shade, but some people still feel the nned to mark thier chairs, and don't bother to remove the towels when they are done so somone else can use them. That is not the resort's fault, and I had little trouble finding a place to park. 99.99% of the fellow guests were very friendly and didn't act like this was the first time they got out of the house. There were a very small few who were trying to beat the house and drink waaay too much. One young man was slurring thinly vieled slurs at the staff. They treated him with more dignity than he treated them, 2 afternoons in a row a large group parked right in front of our room and needed to scream at each other over the alcohol. They screamed across the pool, they screamed up to the balconies, and they screamed to the person standing next to them. Thank gooodness they lost steam after two days. I love my siesta!!!! These things are not the fault of the resort, and these people stuck out like trailer trash at a polo match. 99.99% of the guests were wonderfull.If you can't have a good time at this place, I doubt you can have a good time. Some people can't be pleased. Oh and go horseback riding, not the free 30 minutes. Go for an hour (short money) and gallop down a perfect beach! Thank you Pierre!
