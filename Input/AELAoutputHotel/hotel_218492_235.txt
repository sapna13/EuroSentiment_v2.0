{"text":"Just ok... Nothing great I stayed at the GOPC from Dec 29 - Jan 5. The weather was pretty poor. I was in Punta Cana last April and did not have one ounce of rain. This week it rained 4 \/7 days and when it wasn't raining it was either cloudy or very windy. I guess Dec is their rainy season.... Now for the review of the resort:CHECK IN \/ CHECK OUT: Prior to the trip, I called the resort twice to ask if I could check-in early and both tiems they said yes, check in at noon would be no problem. My partner and I arrived at the resort at 1pm and our room wasn't ready. We waited until 4pm. Not really a big issue though - we dropped our luggage at the front, grabbed some lunch and explored the resort.Checking out was a breeze. No problem.GROUNDS:The grounds were exceptionally clean and well kept. We always saw employees of the resort working hard up keeping the gardens, or picking up any trash along the resort. RESORT:The resort is nice, however I think it looks much better in pictures. The resort is well laid out, however some of the rooms\/buildings look run down and in need of some serious renos.PEOPLE\/ SERVICES:Some of the staff were friendly, however we found that most were not. We found that we did not get what we wanted until we threw some money at the situation. As mentioned by previous guests, most of the employees do not speak English. Our maid only knew three english words: clean, coke and thank you.The staff in the Amercian Grill (one of the restaurants) were terrible. We (along with other guests) tried to order pizza at 11pm and they got very annoyed. They were also so slow and extremely lazy. It took over 45 minutes for us, and others, to receive our pizza or burgers. ALso, during checkout, we randomly overheard two of the reception staff talking about how two of the American Grill staff were fired last Friday. I wasn't surprised at all. They were horrible. FOOD:My partner and I found the food to be almost terrible, but I knew other people who found it to be ok. I found like most of the resort, the food catered mostly to Eastern European tastes. I also was extremely unimpressed with the food times. If you missed breakfast, it was 2 hours until lunch, and if you missed lunch it was 3 hours until dinner. The variety of food was also pretty poor. Same thing everyday it seemed.BEACH:The beach was great. However, I previously stayed at the Princess and the beach there was much better. Sand was much cleaner and the water was much calmer. If beach condition \/ location is very important to you, I would strongly advise that you book else where as this resort is right next to a marina, which means there are constantly numerous boats in the water, making noise and creating large waves. Also, there was a lot of seaweed that was constantly being washed up on shore. Some guests have said that you need to reserve a beach chair by 6am or 7am. We did not find this to be true at all. We were there during a very busy time of the year, and we never had any trouble finding beach chairs around 11am, 1pm 2pm or later. ROOM:We stayed in room 7201, the master junior suites. It was a very large spacious room with a jaccuzi. The only issue we had with the room was that it had a very strong musty\/mold smell the entire week and our fridge did not work at all. Also, on the first day our a\/c did not work, however we called front desk and someone was up within a few hours and it was fixed.OTHER: One poster mentioned that many ppl harassed him\/her about buying time shares. We did not have one person approach us about this during the entire trip. However, be very careful about the vendors on the resort. They are EXTREMLY pushy and they try to rip you off. I wanted to buy a necklace and the man told me it would be $85 because it was a rare dominican stone. I laughed at him and told him I would give him $10. He said ok. When they give you a price for something, divide that number by at least 4 (seriously) and that should bring the price down to a reasonable number.OVERALL: I woudln't return to the GOPC. I did not like how the resort catered almost exclusively to Europeans, and I did not like the beach location of the resort. The food was also almost inedible for my partner and I.
