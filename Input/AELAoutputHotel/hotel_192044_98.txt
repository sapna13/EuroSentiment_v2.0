{"text":"expected better from all of these reviews We were looking forward to our stay given the high praise here on TA. We booked on the hotel website thinking we might get a better room location. Arrived to the hotel about 10:00 am from the US. No early checkin as requested. They said the hotel was full the night before so this was understandable. The spanish girl at checkin was excellent. Always consistently pleasant. Concierge was not overly helpful as stated here. We had a double deluxe room which was nice and roomy. Stay away from 321 or any rooms at the end of the hall near the housekeeping closets. You will hear the housekeepers making noise early in the morning. We rise very early in the morning so it didn't bother us. But, if you like to sleep in it may bother you. Also we had a view of the station in the back of the hotel and we could hear the trains screeching into the station even with the double glazed windows. The first night the air conditioning didn't work and maintenance was off duty. The concierge who's name starts with an A ,can't remember argued with me about this is the way it is. AC don't blow hot air! Anyway asked to be moved to another room. A said he would get back to us and never did. In the mean time we exhausted from our trip and fell asleep. The next morning went to the front desk and recv'd excellent service after complaining about the night before. A maintenance man was in our room within 10 min and fixed the problem. We came back to our room that day to find delicious chocolates and fresh fruit to congratulate us on our wedding anniversary which was very much appreciated. The second day housekeeping changed our very soft sheets to new scratchy ones. Asked that night for our sheets to be changed to soft ones as they felt horrible. Housekeeping was off duty and the front desk sent up two assistant managers who never smiled or apologized. They changed the sheets in complete silence obviously annoyed. They only uttered the same old party line That's the way they are. Breakfast and service was okay. The first morning we arrived late and they were not refilling all of the hot items. I didn't ask either. The coffee was some of the worst coffee I ever had and I love coffee. My husband would get me coffee in the neighborhood at the starbucks at the train station. I usually don't favor starbucks coffee here in the states because it often tastes burnt but it was declicious. The neighborhood is not the most attractive but we new that already and booked for the location to the bridges and Tower of London. The Riverwalk,The Market it's superb. The big red bus tour stops are close by and we did that while waiting for our room. It was a nice way to relax,see the sights to deal with first day tiredness from lack of sleep on the plane. You also get a ticket to use within 24 hrs for a river boat ride on the Thames. We used that the next day to go from Tower Pier to Westminster Pier as we had plans to see the Abbey which is an absolute must see. Pay a little extra and ask for the Verger Tour which is guided with a very informative guide. The cabinet war rooms were great for world war II history buffs. Underground bunker museum about Churchill and that period. Also see the Southwark Cathedral that is close by. A great chip shop is also on the corner. Ask them to fry you cod if it's not out. Prader and Manger around the corner were great for a quick salads and sandwiches. Always fresh and reasonably priced. Would I stay here again no, customer service was not up to par. tTere are too many other hotels and different beautiful locations in London worth seeing.
