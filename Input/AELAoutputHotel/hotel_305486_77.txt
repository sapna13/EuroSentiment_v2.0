{"text":"Good Hotel, Good Value - Don't know why other reviewers didn't like it ! This review is quite delayed because I stayed here in Aug 2005. I was recently researching hotels on Tripadvisor for my Dec 2006 trip to Singapore and I came across many bad reviews for this hotel which surprised me considering my past stay there.I'm not sure if I have low standards or low expectations compared to other guests in this hotel but I've found the Golden Landmark to be a good hotel and good value for money. The rooms were clean, the sheets are not torn, towels were clean and basic toileteries were provided. The lifts are busy because its a busy hotel but they were clean and all were operational.The reception staff were professional and polite - not friendly or chatty. When we arrived they did their job, flashed the usual smiles and moved on to the next guest. That left us no time to judge their friendliness or indulge in touristy chitchat - but the staff were certainly NOT rude in any manner.Golden Landmark was most certainly good when I stayed there in Aug '05. If you want to experience what bad means then you gotta stay in Aspinals Hotel in Little India - I did that in Dec '06 and realized how good Golden Landmark was.For Indians this hotel has a surprise - it has an inhouse Indian restaurant which serves buffet and regular Indian food. We used to dine here regularly and the food was always decent.Breaskfast was included in our package and was well laid out with choice of juices, cerealls, fresh fruits, tea and coffee etc.The location of hotel is nice for shopping in Bugis Junction and Bugis village. The Bugis MRT is below the Bugis junction and its a short 5-7 min walk from the hotel.
