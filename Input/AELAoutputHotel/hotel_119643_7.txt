{"text":"Value? Our family stayed here for three days and have mixed feelings about the hotel. We loved the location, it was off the beaten path, but close to Union street which had lots to look at and eat. The marina district was fun to get to know and we enjoyed our time away from the hotel. The hotel recently (I guess) has had some issues with structural support or something, because there were exposed support pillars with yellow tape put all over them holding up the second floor. We didn't notice any sagging or dangerous looking cracks, but it wasn't what we expected when arriving. The walls and ceiling were thin in our room and we joked about the dinosaurs wrestling upstairs each night. The pool was small, but the weather wasn't hot enough for that to be an issue. Parking was free, but if you couldn't find a parking space inside the courtyard you had to park next door where there are signs every 10 feet telling you to take everything out of your car which doesn't leave you with the most confident feeling about the neighborhood. Our room was small, but clean and functional. The bathroom was Parisian in size and didn't have space to place our daily toiletries . Breakfast was very basic (coffee, orange juice, rolls) and we ended up eating breakfast away from the hotel to fill up. The overall value of the hotel is questionable. We paid $177 a night thinking we would save money on parking and breakfast, but it didn't work out as well as planned. San Francisco is an expensive place, so I am not sure if there are better places out there for families looking to cut costs. Next time I go to SF I will probably not stay at the Hotel Del Sol.
