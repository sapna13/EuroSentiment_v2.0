{"text":"Not worth the money The hotel is coveniently located opposite the Hung Hom train stations, with trains coming from and leaving for the Chinese mainland. We arrived by train from Guangzhou and immediately saw the hotel from the train terminal. But then... how to get to the lobby? No indications for pedestrians, so we took the risk and walked over the windy fly-over for taxi's (later we found out that you could enter through the shopping mall) - a strange way of entering a hotel. We booked a junior suite with harbour view for just over 200 USD per night. Never seen such a small 'suite' in my life. It was like they just had put a wall in a standard room, but the we heard that the standard rooms were truly half the size of our mini suite. We're not claustrophobic, but you would almost become so after staying a while in this hotel. It was impossible to stand in the bathroom with two persons.And then the harbour view... We only saw construction works that took away any view of the harbour - ridicoulous to pay 30 USD per night more for such a view. The downstairs outside swimming pool was a joke as well - nothing of the Hong Kong skyline to be seen as was advertised on the hotel's website. Housekeeping was only so-so - we didn't really noticed the room being cleaned, sheets were only changed once during our five day stay. Restaurants in the Metropolis are overpriced, given the mediocre quality of the food. Moreover, we were unlucky to be seated in the very windy lobby part of the restaurant, and were forced to have dinner with our coats on.The only positive thing we can think of is the convenient shuttle bus service to Kowloon center, every 20 minutes. For the rest - avoid this place! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":142,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":135}]}
