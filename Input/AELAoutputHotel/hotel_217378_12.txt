{"text":"Worst Experience Ever-AVOID AT ALL COSTS This hotel is not what it seems. When I looked up the hotel online the pictures were very deceiving. They only showed pictures of the best areas. When we arrived we were greeted by the valet which is the only way to park there and they charge $22 a day. The valet was not vey polite and there was no bell service outside. The front desk staff was polite but not professional. We asked the bellman in the lobby for help with a luggage cart and he said he was busy and that we could take the luggage cart up and bring it back down. I believe he was the only bellman working for an 18 story hotel. We finally get to the room and the room smelled like mold and smoke and the bedding was old and faded. There was a used glass laying on the floor, the roll of toilet paper was almost gone, and there were also stains on the walls. We were running late for an event so we left and returned at around 12:30am. We go back to the room and get into bed and we immediately started itching and started getting bitten by bed bugs. We called down to the front desk and asked for a manager. She told us to old on while she tried to find another room but she put us on hold and never came back. At this point we were fed up and decided to leave at almost 2am. On the way out we stopped at the desk and complained and asked for a refund but they refused and the girl at the desk had a horrible attitude. We had already called down for the car to be pulled around 20 minutes prior and still had to wait another 15-20 minutes outside. The valet staff this time was also rude. I would never stay at this hotel again. I have had 10 times better service and quality at hotels cheaper. It is not what it seems.
