{"text":"Plan to spend out of pocket for everything The grounds were lovely and the room was adequate. Many of the pools and hot tubs are open 24 hours which is very nice, especially when the days are so hot.The two unexpected disappointments were 1) despite the fact that the resort tacks a $25\/day resort fee onto your room, many of the listed amenities are somehow not covered by this fee. Want to play tennis on one of the seven courts? Plan on shelling out $20\/hour and buying a can of tennis balls for $5 from the tennis booth. Planning on bringing your own car? (I would recommend it since there is nothing within walking distance of the resort for shopping\/dining\/movies, etc.) Valet parking costs $25\/day and self parking costs $10\/day. Do those poolside tent cabanas look like a fun place to hang out? They range in price from $300 - $500!2) one of the three restaurants was, unbeknownst to us, closed for remodelling which severely limited the dining options. That left guests to chose from room service (very expensive with gratuities tacked onto the already way overpriced food), Wright's fine dining (good, very expensive, very decadent food, not a good place for a light meal in the heat of the day and not enough vareity on the menu when it is the only full-service restaurant on property right now) or The Cafe which is really a small deli where one has a very limited selection of pastries and sandwiches for anywhere between twice and five times the price they would be off the resort property. If you don't have a car (which we didn't) you are stuck with the limited food options and the highly overpriced dining options.That said, the pools, landscaping and staff were terrific. We enjoyed massages in the spa (the steam room and one of the showers in the spa men's locker room were broken and the locker room\/spa area could have been much cleaner) and the run of the property but we found that we kept asking staff how much does this cost?
