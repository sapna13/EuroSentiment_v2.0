{"text":"Honeymoon My wife and I went to IFA Villas for our honeymoon and it was awesome. There were some children there with their parents, but it was still awesome. we were there for 7 nights and it was the perfect length of time. BRING SUNBLOCK. We brought 3 bottles and still ran out on our last day. I was pretty well burned on the way home. It was all inclusive but i suggest bringing like 10 dollars in singles a day to tip. The staff there is very eager to please and they only make about $1600 a year in American money!! so tip well and you will be rewarded with a wonderful vacation. If you have never traveled to the DR be aware that when you get off of the airplane you will be swarmed by taxi drivers. I would highly recommend that you arrange your ride to the hotel ahead of time. The trip to the hotel was a little scary as there driving is a little different from us in the states. Do not buy cigars or alcohol from the beach vendors. the cigars are dry and usually fake. I bought my wife a necklace they asked $80 American for it. I ended up paying $15. It was fun to bargain with the people. Leave the house keepers tips and gifts. We brought a bunch of snacks for the airplane so we would leave cookies and chips with a couple of dollars for the cleaning people. on our 2nd to last night they covered our bed in flower pedals and made our bed up beautifully. I made a friend with one bartender. I tipped him well. about $80 total for the week and he hooked us up. I will not say any more, because I do not want him to get into trouble. DO NOT STAY NEAR THE BEACH STAY IN THE VILLAS. if you are unhappy with your room tell them that you requested to be in the villas and they will relocate you if they can. If you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ speak Spanish be prepared to use body language. some bartenders and hosts speak a little English but it is a challenge to get your point across. also be prepared to wait a little longer than you would in the states. you didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ go on vacation to New York, take it easy your in the DR. Hope you enjoy your stay.
