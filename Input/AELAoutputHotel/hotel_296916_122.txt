{"text":"And All That Jazz! It was a mother and daughter weekend, with the daughter arriving from New York early in the morning and the mother at noon from Milan. We had booked a 3 day Winter Sales Package, which included a bottle of champagne upon arrival and daily breakfast. I had asked the hotel if my daughter could check in early and they did not promise that the room would be ready. But when she arrived, since the standard room that we had reserved was not ready, she was upgraded to a junior suite for free! We had a lovely large space divided in two by a half wall, with a flat screen tv in front of the bed and a couch on the other side. If you do not like contemporary architecture and design, pick another hotel. I love it, so I felt perfectly at home surrounded by linear furniture, black, brown and white decor, and a new clean wooden floor that felt so much nicer than the worn out carpets that usually cover hotel room floors. Black and white photos of jazz playing instruments hands decorate the walls of the hotel and of the rooms.Service was extremely quick and kind, everything worked well, the bathroom had both a tub and a shower (again, it was all black and white, if you are into antiques, or decorated details, go elsewhere), lots of amenities, a powerful hair dryer, the only thing missing is a little shelf inside the shower stall to put the soap or foam bottle.The location of the hotel is perfect, at a few minutes walk from Placa Catalunya, and the first stop of the Bus Turistic right across the street, next to the Metro stop.Breakfast was abundant and with lots of things to pick from, the different varieties of breads were delicious.Our room was on the third floor, so unfortunately we felt the vibrations of the Metro beneath us, but only until 11 pm, and then again from 6 am, though at that hour we were still deeply asleep.So if I were to return to the Jazz Hotel, which I certainly would do, I would ask for a room on a higher floor. The noise from the street was not a problem at all. It was our first trip to Barcelona and the choice of this hotel, recommended by a friend of a friend, made it perfect.
