{"text":"Great Place to Stay We stayed at the H10 Universitat Hotel late September for the La Merce Festival. This hotel has a great location especially for the Procession as it started right underneath our balcony on the 4th floor. The room was a great size with an enormous bed (room 412) and the marble bathroom more than adequate with that power shower other travellers have mentioned. Although our room was at the front after we closed the balcony doors it was amazing how quiet the room was with only a distant rumbling from the metro. Some of the fittings in the room were a little tired but the location, size of room and most of all the amazing staff more than made up for this. Try and get a deal with the hot buffet breakfast thrown in - its really worth it - fantastic variety and that great service again. They also serve free rolls and pastries in the afternoon (in the bar area) - just right after a days sightseeing when you have come back for that shower and a siesta to set you up for the evening! For great Tapas try La Boqeria Market off La Ramblas - walk right to the back and have your super-fresh sea food cooked right in front of you at La Boqeria tapas bar - wonderful!! If you are there spring to end of September also try the night tour on the open top 'Bus Turistic' - very romantic and Barcelona by night is gorgeous! Will definately be using this hotel again.
