{"text":"Not cheap...but nice Stayed here for two nights this past weekend as we were in town for the Yankess\/Mariners series. First off, the location is great if you`re going to any games at Safeco or QWest Field. We walked to the ballpark every day and it`s maybe a 15 minute walk. Be warned, it`s uphill on the way back, but that`s why they have cabs. We actually walked down to the piers after the games and had dinner and drinks, so we were definitely cabbing it back to the hotel, cab ride ran about $10 with tip. The hotel was probably built in the `70s but it was still nice. Got a room with two double beds that were really comfortable, I slept great! The room had a nice flatscreen tv on a swivel stand. Bathroom was clean, they had complimentary high end toiletries. Shower could`ve had better water pressure, but no big deal. We were on the 22nd floor and I requested a room facing the water, quiet as a churchmouse all night, never heard any street traffic. And WOW, what a view....Elliott Bay, the two ballparks, high rises all around us! My sister and her family got a corner room for $20 more a night ($249) and they had same view as us plus views of the Space Needle and the Seattle Center. $229 a night is a little expensive but hey, you are in downtown Seattle. You are within walking distance or a short cab away from a lot of great things. Parking is $26 per day but if you`re a Marriott Rewards member, they`ll waive it, which I thought was great. When the Yankees come to town in `09 I`ll definitely be staying here again.
