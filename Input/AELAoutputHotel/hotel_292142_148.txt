{"text":"Comfort and Convenience - Affinia has it all After much research via tripadvisor reviews and the tripadvisor forums which are great for finding information, reviewed over a period of a few months, I finally settled on the Affinia Dumont. True to other people's reviews it truly was a nice, comfortable and central hotel in New York City. We stayed here May 4th to May 10th. Prior to arriving I telephoned the hotel to request a floor change to a higher floor, and because of the professional manner of the reservation person dealing with my request I felt reassured and was looking forward to my trip . I was delighted to receive a room on the 35th floor, overlooking 34th street, with of view of the Chrysler building. With time difference we awoke the first morning at 5am to a fantastic sunrise.we booked a one bedroomed suite, myself, husband and 14yr old daughter. Glad we done this as my daughter was able to go to bed whilst we stayed up to watch TV.Beds are extremely comfortable and very large. Not enough clothes hangers though. There is also full size ironing board and iron, plus a laundry service available. No teapot, or kettle but you could boil a pot of water on the full size cooker. Suggest you bring a small teapot with you if you like to make tea. Coffee maker was great with coffee replenished each day by the maid. And daily newspaper left on door handle each morning was nice. I also asked reception for a bath rubber slip mat which was delivered promtly within 10 minutes to our room. Yes decor is alittle dark - browns and creams but no damaged furniture, or torn wallpaper so overall to me rooms are fine. But I am not into hotels with flamboyant colours and retro furniture. We paid approximately $350 more over the full week for the one bedroom which was well worth the extra. And compared to other hotels the prices are average for the Affinia Dumont. I compared many hotels using TA prior to my decision.Staff:Friendly and doorman advised us to watch our backpacks especially around Times Square. My phone charger would not work there and a Manageress, I think her name was Grace brought me to the basement area and found a charger for my phone which I returned on leaving at no extra cost. This was very much appreciated by me.Would definitely consider returning to Affinia Dumont again. Hope to get back next year.
