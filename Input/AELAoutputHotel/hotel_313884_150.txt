{"text":"Nice Hotel but The Food is below average Me and My new wife stayed here for our Honeymoon.Overall view of the hotel - very clean and great pool and beach but the food is not the best - dont expect great food here you wont get it.Check in - Very good - cold towels and drink are nice touches. When we checked in they asked for the copy of our marriage certificate and took it away and photocopied it. We expect a upgrade or something else but when we got to the room it was just the same as all the others - excepet they brought a basket of fruit and a bottle of rum to the room later on.Pool and beach - Brilliant, If you like lying aroung the pool all day then this is the place for you. The swim up bar is great and Nelson will put a smile on your face straight away - hes always smiling. Try the coco loco's they are superb. You wont go thirsty with Neslon serving you as soon as you coming to the end of your drink another one is placed in front of you- Great. The beach is very clean and I loved the sea - great waves.The staff are very friendly , not one member of staff whilst passing failed to say ola. We didnt tip much , just the maid for the room which she kept spotless and the lobby bar waitress who kept sure our table was never wanting for anything.Food - The biggest disappointment at this Hotel. The buffet is OK but not great and the Restaraunt are only slightly better. We Eat at the Italian and were very Disapointed and the Chinese was OK. We did have fun at the Fondue cooking our food at the table but again the food is just passable. We did eat at La Cava and that was very nice - the best meal we had all two weeks we stayed there.The entertainment is very poor for a Adult only resort and a 5 star hotel. They all try their best but I expected better.Me and my wife were ill with bad stomachs and spent most of the first week on the Toilet but we were much better the second week - Not blaming the Hotel for that just Bad luck I suppose.But overall very nice hotel and resort but dont expect great food or you will be very disapointment ","annotations":[{"endOffset":4,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":0},{"endOffset":282,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":278},{"endOffset":1452,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1445},{"endOffset":1452,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1445},{"endOffset":1452,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":1445},{"endOffset":1984,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1980}]}
