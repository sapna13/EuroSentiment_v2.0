{"text":"Good experience at the Bilderberg Garden Stayed 3 nights - originally booked here as the hotel had A\/C, althought with the chilly weather we never needed it. The hotel is a bit further out (about a 15 minute tram ride into main part of town) but in a very nice area. There are some restaurants nearby (except Sunday morning almost everything was closed) The room was very nice and spacious, the linens very nice quality, and I thought the bathroom spacious and new. The people at front desk were efficient and pleasant -- however when we asked at front desk to purchase a pass for the trams (something their room manual says they can do) we were told they were out of them with no other explanation or offer - i.e. we can get some by the next day,etc). After three nights here we wanted to get a little bit closer to town, and would have stayed at the bilderberg vondel but by then it was all booked up, so we moved to another hotel (hotel vondel) . I did book our Bilderberg room via the hotel's website - after a couple of weeks I went back on the site, and noticed the rates had gone down -- I contacted the hotel and they honored the lower rate, so it is a good idea to keep checking the site especially if you are staying there over a weekend, as I think the bulk of their business is business travelers and it is more crowded during the week. A good place to stay if you don't mind hopping on the tram and riding into town to get most places (or you could also rent a bike downtown for the week and just lock it up at the hotel - it would probably only be a 20 minute bike ride to center of Amsterdam)You definitely get more room for your money being away from town. If you are a tourist you probably wouldn't want to stay here in the winter, as I think waiting for trams in the cold wouldn't be very pleasant, however in the spring\/summer it is a nice alternative.
