{"text":"Highly recommended We just got back from our stay at the Palladium and it was wonderful. The hotel grounds are enormous, clean, clean, clean. We could not say enough how clean the entire place is. There are 3 hotels in 1 resort grounds. You share with all 3. There are 3 pools, many resturaunts, 2 entertainment facilities, a train that takes you around the property. It runs every 15 minutes or so at little train stops. The food was very good, so much to choose from. There was a different theme each night. The 4 of us were completely satisfied each day with our choices. One of us is a vegitarian and her selections were big. The rooms were nice and clean. We were there May 14-21st and we had no problem getting seats at a tiki at the pool by 9am each day. The beach was more difficult, but who doesn't was a tiki on the beach but we found shade under a palm tree every day until a tiki opened up. The pool towels were big and fluffy. the only thing is (same at every resort) if you loose it they charge you $15.00 but who looses a giant beach towel??? The drinks were good, order them with mucho rum or mucho tequilla and you'll get it! We are tippers no matter where we go and we tipped the waitress and servers at all our meals. These people make allot less money than we do and $2.00 for 4 drinks is nothing compared to what is expected from servers here in the US. Our reservation dinners we left $10 b\/c the sevice is sharp. The Michael Jackson show is not to be missed. It was GREAT!! We did a excursion of mini speed boats...what a hoot! You have to try it, they take you boating in your own personal mini speed boat that you get to drive then you go snokeling for 45 minutes then hop back in your boat to hear back, which is about 25 minutes along the coast line. We loved it and had so much fun. We also went on the Seal Lion Swim. FYI...there is not an option to buy a picture you have to pruchase a DVD which you can then pull photos off of. We were dissappointed with the fact that we only wanted a $10 photo and they wanted us to buy the DVD for $30 so we passed on that but we have nice memories of a adventure with seal lions that give you giant kisses! The excursion was fun and worth doing but again, you can't just buy  a picture like you can at all the other excursions. Overall, we had a really nice time and would HIGHLY recommend the hotel for your vacation. It's humid down there so hair clips were a must. Plus we want to say that the entertainment team was nice, energetic, fun and cool to be buddies with all week. PS - remember to barter with vendors at the resort and the ones at the flea market on the beach. START AT 1\/2 and work down to 1\/3, 99% of the time they'll give in and you get your treasure. CLEAN CLEAN CLEAN....the hotel is clean!! PSS - remember that you are going to another country with the way they cook, how they cook, the AMOUNT of food you eat tends to make people say they were sick.....EAT less and you'll be fine. They give you bottle water everywhere just DO NOT drink out of the spickets. Brushing your teeth is fine but DO NOT drink out of the spickets. They provide water, soda and beer in your room. None of us had 1 problem with our stomachs all week, we were good. We will go back in a couple years for sure. If you have any questions feel free to contact me. Adios!! PSSS - the monkeys, Mickey  Nino are adorable and you have to get a photo with them.
