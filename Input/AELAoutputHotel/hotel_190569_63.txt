{"text":"Nice Hotel I recently stayed at this hotel while on vacation. The Palace is a nice hotel. My only caution with this hotel is not to talk to the old man at the concierge. Beyond his attitude, he sent us to a horrible tapas bar.... every time you asked him a question he seemed bothered. The other men at the concierge were helpful, but not the old guy. As for the rooms, I was upgraded to a suite so my room was very nice and large. The bed was very comfortable as was the sofa in the living room. The room temperature was very comfortable and adjustable. The work out facility is very small and there is no pool at the hotel. The hotel is within walking distance to the train station. A great find in the area was a restaurant called El Rincon de Esteban... steps away from the front door of the hotel. We had our best meal in Spain at this restaurant. It was not cheap, but it was well worth the money. If you have a problem with smokers arrive early as it is very small and the room becomes filled with smoke with one or two smokers. A problem we had with the hotel was at the hotel restaurant. Its in a beautiful room and the room was quite busy; however, once we were seated not one person said hello to us or attempted to take an order from us. After fifteen minutes we left... the hotel was not apologetic. They had a too bad attitude about the situation. Overall, I would recommend staying at this hotel for its sleeping arrangements. Its a nice hotel in a wonderful city.
