{"text":"Dont Understand the negative reviews at ALL!!!! I have been anxious to write this review since the first day I walked onto the Bavaro property. From check in to check out 7 days later we experienced nothing less than relaxation, friendliness from staff and beauty beyond imagination. I am an intermediate traveler and done so mostly throughou the carribean. I have seen it good and seen it bad but keep going back. This was our first time to Punta Cana and read alot of reviews on TA. Some of which left me nervous about what to expect. I must say, one day I was laying on the long stretch of pristine white beach under the chrystal blue sky and said out loud  What were alla those bad reviews about?!!A couple weeks prior to check in I emailed the hotel telling them this vacation was a second honeymoon and asked if I could have a price for an upgrade to make it special for my husband. At check in we dealt with Ramone. Ramone is the nicest, most respectful young man. He was a pleasure to meet after a long day of traveling. He told me he couldn't upgrade us because they were sold out but he had something very special for us. Quick and fast off to our room. On the door was a sign that said just married and a bottle of champagne and a basket of fresh fruit. What a nice suprise!! But mostly, We didint get a room upgrade but we did get one of only 4 villas on the beach!! Very excited.The staff were the nicest and most accomodating people I have ever met. I never had a problem with language and they really do apprciate it when you try. They try to teach you key words. For me it was mucho vodka por favor. The room was small but sufficient for our needs. And SPOTLESS clean. They do need a little upgrading but it was not enough for me to be bothered by it. I wish my own room at home was that clean. It is a massive property and you do alot of walking which is okay because you do alot of eating and the walking helps. I only gained 5 pounds instead of my vacation 10. This property is the most beautiful I have ever seen. It is also the most well maintained. Staff are constantly cleaning and pruning and fixing up plant beds. I can go on forever just on the property alone. Go to this hotel for the beach and the beauty alone and you will have spent your money very wisely. The food was good to very good. You can always find something good to eat and if all else fails there is a pasta bar. The buffet is where we ate at most often with the beach bar being our lunch spot. I thiught from the reviews that the beach bar was just that but it is not. It is a nice buffet place right on the beach. And yes, you need a bathingsuit cover up and shoes to go in.There is a casino at the palace that we went to several time to play black jack. It is very small but kept me entertained in the evenings. This would be one of the only cautions I would offer to you. Watch the dealers. They are very quick at clearing th cards that the dealer has drawn and more than a couple of times she didn't add them right which alters athe dynamics of the game. I lost money because of this but also got paid out becaue of this. I could go on and on about this wonderful property. I found nothing negative about it and would go back again and again. I strongly encourage anyone who wants to spemd their hard earned money on a vacation to consider this one. The only other issue we had beside the casino was some of the other guests. Some people just cant be satisfied and are rude. I met more people that I wanted to ask if their mommas had taught them any manners at all. These were adults treating staff and other vacationers that they were beneath them and it was appauling. Other than that....Can;t wait to go back and WILL book here again and again and again.....
