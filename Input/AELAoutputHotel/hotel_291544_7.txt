{"text":"Exceptional Hilton Experience I have been to Paris many times and stayed at many different hotels including the Marriott Champs Elysees and I have to say that this hotel beats them by a mile. The Marriott location is great but that is about all that was great. The Hilton Arc de Triomphe was exceptional in many ways. First and foremost the hotel is beautifully decorated in an Art Deco feel. We were greeted very warmly at the reception and were upgraded to a suite (Platinum American Express). They knew it was our special anniversary and they treated us as such. We had daily use of the Executive Lounge which was wonderful. It had a great selection of drinks and snacks. Our suite was lovely and clean. The bed was so soft I didn't want to get out of it. On our first day when we returned at night we arrived to a room full of roses, champagne, and amazing chocolate cake. They had a note congratulating us on our anniversary. The location is wonderful as well, it is a five minute walk to the metro. It looked to be in a very stylish part of the city with lots of designer shops. On some days when we weren't dying from foot pain, we actually walked from the hotel to the Champs Elysee which was about a 15 minute walk. There is a restaurant right across the street and there is also a pharmacy right next door. The hotel looked to have some beautiful restaurants, however we didn't have time to dine in them (too many wonderful places to eat in Paris to stay in the hotel). I'm sure people are going to think that I am nuts for my next praise, however as an American in Europe, I have to note this because it is rare to find. The hotel has an Ice Machine on every floor. In Europe, they aren't big on ice, but I am and I was so beyond pleased to see it. We adore Paris and visit as often as we can and from now on we won't be staying anywhere else but at the Hilton Arc de Triomphe.
