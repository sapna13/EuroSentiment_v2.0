{"text":"Paradise @ The Grand Paradise Bavaro Just got back yesterday from Punta Cana. We stayed at the Grand Paradise Bavaro. My husband and I shared a room with our two teenagers (boy 16 and girl 13) We were very satisfied with the resort. We had read many bad reviews prior to going so we were prepared for the worst. We had requested building 6, 2nd or 3rd floor through our travel agency. However when we arrived we were in Building 5 on the first floor. $20 at the front desk got us building 6 - 3rd floor, but not till the next day. We booked with Sunwing so we got to book our ala carte directly with the rep, which was great. We ate at the Chinese, Italian and Steakhouse. We liked them all. Probably the Chinese best. We usually had lunch at the La Cana Grill. Pizza  fries were good, but hamburgers weren't cooked. The buffet restaurant was great. Lots of variety. The nightly shows were good. Daily activities were okay. The beach was beautiful. Pools were kept clean. The bathrooms are another story. A couple of days there was no water at the beachbar restroom and other locations. Water always worked in our room though. The rooms were not dimly lit as stated in some reviews. Maid service was more than adequate. We requested additional towels and received no problem. Also received extra water and sodas without asking. We went banana boating on the beach. This was alot of fun. We also went to the Marinarium. This was a 1\/2 day excursion and I would recommend it. Alot of laughs and it was cool to swim with sharks and stingrays (very safe). We also did the sunset horseback ride which we would also recommend. We found the staff at the hotel very friendly. On-site photographers are great. They bring around different animals each day to have a photo taken with. My daughter loved this. My son loved the daily volleyball. All in all we loved the resort and would definitely return. We liked that this was a small resort compared to some of the super large ones. The only thing we would do different is bring our own pillows. The resort pillows are very lumpy. email me if you have any questions (sharalynb@sympatico.ca) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":647,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":640},{"endOffset":712,"mention":"Chinese","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9_chinois"],"startOffset":705},{"endOffset":767,"mention":"Pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":762},{"endOffset":774,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":769},{"endOffset":767,"mention":"Pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":762},{"endOffset":774,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":769},{"endOffset":767,"mention":"Pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":762},{"endOffset":774,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":769},{"endOffset":767,"mention":"Pizza","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pizza"],"startOffset":762},{"endOffset":774,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":769},{"endOffset":800,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":790},{"endOffset":800,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":790},{"endOffset":800,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":790},{"endOffset":800,"mention":"hamburgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":790}]}
