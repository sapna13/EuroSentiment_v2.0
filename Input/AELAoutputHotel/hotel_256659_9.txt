{"text":"THE worst staff Stayed at Westin Sydney for 3 nights with family (2 rooms, total cost over $2000) - basically we won't be back - here are some pointers - - Zero recognition as Starwood Platinum othet than the points and breakfast- Front Desk Agent had no idea whether the hotel's rooms were connecting (!!) - had to get manager...- Asked for upgrade as Platinum Guest and was told hotel was full. I had to get a Starwood reservation for a Junior Suite to prove to the Service Express hotel operator that an upgrade was indeed available... She argued with me - literally argued with me - to the point I just asked for the Manager... He explained that of course an upgrade was available - just that it was on a low floor... (So why make me go to the extent of making a dummy reservation rather than be honest and up-front with me?!?...)- I advised I'll stay in a regular\/non-upgraded room, but requested a higher floor - was advised only 1 of our 2 rooms could move to a higher floor... (Please keep in mind that I have been a Starwood Platinum member since the program was created... Most hotels recognize Platinum members with a fruit bowl or at the very least a note - at the Westin Sydney there is ZERO recognition)- After the first night I had my PA 'negotiate' to get the 2 rooms on a higher floor - I honestly can't tell you why the hotel staff make you jump through hoops to be decent\/hospitable - at no cost to the hotel... - Asked for 2 bottled of complimentary water (which we got on the first day) and advised we can only get these at turn-down service... I thanked the operator and asked that these be delivered now instead of later - of course the bottles never came... :)- No Concierge at night... Asked Front Desk Manager how long it would take to get to Sydney Bridge Climb in the morning - his reply was Oh, you could allow half an hour. I told him there was now way that The Rocks (area) was a half hour away from the hotel - he replied that he didn't know where the Bridge Climb was (this is one of Sydney's TOP tourist attractions!!) and of it's at The Rocks, then half an hour was about right - or maybe 15 minutes... Aaaahhhhh... Nothing like an ignorant local to give you misdirections...- Turned-up at Coffee Shop at 10.31pm - literally 10.31pm - and was told we could not be seated for desert as they close at 10.30pm... Spoke to 2 staff members who advised we should go to the lobby (we've already been there and they had nothing) or order room service (!!). After trying to 'negotiate' for a few minutes I asked for the manager, who apologised, but frankly, by then we were over it...Bottom line - hotel is well located, rooms are not large and have no views, but are nice\/comfoartable and have decent bathrooms. Staff is a whole other story - long waits at front desk, and VERY MUCH in need of training in customer service - in several departments, from the phone, to front desk and fb. Staff clearly unaware customers pay their wages and leave the impression we are distrubing them...We won't be back...:) ","annotations":[{"endOffset":160,"mention":"Zero","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Zero"],"startOffset":156},{"endOffset":1204,"mention":"ZERO","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Zero"],"startOffset":1200},{"endOffset":1204,"mention":"ZERO","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola_Zero"],"startOffset":1200},{"endOffset":2231,"mention":"Coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":2225}]}
