{"text":"Great, Small Resort We used Trip advisor extensively before booking this resort and we were not disappointed. We had a great room with √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¥cean view√à√\u2020\u2022?(would highly recommend this option - well worth it), and balcony. I can say the room was bigger then in many North American hotels, clean, with fridge that is re-stocked daily with soft drinks and bottled water. There were two cabinets in the hallway, nice bathroom, king size bed and central a\/c, which we only used to cool down the room during the day.The beach is only steps away and can be reached within 5 min from anywhere in the resort. I will not dwell on the beach quality, since you can see pictures posted by others. It is fair to say that it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ EXCELLENT. One suggestion is to get there early (between 8-9 o√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√úlock) if you wish to have your own cabana\/umbrella. This is a small resort with few entertainment options, more on the quiet side, which was exactly what we were looking for. Most nights we were in bed by 11 and up around 7:30. This is NOT a party place by any means.Food was tasty, with good selection everyday: salad bar, fruit, daily soup, vegetables, breads, pastry and deserts. I will not go into details on the food as I realize tastes vary and what might be great for me, could be inadequate for others. In any case, I have not seen anyone complain and could tell by the looks of other visitors that most were satisfied. One complaint I have concerns the persistent and at times annoying tour\/time share\/ water sports salesmen. They are everywhere and constantly try to offer you something, especially if you are walking on the beach. We were told to bargain on everything and typical rate is 2-3 times LOWER then what they ask initially. We have found this to be true and once the salesmen stop smiling at you then you are getting a fair price. Hope this helps. Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
