{"text":"good location.. that's about it.. My husband and I booked a mini economy room at this hotel, and it was unbelievably small. I'm from NYC, so I'm used to small hotel rooms, but it was not only extremely small, but it was very very outdated and rundown. We considered switching hotels until we talked to the front desk and we were told that we could upgrade our room to a larger ocean view room for an additional $30 a day. Since we already got a good deal through expedia, we decided to take the upgrade. The larger room was much better, since the beautiful ocean view makes anything better. However, it was still very rundown and in great need of remodeling. The walls and furniture have smudges on them, the wall paper is peeling, the showers are tiny and old, there's no room service or concierge, the beds are old and uncomfortable, and everything looks like it hasn't been updated since the early 90's. All this said, however, it has a very convenient location, right by Waikiki beach, it's in a safe neighborhood, they have their own parking lot, their free shampoos and soaps smell nice, and if you're in to Korean food, they have a great Korean restaurant in the hotel that serves good Korean food for all three meals a day. Also, it is affiliated with Korean Airlines in some way, so if you have Korean Airlines mileage, you may get a discount, and it's very Korean friendly, with the Korean speaking workers and the Korean restaurant. I probably wouldn't stay here again for vacation purposes, but if you want a good deal for a very average room at a hotel by the ocean, and you don't care about any luxury amenities, it's fine.
