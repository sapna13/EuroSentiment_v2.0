{"text":"The Lenox is charming We stayed at the Lenox as my husband was running in the Boston Marathon. We originally booked the Marriott and, when we went to see what we missed, we were so glad we had changed our booking to the Lenox.There is a nice friendly atmosphere at the Lenox, the staff are all helpful and efficient and nothing is too much trouble for them. The hotel is well situated and within walking distance of excellent restaurants (inc the wonderful Atlantic Fish Company), shopping mall, Common, subway etc.Our room was clean and tidy with a comfortable bed, and we liked the homely touches to the bathroom and the nightly bed turn down service. We thought the marathon goody bag was a generous, thoughtful gesture by the hotel and was indicative of the great efforts to please.Our room service meal was excellent but my only crticism of the hotel concerns the bar and restaurant. For me the bar was not a good place - personally I don't like sitting in the pitch black, and I would have liked to be able to get a good cup of coffee when returning to the hotel after a busy day.The meal we ate in the restaurant was not at all good, but the hotel was completely full at that time, the staff were great and I feel very guilty making any sort of criticism at all. Our thanks to you all for a very enjoyable stay, I have no hesitation in recommending the Lenox and hope to return again soon.
