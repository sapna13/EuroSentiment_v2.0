{"text":"Booking for next year... Firstly ignore the bad review that has been written! I have just come back from 2 weeks at the Caribe Princess and it was fantastic!!!!! The hotel is great, very clean and tidy(maids we're cleaning in the lobby at 10pm), rooms are very spacious, cleaned everyday, mini bar in the room which is re-stocked everyday with soft drinks and water. Theres 3 pools to choose from the main pool by the buffet resturant has entertainment allday, the animation guys work very hard and try to get everyone involved, their also very friendly and will just come over for a chat. Evening entertainment was good, shows every night in the Theatre, then on to the lobby for some tropical music which was fun! There are many different restuants to choose from, the main buffet resturant has different themes every evening, but is repeated each week, wasnt a problem though. The waiters were very happy to help couldnt fault them at all. The Le Matica bar served food during the night so if you got hungry from all the dancing then head on down.The main lobby is about a 10 min walk from the rooms, theres plenty of wildlife around including 2 ducks that never left each other. There is a bus service that runs frequently, just stick your hand out and jump on, it will take you around the complex. Overall this has been the best place ive stayed in and ive traveled alot! Take advantage of the things to offer and you'll never be bored. ","annotations":[]}
