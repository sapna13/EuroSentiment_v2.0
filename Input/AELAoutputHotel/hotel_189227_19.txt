{"text":"Loved Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint-Germain The Hotel de l'Abbaye Saint-Germain exceeded my expectations. I travel extensively and always research Trip Advisor to review real experiences of travelers along with their pictures that truly reflect the property. Based on previous reviews I felt this hotel would suit my needs in the area of Paris that I wished to stay. Hotel de l'Abbaye is located in the Saint Germain district of Paris and the various sites that I was interested in seeing were in walking distance. I was delighted upon my arrival to find the hotel spotless and staff welcoming. The large floor to ceiling window in my room opened overlooking a beautiful enclosed courtyard filled with much greenery and a babbling fountain. It was a very tranquil setting and much appreciated after days of traveling. The room provided a safe in one of the closets and locks on both closets. There was a flatscreen TV and all the amenities that a fine property provides. The bathroom was modern, roomy and clean along with a hairdryer. A continental breakfast was included in the room rate. Coffee or tea is freshly brewed and served in a lovely pot along with croissants, various breads, butter and jams. The servicer was very polite, friendly and enjoyed his job. He genuinely waited upon each person in the room as an honored guest. The front desk staff were very helpful with any question and\/or request. I will definitely choose Hotel de l'Abbbaye again upon my future returns to Paris.
