{"text":"Great Hotel, Good Value I had to stay in NYC on business one night Saturday to Sunday and needed something within walking distance to the Jacob Javits Center. This hotel was reasonably close, so I took a look and was pleasantly surprised. It's a small boutique-style hotel not even half a block off Times Square and right next door to the Nederlander Theatre (where Rent is playing). It's also less than a block from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The room was very very clean and very very small, but comfortable. If you plan on spending a lot of time in your hotel room, you might want to consider another hotel, but if you need a nice, very clean room that will serve only as a place to sleep and shower, then consider this hotel. You can't beat the location and the bathroom was impeccably clean (and if you haven't guessed already, very small!). The staff is very friendly and the hotel overall has a funky, youth-oriented style. The next morning offered a continental breakfast in an area that becomes a bar in the evenings. I was there on the weekend, so the garbage collection noise wasn't an issue. My room had a small window that didn't face the street, but faced the center of the hotel, which consisted of a small square shaft that I guess allows for ventilation, etc. I can't stress enough how clean the room and bathroom were. I great find in NYC! Overall, I was very impressed with the Hotel 41 at Times Square and would definitely consider staying there again. ","annotations":[]}
