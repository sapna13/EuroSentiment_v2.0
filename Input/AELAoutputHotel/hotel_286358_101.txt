{"text":"Tripadvisor does it again! Just got back from a three night stay at the Plaza Mayor and the hotel was every bit as good as the vast majority of the reviews on Tripadvisor suggested. Excellent location, friendly and welcoming staff on reception, immaculately clean throughout and extremely reasonable prices (60 euros a night for a single plus another 7 for breakfast).I'm not suggesting that it's faultless - the rooms we stayed in weren't the biggest ever (although I thought they were perfectly adequate for a short stay and let's face it, who wants to go to a city like Madrid and stay in their hotel room?) and I can imagine that some guests who are on the larger side might find it a bit of a squeeze getting into the (fantasically powerful) shower I had in my room. The breakfast was good rather than historic but there was plently of it, with a wide choice of the usual cold meats and cheeses, yogurts, pastries etc plus hot items like scrambled egg, bacon and sausage and good coffee so I'd say it represented value for money. As far as the question of noise which some others have commented on I can only speak for myself and I thought it was one of the quietest hotels I've stayed in with no noticable street noise despite the location (once I remembered to close the window!). Yes, the cleaning staff come around doing the rooms at about 9.00 am but I wouldn't describe them as noisy or disruptive.Just a word on two of the restaurant recommendations we were given by the lovely female receptionist on our first morning. We visited La Gloria de Montera on the Calle Caballero de Gracia and Bazaar on the Calle de la Libertad (I think they're part of the same chain and we found both to be absolutely first-rate with very tasty modern (but unpretentious) dishes, great staff and a brilliant atmosphere. Both places get full early, mainly with locals, and you can't reserve so I'd suggest getting there early..... you won't regret it!Overall we all agreed that the Hotel Plaza Mayor was probably one of the best places we'd stayed at during our regular trips abroad - personally I'd say that the standard was higher than than in many 3* and even 4* hotels I've been to, it's amazingly good value and I'd go back and stay there again without hesitation.
