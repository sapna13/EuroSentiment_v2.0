{"text":"Great Hotel in the middle of the action Booked 5 night stay on hotel website Jr Suite with view of Las Ramblas. Booked on Hotel website...being a member of Starwood Preferred Guest there is a slight discount but it was expensive 315 Euro a nite Room was clean spacious flat screen tv that rotates between sitting area and bed. High speed internet as well.We stayed on 9th floor no balcony in the room view of Ramblas required a little bit of a lean but the view of the city was pretty cool.I booked this hotel after I found out that the Cathedral across from the Hotel Colon was under construction and paying for a suite at Hotel Colon with a view of the Cathedral would have been a huge waste.Check in was very quick no issues everyone spoke great English so no worries. We used the concierge extensively to book restaurants they always gave good recommendations. We did not eat in the hotel restaurant but did have a drink there, nice decor good service. They also have a small bar and sitting area in the lobby.The hotel is in the middle of a lot you walk right out onto Las Ramblas, are a few blocks from the big market La Boqueria, very close to Plaza Cataluna where you can get tourist bus, very close to subway stations which are very easy to use and a great way to get around the city. It is right across street from Hotel 1898, there is a Starbucks a block away.There is still some work going on around the hotel it did not interfere with our visit, also no gym or pool though they can give you a pass to a large health club about 1\/2 mile away that does have pool and all the equipment you would ever want.Room had minibar which was expensive, water 3.90 Euro there is a grocery store a block away where water is .50 Euro and wine and I believe beer was available all at fractions of minibar prices.One odd issue is that they do not guarantee nonsmoking suites, the one we had smelled fine, no residual odor but something to ask about if that is a concern.All in all a great hotel clean, professional good service and great location. Would stay again and recommend to others.
