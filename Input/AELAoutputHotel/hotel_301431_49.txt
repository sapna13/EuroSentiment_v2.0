{"text":"The world's best Hyatt Regency To enjoy The Regent Singapore, it is best to temper your expectations. Therefore, don't think of this as the second Four Seasons managed hotel in town (The Four Seasons Singapore is a few blocks away, connected to Orchard Road through an air-conditioned passaged linked to the Singapore Hilton. . .), but rather the best Hyatt Regency in the world. If you doubt this, note that this John Portman designed hotel could easily be in downtown Atlanta, with the bubble glass elevators, corkscrew circular staircases, and ivy trellised sun dappled atrium up through the center of this concrete building. Alas, the materials are a bit better than your average garden-variety Hyatt atrium, with glowing brass, fine dark woods, and gleaming marble. Rooms and suites are quite bright, both from floor-to-ceiling windows (sliding glass doors in the suites) and yellow walls (the pink exterior doors are a bit odd for my taste). The hotel is actually is great shape, and looks as if it were renovated recently--upkeep is quite good. That said, there are numerous, surprising disappointments. I was in a one-bedroom suite, with two balconies. . .one each off the living room and the bedroom. Still, there is no patio furniture out there. . .not a chair, table, or even a stool. Bathrooms are nicely fitted with black granite and pleasant amenities, but are small for a hotel with these aspirations. . .exposed toilet, shower and tub combination, single basin, not competitive in this market (by contrast, the bathtubs at the Ritz enjoy skyline views, for example) I would think that a few bottles of water would be standard in a hotel of this caliber, but none to be found. While breakfast food is plentiful and imaginative, Capers--where buffet is served--is a disappointing room and loud! I was scolded by the hostess for arriving 15 minutes before closing--surprising to me that in a Four Seasons Hotel, I should plan to arrive at the hotel's convenience.Location is about four blocks from Orchard Road, within walking distance of the Botanic Garden..If this were a Hyatt Regency, the experience would be great. This hotel is not. I look forward to quick remedy to these issues.
