{"text":"An Amsterdam gem! We were in Amsterdam a year ago and stayed at 2 adequate, but uninteresting, hotels. This time we found Chic and Basic on Trip Advisor and couldn't have been more pleased. (In fact we returned there for a night on our way back to the States.) We had a similar situation to that of a previous reviewer in that when first arrived we were looking for the Hotel New Amsterdam. After walking past Chic and Basic several times, I remembered a reference to a new name on their webpage and we were set.It is close to Central Station (5-10 min. walk) and in a very quiet neighborhood. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating. The entire hotel is newly remodeled (candid photos are more accurate than the hotel photos on Trip Advisor). The rooms we stayed in were very clean, European smallish as were the bathrooms but very efficient. The breakfast was one of the most extensive I've had in a small European hotel and they have a super coffee machine which also makes espresso type coffees quite well.The biggest negative I saw was that many of the rooms are accessed by very steep staircases and there is no elevator. There are rooms on the ground floor so if a guest has mobility issues (or lots of large luggage) they might want to request one of these.Other great amenities - free internet and wifi and a great welcome bag with high quality toiletries, etc. The staff was also very willing to hold our bags both when we arrived early in the morning and also when we were not leaving Amsterdam until late afternoon.We will plan to return to Chic and Basic on our next trip to Amsterdam!
