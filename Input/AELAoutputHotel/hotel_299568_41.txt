{"text":"great honneymoon Me and my husband spent in Novotel Benoa great honeymoon in September 2007!We lived in the part of the hotel situated closer to the beach, that truly deserves to be recommended. The second part of Novotel is at the other side of the main street and has very beautiful swimming pool, open also during the night, however the hotel part has not been renewed. What we liked most was the mixture of Balinese architecture style and modern interior designs, both combined in very picturesque way. The hotel has very nice check √à√\u2020\u2022√ä√™√ân area, surrounded by the pond with fish (!) If you prefer rather intimate hotels and you hate crowds √à√\u2020\u2022?that is a good choice! Another great thing is tropical garden surrounding the hotel area - very well kept. We also liked the details, e.g. the funny Balinese statutes hidden between the vegetation. The stuff is very nice, always smiling.We lived in the √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢ropical terrace√à√\u2020\u2022?room, big enough, very clean and with the fantastic bathroom joined with the bedroom with huge wooden doors. We liked also our private garden. We preferred eating outside, so we can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ tell anything about the hotel restaurant, except for the delicious breakfast. We can recommend Bumbu Bali √à√\u2020\u2022?traditional restaurant serving spicy food √à√\u2020\u2022?taste fantastic minced duck in banana leaves!!! (I even cooked it at home for my family and I succeeded). Quite expensive but worth visiting. Go also to Jimbaran during the Sun set, and taste fresh see food in one of the beach restaurant√à√\u2020\u2022?very romantic, not only for honeymooners!The only thing, we were disappointed - was the hotel beach and the see. It is important to underline that we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ expect white sandy beaches like in the Maldives. Nevertheless we were very disappointed because of see wet in the water and on the sand √à√\u2020\u2022?impossible to clean, despite of the hotel service effort. Also the color of the see is not that blue as you can expect from the tropical island. And the worst thing was the permanent noise from the water sports centers nearby √à√\u2020\u2022?people were driving motorboats all day long √à√\u2020\u2022?in traffic hours impossible to support. Bali is worth visiting because its culture, temples, magnificent atmosphere, food and rise terraces, and very diversified nature. But if you are looking for √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√µaradise√à√\u2020\u2022?deserted beaches, you would better go to south Lombok There you can find turquoise water and the miles of white sandy beaches, where is nobody except you!
