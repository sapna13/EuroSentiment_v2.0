{"text":"Could be world class, but the food is horrible! I need to start off by saying this could be a world class hotel. The rooms are great, large, clean, good a\/c, roomy bathroom, with no issues with water temp in the nice shower, and great pressure as well. The daily housekeeping was nice, and included a late nite turndown service as well. the mini bar is a great asset as well, stocked daily with soda and beer. The beach is awesome, and is one of my favorites, they have it being cleaned all day, white sand, blue water, nice waves. the vip package includes the use of the beach beds and they are great too, you can even have drinks brought to you by the waiter, though the bar is close and quicker to use.No issues with getting towels, there seemed to be plenty. The grounds and pool are well kept, and very nice, many people working on the upkeep all day, they really do a nice job. Internet access is available in the lobby, starting at 9am and is included free in the vip package, they give you a 20 minute pass code daily, though most days i got a few no problem. We dont stay up too late, so cant say much about the entertainment, karaoke one night was fun, and our friend went to the sister resort next door for a show they said was great and included fireworks. Check in and out was a breeze, very helpful, friendly, and courtious staff for the most part, though language can be a bit of a stumbling point at times, and chalenging at others, But I am a visitor, so not too many points off for that. So Jay you ask, whats up with 2 stars?? the place sounds wonderful! OK, now it gets ugly... Judi and I travel 3 times a year to all inclusives at least, we've do not go away for the food, we go for beach and fun, we usually ignore reviews about food complaints because we've never had an issue, until this place. The two ala cart restaurants we ate at for dinner were just ok, and only open for dinner, the breakfast and lunch buffets were just plain weak to gross, no better, seriously, just plain nasty, though thebeach buffet\/grill I have to admit was nasty times 2. In the airport on the way home,, we ran to Wendys for a burger because we were so hungry, and i must say it was soooo good! In fact we then had pizza next door as well, we were stuffed, it was like we hadnt eaten in a week! OOOPS, we realized we actually ate at least 30 cheese sandwiches between us throughout the week for breakfast, and lunch, and snacks too. I publicly apologise to all the reviewers, and complainers that in my mind Ive character assinated, I now feel your pain, Must be Karma.LOL Hey, did i mention the wine? YUK! We are really easy people to pleas when it comes to wine, although we like fine wine, at home we we enjoy fairly cheap, though good stuff, Im telling you the house wines they serve are positivly disgusting, undrinkable, did i mention nasty? You can purchase other wines, but only at dinner at the ala cart restaurants, $22 a bottle for a cheap mondavi sav blanc, hey we drink it at home. so not too bad. They will make you sign for the bottle, no cash accepted at the restaurants, you know why? cause they add $6 to the price called a convience fee, what is that? $28 dollars a bottle, oh well, at least we got to enjoy a glass of wine with our newly made friends. Well at least I could also drink a nice absolute on the rocks right? Not so fast, hmm, this tasts funny, kinda like lighter fluid.. the manager was kind enough to get a new bottle for me though, and after sniffing both admitted there was a problem with the bottle at the bar, LOL caught ya filling the good bottles with the bad booze! any way, he let me keep the new bottle, which I tipped the bartender well to only pour for me. Ya know, I could go on ang on, which I have ,and now Im done, will we return to the PCP, not even if it was free! Unless they fire the and fix the food and beverage dept.
