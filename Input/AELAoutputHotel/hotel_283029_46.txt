{"text":"Absolutely Fabulous Hotel Roemer is a small boutique hotel in a quiet area close to all museums and shopping areas etc. We stayed in room 21, a small (but executive king) room and in some ways a little cramped but the balcony with two chairs and small table increases the size of the room by a third with a lovely view over the back gardens of the nearby houses, it is Amsterdam afterall and only newly built hotels have large rooms in general. The room was sparkling clean, toiletries are of a good quality, the mini bar is well stocked, strangely though ours was missing sparkling wine\/champagne. An espresso machine was in the room as I believe it is in most rooms but was not supplied with sugar or milk (a Dutch way of drinking coffee) and tea was not available either. I take it this is normal but when we asked for what we wanted,it arrived almost immediately with a smile and 'nothing's a problem' attitude. The room service menu is limited and only available until 11pm but it is a small boutique hotel so there are some sacrifices! Breakfast was a small dissapointment and the only aspect of our three day stay we were not happy with, but not sufficiently unhappy to complain. However, drinks are always served with snacks, coffee with tiny muffins and soft and alcololic drinks with beer nuts, a lovely touch. The staff were warm and friendly, Joost the evening barman is an expert at judging if guests want to be left alone or have company, chatting, suggestions for trips, restaurants etc. He makes a mean cocktail and is very helpful and friendly.The hotel has a cosy, warm and intimate feel to it, almost like being a guest in someone's house. Although while we were there there were aIso business travelers holding meetings in the hotel and they seemed to be as delighted as tourists. I would highly recommend it this hotel if boutique luxury in central Amsterdam with a cosy atmosphere is what you are looking for.
