{"text":"Great Hotel...but bring your walking shoes! I recently spent 3 nights at the Intercontinental Grand Stanford during July 07. My expectations were quite high given the strong experiences I√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√πe had with other Intercontental hotels and I left very satisfied wit hthe experience.The hotel is well appointed and my room was comfortable. The lobby is nice but potentially lacks some of the wow factor you get from other Asian hotels. I had a harbour view room and would consider this a must given the great views the hotel has access to. The room is well decorated in a traditional (not modern) style and the bathroom was spacious. The bed was extremely comfortable and housekeeping did an excellent job every day. The major downside was the location of the hotel. While it faces the harbour it is at the far end of the strip\/promenade and there is a 10 minute walk before you can get to Nathan rd\/Star Ferry depot. The walk is very pleasant along the promenade that faces the harbour however for the cost of the hotel I would have preferred to have stayed somewhere closer to the action.Staff were very friendly and pleasant with most speaking very good English. There were a few occasions when I needed help with directions etc and found the concierge desk to be very helpful in the information they gave. I did however find some level of inconsistency connected to doorman opening the main doors- somedays there was someone there the next there wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ. I also found the reception\/concierge desk at times to be understaffed with some longish queues. Given the overall cost of the hotel these inconsistencies probably need to be addressed. Given the wide range of food available around Hong Kong I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ eat at the hotel. The hotel is on the Kowloon side and there were plenty of choices for eating both around the hotel and also in and around Nathan rd. Temple Night Markets are around a 20-min walk away and are well worth doing also. Overall I had a great stay at the Grand Stanford and would recommend it thoroughly. It probably has a way to go to compete with the likes of the Peninsula but I had a very good experience and would certainly return in future.
