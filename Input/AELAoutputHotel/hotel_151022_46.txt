{"text":"Absolutley AMAZING! We have just returned from Natura Park on April 20th. It was our first time in the Caribbean and we had an amazing time! We have read some reviews about the resort and were kind of ify, but we thought we would take a chance seeing as how the price was unbeatable! We had no problem checking into the hotel. Everything went very smooth! The employees were all so nice and very helpful! Everyone had a huge smile on thier face and always greated you with a big HOLA! and a high five! The food was ok, definalty not anything like what we have here in Canada. We pretty much lived off of hotdogs the whole week. We did find a few things at the breakfast and supper buffets that we liked. The Steak House a-la-carte was ok. The only thing we ate there was the steak. The chicken wings...not so good, and the cold cut platter...haha...not so good. We went on a few excursions. Parasailing was so much fun! We also went Scuba-dooing! Haha, that was a blast! We were feeding fish right out of our hands! We went the the Animal Adventure Park where I went swimming with the Sea Lions! That was an experience! It was so much fun! We had our pictures taken with monkeys, all kinds of tropical birds, and a boa...which I didnt like too much...Then we went on a dune buggy trip. We got to see alot of how the Dominican people really live. We took candy with us to give to the children. And they really appreciate it! While on the buggy trip, we stopped at Macao Beach, the only public beach in the area. It was beautiful! The surf was intense! Then we stopped at an underground cave where you could go swmming. We didnt swim as it was still water, but there were some locals swimming. The cave was amazing!Another day we went to Captain Cook's Restaurant. The seafoodwas really good, but we were told that we would only be there for 3 hours. We left our resort at 12:00 noon, it was a 30 minute boat ride to the restaurant and once there, we were harrassed by a bunch of vendors wanting us to buy everything! We were told to wait on the beach at 3:00 for our boat to take us back to the resort. An hour and a half later we were still standing there. There were alot of Captain Cook boats...just no captain's! So it took someone to complain in order for us to get back by taxi. That was the only time we were disappointed, but you know what they say, one dominican minute is equal to one hour! And it is so true! Everyone is so laid back and carefree!The rest of our time there, we spent on the beach and in the pool. The beach was beautiful. There was a lot of seaweed early in the morning but they constantly had men racking it up throughout the day. Nothing to really complain about! We spent alot of time at the bar over the pool. Our favorite bar tender, Jorge, worked there. he was a sweetheart! Always happy! And everywhere you go, you always hear... I LOVE MY JOB! and I can tell you, that they absolutly do! The entertainment staff have so much fun doing what they do! And they love to see vacationers make a fool of themselves! haha, great times!We were talking with some people who have travelled all over the Caribbean and she said we would have high expectations for any resort after we have been to Natura Park. She said the grounds are amazing compared to other chain resorts. Natura Park looks like they took the buildings and placed them in the middle of the jungle! It is so beautiful!
