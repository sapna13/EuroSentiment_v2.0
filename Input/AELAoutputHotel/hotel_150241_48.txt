{"text":"Everything I needed ie: One Stop Shopping Stayed at the Hampton for three nights prior to my cruise on Sept 3rd. Even though the Hampton is close to the airport, not one person at the establishment seemed to mind.First night was quiet, with my husband (got married on the cruise) and I became aquainted with surroundings. We arrived at noon and our room was ready. Even though we had a view of the parking lot and nearby cock fight stadium this did not damper our enthusiasm. The room was great. Clean, king size bed, decent furnishings, safe, ironing board, and toiletries in the bathroom. Watch out for the AC or at least adjust it as our room was ice cold all the time.Staff was nice, and we even got a welcome call. Speaking of which 800 # calls  local calls were free and so was wireless internet and use of the business center downstairs for printing and web surfing. Pool was sufficient and stayed crowded after the first night with kids, and adults frequenting the swim up bar. The Hampton is across the street from a small strip mall., where I was able to do my nails (for the wedding) and purchase other essentails for the trip. ATM around the corner from the strip mall and if you tired of the free breakfast at the Hampton a Denny's was just feet away.Good resturaunt that locals and tourists alike is right next door (The Metro.....??) and cabs are stationed outside if you want to go Old San Juan. Hotel was able to arrange tour of Rain Forest, El Yunque and despite the rigourous hiking, the tour was the highlight of our stay there. ","annotations":[]}
