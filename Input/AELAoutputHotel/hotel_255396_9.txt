{"text":"Excellent Location What an excellent hotel in a great location! This is a holiday inn though so don't expect the sheraton, however...This hotel is in a perfect location for a visit to Sydney. Located in china town, a 1 minute walk to Paddys market and a 1.5 minute walk to a monorail station. Easy walk and access to Darling Harbour.If you want to go to Cricular Quay it is a bit tricky, but pretty much you just catch a bus straight down george street. Or alternatively, walk to Central and catch a train from there.Fantastic restaurant on Golbourn street, Mamak. Satay and Roti restauant. Cheap and the best satays I have had outside Malaysia. An absolute definite must eat here restaurant, and cheap too!As for the hotel itself. We stayed in an executive room on the 10th floor and for 2 adults and 2 kids it was pretty good value. The kids loved the foxtel! The rooms are a good size and the bathroom is great with a seperate bath and shower. They need to look at adding a micowave into the kitcheny area they have as this would add to the room. We had a room facing George street and the view was pretty non existent.Also be aware this property does not have a pool. It does have a hot tub\/spa, but it is a 6 person residential type, and not really pratical for a hotel of this size.I would give this hotel a 7\/10 and would definitely stay here again.
