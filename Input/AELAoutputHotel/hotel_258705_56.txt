{"text":"Amazing service We stayed at the Hotel Commonwealth while visiting colleges in Boston with our daughter. The hotel itself is lovely from lobby to the guestrooms. The staff was wonderful-- printing off college info that they had gathered. We booked the college exploration package for two rooms which came with small day packs, water bottles and info about Boston University. The package also came with breakfast for two which was actually a gift card to Eastern Standard restaurant. Each card (one for each room) had around $52 in value which not only covered breakfast for the four of us for 2 days but also a glass of wine one evening for my husband and myself.The location of the Hotel Commonwealth is great also--right next to the Kenmore T stop. Prudential Center shopping is not too far either.The real test of the hotel staff came AFTER we checked out. We were scheduled to fly out on Mar 16--when Boston received 9 inches of snow that shut down Logan Airport. While at the airport we ran into 25 high school students and 2 chaperones from Dallas (some from my daughter's class) who were also trying to get home after an organized college tour. We had already rebooked our rooms when I called them back to see if they could take in the stranded group for 3 days until they could get flights out of Boston. While initially hesitant for obvious reasons they agreed to take them in. Many of the students were surprised that such a nice hotel would be so accomodating to a group of high schoolers.I am hoping that my daughter ends up at a school in Boston so that I can return to the Hotel Commonwealth.
