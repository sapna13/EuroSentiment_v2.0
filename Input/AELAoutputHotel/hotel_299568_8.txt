{"text":"Beach Cabana Review We stayed in a Beach Cabana. The room is adequate in size but certainly not large. Room space is cluttered. The bed room can be closed from the bathroom\/closet room by sliding doors.The room is close to the beach, pool and restaurant. Nice sea breezes on those hot days. There is a small private yard with 2 sun lounges and umbrella.The air conditioning was adequate but noisy, with a constant background roar at all settings.Walls were thin so occupants of adjoining room could be heard speaking at normal conversation levels. By closing bedroom sliding door this was less noticeable.The hotel next door had a band which played each night from 7pm but finished around 10pm. It was quite audible in the room, particulary the thumping monotonous bass guitar. Annoying intrusion.Staff were very polite, helpful and provided excellent service, except for Front Desk staff who were very poor. We were kept waiting at check in for 20 minutes while staff appeared to be chatting amongst themselves. On another occasion a simple transaction at the desk took 20 minutes, while one overworked staff member attended to guests and took phone calls. All this time two other staff members in uniform stood behind her chatting to each other and avoiding serving the waiting customers, and avoiding eye contact. Not a good look , not good enough for customers paying big bucks, and tends to annoy greatly. Novotel need to get their act together in this area.There are many restaurants in the area with cheap prices. The hotel has meals at reasonable prices. There is a nice beach bar and eating area right on the beach adjacent to the pool.Overall we enjoyed our stay, but next time will look for something else. For the prices charged for the beach cabana we expect better service at front desk, better internet service and internet included in room rate, not extra cost. We expect a quieter room both from airconditioning and external noise.SUMMARY. Great location. Great staff except front desk. Great pool and beach scene. Just needs to try a bit harder if charging top dollar for these rooms.
