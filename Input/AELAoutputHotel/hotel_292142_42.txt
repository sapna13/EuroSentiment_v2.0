{"text":"Wonderful place to stay My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Dumont from the 5th to 10th Oct 2008 and our family also stayed there in a separate room. We were in New York to be married and the hotel staff were excellent with us. From the moment we met the concierge we knew we'd picked the right place and if first impressions are anything to go by then we were very happy. The one worry i had before travelling was some of the negative reviews about old carpets. I didn't ask, but the room we stayed in the carpet's were good and clean - perhaps they've had a refurb?The hotel room itself was really big and clean with separate lounge and bedroom. Bed was very comfy and we had a newspaper delivered every morning. Shower and bathroom were great and never had any problems with appliances failing etc the whole time we were there.The view of the Chrysler building was amazing and you could almost see river to river.The hotel was ideally located for us - 5mins walk to ESB and Macy's, 15mins to Grand Central and 25mins to Times Sq.Subway just one block away.Something to remember is the internet in the lobby is free if you only need to print your boarding passes for your flight out of NYC.We only ate breakfast at the Barking Dog bar\/ diner once as we much preferred the Murray Hill diner around the corner. Go there!The Murray Hill market store on the corner is also a plus.I appreciate that some travellers may feel differently and have their own opinions, but the staff we met all had a smile and could not do enough to help us. Their kindness and consideration really helped make our stay in New York that bit more special. Thank-you so much.To sum it all up - we searched and searched the internet for a good hotel when planning our trip, but next time we go to NYC there won't be any need to because we'll be going back to the Affinia Dumont.
