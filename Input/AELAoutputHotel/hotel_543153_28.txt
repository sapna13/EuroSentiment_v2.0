{"text":"I want to go back... Stayed 2 nights here with my partner. We had a room (or 2 rooms) on the 5th floor. the 2 room set up is fine - we never saw anyone else when we made the cross. The main room is nicely done but a bit dark when you're trying to find your money\/room card\/map etc. Got very attached to the hammock in the lounge that faces the tv while my partner had a siesta. The reception staff are great and very knowledgeable about local restaurants etc. Breakfast is really good with a wide selection. All day buffet is fairly limited - sandwiches, salads, yoghurt mainly but good for a snack and who wants to hang out in the hotel lobby while you're in Barcelona?!Hotel is situated in the upper raval which is currently the hippest area of Barcelona. Contrary to what some people might have read, the upper raval is very safe, quite touristy but with bars\/restaurants a plenty. Hotel is literally 3 mins walk from Museum of Modern Art. As an aside, the lower raval still has 'edge' so not a place to sightsee with the kids.Really recommend restaurant\/bar Dos, Trice. 5 mins walk from hotel. Eat in the basement (smoking even if like us you don't smoke). Decor is a cross between a David Lynch film set and a brothel. ..Food really good and cheap. Full of locals. They do a good mojito too. this is the 2nd time I've been to barcelona and I can't wait to go back. Would stay at casa camper again too.
