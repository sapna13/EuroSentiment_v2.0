{"text":"Excellent location and value, rooms on the small side The hotel is in an excellent location, a stone's throw from Tin Hau MTR, tram and bus stops plus only around 10 minute walk through Victoria Park to Causeway Bay with Times Square shopping on your doorstep.The standard rooms are light and airy but are pretty small. Beds are queensize and there is only just enough room to walk around them. Bathrooms are a good size though - no bath but nice shower and plenty of fluffy towels and goodies.As you long as you get a habour view room, it's good value for Hong Kong. I can imagine a room at the back overlooking the flats won't seem so much of bargain though. The staff were lovely, nothing too much of a problem. Concierge extremely helpful. Recommend the airport bus which costs around HK$120 and also an Octopus card which you swipe on all publc transport - buy from the customer service kiosks at any MTR station for HK$150 ($50 refundable). The only problem I had with the hotel is the air con. The room was a little musty and smelt damp - although it was spotless and there was no evidence of mould or mildew in the bathroom. It felt like the air con was on recirculation giving the room a slightly sweaty\/damp feel. We turned it off at night (lucky it wasn't summer) and this helped a little.We didn't try the restaurant as it seemed pretty expensive and bland for what was on offer outside the hotel (some fantastic Japanese on Electric Road). The rooftop pool was amazing.
