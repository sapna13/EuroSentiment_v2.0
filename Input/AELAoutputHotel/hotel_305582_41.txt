{"text":"Regular rooms are OK, but avoid the Superior rooms Hotel Axel bills itself as a hetero-friendly hotel. Indeed, I was in Barcelona for a conference and there were many hetero's there who had no idea it was really a gay hotel -- that is until they got to their room and found the large artwork of a naked guy on the wall. Quite amusing actually. Nonetheless, the staff treated them well, as far as I could tell.Still, the hotel is definitely designed for a the gay traveler on holiday. It is not set up for business travelers, but provides a comfortable bed in a convenient part of town. (WiFi was relatively inexpensive though -- 6 euros for 24 hours. And they had to PCs available for checking email, etc., for free.)On the positive side: the location, the very comfortable beds, the free bottles of water, and of course the gay-friendly atmosphere. The restaurant served good food at a fairly reasonable price, and room service was generally good, for someone ordering in English and not Catalan or Spanish. The breakfast buffet was bigger than expected. During my February visits, the roof deck amenities (pool, jacuzzi, gym, etc.) were too cold to enjoy, but looked like a great place to hang out in warm weather.On the negative side, the rooms were very spartan and on the small side. The double, city-view room had a nice balcony, but otherwise was small and lacking in storage and surfaces on which to put things. The wire-rack storage system (shown in room photos on the web site) is clearly a cost-saving measure and lacking in functionality. There were few surfaces on which to put things, such as a glass of water, a wallet, coins, etc. Also on the negative side, they say the rooms are sound proof, and indeed the windows are effective at blocking street noise. However, every small sound from the corridor seems to be amplified by the hallway and is loudly transmitted through the door to the room.We stayed one night a second time a week later in a Superior Room, which had a beautiful stained glass-enclosed balcony. Lovely to look at, but not well integrated into the room. In fact, the entire Superior room was poorly laid out and had a poorly designed bathroom. (Very poor feng shui!) All my bathroom pet peeves were there: 1) no door on the shower or bathroom, meaning steam permeated the entire room; 2) glass wall between the shower and bedroom (sexy when I was younger, but annoying now); and 3) no ventilation. All in all the Superior Room was not worth the extra money over the city-view double.Other details: TV had only two English language channels. The pay-per-view selection was limited and extremely dated. The restaurant is nice and knew how to make a good martini -- rare for that part of the world. The staff was pleasant and all spoke fluent English. I would go back, but would not splurge on the Superior room.
