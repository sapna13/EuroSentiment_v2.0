{"text":"Value for Money Booking from the website was no problem. We booked a 2-bedroom room and got a 3 bedroom. Space was great for the two of us. Hotel is located next to a main road with Tram and our room faced the main road. In the night we could hear the noise of the late and early trams and emergency vehicles with there load siren. This was the only downside. Everything else was what we expected for this price. The breakfast was simple, but complete and the coffee was great (As a coffee freak a good thing). Free flow of drinks and food for European breakfast. They also had pastries, something I didn't expected. Our breakfast was in the hotel itself. I understood from the counter staff that the breakfast could also be in the hotel next door in case of the colour hotel is fully booked. The breakfast room is small and cannot accommodate all travels in that case.)The counter staff where friendly and their English was simple but good enough for the necc3ecarry. Location was right next to the main train station with direct connection to the airport. No need for taxi to the station (save some euro). One minor point was the let luggage. They place this in a room open to the reception not locked. Although we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ feel comfortable with this, but had no choice as out flight was late night. No problems when we came back to pick up our suitcases as everything was there. All together a great hotel for the price we paid.
