{"text":"Extremely luxurious LOCATION: The Westin is extremely centrally located at No 1 Martin Place, right near the Pitt St mall shopping district. The closest train station would be Martin Place and the second closest would be Wynyard. THE ROOM: We stayed in a standard room with a king size bed (which was extremely comfortable) in the modern wing (rather than the historic wing which is somewhat more expensive) and it was highly impressive. The d√ã√\u2022√ñcor was very modern and the design of the room is quite unique: there is a glass pane separating the bedroom and the bathroom which means that you can see between the two rooms (although there is a shade that you can raise and lower if you so wish and the shower and toilet are in separate rooms protected by frosted glass). It also means that if you were in the bath, you could still watch TV (which happens to be a very large flat screen). Broadband internet is available in-room and wireless in the lobby at a rather high price. The toiletries in the bathroom were generous and smelt great. The room also provides bathrobes and there is an in-room safe and complete mini bar with free tea, hot chocolate and coffee-making facilities. SERVICE: We arrived at 11.30am and our room was already ready which was a nice touch, despite the fact that check-in usually isn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ until the early afternoon. Every single staff member that we encountered was so very helpful and friendly and the hotel adds nice touches like a free newspaper outside your room in the morning if requested and some iced mineral water in the late afternoon (which we found when we returned from the gym). AMENITIES: Hotel guests can use the gym and pool free of charge at a section of the building which is part of The Westin property but the fitness centre is not owned or operated by the hotel. The gym is, however, quite large with a multitude of treadmills, stair walkers, bikes and rowing machines as well as a range of weighted equipment and free weights. Personal training and services at the spa can also be arranged at a fee. The pool is more like a lap pool and is much smaller in a section above the gym. There are many conference rooms in the hotel for business use but we never used any of these or the business centre. IN-ROOM DINING: We ordered room service which came promptly √à√\u2020\u2022?we were given an ETA of 30 minutes but it did arrive slightly before that at 27 minutes.. I highly recommend a wood fired pizza √à√\u2020\u2022?it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ healthy and absolutely delicious! The food was quite pricey but it was in line with what I would expect from a hotel of this calibre. We never ate at Mosaic but the in-room menu boasts several dishes from the restaurant which contain √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√Üuperfoods√à√\u2020\u2022?and there is an explanation in the in-room brochure about such foods which promote healthy living, etc. MISC: One of the brochures in the room states that there are special running sessions with a Running Concierge but when I phoned the front desk, they informed me that this property doesn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have a Running Concierge. They do, however, have running maps (6kms or 8kms) available from the front desk. The Westin is a strictly smoke-free hotel and there is a $300 cleaning fee charged to your card if evidence of smoking is found in your room. In general, the hotel has a great feel √à√\u2020\u2022?they seem very √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂?ith it√à√\u2020\u2022?in terms of sustainability, charitable giving with the UNICEF √à√\u2020\u2022√ä¬∂√≥heck out for children√à√\u2020\u2022?campaign that they run and healthy in terms of the menu.
