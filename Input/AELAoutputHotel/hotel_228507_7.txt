{"text":"Adequate But Shabby Rooms Atop Central Transit Hub Spent two nights with my daughter here in late July. Overall, the place was OK, but only because I was able to book it at a very favorable price.The good thing about the hotel is that it sits atop the central train station. It is therefore a direct 20-minute train ride from the airport and on two Metro lines. This makes it a convenient hop or two to wherever you want to go along Barcelona's extensive and well-serviced Metro lines. The double-decker tourist buses also stop right outside, and there is a reasonable assortment of eating establishments in the area. Placa D'Espanya at the base of Montjuic is two stops or a 15-20 minute walk away.The smallish room was disapointing. It had a depressing, faded green decor. The mattresses on the twin beds were hard, thin and fairly uncomfortable. The bathroom was cramped. The tub had cracked tile, mildew and an extremely slow drain. If you wanted to use the in-room safe, they charged 4 EUR per night to activate it. On the plus side, wireless internet was free if you had your own computer with you.The common areas of the hotel were somewhat nice. Unfortunately, the common areas are not where you sleep and bathe. There was a basic fitness center and a business center.The hotel's other saving grace was its staff, who were uniformly friendly and helpful. As well, they were conversant in English, which is a big help if you don't speak Catalan or Spanish. If they would take the trouble to renovate their rooms, this hotel could be all right. For now, though, it rates 2 stars on my scale. ","annotations":[]}
