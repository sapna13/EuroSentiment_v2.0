{"text":"Great place to stay Just completed a 3 day stay at the Holiday Inn - South in Florence. Was very impressed. The hotel has recently completed a remodel of the interior and rooms and we found the room we stayed in was outstanding (executive level). The room is large (by Euro standards) and nicely furnished. The bathroom is done in marble and granite and the room has a minibar, safe, and internet access. The bed is King size and was firm but very comfortable. I stay in hotel rooms over 200 nights per year and this was one of the nicest mid-priced hotels I have stayed in. The hotel is located on a convienent major road into Florence and is in a pleasant neighborhood. While the hotel is not much to look at from the outside, our room faced a lovely park and was very quiet. Within easy walking is an excellent coffee house (Marcello's with cappucino for 1.10 Euro!!), ATM, several moderately priced tratteria's (dinner for two for less than 25 Euro), and large local shopping area (CO-OP). The cab fare into the center of Florence was 12 Euros. The breakfest at the hotel was overpriced (36 Euros for two), although drinks at the bar were cheap (4 Euros for a glass of wine). We found this hotel to be more than acceptable. If you don't need to be right in the center of Florence and want to avoid the high prices there (coffee at 4 Euros and a glass of water for 2 Euros), this hotel will serve you nicely.
