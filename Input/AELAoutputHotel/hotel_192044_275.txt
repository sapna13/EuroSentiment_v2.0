{"text":"London Bridge Luxe This hotel was a very pleasant surprise - a dollop of luxury in an otherwise unpreposessing location. Given the prices of London accommodations - the dollar dropped to a 26-year low against the pound the day before we arrived - we were pretty pleased.Important caveat, however: we received a free upgrade to a club room. That made it a pretty sweet treat. Also, we booked well in advance and stayed over a weekend at a property that's more geared to business customers. I suspect that means we paid a lower price than others would for the same experience.The room was huge, extremely quiet - double-hung windows very effectively sealed off train noise from adjoining London Bridge Station - and offered small luxuries such as waffle-cloth bathrobes and a heated mirror in the bathroom. The immediate blocks surrounding the hotel are a bit on the ordinary side, but it's also extremely convenient to Southwark attractions, such as the National Theatre and (critical for us) the Tate Modern. London's top farmer's market is also virtually across the street. The included breakfast, served in the basement dining room, was quite good and the staff were mostly terrific. (The one exception was the not-terribly-helpful concierge; when asked about late dining, he seemed to assume we weren't willing to walk to the restaurants on the south bank - which we later learned all stay open late - and instead directed us to a rather dreary pub.)All in all, a great experience for a weekend trip.
