{"text":"Wonderful We stayed at Hotel Columba in the first week of November. We knew this was a family run hotel and knew that it was not a luxury accommodation. We arrived there early morning and our room was not ready. We were very early and didn't expect our room to be ready for a while. Rosanna took our luggage and let us rest in a very nice sitting area. Within an hour of our arrival our room was ready! It was a very nice and CLEAN room and attached washroom. Very very big and spacious for Europe standards. It was in front of the reception and we had heard it could get noisy, but we really wanted to check in and rest. I have to say, we stayed there for 5 nights and only were disturbed by a little bit of noise on the last night. The rest of the time, we didn't even notice that we were in front of the reception. Rosanna and her family were wonderful to us and always made us feel welcome. Something you don't get at many of the 'big' hotels. They also had free internet access and an area with lots of books and magazines. Overall a very nicely organized hotel. The breakfast was wonderful as well. The hotel staff was always very very pleasant. If you are looking for a great location close to everything, clean and spacious room at a very very reasonable rate, this is the place to stay. I would go back if I ever visit Florence again. Thank you Rosanna, family and staff. You made our experience very memorable.
