{"text":"Not a fabulous hotel, but still worth a try This hotel is good for families staying for more than 3 days, because of the full kitchen suite. However, there isn't any supermarket or 711 to stock your kitchen. The hotel claims that they will buy your groceries if you provide them a shopping list and they will charge it to your room. We didn't bother to stock the fridge with anything because we were only staying for the weekend. The complimentary breakfast is great every morning. Also, if you want room service, it's only available after 5:30pm.If you're interested in sightseeing keep in mind that the nearest train station is over the bridge, but it isn't a bad walk at all. It turned out that this hotel was very convenient for us because we went to a Celtics game our first night and the TD BankNorth Arena was right after the bridge. We found it interesting while taking the train around some areas that the stations were actually rather close to each other so each stop was very quick. Honestly we could have just walked and covered the same areas but it was a little chilly.Another attraction not too far from the hotel is the New England Aquarium which is worth checking out. Legal Sea Foods is right across the aquarium and is always a great choice if you can't decide where to eat.The next time I'm in Boston I would try another hotel that's a bit more modern but this hotel was ok. It's kept very clean and secure and the waterfront view with the boats is worth the price. ","annotations":[]}
