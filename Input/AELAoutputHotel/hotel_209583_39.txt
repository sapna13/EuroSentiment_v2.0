{"text":"The real load down at the palace Just got back from a one week stay at the Barcelo Bavaro Palace. The trip was done through USAir so everything was included in our price. Check-in was fabulous and smooth. We were put into building 5 on the third floor. The room was being cleaned when we arrived so we were quickly able to develop a relationship with our maid. We were with another couple( good friends of ours), and their room was down the hall from us. We first noticed how big our room was. Once we got our AC running at the temperature we wanted, everything was fine. OK first off, this hotel is quite a few years old and in some cases it shows it and in some others it doesn't. The rooms, and the gounds of this resort are cleaned every single day. We tipped our maid well, which for us meant plenty of towels and sundries. Our mini bar was always well stocked with water, soda and beer. Our king size bed was comfortable. From an accomdation point of view, the Palace served us well. Other reviews talked of mildewy smell,or uncomfortable beds, lack of hot water, low pressure in the water,etc. not an issue here. I figured that most bad reviews started from any bad experiences at the check-in or some weak stomaches. Allright lets get to the beach and the pool. From an aesthitics point of view, your not going to find much prettier beaches. The ugly side of the beach was the swim wear being worn by some people or the lack of swim wear by some others. Hey this is a place where people bring children with them, but again our friends from across the pond continue with using their idiotic judgement when it comes to their beachwear. I am a 52 year old man who is in reasonable shape and I am certainly nobody's prude. Come on now, men for heaven sake stop with the speedos, for the vast majority you look like buffooons at best and morons at your worst. Get a decent pair of swimming trunks and stop looking like jackasses. I donot even want to start with the topless women at these beaches. Just throw them in with the guys in speedos and you get my drift. Thank the good lord that at least the woman topless scene does not occur at the pool, can't say the same for the speedos. Food- my friends, my wife and I will never say no to a meal. We eat like nobody's business and we eat well. We are entering an area of expertise for us. So what did we think of the food? It was ok. Hey We are at an all inclusive so it is what it is. Favorite places- La Pina grill, Mexico Lindo, Caribe buffet, Steak House and La Brisa(seafood). Disappointments- Los Pinos Italian restaurant and Bohio. La Pina was outdoor grill by a flea market that served some good steaks, shrimps, and lobster tails. Mexico Linda had a great appetizer bar, the other ones speak for themselves. Los Pinos giving me a piece of chicken leg for the chicken cacciatore was an insult. The spaghetti in meat sauce though was very good. Oh yeah, this place needs to find out what hamburgrer and hot dog buns look like. And yes, make all the restaurants smoke free please, or send the smokers to Haiti if they insist on smoking.Beverages- plentiful and good. Presidente beer was very good, where's the Presidente LIght? Casino -ok, golf course- muni at best. Chickens at the tee box on the 6th hole was fantastic, watch out though for the wasps.Would I go there again? Yes but I like to try other resorts first in Punta Cana.
