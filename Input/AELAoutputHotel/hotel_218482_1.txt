{"text":"Very relaxing...would go again! My husband and I and three other couples went from Dec 26-Jan 2nd and we had a wonderful time. For the amount paid, this was well worth it!!!In General--The beach was beautiful, and there were lots of sun chairs to be had. The pool was decent...a little crowded, but you can go to a pool anywhere! The beach was where we spent most of our time. There were no mosquitos, as some other reviews had warned against. No bug spray needed! The rooms were clean and exactly as pictured in online photos. Very comfortable, everything worked. Food--you definitely need to book your a la cartes immediately upon arrival. They book up very quickly...especially if you are a large group as we were. We did not end up getting into the Japanese one. The buffet was just ok...but I prefer a la carte dining. For breakfast, go to the restaurant near the beach...much less crowded and has the best porridge ever (so says my husband) with all of the breakfast things you could want. There is a GREAT place by the pool that makes rotisserie chickens and wood fired pizza (along with other) all day long...we ate lunch here EVERY day...it was so good! If you sweet talk Juan, the pizza maker, you can get your pizza customized how you like. Staff--I found the staff very friendly, and most spoke at least a little English if you needed something. Not in the gift shops though...be prepared for no english at all. Unlike some resorts where they clearly say you do not need to tip, if you tip here you get better service. A little annoying, considering it's supposed to be 'all inclusive' but whatever...I don't know if this is a place I would take young children...it didn't seem like there was much for them to do. Maybe I just missed it...The grounds within the complex were BEAUTIFUL! They have an oasis of all types of tropical plants and trees with pathways going throughout...very lovely.You can snorkel right within the swimming area and see lots of tropical fish! Steal some buns from the buffet at breakfast and take them out with you...the fish will come from everywhere. We also did the half day 'reef explorer' excursion. If you like snorkeling, this was great! You also get to swim with sting rays and nurse sharks. Well worth the $90. For what we wanted, it was a perfect place. If you are looking to go and relax for a few days this is a great resort to consider. We would go again!
