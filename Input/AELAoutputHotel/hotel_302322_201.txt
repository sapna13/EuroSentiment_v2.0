{"text":"Wow, 10 out of 10 We chose the Harbour Plaza Hong Kong for our holiday in October primarily because of the great write-ups it has received on this site, and, wow, am I glad I discovered TripAdvisor. This hotel is just beautiful and certainly deserves all the accolades which have been laid upon it here.I had been intending to write something about our stay but somehow the days drifted past since our return and I guess I felt it was simply too late to comment. However, when I read the rather negative comments by Sspade I just had to get the fingers hitting the keyboard. I can't believe he thought the hotel more tourist orientated than business. While we were there the hotel was full, and, sure the guests seemed to arrive by the busload, but that was because so many of them were delegates of conferences and trade fairs which were happening at the time. This is definitely not a touristy hotel, witnessed by the fact that it pops up in very few travel brochures or even on the tourist maps of Hong Kong. In all of our 12 night stay I think we only saw two families there with children, and most of the guests we spoke to - or overheard - were there on business. Sspade's comments about the smells and noise in the foyer area leave me a tad mystified also.Anyway, back to the hotel. Check-in was absolutely seamless, and - wonderfully - our suitcases were delivered to our room within about 5 minutes. Our room was large and, with an upgrade to a harbour view, had spectacular views over the harbour to the island - gorgeous at night. The room was made up at least twice a day, with the staff ensuring that we had plenty of tea and coffee making provisions - often overlooked - and supplying plenty of free bottled water. The meals we ate at the hotel were fantastic, and the dinner we enjoyed on one particular evening at the Waterfront Bar  Grill next door (part of the hotel's facilities) was absolutely memorable.One of the great things about this hotel is its location - away from the bustle of Nathan Road. The hotel is in a very nice area of Kowloon which boasts some fantastic shopping centres. Ladies, the boutiques here are just wonderful with none of the junky stuff found at Mongkok. Another great feature is the close proximity of an excellent supermarket where we were even able to buy fresh milk daily - all the way from Australia - plus things like bandaids, munchies to go with our drinks, headache pills etc.We certainly wouldn't contemplate staying anywhere else in Hong Kong after this visit, so thanks to all the members here whose comments drew us to this property.
