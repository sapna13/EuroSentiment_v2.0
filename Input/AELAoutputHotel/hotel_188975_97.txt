{"text":"#1 Rating is deserved On my first trip to Paris I decided to stay at one of the best hotels in the world! George V deserves all the rave reviews. The customer service is spectacular. I felt welcome right from the start as a solo woman traveler. The concierge was always helpful, and every question I had was answered pleasantly. I arranged a pick-up at the airport by the hotel, which was perfect. I didn't want to have to worry about arriving at a new city with jet-lag. The staff was waiting for me after I passed through customs. On arrival at the hotel at 9:00am my room was not quite ready so they offered for me to wait in the spa. Say YES, the relaxation room at the spa is spectacular. Little beds with fluffy duvets and curtains, where I could have stayed the whole day if necessary. My room was ready just 30 minutes later. My room, 605, was huge, and the bathroom was probably the size of most hotel rooms in Paris, approximately 10 x 15 ft. The bedroom had French doors overlooking an alley off Avenue George V, with a balcony. The Bulgari toiletries are wonderful. The location is perfect with a quick walk either to the Seine or Champs-Elysees. Tips: Take a bathing suit. The spa pool and facilities are included in your stay. Enjoy! The George V massage (extra $) is fantastic. Buy a metro full day pass and the Museum Pass. Make a daily outline of the things you want to see in Paris. I ran out of time so I am looking forward to my return in 2008. My visit of 3 nights was not long enough.The hotel is everything you read about and more. Life is short........Treat yourself!
