{"text":"Horrible Customer Service at Hotel Arrived after traveling for hours to be told once we hit the hotel lobby that we had no reservations on file, once I gave them a copy of their confirmation, I was told ohhhhhh hold on let us see what we can do, I was traveling with my entire family (12) people to be exact, we were made to stand in a hotel lobby with all our luggage and long pants on for four hours unitl they called around to see what could be done, when I asked if the kids could please get bracelets so that they could eat I was told NO! The front desk Manager was one of the rudest people I have ever encountered he was speaking spanish no realizing my daughter speaks it fluently so she was repeating back to us everything that was being discussed, when we informed him of this he called us IMPOSSIBLE AMERICANS! We asked to speak to his supervisor he told us there was no other management people on the property, we asked to please get one on the phone we were told NO ~ The food was horrible, cold, the all inclusive part was a big ripoff they stocked refigerators with one coke, one sprite, one diet coke and 2 beers,. WHAT A JOKE , I called the front desk for an extra pillow and was told it would cost me more money, after I complained about that it took two days to receive my pillow. A year old girl was left alone across the hall from us and at 3:30 a.m. I was awoke to her constant knocks on my door, I had to call the front desk 3 times and was told all 3 times that they would send security, when I waited approimately 45 minutes for security I finally had to get dressed and go to the front desk and literally walk a secutiry person down who spoke no english! He walked by her looked and kept going I once again had to go to the front desk and scream at them, Finally got to bed at approx. 4:30 a.m. Just a few examples of our wonderful family vacation. I have written several emails to the Genereal Manager to get a form letter response, they don't even have the common courtesy to call or wriite a normal letter to me. EXTREMELY RUDE !!!!!!!! I wouldn't recommend this Hotel to my dogs!
