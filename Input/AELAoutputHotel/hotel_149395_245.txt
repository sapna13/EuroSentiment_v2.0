{"text":"great vacation!!! I have never written a review before but since I had read all the reviews before we booked I thought I should. My 13 year old daughter and I arrived for a week long stay on February 23. We booked with Liberty Travel and could not have been happier-other than some cloudy days. After we landed it was a little confusing trying to locate our transportation to the hotel. The hotel lobby was beautiful and check in was a breeze. I had read some complaints about delays in getting a room but as we did not arrive at the hotel till 5:30pm everything went smoothly.The only issue I had was the map of the hotel which described all the restaurants, policies and amenities of the hotel was in Spanish. I asked for the English version and was told we don't have one. Kind of annoying. The grounds were impeccable and the grounds keeping staff were very friendly. Our room was immaculate at check in and the following morning I left a $10 tip for the maid asking for bottled water and coffee everyday. Everyday upon return to the room was an overabundance of both as well as a super clean room! The beach was beautiful no issues with cleanliness at all. The place was packed as it was spring break but never an issue of getting a place to sit. The food was okay, my biggest problem was a severe shellfish allergy and all the food descriptions were in Spanish at the buffet. When attempting to explain my situation to a waiter I felt that they did not understand the question and just say yes or no not realizing the implications. The best were Chinese and buffet for us. I think that the staff there want a tip upfront before you are served to kind ofensure quality service which is not my policy. I will tip you after I am served on the quality and attentiveness of the staff, not before. The regular waiters at both restaurants received generous tips. The only other problem which was not a big deal was on the hotel website and confirmed through my agent, we were told they had wireless internet. I assumed that meant in my room -but it is in the lobby at $5 an hour. Some people still have to work while on vacation and I found this to be a little inconvenient. All in all great trip, would recommend.
