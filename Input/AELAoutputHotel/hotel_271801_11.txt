{"text":"Wouldn't recommend it to anyone I thought this hotel was awful. On the evening my colleage and I checked in, a gentleman at the desk was reporting that the room he had been assigned to already had someone in it. Red flag #1. After checking into our own rooms, I found that the heat in my room didn't work and there was someone else's hair in the tub. I ordered room service only to find that there was a hair on the tray and no spoon for me to eat my soup with. There was also a hair on one of the washcloths and I don't want to get into what kind of hair it was. My colleage found that her room contained a half eaten box of Oreos, 4 diet cokes, several bottles of water that were of varying brands. One of the bottles of water was half empty. When she showered the next morning, she found that one of the towels had been hung up wet. We're still not sure whether someone was just showering in her room before she arrived or whether they never let the towels dry after being washed. We reported these problems to the front desk. I'm not sure if it was because we were nice about complaining or what, but there were no offers to give us a free night or anything else. As a matter of fact, there wasn't really an apology. I believe the front desk supervisor just said, Oh, that's the not way its supposed to be. Needless to say, I'm disappointed. I was also rather disgusted. If those are the things we could see, what kinds of things were not visible? Anyway, we switched to another hotel after the second night of madness (i.e. the hair was never taken out of the tub and the heating was fixed, but cranked to 85 so my room felt like a sauna). Never again.
