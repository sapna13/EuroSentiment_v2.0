{"text":"Tired and in need of a refurb I used to send people to this hotel all the time when I worked for a bank, they all would love it, last week I finally got to stay there myself I was very excited.I have to say I wasn't as impressed as all the other reviewers, for me this was a huge come-down. Firstly as you come into the hotel the immediate view is one of a staircase going down into the basement, certainly no wow factor, as you look to the left a huge open plan (not romantic at all) restaurant that would seat around 100 people, go to the right and there is a large open lounge area (that I later realised is the bar too, go figure??) this also doubles as the reception, which was weird I thought, having people trundling though with luggage and bags whilst people are sitting around in their finery. I didn't like it at all.Room was a nice size, bed lovely, and bathroom amazing with THOSE windows but the decor is all a bit bland and because of this you see lots of scuff marks everywhere, carpets are bland and dirty too. All in all, I think this place needs to have a serious designer in to revamp the entire hotel, especially the bar\/lounge\/reception area, that was the biggest disappointment. No one in their right mind wants to wander into a noisy bar area after a long haul flight that is filled with people looking their best.
