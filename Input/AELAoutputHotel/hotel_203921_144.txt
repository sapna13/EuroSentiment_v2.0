{"text":"The Best! During our first visit to Florence, we stayed at the Hotel David for 3 nights. We selected this hotel because of their price and good reviews from trip advisor. In my opinion, this was the best hotel during our entire vacation in Italy. The hotel is located on the opposite side of the river as is down town Florence. Is only 15 -20 minutes walk from the hotel to the Ponte Vecchio Bridge.Our room was located on the second floor facing the street. The room and the bathroom were clean without any mold and\/ or musky smells. The size of our room and bathroom made us feel like we were in a junior suite. The shower in the bathroom was the best one. The bed and the pillows were very comfortable. They even had extra pillows.The David√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ staff was the most friendliest and efficient that I saw during our 2 weeks in Italy. They always responded to my e-mails on time and they did not showed attitude when I came to them with requests. Their breakfast was an average breakfast and I think that they could improve it. Usually, they had broiled eggs, bread, pastries, cereals, cold cuts and coffee. I think that I got spoiled by our hotel in Rome (see San Francesco review). The David offers a free happy hour for their guests. Their snacks and wines were good.If you want to take the bus to the Accademia from the hotel, the bus stop is a cross the street.If we go back to Florence I will stay at the David without any hesitation. The hotel David is the BEST!
