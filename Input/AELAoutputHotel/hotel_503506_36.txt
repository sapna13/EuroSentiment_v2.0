{"text":"Nice Stay - but not 'Exceptional' The Lloyd hotel is a nice place, in a decent location, and staffed with some nice people. The history of the building is interesting and my walk around the area (this being low season) was notincredible - but was pleasant. The best thing about the hotel is that it is clean and open - and somewhat secluded. The pricing is not bad for low season. However, the thing to watch out for (and this is demonstrated in some of the other guest complaints) is the unique way in which the hotel categorizes the rooms. I booked for 3 nights and was happy with my room. But, being a category 4 room I expected something a bit more than what I got - it was basic and not interesting- certainly not exceptional. There is much said about the interiors and furniture, etc... but I found that much of it is hyperbole. There is much difference between a 1 and a 5 perhaps - but I suggest you pay close attention to anything in between. Many of the rooms are not much of an improvement on category 1 - except space. But, there are some gems to be found. Just make sure you get one! The public space is well designed and interesting. I visited in the low season, of course, and as such the atmosphere was slower - but I can imagine the Lloyd holds its own when it comes to the high season festivities.I was just pleased to be in Amsterdam and the hotel room sufficed. I suggest, if you are travelling soon, checking out the old Postal building housing the Stedelijk - either in the day ornight..... the view is great... especially while dancing! The centraltrain station is really not that far away - and the tram station behind the hotel is very safe, clean, and quite modern! Either thetram 10 or 26 can get you anywhere you want to go pretty quickly! Decent place, interesting history - but nothing truly exceptional apart from the public area and engaging staff!
