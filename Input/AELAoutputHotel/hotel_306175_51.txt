{"text":"Lousy Service, Not Worth it Had a short stay in Singapore and I booked this hotel. This hotel is pricey but looking at their website, the room looks attractive and location is convenient, right at the centre of Orchard Road. The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ørand Deluxe√à√\u2020\u2022?room is actually a junior suite with a separate bedroom and living area with sofa. On first look, the room does looks nice, stylish and spacious actually, charming in its own sort of way but a bit too minimalist for my taste. It has a separate sitting area with sofa and a working desk. But on closer inspection, the hotel really cheap out on a lot of things. The sofa is kind of Ikea type, the TV yes it is a Band  Olufsen but it is not flat screen, it is a CRT tube TV, no more than 30√à√\u2020\u2022?and not even widescreen. There is also no DVD player, no sound system. Bathroom is black marble with rainforest and a deep tub. But the rainforest shower head is very small ( size of a small plate ) and the water pressure is definitely not adequate. Also it is very difficult to control the shower temperature as it can fluctuate from cold to suddenly very hot before it stablised. For a √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√Ørand Deluxe√à√\u2020\u2022?room and with the rate they charge, the hotel only provide a miserable 2 bottles of no-brand mineral water. Sound-proof is not adequate. I can clearly hear people talking at the corridor outside. Also, there are a lot of strange noises in the hotel room at night, mainly from the aircon and the bathroom ( water flowing underneath in the pipes ). No view from my room, just buildings. The room faced the Far East plaza building.  Now to the biggest complain √à√\u2020\u2022?Service! The service here is really sub-par for 5-star hotel. When my taxi arrived, no bellboy was in sight to pickup my luggage. A hotel staff was standing right next to where my taxi stopped but did nothing. Surely if I came to their hotel by taxi and have luggage in the taxi, then I am their hotel guests! My taxi driver has to literally went into the lobby to call the bellboy to collect my luggage. Even a 3-star hotel has better service.  Check-in took 25mins, including 10mins of waiting in a queue and another 15 mins waiting for the checkin staff as she type furiously on the computer trying to locate and assign me a room. Moreover her first form got it wrong and printed another guest name instead. This is really unncessary and unacceptable. They already should have my reservation under confirmed status and I did inform them of my arrival time so they should already be expecting me and have my room ready. After room keys were given, no √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢hanks for staying with us√à√\u2020\u2022?or √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√únjoy your stay√à√\u2020\u2022? And of course, no escort to the room. There is also no welcome letter in the room. The concierge is not helpful either. I ask him where can I buy some artwork near the hotel in Orchard Road . He refers me to Tanglin mall, a good 20 mins walk from the hotel at the corner of Orchard Road . Actually it is avaliable within 5 mins walk at Takashimaya and Paragon. The casual answer showed me that he really can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ be bothered.  Breakfast is included in my room rate and food generally OK but I definitely won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ pay S$40\/= for it because they cheap out by serving local food like chaw kway tiao, nasi padang, rotti platta which can be bought outside for one fraction of the price and properbly of better taste too. Service during breakfast is good though ( the only time when I got good service from this hotel ) and the caf√ã√\u2022√ñ staff are much more attentive, at least they greet me! Internet is very expensive at S$25\/= ++ a day. Another service hipcup occur during checkout. I waited almost 30mins for the bellboy to come up to collect my luggage. And this is after 3 phone calls to chase and also after I intercept a passing staff along the corridor to help me locate the bellboy. Then after I checkout and paid, they misplaced my luggage and took them another 15 mins to locate them while I wait and wait and wait.This is definitely not worthly of the hotel√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ √à√\u2020\u2022?-star√à√\u2020\u2022?status.  Overall, for the room quality and the 2-star service, it is way overpriced and poor value for money. I definitely won√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ stay there again, at least not at those rates they charged me. If location is crucial, the nearby Marriott will most likely be a better choice.
