{"text":"A top class hotel We recently stayed at the Oberoi and we were not disappointed! Having read some of the more negative reviews before travelling we were a little bit concerned that we may have chosen the wrong hotel. However from arrival to departure we had a fantastic time. The staff are geniuinely welcoming and the hotel is set in beautiful grounds. The staff working by the pool area are very attentive. As soon as you select the sun loungers which you wish to use the staff are there laying out your towels and bringing you chilled mineral water and chilled face towels. They also bring sun cream and a chilled sented water spray which is a great way to cool down when the rays get that little too hot! The water is replaced continuously and every so often a little treat appears such as fruit kebabs or a home made ice cream or sorbet.The beach is great too and there is a life guard on duty. The sea has fairly large waves ideal for surfing and body boarding. During our stay we used the body boards and i took a couple of surf lessons (extra cost) which were really good fun and helped to burn a few of the calories off.We also used the spa which was fantastic but expensive. We opted for a couples 2 hr treatment which involved 1\/2 hr body scrub, followed by a 90 minute massage which was very good. not something you could afford to do every day!We were a little bit disappointed with breakfast. Although it was good quality we personally prefer a buffet breakfast allowing you to try a little of what ever takes your fancy. Unfortunately this is not available at the Oberoi.We ate at Kura Kura one evening. Again very expensive but the food was very good. Food at the pool side was good with quite a varied selection of foods on offer. We had cocktails at the bar several times and the bar snacks offered are very nice. The olives are great! Again these are not cheap. Overall we felt the food and beverage pices were too expensive. We appreciate it's a 5 star hotel and you get what you pay for but they would do much better reducing the prices a little. A short death defying walk from the hotel is Eat Street, where good food at much cheaper prices is available. Next door to the hotel is Ku De Ta which is a really cool restaurant\/bar. A must.The hotel rooms are great especially the comfy beds and sunken bath.We would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. We had a fantastic holiday.
