{"text":"Marriott is nice place to stay My hysband and I decided to go to Puerto Rico this year and try a new Island. We have been to Aruba four times,Bahamas, Paradise Island, St. Maartin and Hawaii---many times here, being my daughter lives there. Our experience in Puerto Rico was a nice one and have to say that the people here are very friendly and very helpful with any information you ask for. Of course, there were times when they didn,t speak English....but had no problem finding out what we wanted to know. First of all, the Marriott is a really nice Hotel and the room was very clean and beds so-so comfortable and I usually have bad back problems sleeping on different beds other than my own, but these were so nice and never had a ache in the morning. Bathroom was nice and enjoyed the lotions and soaps..nice smelling. Aloe, I believe.  Location of Hotel was perfect for walking in either direction and there is lots of restaurants around to try. We went to quite a few nearby and all were good.  Went down on the Bus(which is free until the Elections) to Old San Juan and really enjoyed touring the City. Walked all over the city and did the Fort Tour. So neat to see. Also if you you have the chance go to El Morro Cemetary to see all the Headstones...so amazing and beautiful. Never been to a Cemetary that was so peaceful to walk around and see all the beautiful plots. Even my husband was amazed with this place. Took so many pictures there. Ate at the Brewery by the Water Front and it was so good.Really nice place and different. Inside is like a Brewery with pipes and barrels all over. We had Eggplant and it was out of this world.........best I ever had anywhere. Also took the Ferry (free) over to the Baccardi Rum Factory and enjoyed that also. Was disappointed that there was no Production Tour, but saw a movie and people talked about the History. You got 2 free drinks of your choice and then we ended up at the Gift Shop....very high priced to buy there.  The Beach at the Hotel is fairly nice, but can,t go into the water...Red Flag out everyday. We used the Pool and it is nice. Pool isn,t that deep, but enough to get cool and very clean. We are so used to being able to go into the water at the Beaches we go to on other Islands and was dissappointed with the ones here. Glad I got to travel to Puerto Rico, but probably won,t go again...like to swim too much. All and all...it was a pleasant trip and we enjoyed the Casino at the Hotel.....even won some.
