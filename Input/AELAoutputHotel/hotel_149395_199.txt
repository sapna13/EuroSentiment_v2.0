{"text":"Paradisus is Paradise (especially for honeymooners)!!! We visited the resort from 6.25-7.2 and absolutely loved the entire trip. We highly recommend the Royal Service upgrade for a private pool with swim up bar, private beach with beach runner service for drinks and food, AC room with breakfast, lunch and snacks, and all of the other small amenities i.e. pillow menus, scent selections, room service, etc...Service and Staff:Everyone made sure to take care of our needs and always replied Everything is possible (Todo es posible) after each request. We did bring some smaller bills to tip when we had extraordinary service and we think this ensured great service throughout the week (ie - getting into dinner without special reservations). Our favorite Royal Service staff members for the week were Janderson (always made us feel like royalty), Jose (who greeted us with songs and smiles every morning) and Lizardo (who took care of us on the beach with drinks and food without us asking).Food:First off- we are not too picky with our cuisines. On a scale from 1-10, overall we would rate food as a 7.5. The key to enjoying the food is being part of royal service so you dont always have to eat a buffet breakfast and lunch. Instead, enjoy huge spreads of food (eggs made to order, pastries, meats, cheeses, etc) and lamb and lobster for lunch. Our favorite restaurants were Mexican and Italian.Upgrades:We also upgraded to a honeymoon package which included a private dinner for two on the beach (gourmet), couples massage, jacuzzi with candles and flowers, a small gift, breakfast in bed with champagne! The cost of the upgrade was worth it!Beaches and Pools:The private pool was awesome and the swim up bar was ideal. The private beach area with bali beds and shade were ideal. We walked up and down the beach and other resorts just didnt compare. Included Excursions:We thoroughly enjoyed kayaing, snorkeling and horseback riding on the beach. Just make sure to schedule these events in advance because slots sometimes fill up quickly.Overall - we had an absolute blast, relaxed, drank, ate and just enjoyed the atmosphere. We would highly recommend the Royal Service and the Paradisus in general.
