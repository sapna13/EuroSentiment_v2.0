{"text":"Comfortable and Convenient I scored a great deal for a weekend single in London in the summer (99 GBP for Fri, Sat, and Sun nights, English breakfast included). The hotel is excellent, very comfortable and in a great location. It seems to cater to business travelers, because my rate went up to 162 GBP for Monday night(!). However, it's an excellent choice for tourists on weekend stays.A train from Gatwick to London Bridge is 10 GBP and takes about 30 minutes. The hotel is only about 200 yds from the train station, an easy walk even with lots of luggage. The underground is in the same station, with easy access to the entire city. The hotel is within walking distance of several great sights, such as Shakespeare's Globe, the Tower of London, Vinopolis, the Monument, and the George Inn. A bus stop for the major sightseeing tour companies is also nearby. The Borough Market is a five-minute walk away; on Saturdays you can browse the produce, cheese, jams, tofu, etc., and sample some great food (I had an awesome ostrich burger here for lunch).The rooms are decent-sized by European standards, with comfortable bedding and air conditioning. High-speed Internet access is available at 10 GBP per day. There are flannels (washcloths) in the bathroom, which I find unusual for European hotels. There is no view. Street noise was not a problem during my stay, with the window open most of the time.The included English breakfast was very good. Served buffet-style in the hotel restaurant downstairs, it consisted of pastries, breads, and fruits, plus a hot bar with eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, potatoes, and beans. Check your package; some guests only received a Continental breakfast (without the hot bar). I did not try the restaurant for any other meals on this trip, but prices on the menu seemed high. The pub next door (Borough Bar) was more reasonable and served good pub fare.Overall, I would definitely choose to stay at the London Bridge Hotel again. And at the weekend rate, it's an excellent deal.
