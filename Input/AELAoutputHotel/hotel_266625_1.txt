{"text":"Great vacation at Sirenis Cocotal Resort My pregnant wife and I decided to spend Christmas somewhere warm so we booked at Sirenis Cocotal In Dominican Republic. I will begin with saying this is not my first all-inclusive trip so I can compare this resort with past experience. Our trip was amazing and went without a hitch. The food was excellent, the service was great, pool was nice, etc. Trip to\/from Hotel:The ride to the hotel is a little long (~1 hour) and was a little bumpy but not that bad. We liked it, because it gave us an opportunity to see a little of DR including urban and rural. The ride went by quite quickly.Check in\/ Check out:Check in was great and quick. Check out took less than a minute. The staff at the reception desk were very nice and there was very little wait.Room:Our room was clean and everything worked. The only complaint here was the ventilation in the bathroom was connected to the ventilation from some of the other rooms. You could hear people from other rooms through it and sometimes it smelled a little.Pool and Beach:The pool area is very nice and we enjoyed our time there. The Beach was okay, not as nice as some of the others I have seen but it was still very nice to walk.Food and Drink:The selection of food was great and I found many tasty items to my liking. My wife is under a number of self imposed dietary restrictions due to being pregnant, she still found lots of items to eat. The only complaint here was that the snacks that were provided between lunch and dinner were not that good. Mostly greasy burgers and fries. The Mexican a la carte restaurant was a 3 out of 5, I give the Japanese 4 out of 5. The Japanese one is fun because they cook in front of you. Drink selection was great and the they provided drink menus at all the bars. Plenty of alcoholic and non-alcoholic options available. We met people at the resort and did not hear any stories about people getting sick. Everything in the resort is prepared\/wash etc. with bottled water. The only thing to avoid is drinking water from the room taps, and toilets (our rep joked to us).Service:Service here really stood out. The staff were excellent and seemed happy to serve you. If you do not speak Spanish, have a little patience with their English, they are trying hard. We were a little annoyed by the house keeping staff as they showed up a different times every day and stood outside our door yelling at each other sometimes early in the morning. The bell boys and lobby staff were super nice to us. The anamcion team were unbelievable. They put on amazing shows every night and during the day time kept the kids entertained and happy. The kids enjoyed these guys and gals so much that I would see the kids run up to them and give them hugs whenever they appeared. Amenities:Lots of pool space (pool ranges from 1 - 7 feet in depth, plenty of room for swimming or playing). Nice swim up bars. Good selection of buffets (2 for breakfast, 4 for lunch, 2 for dinner). Good selection of a la carte restaurants. Decent Gym and spa. Small Casino. Couple of Disco's with live music. A nice theatre were they put on great shows every night (Grease, Mamma Mia, comedy skits, Dominican cultural dance, etc.). Lots of nice seating areas.The cons I list below are very nit picky and I do not think they warrant anything lower than a 4.5 out of 5.Cons: afternoon snacks, housekeeping staffPros: everything else ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1561,"mention":"burgers","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Hamburger"],"startOffset":1554},{"endOffset":1571,"mention":"fries","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/French_fries"],"startOffset":1566},{"endOffset":2896,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2892},{"endOffset":2896,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2892},{"endOffset":3100,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3096},{"endOffset":3229,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3225}]}
