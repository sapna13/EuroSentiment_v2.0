{"text":"Older but clean Overall, this was a good place to spend a night. The staff was very friendly. Maybe a little brief, and quick, but that may just be a Southerner's experience in Boston. The hotel itself looked relatively old, and not in the charming, historic, Boston way. It was obvious once I was inside that this wasn't just on the outside. The room was definitely older, but very clean, with upgraded shampoo and lotion. The New England coffee (roasted in MA) was also a nice touch, especially for tourists, although you can only do so much with a pre-packaged bag of ground coffee. There were maybe 15 channels on the TV, including HBO, and free wi-fi in the room. My room (two doubles) also had a desk and three chairs. The bed was relatively firm, although not uncomfortable, and there was a thermostat that controlled the heat, but not the A\/C. The fan in the exhaust duct rattled during startup and shutdown, but otherwise wasn't too loud. I had a room that was adjacent to Soldiers Field Rd., and you could hear cars passing by pretty easily when the heater wasn't on. If you're a light sleeper, or if you were trying to sleep during off hours, I could see that being a problem. Additionally, there is a Chinese restaurant downstairs that smelled good and appeared popular with the local Asian crowd, even on Tuesday night, but I didn't go in.Other Miscellaneous Information: The hotel backs up to Western Ave., which can be useful if you're walking or busing it. For the frugal, there are several bus routes there (70,86) that will take you into Cambridge, to Harvard, and to the Red Line. There are a few Zipcars within walking distance as well. From the airport, you can take public transit right to the hotel for a total of $3.50 or less, and in about an hour or so.
