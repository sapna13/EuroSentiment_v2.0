{"text":"Great time at Secrets Just returned October 19, 2006 from a great time at Secrets Excellence in Punta Cana. We were a group of 4 couples celebrating 40th anniversary. Would highly recommend the Excellence Club, we were met at the front desk and taken to the club room for a private check-in Esperenza brought us a bottle of Champagne and as we enjoyed our drink she took care of getting our rooms and all 4 rooms were close to each other (all Ocean View Jr. Suites) within a few minutes we had our room keys and she gave us the option of going upstairs to have some more drinks (all top shelf) and snacks (fruits, cheeses, hot hor d ourves etc.)She told to relax and just let her know when we were ready to go to our rooms, we were escorted to our rooms by someone from Excellence club. Rooms were very nice, toward end of stay did notice some very tiny ants, but this a tropical island and it had just rained, bring bug spray, sunscreen, and antifog if you wear eyeglasses, humidity is high. the ride from the airport is long, but it gives an idea of what the Island is like very poor. Since the Hotel is no longer going to be a Secrets property in January, we did notice that some things needed repair. the pool is great, beach beautiful, ocean rough. Entertainment ok, but we were not Broadway. Food good, not great. Many people complain that there are no top shelf liquors we had no problem if you ask, and pool drinks are not real stropn, but if you asked the bartender added more liquor,(we all like the Sammy Sosa's) but the drink of the day was good every day of our stay. We are looking forward to trying the new Secrets in Punta Cana, which is closer to the airport.
