{"text":"Barcelo Bavaro Palace - great beach! Overall we had an excellent experience at this hotel and would return here based on the quality and value for the price we paid.Resort. The Palace is the best of the 5 hotels at the Bavaro Beach resort and one of the 3 that are located directly on the beach. Guests at the Palace have dining privileges at all the other hotels, guests at the other hotels do not have privileges at the Palace. The resort is only 20 minutes from the airport which makes for smooth arrivals and departures and less time on the bus. Security is very obvious throughout the resort. The shuttle between hotels is very convenient. We were there during US college Spring Break and the Beach hotel seemed to be virtually full of late teen\/early 20 aged guests and in the evening the noise and energy in the lobby and bar areas was quite high. The Palace was quiter and seemed to be occupied by an older clientelle and families.Room. Very good size, king size bed, small balcony. Bathroom is getting a bit dated.Beach. Excellent, clean, well maintained, shallow, gradually sloped and you really can't beat the location - literally a few steps outside the entrance to our building.Golf. Adequate. Good layout but conditioning is a bit tired. But since green fees are free plus a $30 cart fee if you stay at the Palace (green fee of $60 for non-guests and $30 for guests of othe Barcelo propertieslus the $30 cart fee) it is OK.Food. Very good for an all inclusive resort. At the Palace buffet you can select specific pieces of meat (steak, pork, chicken, fish, burgers, etc) and have them grilled to your liking while you watch - a benefit if you are concerned about the quality of the food. This same feature is also available at the beach bar\/restaurant throughout the day which is a big surprise. A la carte restaurants are available for a $30 premium for dinner.Staff. Check in was smooth, bellman was efficient. Maid service was acceptable but not fantatsic. Staff at food and beverage locations were fairly attentive and friendly. Language is a bit of a problem as most staff other than reception desk and guest services speak almost no English. While I recognize that the DR is a Spanish speaking country and the Barcelo is a Spanish chain, 80% of tourist revenue in the DR comes from the US and a substantial additional amount comes from Canada so I would expect a few more folks capable of speaking English at the resort much as staff do in resorts in Mexico and Cuba.Entertainment. The Palace had a stage show every night. more than half of these shows were excellent with professional singers, musicians and dancers. The remainder invovled audienece participation and were not as good. There was also a more glitcy show at the Casino every night which was quite good but only an hour long and the drinks were not included.
