{"text":"Yes...it should be on your bucket list... This is a unique colonial property that is well worth a visit once in a lifetime!We stayed for four nights. Major problem with room made a mess of our first night. We booked a Palm Court room (checked chain of emails from the agent to verify). We arrived and were shown to one of the personality suites in a courtyard location (Ava Gardner). Whether it was the right level or not was academic, it was uninhabitable because of lacquer fumes. We asked to be moved before the front desk left the room and were shown to an adequate, but unimpressive courtyard room facing a busy street which had 24 hr construction activity. Had a very bad night.Went down the next night, and were finally shown to a Palm Court room which was extremely nice. Lovely outlook, quiet area and very nice fit out. Take your own iPod and speakers.In subsequent discussions with the front desk we discovered that there was a room adjoining the Ava Gardiner which was being renovated which was the cause of the fumes and that they had left four rooms vacant to deal with it. Clearly they needed to leave an extra one.Overall service was good. Enthusiastic if not skillful. I think our description was cheerfully incompetent. There were, however, some very nice moments. For instance, we were in the habit of having a pre-dinner drink on the balcony with friends, and when they noticed we were using the bar fridge Pringles as nibbles, the next night they were replaced be a small selection of nibbles laid out as our wine was brought. Hand written notes of apology for the room debacle.Dinner in the Grill was superb. The sommelier was exceptional and has a great wine list to work with. High tea in the Tiffin room was lovely and breakfast was nice. Singapore Slings in the Long Bar were much better than expected! The pool was lovely and relatively quiet (about 24 sun beds, but never full, chlorine levels were tropically strong!). The spa was nice with several treatments much approved of by my other half.Concierge was very helpful with tracking down retailers we wanted to visit.But the reason for visiting is simply the buildings and grounds themselves. The restoration work is extraordinary. The history palpable. The museum fascinating.
