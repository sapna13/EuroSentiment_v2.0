{"text":"great time My wife and I and two other couples just got back from the Iberostar Dominicana. We all had a great time, the resort was clean including the beach and the food was good. When booking at this resort check the prices for Dominicana and the Punta Cana both buildings are the same and they are equal distance to the pool and buffets. Book the one that is cheaper in price because you get the same everything no matter what resort you stay at. The food was good like I said and you will not go hungry that is for sure. The only negative is the night life they had a show every night that was ok if you knew spanish. They do try to speak some broken english but it is mostly spanish. They do have a disco bar that opens at 11pm but it had alot of todays retro music and i'm a eighties guy. Besides that it is worth the money to stay there. If you are a beer drinker only, then you have to hope you like there local brew. It is called Presidente, I enjoyed it over and over again. If you like mix and frozen drinks then you are all set they have plenty of booze down there. If you have young kids or do not care to see topless woman, this is not the island for you. I don't think has to do with the resort it is just the nationality of the people that go there. Alot of people from Europe and South America were there and they lay in the sun topless. Enjoy your trip! ","annotations":[]}
