{"text":"Can't fault it! Stayed for a couple nights between Christmas and New Year in one of the Library's std room.Can't fault this hotel - Ok, it's not a huge hotel, but has an excellent boutique feel about the place and very comfortable. Our room was not big, but so well thought out that it is not really noticible. Bathroom in particular is really well thought through. Even though we were on third floor we didn't really hear any street noise (other than some unusually noisy delivery to a building being renovated opposite one morning). Room was clean, well lit, warm enough etc etc]Complimentary brekfast was good - cerials, fresh fruit salad, pastries, fresh juice + coffee - not a massive choice, but exactly what I'd eat normally. Cocktail bar on top floor is an excellent place to end an evening as well - cocktails are good as well.All the staff are very friendly and can't help you enough.Not sure if the restaurant on the ground floor was part of the hotel or not (I guess so as you could order room service from there). Not a great number of restaurants nearby (that we found), and we ate in the restaurant one evening and the food was very nice although the wine is expensive (and they didn't have any of the cheaper bottles left - i just hate that, always so convenient - for them). Location was excellent 10 \/ 15 mins walk from Empire State, Times Square or Macy's and about 20 - 30 mins walk to central Park or Bloomingdales. One block from Grand Central and the Chrysler building - it really couldn't be a better spot.Would i go back? - absolutely no question I would, great value for money!!!
