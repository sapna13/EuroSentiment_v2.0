{"text":"Mediocre  I've stayed here twice, first in June '06, and again in Jan '07. While this review is specifically for the Jan '07 stay, both stays were comparable, Fri+Sat nights, and both were at a nightly rate of $55 via an opaque, prepaid, online booking service (I named my own price). The hotel's own website states:  Please note the hotel will be undergoing renovations from Nov. 1, 2006 until Mar. 30, 2007.My advice is: Do not pay rack rate here until after renovations are complete!On the upside, the room was well-furnished, with two double beds, attractive wall coverings, TV, ironing board and steam iron, free wireless  wired internet (more important than TV!), a small desk, and adequate lighting. There were nice soaps and shampoo\/conditioner\/lotion in the bathroom, along with clean towels, washcloths, and a coffee maker. As noted by others, the elevators were functional and fast. Climate control in the room was adequate. I also appreciated ceramic coffee mugs and glass tumblers (rather than plastic). And there was a sliding-door closet, with hangars and plenty of storage for luggage, etc. I was annoyed that there was not a luggage rack, however.On the downside... the bathroom ceiling was absolutely filthy with mould and peeling plaster, the grout was mouldy, and the floors stained. I'll stop there, because as noted by the many flyers, the hotel is undergoing renovations to replace all guest bathrooms from the studs out. The worn carpeting and shabby draperies are also set to be replaced. I can only hope that the hard and uncomfortable mattresses will be replaced too. As noted by others, the rooms facing the hospital do experience sirens and road noise all night long, and I don't think the renovations will fix that. And renovating the tiny bathrooms won't make them any larger.I had little interaction with the desk clerk; however, I was pleased that my advance phone call at 10 PM the day of check in was sufficient for them to hold my room until my very late arrival of 12:30 AM. (Prepaid bookings are sometimes cancelled with no refund if you don't check in before midnight of the arrival date. Fortunately that did not happen to me.)Aside from the items noted above which will be rectified by renovations, my stay was satsifactory, and the price was terrific. The outdoor pool was closed. Others seemed to be enjoying the restaurant, though I ate elsewhere. There isn't a lot of late-night dining in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, other than a pizzeria. There seemed to be a security guard out-and-about, so I always felt safe. Yes, there is a Red Line T subway station about two blocks away; the hotel has no self-parking and the adjacent garage charges $36\/day with no in\/out. (So if you're going to park, use the hotel's valet parking, which is the same price but allows in\/out). There is no on-street parking available. I would stay at this hotel again, though I'd really want to find a cheaper parking option. I'm sure that after the renovations, this will be a much more attractive property.
