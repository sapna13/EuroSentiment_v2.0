{"text":"We would not consider staying anywhere else. First time in Bali 1975, some hotels OK, some not so good. It was a question of looking for what we considered to be the best. First time we stayed at Novotel Benoa ( not to be confused with Novotel Nusa Dua ) we knew that we had hit the jackpot and had found the hotel that we were looking for. Since our first visit we have now stayed there maybe twelve times and now go there twice a year. The open Balinese style reception area is very welcoming as is the ambience of the whole hotel. We have stayed in Superior rooms,Tropical Terrace rooms, Beach Cabana and The Villas and have been comfortable in each. The breakfasts are deliciously huge and cater for every taste. There is a differant menu theme for dinner every night, the hotel has a good quartet who play six nights a week and on a couple of nights a week you can be entertained with Balinese dancers who are part of the hotel staff. If you want to know more about the Balinese culture and visit the village then seek out Mr Wibowa. The beach is both clean and safe. There are three pools one of which is suitable for toddlers.Water sports are very close by with a kiosk for booking next door. Baby sitting is 100% safe with Padma. We had a family wedding at Novotel Benoa, it was professionally catered for, our family was fully entertained and we were delighted. The staff throughout the hotel are caring, helpful, courteous and friendly, the management is professional. We, in writing this review may sound rather bias, and we are, after years of searching we believe that we have found the best hotel on the island, we have never had a problem, and quite honestly we would not consider staying anywhere else.
