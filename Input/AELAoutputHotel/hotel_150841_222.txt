{"text":"Great Stay! 12 of us just returned form Christmas stay at the iberostar Bavaro. All of us would be more than willing to return. The D.R. seems to be a very good value compared to others. Plusses: Staff was very nice,beach is awesome--all the hotels are set back and only two stories so all one sees is palm trees and beach chairs for miles in either direction. The water and sand are gorgeous. The hotel strained a bit during Xmas week but still the service was very good and we always could find chairs by the beach and pool and even a palapa. During the rest of the year, it must really be a dream. The food was very good for a buffet. The rooms were large and comfortable-mattresses firm butnot hard. Nice balconies overlooking the gardens,peacocks etc. The landscaping is lush and immaculate. The pool is large and nice. We took a $39 snorkel trip which was good tho not spectacular. The Hobie Cats are fun. The shows were of a professional quality, mostly latin music. Negatives: the wine was Spanish Swill. The liquours and beers good but not top shelf. The theater was open air so rooms near the main building were noisy up until midnite. the maids yell a lot so wake people up in the morning, which possibly may be their purpose. The restaurant reservation system was cumbersome and inefficient sincethere were many open tables at supposedly sold out places. Tipping is very appreciated. The overall hassle factor is zero. One can negotiate the grounds even if partially handicapped-otherwise bring a wheelchair since there are no shuttles (one has to call for the bellman and wait- which we had to do to go to the Dominica next door for the casino--its a ten minute walk.) We booked thru Vacation Store Miami which I would not particularly recommend. The transfers were a hassle. The construction next door was apparently shut down for the holidays.  this is our second iberostar stay-very pleased with them--this one is somewhat better than the Playa De Carmen in every way except that there one can take excursions whereas Punta is somewhat isolated. Havefun!
