{"text":"As Good As It Gets We have just returned from seven days at the Mandarin Oriental and what a stay. The moment that we stepped out of the immigration hall, we where greeted by the hotel representative and taken back to the MO by a Mercedes.We were greeted by the hotel staff that where waiting for us at the front door, check-in was quick and smooth inside our room. Due to past experience we had booked a Club Harbour View room, but where upgraded to Club Harbour View suite. The view from these rooms at night is just fantastic with the Merlion standing at the entrance to the Singapore River to the back drop of the financial district.The rooms are all well appointed with impeccable d√ã√\u2022√ñcor that has a high standard of maintenance from the housekeeping team. The bags arrived within a few minutes of the check-in. The beds are very comfortable with a choice of pillows available to meet most needs. The housekeeping team serviced the room several times during the day and a turn down service was undertaken during evening cocktails. The bathroom was modern and well appointed with tub and a shower the toiletries where of a good standard.Visited Melt to experience the famous buffet breakfast and was not disappointed, the buffet was extensive, fresh and offered plentiful choice.  Breakfast was also taken in the Club Lounge this was of a more formal offering where you are treated as individuals by professional dedicated staff.Used the gym on a daily basis, this had recently been refurbished with new Techno equipment, cold towels along with iced water always on hand. The pool and surrounding areas where spotless, the staff where very attentive anticipating your every need, offering iced water and cold towels upon arrival and several offerings of sorbets along with iced fruit. The club comes alive each evening and is a special place to unwind and enjoy some fabulous cocktails and canap√ã√\u2022√ñs. One of the most over looked benefits offered to Club gests is a 20:00 check out, with most flights back into Europe departing around 23:00 it good to have a late check out.Any visit to MO must include an Oriental Club package.
