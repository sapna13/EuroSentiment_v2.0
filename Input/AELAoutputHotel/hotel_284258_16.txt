{"text":"Good Enough For Us! I was booked to this hotel through a secret deal on a certain website.After reading a few reviews I was a little worried what to expect! I believe it comes down to what you expect in a hotel,and previous experiences in 5 star. I rarely travel,so the thought of a 5star hotel in sydney sounded good.My daughter (7) and I stayed overnight in a deluxe king room.We traveled by train to wynyard station and is only a street away walking.On arrival,the door was opened with a welcome to the amora the girls at front desk were polite and showed us how to use the cards for the elevator and rooms.Our room was on floor 17.I found the rooms spacious enough,HUGE king size comfortable bed,well stocked bar fridge,tv,robes,slippers,guides to sydney,very nice bathroom with deep tub,seperate shower,shower gel\\shampoo\\cond\\hand lotion. Our room looked into the other buildings with glimpses of the water,but if you stay in the CBD you just expect that and being from the country it was fine with us to check out the city. We had a light dinner at the Gallery and was nice.Breakfast for a buffet is $33,but there is a food court practically underneath,with every kind of eatery you could wish for.Also a cafe next door advertising full breakfast and coffee for $12.50.Location - Perfect! A short walk to circular quay\\botanic gardens\\ferries\\trains etc was excellent.We explored the hotel pool which we thought was nice with a sauna\\steam room\\spa as well,and the beauty room.Did not use these but seemed very relaxing.Other reviews say about times with this hotel.Yes the pool\\restaurants etc are open certain times, so if this is important to you doesnt it make sense to find this stuff out before you go?Anyway we loved it,and the service,I think if you have a smile,they will too.
