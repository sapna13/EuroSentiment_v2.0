{"text":"One of the Best in Bali This is our second trip to Bali - part fun and part work. First year we had a private villa which was nice but limited us to one spot. This year we stayed first nights at The Ritz Carlton in a huge one bedroom villa with private pool - wonderful. Next stop was the Novotel in Nusa Dua - we saw it and left immediately. The Laguna kindly took us in and the service from the greeting at the door to the afternoon teas in the library, to the breakfast staff that remembers you each day - was amazing. The staff are sincerely friendly, kind and actually assist. Our bags were brought by the Concierge from the Novotel without event or even a charge. All the other reviews about the restaurants, pools, delightful breakfast, garden setting, internet in the room that actually works - are all true. We stayed over a week and then returned for another few days after our time in Ubud - make sure you stay there too !The excercise room is great and available 24 hours. We didn't try the massages here - but the body treatments - waxing and pedicure were not the best. Try the massages just down the road at the Grand Hyatt - wonderful new spa with great setting.We ate at the hotel and for Japense at the hotel next door - a Westin I think ? We also went often to Seminyak - we didn't mind taking a taxi back and forth as it could be a little dull in Nusa Dua. The Library Restaurant and of course Ultimo are wonderful values in Seminyak.
