{"text":"Fabulous! We flew to New York on 10th August, so got caught up in the security threat circus, which meant we were really late and very tired when we arrived. The reception staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful, and when we got to our room on 34th floor the incredible view (East River, 1st Avenue, Empire State and Chrysler Building) took away all the stresses of the day. It was fantastic - I couldn't get enough of that view. The room was spacious with 2 Queen size beds - arguably the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. It wasn't perfect, but for what we paid it was great - plenty of room, and really clean. All the staff we encountered were really helpful and friendly. The only minor niggle was lack of mirror in the bedroom, which was a bit of a pain for 2 women wanting to get ready at the same time!Location wise it's ideal - a 20 minute walk gets you to Times Square, and it's nice to be away from the noise and hustle. John's Diner, a 2 minute walk up 44th Street, does a good breakfast, and there are plenty of other shops nearby.Do: buy a New York City pass - saves money and time for getting into attractions; try the Circle Line Harbour Lights cruise in the evening; Liberty Helicopters - not cheap but well worth it; see Wicked at the Gershwin Theatre - it'll blow you away; spend time in Central Park; go to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and have a drink on the roof garden, for fab views of Central Park. And if you've never been to New York before, invest in a good guide book (I used the Brit's Guide and the Eyewitness Guide) - it saves a lot of time if you already know what\/where you want to see and do.We both loved New York and can't wait to get back! It's an amazing place and will stay in my heart forever. And I'd quite happily go back to the same hotel. ","annotations":[]}
