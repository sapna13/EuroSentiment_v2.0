{"text":"Comfortable stay, but isolated and problem with min-bar charge This hotel is generally nice. On the plus side 1.The bedding is extremely comfortable. You will sleep well.2.The hotel seems to be well made and it is quiet.3.There is a nice pool. It is roomy and has little sprinklers that squirt out from one side.4.There is lots of free parking. But, there are some negatives:1. The hotel is isolated. You can not walk anywhere. If you try, you will probably get run over. The hotel does operate a shuttle, but it is on a first come, first serve basis. So, you can't reserve it for use. It's best to have a rental car if you stay at this place. There are plenty of restaurants a few exits down.2. There is an expensive restaurant on the premises and also a bar with bar food. The bar food is for the most part not very healthy.2. They spray a wierd fragrance in the lobby, I guess to create some ambience. It smells like a really strong, synthetic floral perfume. Yuck.3. The hotel erroneously charged me for the mini-bar ($50.00.) I did not use the mini bar, so I am guessing that a hotel employee took stuff from the mini-bar and charged it to my room. I called the hotel and they apologized and said that I would be refunded. I did appreciate the quick response, but hey...I'm not used to having false charges on my credit card. I'm glad that I checked.All in all, it wasn't a bad stay. However, for the reasons above I would probably seek out another hotel next time in Dallas. If you have business in the area, it's probably a decent choice. ","annotations":[{"endOffset":237,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":233}]}
