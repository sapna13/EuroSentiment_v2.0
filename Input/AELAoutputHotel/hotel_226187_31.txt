{"text":"The best in the Grove area for the price.. During a recent business visit to Coconut Grove, my company had made a reservation through the USA office for the Grand Bay Hotel.. Well..the state of the Grand Bay was unbelievably terriblle., especially for the ridiculous price that I was paying.Through my customer office in the Grove I got into the Sonesta.It was a huge improvement. Although the building is a bit bland, the reception, the staff, and the cleanliness of the room was just great ( If there is one thing I cannot abide, that is a dirty room, and the Grand Bay was dirty !) So a commendation for the Sonesta is due. I had looked at two other hotels and they were the Double Tree and the Mayfair. The Double Tree was not bad (I had stayed there before) and it was the least expensive. The Mayfair is meant to be a 'Leading Hotel Of The World' group, but didn't have good reviews and looked a bit 'tired' when I went to see it, and it has no pool.My room in the Sonesta (139 usd) had a small kitchen, sitting room, bedroom, walk-in wardrobe, and two toilets one bath. Nice view over the Grove. Two TVs, coffee maker, etc. Swimming pool on the 8th floor was a bit small but had clean water. The breakfast was included and served in the restaurant on the 8th with a nice view over the bay. So there you go ! Thanks Sonesta. Keep it going !-- Tony. Luxembourg.
