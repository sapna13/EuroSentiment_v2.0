{"text":"Best Hotel I've ever been in We stayed at the Chesterfield Dec. 07 and loved it. We read all of the tripadvisor reviews and disagree with some of them. There is no smoky bar - all public areas are smoke free. If you are going to stay at the Chesterfield then save extra money and eat there. The food preperation is unbelievable and the service excellent. A large part of the experience of the Chesterfield is the wonderful pampering by the staff. You have to be around to be pampered. They make you feel very special and important but in no way pandered to, nor are they insincere - real hospitality people doing a great job. We had a regular small room, beautifully decorated, coffee, hot chocolate and plenty of cookies free. Absolutely silent, no sounds of anykind from anywhere. Cosy, comfortable, pleasant to be in. The hotel is located at Pearl and Charles streets. One block down Pearl and you'll be in Shepards Market where there are plenty of bars, takeouts and markets. Eat there if you want to be jammed in, smoked up and served low average to poor food - you'll save some money but you'll miss half the fun of the Chesterfrield. Many people have their dinner in the bar of the Chesterfield to save on that meal. A 20oz mug of Stella beer, a big puffy sandwich, french fires, tons of cashews, etc. Don't take the tube from the airport unless you want fight the crowds, heft your bags up long stairs to get out of the underground and then walk a mile to the hotel (it's not as easy as some people let on). Take the dot to dot shareride. Seventy bucks airport to hotel door and when they pick you up, if you pay for a discounted round trip - it's your hotel straight to the airline of your choice. I really debated with myself whether to make this review public - more people will want to come and it's going to make reservations more difficult . There is a very good reason why the Chesterfield has so many good reviews. ITS NOT A HOTEL, IT'S A LIFETIME MEMORY!!
