{"text":"Beautiful but boring! We were a party of 12, (three families) Kids ages ranged from 6 to 19. There was absolutely nothing for the teens to do at night and there were no other teens on the property to hang out with. The disco was all Spanish music and not much fun for the Americans visiting. The staff speaks very little English, and although they appeared to be very friendly, it was quite difficult to communicate with them. We wanted mayonaise and they brought salt, we wanted powdered sugar and they brought ketsup; it just went on like that, which got annoying by the third day! The bugs are horrendous at the buffet in the morning, so if it's cool outside you need to sit out there. None of the food or drinks were very cold, nor was the coffee or tea very hot. Everything was just luke warm. The food was so so; two of the kids got sick on the last day and of course we were careful not to drink the water unless it was bottled. I do not suggest going there in the summer months, as it will be unbearable heat. The rooms are kept extrememly cold, however the wall a\/c units are loud and will disrupt your sleep. The mattress is as hard as a board and although we stayed in the beach casitas with a gorgeous view, we were quite disappointed in the room. It was small, and not well lit at night. The walkway at night is not well lit and the floors throughout the resort are quite slippery, so be careful with the shoes you bring. All in all, the resort is beautiful just as nature intended it to be, however, we all felt as though we were truly in a very poor country as the accomodations were fair at best. It's a wonderful place to escape to for complete relaxation, and I suppose if you take alot of board games and drink alot of alcohol you will make your own fun, but don't look for entertaining shows at night and don't expect much from the disco because it's just not there. Personally, I don't think think we will ever go back .
