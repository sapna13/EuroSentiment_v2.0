{"text":"Good experience Stayed at The Marina Mandarin in Nov 06 for 5 nights with great promotion from expedia and I don't have much to complain about really. While checking in, I asked for a room with a nice view and was provided with a 14th floor corner room overlooking the Marina and The Oriental was right opposite - fantastic choice. The only downside was the walk from lifts as I had to walk in a big square shape every morning and night! The room has been partly renovated and was in a suitable size and good condition. Some pieces of furniture looked tired, but wasnt a big deal. Bathroom was clean and spacious but looked kind of late 80's. I agree with every reviews below about the noise from the lobby area which sometimes the songs could put me to deep sleep and sometimes it could be a little frustrating. The location is perfect in terms of physical comfort. Restaurants and shops in Marina Square were easily reached and if you need to take a cab, there is always one - I never ever had to wait for it. The spa was amazing. The atmosphere was so serene and I just loved going there for treatments. The rates were not friendly but service was spot on - highly recommended.The two problems I came across while staying at the hotel were the conceirge and the crowd. I was a solo traveller and hardly know anyone in town so when I was asking for crucial information, this man seems to always be rushing to do something and never let me finished my sentence. I just got fed up with the service so I helped myself with the directions in the end. As for the crowd, there were wedding receptions held at the hotel twice during my stay which made it troublesome getting in and out from the main entrance.All in all, I would not mind staying at the Marina Mandarin next time I visit Singapore.
