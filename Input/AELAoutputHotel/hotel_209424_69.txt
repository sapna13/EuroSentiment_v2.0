{"text":"This is not the Ilikai we used to love!!! I've stayed at the Ilikai for over 20 years. Recently, it was a Marriott hotel chain, but they sold it and it is now independently owned. I'm sad to say, the hotel is a disaster. I'm not been dramatic -- everything that could go wrong in an hotel is happening in the Ilikai. The basic infrastructure is failing. For over two weeks, only 2 or 3 our of 6 elevators are working. The wait time can be up to 30 minutes to get downstairs. They have shut down and sold one of two pools to another company so the entire hotel is forced to share one small pool along with the condo association which has units in the building. They are mostly retired snow-birds who get down to the pool first thing in the morning, reserve their chairs and then disappear. On three different occasions we could not get a seat around this small pool, and there wasn't a single server offering drinks. While we did eat at the outdoor restaurant Canoe, we were startled by the rat that was snacking under our table. Yes, you read that right... it was a rat. The room cleaning has become sub-par as they have cut back almost 50 percent on the cleaning staff. Our room often wasn't cleaned until after four in the afternoon, and then it was often still filthy. The quality and quantity of the staff is deplorable. They joke about the state of the hotel and say they are the last of the Mohicans... they know the writing is on the wall. I have a history in this hotel and it breaks my heart to see it deterioate in such a way. Bu sadly, at these prices, I advise you to stay away.
