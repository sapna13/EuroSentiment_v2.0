{"text":"Casablanca Hotel - Perfect Place to Stay I am very familiar with NYC having grown up in the area. I have also stayed at some very nice hotels there over the years. I loved the Casablanca Hotel. I brought my niece with me for a long weekend. We were right around the corner from Times Square -- close to the subway station, the Theater District and lots of restaurants. The hotel is a boutique hotel which is great because the staff knows you as you walk in and out which makes it feel very small town in the big city. The rooms are smaller than big chains but they are also neater and cleaner. Unlike big hotels, you don't hear doors slamming all night, and other than the traffic around Times Square (which is expected), it is very quiet. The beds were very confortable. Free extras included a beautiful breakfast spread in Rick's Cafe. Fresh pastries and bagels, cereals, yogurts, cappuccino, lattes, coffee, hot chocolate. In the evening there is free wine, champagne, fruit, cheese, crackers. Late at night before going back to our room, we would go to Rick's Cafe for cookies. Rick's Cafe was clean and comfy and gave us a chance to chat with other guests. There is also a computer there (with a printer) so we could print our boarding passes. For smokers, there is an outdoor patio with lots of potted plants. The Casablanca Hotel is everything they say it is on their website. It truly is an oasis in the middle of a very chaotic desert!
