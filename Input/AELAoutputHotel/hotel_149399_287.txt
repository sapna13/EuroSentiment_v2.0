{"text":"Beautiful Resort - not great for scuba though We have been to many resorts throughout the Caribbean and this one ranks as having one of the nicest grounds we have ever seen. I would say that their food is above average, and the nightly buffet is very good if you choose not to go to a restaurant. We did not find it difficult at all to get booked for dinner and thought the Japanese and Sea Food restaurants were the best. Be prepared for long walks at this resort as the grounds are huge. They have golf cart type trains that roll through the resort at regular intervals but we found it faster to walk. Keep in mind that they are not on the ocean, they are just off the beach so you will need to walk to the ocean to get a view of it. They do have one of the nicest pools I have ever seen and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The real downside to this resort is all the timeshare hassles (everyday they will be hitting you up) and our experience was that the scuba diving was terrible. The waters you will dive in will be rough and the visibility will be about 40 feet. I would recommend passing on this resort if you are going on a dive vacation.If you don't mind just staying in the resort for you entire vacation and just relaxing and perhaps spending hours at the pool bar :) - this would be the resort for you.
