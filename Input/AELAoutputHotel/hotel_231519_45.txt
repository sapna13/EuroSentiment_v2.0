{"text":"Great Spot, Room a bit small We stayed at the Hotel Inglaterra June 9-12. The hotel is in a great location, near good restaurants, walking distance to Ramblas, Gothic Quarter and Metro.The hotel was fine and suited our needs. We had 'deluxe' room with a queen bed and french doors that opened onto a very small balcony. Some noise from the street, but not enough to keep us up at night if we closed the window and turned on the air conditioning. Hotel staff were freindly and helpful. Room was in OK repair. Three comments: 1. Room was very small, and often two people would be in each other's way during busy times (like when getting ready in the morning). In all fairness, the hotel did offer to upgrade us from the Deluxe room to a suite when we arrived for 35 euros a night, and we declined (since we already thought at 210 euros a night was enought to pay for a hotel).2. As others have written, no full length mirror in the room.3. Bed was not comfortable, both my wife and myself had sore backs after sleeping on the bed, and we typically are not picky when it comes to beds in hotels.We did eat breakfast the first morning at the hotel for 12 Euros each. Breakfast was OK, but we decided to explore the area a bit, so we ate all subsequent meals outside of the hotel. There are hundreds of restaurants within walking distance. We found that in general you get what you pay for (expensive restaurant, better food, cheap restaurant, cheap food).Best restaurant experience was the L' Acadamie and Plaza St. Just in the Gothic Quarter. Hard to find (better have a good map!), not cheap but not too exhorbidant (80 Euros for the two of us), and excellent food and wine.
