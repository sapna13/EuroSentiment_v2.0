{"text":"A great trip for us Secrets Punta Cana is a very delightful resort. It has natural beauty and the staff is very good at taking care of you. I did take into consideration all the reviews prior to my trip and looked for most of the problems. I did not find many of them and it did seem that maybe people are a tad bit critical. I also understand that each person feels that they are the only person of importance and should be treated better that anyone else. That being said I observed the following while my wife and I visited the resort during the Nov 18- 24, 2006. Drive to Resort: Long about 1 hour on bad roads, not the best part of the trip.Upon Arrival: Fast service at check-in, staff nice and very helpful.Restaurants: Good, French was our favorite along with Seaside grill.Beach: Very clean and beautiful, the trash that we witnessed was on the federal property.Service on Beach and Pool side: Very good and the ladies were so nice. They did not require a tip at all. The service was the same either way.  Entertainment: A bit cheesy at times but they really looked as if they were trying.Rooms: We had a swim out on the cascading pool. The room was large as resorts go. Bed was very hard, but overall nice.Spa: The staff very nice and good at their job. Deep tissue was my favorite. The dressing rooms were not up to par. Several days the shampoo, conditioner, and soap were all empty no towels on two occasions. This was not a huge issue returned to the room and showered there.Shops and vendors: Shops were a bit pricey. The vendors were pushy but did finally take no for an answer. Wildlife: Nice touch chickens, flamingos, parrots, peacocks, ducks. This was a joy to see all the animals walking around, put a smile on my face each time.  I have been to several resorts in Mexico and Mayan Riviera and have seen the good and bad of things. When staying anywhere I think it all has to do with your attitude and desire to have an open mind when you start you trip. All the reviews I am sure were very honest and there problems were big to them. I personally enjoyed myself and would return to this property without a question. I hope that this has helped someone enjoy a wonderful trip to Secrets. If you have any other questions do not hesitate to email them and I will reply promptly.
