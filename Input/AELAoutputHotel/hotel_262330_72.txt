{"text":"Fantastic experience - see New York at its best ! I went to New York for a trip in December 2005 and had a great time at the Millenium Hilton. We stopped on the 39th floor and had a breathtaking view of Ground Zero. The hotel was the closest hotel to the Twin Towers and the staff are always keen to tell you stories. There is even a rescued flag framed in the reception area from the building that was salvaged on the terrible attacks in September 2001. Make sure that you ask for a front facing room as the views are simply stunning. The views from the rear will encompass Brooklyn Bridge. We didnt get chance to use the swimming pool facility but did enjoy the breakfast everyday which had the most delicious muffins I have tasted . . . ever! and you can eat as many as you want :) Nearby there is a underground station which is accessible to most places with ease, the hotel is situated just a short walk to the harbour front where you can see the Statue of Liberty. There are several restaurants nearby but dont make the mistake of ordering a starter as you wont eat the main . . . food was fab, but there was just too much of it - even for a strapping 6ft 5 lad like me. The staff in the hotel were all very friendly and nothing was too much trouble, when I ordered Champagne to the room it was there within minutes and there was never any fuss. If you are a shopaholic be sure to check out the Department Store next to the hotel 'Century 21' I think the name was - loads of bargains to be grabbed, fantastic prices and lots of choice. The hotel was also a short walk from Wall Street as it is situated in the heart of the financial district so there tends to be an after-work crowd in the hotel bar at night and that is where you can really soak up the atmosphere and mingle with the locals. Overall a thoroughly enjoyable trip - lovely hotel - the only thing I wouldnt recommend is spending New Years Eve in Times Square, although its nice to say you have done it you cant see much and you need to start queuing at 3 - 4pm in the afternoon in the freezing cold . . and if you need the toilet, well you lose your place! Still I cant complain, an unforgettable experience which has left me with fantastic memories . . enjoy!
