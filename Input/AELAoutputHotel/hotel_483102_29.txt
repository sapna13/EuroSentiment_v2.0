{"text":"comfortable hotel if you get the right room! We stayed at the H10 Universitat last weekend (1st dec-4th dec) and had requested a high floor overlooking the street. When we arrived our room wasn't ready but it wasn't too big a deal as we were early so had to wait about half hour. Were first offered room 208 but didn't want to be on a low floor so we were offered one on the 7th floor but it was a room at the back (705). The room was okay, beds were a bit uncomfortable and i don't think i could have slept in it for more than 3 nights. The room had the bathroom in the corner with frosted glass door. It was a bit different to what we're used to and don't think i'll be installing frosted glass at home anytime soon!!The breakfast was adequate and you could have a choice of cereals, fruit, juice, toast, cold meats, cheese or the full english.We took advantage of the free internet in the lobby, the free snacks in the afternoons and enjoyed the free cava at reception when we arrived, although i did have to ask for it as it wasn't forthcoming.The best thing about the hotel was the location and for the price we paid (339 Euros for 3 nights including breakfast) it was a really good deal. We didn't have any problems with pickpockets whilst there even though it was our biggest worry about going to Barcelona after all the horror stories we had read. Hubby used a discreet money pouch and didn't carry a wallet. I carried my camera all round the city but didn't take my hand off the bag and was constantly on alert, more so than anywhere in the world i've ever been.Would we stay again? Possibly not, but we will probably visit Barcelona again at some time in the future.
