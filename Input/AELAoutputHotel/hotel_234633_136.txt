{"text":"Absolute Rave After studying Trip Advisor in depth, my wife and I chose Hotel Residence Foch for our stay in Paris March 14-19. I cannot over-emphasize how pleased we were with the hotel (and with Trip Advisor for cluing us to it). We travel extensively and I can honestly say that we have never met a friendlier or more helpful staff than the one Nelly has assembled. From the moment Isobel welcomed us to the hotel to the moment Bao waved goodbye to our taxi from the sidewalk, the experience was a real joy. Everything is as advertised and as others have described -- a great bargain, a lovely little breakfast arrangement, quiet location in a residential neighborhood. This last may seem a negative to some -- but get a Metro pass (the hotel's a five minute walk from both Metro and RER) and take the #1 train to the heart of Paris, minutes away. We thought staying in the 16th had its own pleasures anyway, and the hotel staff will direct you to local restaurants if you want to stay in the area for dinner. Our room (#14) was small but immaculate, and perfectly quiet except for some brief vendor noise (the linen delivery truck) one night. We will think of this small hotel as our home-away-from-home in Paris from now on -- such was the degree to which we were made to feel welcome and at ease, setting the stage for a delightful stay overall. Congrats to Nelly and company, and thanks again to Trip Advisor and previous reviewers.
