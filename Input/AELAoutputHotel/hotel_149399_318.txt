{"text":"Brilliant but go Royal Service Brilliant Hotel it is a big complex but after a few days of getting used to where everything is the size is not a problem. From the moment you get there the people can√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ do enough for you arrived at the airport in Punta Cana had a short wait for the bags then some local men come to take the bags to the coach (they do expect a tip for doing this though) then a 20 min drive to the hotel. Once at the hotel we were ushered to the Royal Service lounge which is nice and air conditioned, from there we were taken to our room opposite the Royal Service Pool And Restaurant. The porters take the bags to the room and show you how to book restaurants and how to work the telly.The resort has a number of restaurants on the site 9 (but only 6 were open when we went) all of which were very nice with great service. The resort also has a few buffet restaurants if you want more relaxed evening meal, there are lots of bars all offering a good range of drinks and cocktails again good table service.Hotel is really good cant understand the bad feedback it has had everything that we seen was brilliant even when we did have a problem with one of our parties rooms the service people come out in about 10 mins. There are bugs around but this is not because the place is dirty it is just that its so hot and humid. Would defiantly go to the hotel again the only thing putting me off is the 9 hour flight from the UK.Andy Keogh Keo1979@hotmail.com ","annotations":[{"endOffset":505,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":501},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":501},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":501},{"endOffset":505,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":501}]}
