{"text":"Good choice This hotel probably deserves the good reviews it gets. Previous posts contains a quite accurate description of the place. I am just goning to make some remarksThe hotel is not located in the very centre (fortunatly, to my view). Anyway, it is imposible to be near St Paul, The British Museum and Westminster Abbey at the same time. What is true is that this hotel is not in the shopping or nightlife districts, but in a quiet and peacefull area next to the Tate Britain, so if you like Picadilly√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ enviroment go somewher else. But if not, probably this hotel is your place. Nevertheless from the place you can get to the Big Ben in about 15 minutes walking.Note that rhere is little bit of a walk to Pimlico, St James or Westminster tube stations. If you don't carry heavy luggage and like to walk you can reach the hotel from Victoria station in about 20-25 minutes.  By the way, I suggest to explore the pretty georgian style neiborhood arround St John√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ Church in Smith Square. It is also true that there are not many pubs arround the hotel, but there are at least two. The nearest is √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?¬¢arquis of Granby√à√\u2020\u2022?which is in Dean Ryle Stree (continuation of John Islip street), 2 minutes walking from the hotel. The other is √à√\u2020\u2022√ä??he white Swan√à√\u2020\u2022? in Vauxhall, in the corner with Causton street. About 5 minutes. Both offer a choice of ales, and british food.The hotel is new and stylish. The service, attentive. Rooms could be a bit larger; and there are not many with river view, so if you want one of them, let it know to the hotel in advance. And, if it's cold and you don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ like the noisy, unhealthy and feeeble air heater system, ask for an electric radiador, they have some.Finaly, try to get breakfast included. It is excellent (the earlier you go to have it, the better; it is served from 7.00)I hope this was helful. Have a nice trip!
