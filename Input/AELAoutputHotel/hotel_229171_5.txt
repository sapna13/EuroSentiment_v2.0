{"text":"NH Doelen, Amsterdam The NH Doelen in Amsterdam is in an excellent position, away from busy Dam Square and Central Station, yet within easy reach by foot of many of the main attractions. For example, Dam Square less than 10 minutes, Waterlooplein, Rembrandtplein, flower market, cruise boats - a couple of minutes. It's also in an attractive spot, and is fairly quiet. The hotel advertises itself as four-star, according to the hotel rating system in the Netherlands. I suspect it's similar to the star rating in the UK. It offers good value for money. The staff were excellent and friendly, and very eager to help. However, The Doelen is now looking rather tired and shabby. Our room, though of a reasonable size for a tourist city room, looked very 'nineties' in its furnishings and decor. It needed a makeover and, more importantly, a thorough clean. The net curtains had lost their whiteness some time ago; the upholstery on the easy chair was grubby; nooks and crannies were dusty; some of the wallpaper was peeling. The bathroom, on the other hand, had clearly been renovated, and was pleasant and well-stocked with good quality toiletries. The bedroom itself was well equipped.The pleasant dining room affords an attractive view over the canal. The lounge, with free internet access, was miserable. The reception lobby could be made to look fabulous in its Baroque-style decorations. But again, it really needs a facelift.All in all, we feel that The Doelen is a good quality 3-star hotel, so don't expect 4-star luxury. ","annotations":[]}
