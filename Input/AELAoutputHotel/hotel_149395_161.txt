{"text":"Loved the People Beach Resort Paradisius Punta Cana We arrived and were taken to The Royal Service Building for private check- in, where they gave us snacks and Champagne. After a brief proceredure we were on our way to our very beautiful Garden View Room which included a Butler and all the amenities we expected.The restaurants were all fantastic only two required reservations The French√à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√¨l Romatico√à√\u2020\u2022?and the Japanese which we never made reservations for (no time) We were a bit disappointed when we had diner at The French only because we expected a more formal atmosphere however the food was good. We never ate at the Japanese, but we did go in and look. It as well as the French requires long pants and a collared shirt, I was wearing shorts then so we asked if they had a Sushi Bar. They again reminded us that we needed reservations and proper dress. What was Amazing was that they offered to make us a Sushi carry out and we accepted, it was wonderful,As for the other restaurants our favorite was the Seafood Restaurant , during the afternoon it has the most wonderful lunch buffet everything Fresh including you pick fresh fish that they prepare as you wish. They also have the biggest cheese burgers and hot dogs I have seen in a long time. At night they had a Full service menu which has all seafood selections. The next very good restaurant was the Chinese where we had a lobster dish that was out of this world. We went to the seafood and Chinese twice each.The breakfast Buffet is one of the best we ever had everything is fresh and there is a plentiful supply of fresh island fruit everyday. The pools are incredibly clean and appealing as well as the activities the staff provides including plenty of music and dance pool side.The beach is the most wonderful aspect of the entire vacation it is what one imagines, the color the scenic view in each direction and most important the cleanliness We have stayed in other resorts but this one was definitely the best. The people there go out of there way to make sure you are having the greatest time ever and they do it right. We recommend that you brush up on your Spanish or if you like pay my way I speak the lingo and I would love to go as your personal interpreter Lol My wife and I were there In November and we plan to go back ASAP!
