{"text":"Great Beach Hotel in San Juan Our family spent 5 nights at the San Juan Marriott Resort. Immediately I noticed that the staff was very friendly and professional. We arrived late morning and was presently surprised that we could check in our room early. We had a beach front king room with a sofa bed. The room is a typical Marriott room and the view was great.The hotel is in Condado about a 15 minute taxi ride to Old San Juan. Just outside the hotel is Starbuck and Haagen Dazs Ice Cream. There are plenty of restaurants near the hotel so you dont really need to go anywhere else. We never had a bad meal while in San Juan. There are great restaurants everywhere. The hotel and surrounding area have a Miami\/South Beach feel. It appears that the local govt. is trying to modernize the Condado area. There is still some construction going on in the area and a few abandoned buildings.The hotel beach is small but nice. As everyone else as stated the red flag was out everyday. There is an undertow but it was manageable. My son is 10yrs old and he had no problem in the water. The waves are perfect for boogie boards and body surfing. In fact seeing local kids boarding was a daily occurence. The sand is soft and the Marriott beach chairs are complimentary. Umbrellas were not. There are two pools, one with a water slide. The pool area is nice but a little small for a large resort. Chairs are at a premium so get down there early. As others noted there is alot of shade arond the pool. However you will have no problem getting a tan.I was a little suprised that there was not a kid's program at the hotel. Although I knew this before we left, once we got there and saw the amount of kids I thought they should of offered one at the property. We have been to other Marriott resorts and they had a Marriott Kids Club. There are organized activities for the kids by the pool daily though.We went snorkling through East Wind and the trip was great. Also a trip to the Rain Forest, El Yungue, is a must. Take the La Mina Falls trail and swim in the waterfall. This was one of the highlights of the trip.The Marriott is a great central location to see San Juan and Puerto Rico. We felt safe in the Condado area. There were cops everywhere and everyone, locals and staff, were very friendly.
