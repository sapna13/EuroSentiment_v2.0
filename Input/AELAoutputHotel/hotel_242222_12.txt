{"text":"MUCH better than expected after reading reviews!! long review We just returned from 8 nights at ESJ Towers. I read all the reviews on this property and was quite apprehensive as to what we would find.We booked our 3 bedroom\/2bath condo from a private owner. We did not book through ESJ Towers so I cannot comment on the units they have available for rent. We knew going in that that this is was not a fancy resort with all of the anemities they have to offer. The location is great. The staff at ESJ Towers were great - couretous, friendly, extremely helpful......they couldnt have been better. The conceirge is open every day until about 9pm. It was an invaluable source of information and help for us. We found the lobby large with lots of seating. My husband spent a fair amount of time using the wireless internet in this area. There were 2 rooms with computers and printers - great for printing out boarding passes or anything else. There is a mini mart on site that has a huge variety of items including beer, wine, liquor- yes they are more pricey than a large food store, but it is very convenient to pick up a thing or two. I had read alot about beach access. It was not a big deal at all. You take an elevator to the parking garage, exit, walk maybe 30 steps to a door (security - you need your room card to exit) that leads to the beach. It is not dark during the day as the entrance the cars use to enter the parking garage is right there and lets in LOTS of light. Also the fitness center is located in this area of the parking garagewhere you can also sign out towels and rent beach chairs for $2 . Once you leave the building, you enter a small playground area and a gate to beach access. You punch in a 5 digit code to open gate to beach. This access code was the same the entire time we were there. There was also a securty guard there most of the time checking our names off the list. There is also a man right on the beach in front of ESJ Towers who rents nice beach chairs for $4 a day. Water sports are located very nearby too (jet skiis, banana boats etc).The pool......This area was very nice and large. It had lots of reclining beach chairs. The chairs had cushions on them and towels were always avaialble. We were there over Easter and we were always able to find chairs. There is a small snack stand that sells soda, water, beer, alcohol drinks and hotdogs. There is also a nice bathroom in the pool area. There is security there - a ESJ security guard checks your name on a list and gives you a wrist bracelet. We did not use the restaurant or visit the Mano Mano Lounge. There is a billiard room with 2 pool tables. Also a card room with 4 tables. People were using this as a computer room for wireless internet users. The game room had approximately 10 video games in it.You have to pass through a security gate to enter the property. There is also a security person where you park to register etc. He was great! There is also a securty person where you enter the parking garage. This is a very secured property. From what I observed, all of the properties are treated in this way. While some people find this an aggravation. It is done for our safety. This isnt a 5 star hotel or resort. For us, it worked great. We had a nice clean condo with 2 ocean view balconies, washer and dryer 3 tvs etc. Hotel prices in San Juan, especially beachfront, are pricey. I would suggest you research private owners who have property here. Quite often you can see pictures of their units and that is a great help.Overall, I would not hesitate to stay here again. It isnt the Ritz or the El San Juan......but you arent paying the high prices like you would staying there. We chose it so we could all stay together in one condo as it was a family vacation. We didnt want to stay in a hotel with separate rooms for a week. If you have any questions, send them my way.Karen ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1979,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1975},{"endOffset":2342,"mention":"soda","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Saltine_cracker"],"startOffset":2338},{"endOffset":2405,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2401},{"endOffset":3257,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":3253}]}
