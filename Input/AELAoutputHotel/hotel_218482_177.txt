{"text":"Good but not exceptional My wife and I stayed at the Catalonia from 1\/13\/08 - 1\/20\/08. We had a pleasant stay and it is not a bad resort but it could be so much better.Rooms: The rooms were immaculate, and huge. The soaking tub easily fits 2. The shower was microscopic; don't drop the soap b\/c unless you√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√¥e a contortionist you will not be able to pick it up without stepping out of the shower. Overall the rooms were great.Staff: The resort staff was excellent, they really try very hard to make sure that guests are happy. Many of them speak 4-5 languages. (Spanish, English, French, German, a few even spoke Russian) I guess this was due to the fact that the guests come from all over. While we were there most were from Canada, but there were many from Germany and Spain as well. Beach  Landscaping:The beach was excellent. The water is shallow; you can go out 50 yards+ and still be in water you can stand in. There is sea grass but the resort does a great job keeping it off the beach. The resort itself is gorgeous and well maintained. Truly a tropical paradise.Food and Drink: This is where the resort falls down. The food is edible and you definitely won't starve but you will eat more b\/c your hungry than b\/c you can't wait to taste the next morsel. We ate at all the specialty restaurants (French, American, Japanese,  Mexican) Mexican was good the rest were OK. The buffet is OK as well but the food really was not appetizing. Sucks b\/c one of the biggest draws for any all-inclusive is the food. The drinks were super sweet,  completely inconsistent. The same person could make the same drink 10x and it would taste different each time. They have very few top shelf liquors. That being said, my wife and I still managed to get tipsy a few days during the trip. Activities:We went SCUBA diving; there is a sunken wreck that is cracked in half a short boat ride from the resort. It was great diving through the wreck. We also took ocean Kayaks out  played competitive volleyball on a few days...it was fun.The Jurassic Boogies expedition was a good time as well. You take dune buggies off-roading and then arrive at a beach. Afterwards, you ride trail on horseback. All in all we had a good vacation. Great to get away from work, being parent, life in general. We met some awesome people and had a lot of fun while there. Better food\/drink would have really improved my opinion of the resort. ","annotations":[]}
