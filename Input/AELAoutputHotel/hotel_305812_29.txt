{"text":"Good Location but... This is my 3rd time to HK and 2nd time staying at TST. I love to stay at TST... It is a place with good food and great shopping.Location:Thus, Kimberley Hotel is very well-located. It is just a 10min walk from the MTR... I would advice travellers to walk into those small roads\/lanes\/streets instead of walking along the big main road (i.e. Nathan Road). All these small roads\/lanes\/streets have loads to offer. The Addidas shop along Granville Road has great offer too.There are a few coffeeshop opposite of the hotel for breakfast. Cafe de Coral and Maxim are also nearby. Famous restaurant like Sweet Dynasty (directly opposite of Habour City) and Macau Restaurant are also within walkable distance.A negative point to be taken is the fact the big buses (i.e. those buses to airport) could only stop opposite of the hotel. Raining days will make loading\/unloading of luggages tedious. Thus, please get the porter to help in loading the luggages when the bus to airport has arrived.Room:The room size is small but should be sufficient for 2 persons with luggages. But the room especially the bathroom does show signs of aging. It would be great if the management could plan for some renovation.Service:Staff are friendly and willing to assist. But don't ever ask them to introduce places for dim sum. The place that they suggested me to go for dim sum was a nightmare. It was the most TERRIBLE and YUCKY dim sum I ever had in my life. For dim sum, just go to teh chinese restaurant at Miramar Hotel... it won't disappoint you but it's expensive.
