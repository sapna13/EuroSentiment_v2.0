{"text":"Not worth it at this price point I usually am a fan of the Hilton properties. Having stayed at the Prince Kuhio when it was a Radisson, I was surprised when I found out the Hilton was taking over. While they did upgrade the rooms, I found the experience at the hotel to be less than it should be at the price range. I was travelling on business and, therefore, didn't pay the bill. My corporate rate was only slightly less than the going rate of $199\/night. For that rate, you can probably do better as far as location goes. Although some say the Prince Kuhio is a block from the beach, it's a very long block. The hotel is located in a quiet area of Waikiki, surrounded by condos. While some might like the quiet, I found it a bit distant from decent restaurants and shopping. The room was nice, although smaller than your average Hilton. (Hilton website says 305 sq feet. Hilton Hawaiian Village rooms must be closer to 400 sq feet, based on my perception.) The walls seemed a bit thin, which isn't surprising since this property was built to be a moderate level hotel and not a luxury brand like a normal Hilton. Again, a bit small for the price, in my book.Service was hit and miss. The front desk agent at check-in seemed distracted and not nearly as friendly as I would have liked. (Although, after a 14 hour trip from Florida, it might have been me.) Having the front desk lose two faxes, however, was inexcusable. (They were delivered to the wrong room one evening.) The hotel operator, however, was very cheerful when I called for wake-up calls each evening.All in all, I'd probably recommend another hotel, even though the Prince Kuhio wasn't horrible.
