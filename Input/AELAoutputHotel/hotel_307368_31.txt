{"text":"We loved I stayed one night at the Park Hyatt last week on the 16th October with my grown-up son. We loved the experience and we really wish and plan to return next autumn. Tokyo is a wonderful, beautiful and at the same time cool city. It's really something everyone should experience!We had a large corner room with magnificent views over Tokyo. The beds were very comfortable and the decor in the room stylish. My son appreciated the very large HD-television in the room.The bathroom is nice and spotless, but not exceptional for a hotel of this class (it has a tv as well). We had dinner at the Girandole, the food was good and the service impeccable and very friendly. The check was only about 110,- euros, we both had three courses and I had a glass of wine. A sandwich lunch at the lobby cafeteria was about 40,- euros.Of course we went to check out the New York bar, which was quite nice and very much Lost in translation. A glass of good champagne and a Coke was 24,- euros. Not at all too much, I think. There is a cover charge after 8 pm.In general I found the service excellent in this hotel, very professional, but friendly and helpful at the same time.After dinner there still was one thing to do and that was to test the pool. It' s quite something, unbelievable views, calm atmosphere. We had the pool to ourselves, which was brillant!We had to leave really early for Narita airport, so we tried the room service breakfast as well. It was promtly delivered and delicious. The check out took about a minute and we were given bottles of water for the limousine bus journey the the airport. The bus ride took about 1h 40 minutes and it takes you from door to door. Very convenient.To sum it up, we had high expectations, and we were not at all disappointed, on the contrary!
