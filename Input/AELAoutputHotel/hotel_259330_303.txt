{"text":"Can't wait to go back !!!! Like many we were a bit nervous after reading some of the reviews about this resort, But we found nothing negative about it. We arrived on the late night flight on April 8th 1:15am.Once through customs our air conditioned bus was waiting and we were on our way. AT check in of course there was a line up but we went through efficently, safe lock and remote in hand with luggage right behind us. We were in building 1. We were a group of 5, 3 in room 1114, our son and daughter-in-law in 1127 just down the hall. Our room faced the beautiful gardens, we were near the lobby and the buffet, ideal location not a long walk to anything. The beautiful beach and pools was just a little ways in the opposite direction. We were able to get drinks and something to eat at the Sports Bar at 3:00 am, Orni made great Lattes.Walked to the beach for a quick peek, did not prepare you for the spectacular sight in the morning !!! The rooms are older but clean, and the maid service great, always clean towels, soft drinks and water replaced daily.We always left a little something for the maid it may have helped but Wanda was always very nice, we asked for Diet Coke and we got it. Our toilet got blocked, we called just once and it was fixed within an hour. T.V. worked perfect, not alot of stations but not there for the T.V.The breakfast buffet was amazing, food good, coffee served promplty, and many choices- omlettes made to you liking, fruit, and bread plentiful.FAvourite Al la Carte, The Grill and Italian-Angela at the Italian was a real sweetheart.Went on 2 excursions Saona and swim with the Sharks and Stingrays- so well organized and alot of fun. The Natural Pool where you swim in the Caribean while being served Rhum FANTASTIC!!! All in all everyone had the best time ever and we are planning to return a group of 10 at the same time next year...already counting the weeks- The weather, the food, the people and the resort- all 5 Star plus.....Tipping may help, but also a little respect for the people who work such long hours and are always happy ,goes a long way. They are always smiling, singing and dancing- there are lots of activities as well, you can participate or decline no problem- the shows at night too are a must see, the entertainment staff-Superb. Bring your Thermos Mug for the beach. Flea market, you have to bargain but worth the trip, just outside the Club side of the resort. We also had our pictures done by Chris from the photo center in the Hotel Lobby, he is the best he made 2 hours of picture taking a blast and the photos are very professional - Memories to last, do it if you have the chance. And lastly the BEACH, nothing like it absolutley The Best Anywhere. I could continue but it getting a little long, I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to relax and enjoy family and friends.
