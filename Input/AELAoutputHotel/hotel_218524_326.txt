{"text":"Excellente - One of the best adults place to stay in Punta Cana, DR We travel twice a year to different caribean islands. We had stayed 5 years ago at Iberostar Suite in Punta Cana but was somewhat disappointed with the food and alcohol. We are frequent travelers and we enjoy great tasting food, liquor, service, and quality - even if we pay a little bit more to get it. Even when we are not traveling we like to try new restaurants and enjoy great drinks and quality of service.Excellence was recommended to me by my co-workers who go back every year for 5 years and have never been disappointed. So we said we will try it. The transportation from the airport was there on time and we did not have to wait for them to fill up an entire bus which I hate. My husband and I were the only ones is a private car. The trip from the airport to the resort was bumpy but had nothing to do with the resort transportation. We booked the Excellence club level package with its own concierge and club lounge where different food presentations are laid out each day and internet service was offered. The Club Manage Roberto Puello was very attentive and patient with our needs and came through with anything we needed. Worth the extra money for the Excellence Club Level but you can enjoy this resort without a club level since the food, liquor, staff, and other amenities are consistently offered to everyone. We arrived at the hotel and was greated with champagne upon arrival and was excorted to the Excellence Club for checkin with no waiting on lines. We asked for Coconut with Rum and within minutes we were drinking from a coconut. Wow - Service was awesome. Our room was amazing with a jacuzzi that was part of the room and we had our own private hammock outside with a pool to pretty much jump into from the room. The beds had a sheer canapies on the post drapped across the bed. Bar was fully stocked with anything you want to drink.The hotel grounds are incredibly clean and well kept. We loved the Flamingos and birds close to the SPA. The gym was well equipped with all types of equipment. The pool areas are always not crowded and everyone can have their own space and the water is amazingly blue and always clean. The cabanas around the pool are to die for and we just relaxed for hours on them and their is always one available with no need to save space for later. The Spa is out of this world and we even had massages on the beach that was great\/ Restaurants are great especially the French one and it is awesome since no reservations are needed and we never waited more than 10 minutes for anyone of them. We loved the restaurants for dinner and enjoyed the breakfast and lunch in the buffet. Loved the champagne with caviar in the morning. The food at this resort ranged from lobster to shrimp to lamb chops to the best steaks. The food is always presented with quality and care and has an amazing taste to anything we ate. Great variety, great service and never crowded.Entertainment staff was awesome and managed to entertain us for 5 days non-stop. Our favorites staff members were Franklin and Alta Garcia. They help you to participate in the entertainment and constantly make us laugh. Amazing group of entertainers.The bar staff at the Pool\/Beach Bar - Jose, Alta Garcia (bar waitress), Darling and Pedro who s at the bar are so attentive and they are so friendly and make awesome drinks with international premium liquors not just DR brands (Hennesyy, Johnny Walker, Absolut). We loved the fresh coconut drinks with rum inside. Try that - if you are a drinker - you will love them. The staff makes it easy to want to relax and drink - Awesome staffOverall I would say this is probably the best hotel we have ever stayed in. The Excellence hotel is magnificent and we have never experienced such incredible service, quality in food, and staff. Boy, they mean it, when they called this resort Excellence.....can't wait to return. We think we have found the perfect place to go back to each year especially when we are not traveling with the children since this is the utimate couples\/adults resort out there.
