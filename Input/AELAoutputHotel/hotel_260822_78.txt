{"text":"Wonderful location We just returned from a wonderful trip to Florence and couldn't have wished for a better hotel.Hotel Perseo is in a wonderful location around the corner from the Duomo, within 10 minutes walk of anything you might want to visit and is surrounded by lots of cafes and restaurants.We had read the trip advisor reviews about the hotel being hard to locate, so we knew what to look out for and found it easily.All the hotel staff were friendly and extremely helpful. Louise, Giacinto, Badr and Laura recommended restaurants, gave directions and made museum reservations. They also gave my husband and I a complimentary bottle of Champagne to celebrate our wedding anniversary.We had booked 2 rooms and had requested they be close together, for my husband and I and our two college age kids. The hotel gave us rooms next to one another on the 4th floor at the back of the hotel. We overlooked to rooftops of Florence and the rooms were very quiet.The hotel has been extensively renovated and the rooms and bathrooms are clean and bright. Bathrooms and showers were not huge but were more than adequate. Flat screen tvs in all rooms and free internet.Breakfast was included as was the afternoon Happy Drink which included snacks and a glass of wine. In addition, the bar is open 24 hours for coffee, sodas or a variety of different wines and other spirits. We will recommend this hotel to anyone we know who is planning to visit Florence and we would not stay anywhere else in Florence..
