{"text":"Excellent vacation I do not understand how people can complain about the Westin Rio Mar. Your vacation is what you make of it. The staff at the Westin are very pleasant. We had no problems at check-in, no problems with the bill for our stay, no problems finding beach or pool chairs, and no problems with bed bugs or bugs on the beach. We had a beautiful view of the ocean from our room. I walked for miles every day on the beautiful, secluded beach at the hotel. My two sons, ages 11 and 15, loved the hotel. They made friends at the pool at night and are still telling their friends at home what a good time they had. We rented a car at the airport. It is incredibly easy to find your way around PR. The drivers are somewhat reckless but we managed. We went to a number of different restaurants in Fajardo and Old San Juan and had wonderful food. You don't need a trip or tour of the rain forest. Just put on your hiking shoes and take the trail to the waterfall (La Mina). It's beautiful and an easy hike. The East Wind snorkeling trip was great. My son said it was the highlight of his trip. You really need to go see the clear, blue water before you leave. I didn't even think about booking the snorkeling trip through the hotel. There is no need to do so. The hotel has a book about PR in the room with all the phone numbers you need to book any trip\/excursion you want. Everyone in PR is very friendly and making last minute reservations doesn't seem to be a problem. We'll definitely will go back to the Westin Rio Mar. ","annotations":[]}
