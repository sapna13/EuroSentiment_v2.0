{"text":"Westin Sydney falls short and hits average My husband and I stayed at The Westin Sydney for 5 days during Christmas week 2007. Our experience teetered between average and above average during our entire stay. Unfortunately, the high cost of the (higher than usual, due to holiday season) nightly rate was not properly supplemented by the usual Westin experience. We have stayed at many Westins over the years, and this one fell short of expectations. After all, if you are paying for some pampering, you should at least get a little.The positives: Our room was located on the SPG Executive floor, just a couple doors down from the Westin Executive Club. Breakfast is served daily in the Club. Pleasant, though the selections were average and do not change. Free wifi is also available in the Club. The room and bath were spotless and spacious, very contemporary, with a few notable touches. The giant heavenly bed is a favorite of ours.Two train stations are nearby, 5 minutes or less by foot, with a line to the airport.Good location: walking distance to Darling Harbour, Circular Quay, and plenty of CBD shopping.The negatives:Service in the Club was surprisingly below par. And all they had to do was bring our drinks. Only two people provided adequate service. The others, too busy chatting with each other.Views to the harbour are obstructed by tall buildings. We didn't chose the Westin for the view; but if one was interested in unobstructed harbour view, ask for the very top floors or choose another hotel.The concierge staff didn't know much about the area. We spoke to 3 different concierges about restaurants and sites nearby and they gave us wrong information, wrong directions, wrong times, etc... This was highly disappointing because we were not up for wild goose chases in a strange city. They were also not personable and acted as if they were being disturbed, even though each was just standing at their desk on the 3 occasions we came by to ask questions. God forbid we ask them to book us reservations and do their job.If your room is in the newer tower, it is a LONG trek to the pool and gym which is located in the older, historical tower.The restaurant onsite is expensive and forgettable. I can't even remember it's name. The food was served in very small portions and barely average in taste. Better to walk to Darling Harbour.Front desk service was average, not quite welcoming but not quite cold. There was one friendly and helpful fellow though. We're hoping that this experience is an isolated incident. If we had to fly to Sydney again, we would probably give this place a second chance. Hopefully, their service will have improved by then.
