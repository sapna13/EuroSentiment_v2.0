{"text":"A pleasant surpirse A week before I was due to travel to the Ronda Hotel for a three day stay I decided to read a few reviews of the hotel and was horrified to see how bad some of them were. In fact, I even tried to cancel the booking and look for alternative accommodation - how glad am I that I didn't! The hotel is in an ideal location for exploring the city. The Aerobus from the airport stops in the Placa de Catalonia and the hotel is about a 10 minute walk away. All of the streets around the hotel lead to La Ramblas and offer a good range of bars and cafes for you to choose from for meals, drinks and tapas. The rooms in the hotel were clean and well furnished and each room has it's own hiardryer, tv and safe as well as comfy beds and a clean well presented bathroom. Granted the view from the room wasn't picturesque but on a city break how many people choose to spend a great deal of time in their room - there is far too much to see in the city for that! The breakfast served in the hotel was great with a good choice of items. The bar area is nicely decorated and drinks were reasonable. As for the supposed prostitutes that other people say hang around in the nearby areas, I didn't see any! I don't normally write things like this but I felt that I should to put the record straight - we would definitely visit Barcelona again and would have no hesitation in staying in the Ronda. It's a great base for a short break and I recommend that anybody who has read other reviews and is worried should visit the place and see for themselves!!
