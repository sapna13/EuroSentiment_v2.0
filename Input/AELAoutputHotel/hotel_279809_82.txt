{"text":"Trapped in Paradise The beach and the hotel lobby was beautiful however, the room left a lot to be desired. My husband and I received a gift to go for our honeymoon. We were excited to be alone in what was described as paradise little did we know we would have been better off staying at home. The hotel was briefed ahead of time that we would be spending our honeymoon with them. Our room was decorated with love birds made of towels and we received a small bottle of room. The bedding situation consisted of two twin size beds that we tried to put together but, one was higher than the other, some way to consummate a marriage? We ended up sleeping in separate beds for the week. My husband and I decided we would spend time in the Jacuzzi tub but, it didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ work. The water pressure was horrible and the jets did not work. We received only two thread bare towels per day with no wash clothes unfortunate for us that we bath at least two times per day.At meal times it was torture, the food was not cooked fully, not hot, and not appetizing it was a chore to find something decent to eat. Items that were served for dinner the night before reappeared for lunch with a sauce on it. The food smelled spoiled most of the time. To think we had to pay a mandatory $76 per day per person for that slop. At the hotel there are two restaurants available by reservation, we decided to reserve a table in the seafood restaurant; the menu was very limited and only contain one fish dish (the other dishes were chicken or beef). If you wanted lobster or shrimp you had to pay an additional $27.00. If you are a drinker you will feel like you died and went to heaven; one can drink the day away with many choices and the $76.00 will feel like a bargain. For us it was a week in hell.The hotel staff that peddled excursions harassed you in the hotel, on the grounds and on the beach constantly. Once they realized that we were from America the price tripled for an average three hour excursion. To avoid the harassment I stayed in my room except to go to the slop house to eat.On our last day there we were up and ready by 7:00am waiting for our time to leave we could not wait to get home.Take our advice, stay at home, save your money if this is where you plan to vacation.
