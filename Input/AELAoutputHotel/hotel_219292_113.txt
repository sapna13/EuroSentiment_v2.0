{"text":"Felt like home at the Wyland Just returned from a week in Honolulu and a stay at the four month old Wyland. The staff at the desk, in maintenance and cleaning were terrific and friendly - not forgetting the valets at the parking area!We were booked at a different moderate priced hotel but after checking their reviews before we left ,changed to the Wyland a few days before arriving. Our main concern was cleanliness as we had no intention of staying in a place where you couldn't take your shoes off!We were upgraded upon our arrival to an ocean view room on the 17th floor. The room was beautiful and we got a city view as well as mountains and the sea as we were on the corner. The balcony was large and like everything about the room, clean and new. The bed was the most comfortable I have been in at a hotel but the room was a little noisy as trash trucks and street sweepers came by every morning at 6am!The shower did plug and is really small - luckily we are both under 6ft tall but I am not sure how this would work for anyone of large stature - I could barely stand under the shower head. There is a problem with the drainage in the shower. The bathroom sink has lovely faucets but again are too big for the size of the sink so water splashed a lot! But the cleaning staff didn't seem to mind and our room was cleaned every day before noon.There is no extraction fan in the windowless bathroom which may cause problems in the future but for now it is fine. Just another design problem. Beautiful granite bathroom and kitchenette though!The breakfast is fine for what we paid and if you don't want a pastry there were croissants and bagels which they toasted. The coffee was great! And besides there is an IHOP right across the street! Some days we used two coupons each and went to the IHOP the next day!The pool was wonderful and a great place to sit near with breakfast or a glass of wine in the evenings. Not too cold to swim in either but then again who needs a pool in Waikiki??Overall, I would come back as long as the hotel continues to be well maintained. It is a good walk to the beach but close to the new restaurant and shopping area at the Beach Walk. I wouldn't bring kids here as rooms are too small and it's not a fun place for small ones - but that's allright, sometimes it's ok to be an adult !
