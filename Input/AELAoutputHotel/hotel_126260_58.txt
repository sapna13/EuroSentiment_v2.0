{"text":"Very swish! My partner and I stayed in New York for 4 nights en route to see his brother and wife in Austin Texas. We wanted to stay somewhere central and to have a bit of luxury and found a good rate online for the Palace. We weren't disappointed. For a first visit to New York, the Palace is in a good central location: close to Central Park, shopping on Fifth Avenue etc. However in hindsight we would probably have preferred staying in Greenwich Village or East Village - still central, but away from the noise (you can still hear those taxis loud and clear even 34 floors up!) and the hustle and bustle of Midtown. The Palace is an extrememly fancy hotel which deserves its 5 stars. The courtyard and lobby are very glamourous and the front desk staff very helpful. Our room was a corner standard room which was extremely large and had fantastic views out of St Patrick's Cathedral and double aspect windows which made it really light. The decor was classic and smart - not chic and trendy like a boutique hotel but very sophisticated. The room was really well equipped with a very cute little clock radio\/MP3 player which had soothing music built in. The bed was very comfortable and huge! The bathroom was a little disappointing as it was a bit dated, but still very clean and well cared foor. The room was also impecably clean and the housekeeping was very thorough. They even left really sweet little touches like chocolates on the pillow with their free turn down service. All in all we were impressed by the quality and service of the hotel and would recommend it. I would however recommend taking earplugs if you are a light sleeper as you can here the traffic of New York's streets even 34 floors up and it is a constant presence all through the night!
