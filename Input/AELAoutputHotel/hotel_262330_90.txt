{"text":"Nice hotel but do not stay here whilst WTC construction is still in process I searched many a website to find the perfect hotel for our 5 night stay in New York and I eventually settled on the Millenium Hilton. The photos on the website looked very nice and the value for money was good given our 5 night stay included New Years Eve. I had no doubts really that the hotel would be fine given the Hilton name.The hotel itself is very nice, clean and with stylish decor and first impressions are very good.Ours problems however started at check in. I had pre-booked a king room with a city view only to be told there were none currently available, so we had 2 choices, wait for a room to become available later in the afternoon (it was 4pm when we tried to check in) or take a lower room. We decided to wait for our room with a view that we wanted.We were pretty tired after the very long journey but sat patiently in the hotel bar for our room. After an hour we went back to the desk and were allocated our room on the 48th floor. The room was very nice with a view right over what was the WTC and the Statue of Liberty in the distance. I was perfectly aware that there was construction works going on prior to booking the hotel but presumed the works would stop in the evening and continue in the morning and as I am someone who sleeps well I did not think it would pose a problem √à√\u2020\u2022?how wrong could I be? I decided to have a quick kip before heading out for something to eat on the 1st evening, I laid on the bed for 2 hours between 5 and 7 and didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ sleep a wink due to the very loud construction noises. On our way out for something to eat we asked at reception what time the works would stop, we were told maybe 11pm sometimes earlier sometimes later (not very helpful) we asked for some ear plugs which they appeared to have plenty of.The long and short of it is that the construction went on ALL night and we did not sleep a wink, even with the ear plugs and a pillow on my head. We phoned down to reception in the morning and asked to be moved to a quieter room or alternatively to relocate us to another hotel and we had no intention of staying where we were and having 5 sleepless nights.We took our luggage down to reception and went out for the day. We were told we would be allocated another room. We returned to the hotel at 8pm to find we had not yet been allocated a room, after about √à√¥√ú an hour they found us a new room. It had twin beds and no city view but the room was quiet and we were too tired to argue the difference and the receptionists did not seem too bothered anyway. I intend to take this further with Hilton now we have returned home.On the positive side as before the actual hotel is very nice. Ideally located for down town Manhattan with subways on the doorstep costing $2 for a single journey anywhere in Manhattan. New York is a fantastic place, everything you think it will be and a place you have to visit at least once. The shopping is amazing and very cheap in comparison to the UK, there are many bargains to be had. The food is also fantastic, we ate in Fish in Greenwich Village and had whole lobster for √ä√£¬¢15.New York at this time of year was very very busy, I would definitely return again although probably at a quieter time of year. If you go when its busy expect to queue for everything.With regards to the hotel I would definitely not stay here again until after the construction has finished and would not recommend to anyone to stay there at the moment.
