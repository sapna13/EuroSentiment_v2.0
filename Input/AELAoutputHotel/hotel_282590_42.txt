{"text":"Amazing hotel I shared a junior suite with 2 friends on the 6th floor facing out onto Oranienburger Strasse. Amazing view through the enormous slanted windows. A spectacular room. I would have to say this was the best hotel room I have ever stayed in. The room featured a breakfast table and also a lounge area, flat screen tv, dvd player and a choice of cds. The double bed had individual duvets and was quite large so it felt like separate beds. The person on the sofa bed was also very satisfied. Loads of space within the room and plenty of cupboard space too. The kitchen has a kettle, fridge and hob. Impeccably clean. Bathroom very satisfactory. In the junior suite the bathroom was separate to the room, as opposed to a queen room where the bath\/shower (although screened) was open plan.I viewed a queen room which was very impressive too. Initially we chose not to have breakfast in the hotel as it seemed pricey. However, after 2 successive mornings of wandering around the locality in search of a menu to satisfy everyone's needs I would recommend the hotel buffet breakfast. It was superb. I am a vegetarian and generally suffer when it comes to European buffets, but there was plenty of choice beyond the typical meat options. The cereals  muesli accompanied by a variety of seeds and yogurt were divine. Plenty of fresh breads, pastries and good coffee make it worthwhile. If you book the breakfast the night before you can avail of the reduced rate at 12 euro.The staff at Arcotel Velvet were very friendly and helpful. This hotel is in a great location if you want to stay in Mitte and are interested in a more bohemian area. Numerous buses, trams and the underground are available outside the door of the hotel so the shopping districts and sites are within easy reach. I would recommend the Welcome card for short stays. A 48 hour or 72 hour travel card are available which also act as a discount card for some museums and sites.
