{"text":"There are great things about this place and not so great things I have mixed feelings about this hotel. I was traveling for business as a single woman, but with a group of people from work and a family member. My company paid for everything during my stay. The room was large, clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. I was not overwhelmed by the spa or salon and they don't have their act together coordinating services between them. The massage I had was just okay, nothing to sing about. The food provided for the convention was usually dry and not exciting, but that may have more to do with the choices made by the organizers than the hotel. I could not get my room cold no matter how low I turned the thermostat. It sat on 62 the entire time and I still was too hot to blow dry my hair. As some reveiws have stated, the hallways are hot and muggy. On some days some hallways were and on other days none of them were. The FedEx office had no a\/c on my last day there and it was unbearable in there. I highly recommend using their Sony Picture Developer as I developed my digital photos and the Sony machine really does a fantastic job. The service at the hotel is outstanding, I was always satisfied with how they handled problems (several small things like the made threw out my newspaper before I had read it and I need a box to ship things home). The hotel did not coordinate my car to the airport, but I was still able to get one. They say to reserve it 24 hours in advance but also re-confirm it a couple of hours before (says my driver). I never did go outside, too oppressively hot. I have to agree with the restaurant recommendations, thumbs up to Blue Sage (my #1 choice) and Roys and thumbs down to the steakhouse. I never had the time to try the Italian place as it is closed 2 nights a week. ","annotations":[]}
