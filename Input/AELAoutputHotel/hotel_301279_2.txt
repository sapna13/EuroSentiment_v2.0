{"text":"Loved the 'Top of the Tower' Breakfast I have stayed at New Otani twice in 2008. On both occasions, it was for 3-4 days.The hotel is huge, and has a complex layout. On my first visit, I actually got lost and had to ask my way around. However, the staff is really efficient and helpful. They all speak English, so it wasn't a problem to find my way.The entire complex houses not only the hotel but also several offices, a shopping complex (apart from the one in the main lobby area) and a few other things.The hotel is located centrally in Tokyo, and a short way from most places that one might want to visit. It is a convenient 3-5 minute walk from the nearest Metro station (Akasaka-Mitsuke, if I am not mistaken). Ask the concierge for a map of the locality and they'll be able to give you an English map with everything around the hotel marked neatly on it. Once you have that map, exploring the area is quite easy.As the title of this review says, the Top of the Tower breakfast is a great experience. Not only in the menu very good, but the view of Tokyo is excellent too. The size of the breakfast area is an issue sometimes because there can be too many guests turning up at the same time. Try to go very early or very late to avoid the queue.On the downside, the rooms are a bit on the smaller side. That seems to be the case with most hotels in Tokyo though. ","annotations":[]}
