{"text":"Spectacular Hotel with Unbeatable Service From the outside the Mandarin Oriental looks rather unimaginative, but as soon as you step inside you are transported to hotel nirvana. The lobby is spectacular, albeit somewhat dark, with striking artwork and a large reception area that easily accommodates large numbers of guests arriving simultaneously. We were greeted by lovely reception staff, and were upgraded to a suite and provided with late checkout til 6pm. Upon booking we had mentioned that we were traveling for our anniversary, so the hotel saw fit to put us up in a fantastic room. In less than ten minutes we were riding one of the panoramic lifts in the atrium up to our room.Although we have often stayed in hotel suites, this particular one was no mere hotel room, but rather a full apartment in itself, with a separate dining area, kitchen, living room, and bedroom. The decor throughout was impeccable, and the service continued to raise the bar. Perfectly timed with our arrival, our bags came split seconds later, followed by a complimentary fruit and tea tray. The bed was one of the most comfortable ones I have ever had the pleasure to sleep in, with a choice of pillows that satisfied even a fussy sleeper like myself.I feel that one of the hallmarks of truly great hotels is invisible service, and staff that can truly anticipate your needs. Housekeeping managed to slip in and out of our suite unnoticed, and the turn down service was perfectly timed to coincide with our dinner outings. The concierge was extremely helpful, and was able to provide suggestions that covered everything from entertainment to dining and shopping. The service throughout was simply outstanding - genuinely hospitable, knowledgeable, and efficient. The hotel is located a little bit on the periphery of the more happening spots, but taxis are fairly cheap, and are a widely used means of transportation. The MRT is also extremely efficient, but you will have to walk a bit to the nearest station, and Singapore is not very pedestrian friendly in all areas. As a result, we ended up hopping in a taxi every time we stepped out of the hotel.I would absolutely recommend this hotel to people who want to experience hotels as they should be - supremely comfortable, with friendly and efficient staff, immaculate service, and beautiful interiors.
