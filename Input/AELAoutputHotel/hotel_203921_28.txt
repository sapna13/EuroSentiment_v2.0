{"text":"Great Small Hotel...away from the crowds !!! We just returned from a 4 night stay at the David; Mon. 10\/6, then Thurs., Fri., Sat., 10\/9-10\/11.Our daughter, who is studying in Florence and staying with a host family in the Gravinana district of Florence, rode past this charming hotel on her way to\/from school on the Piazza Savonarola.The location is central, but away from the crowds, which we accessed via a lovely drive on the Viale Michelangelo from the AutoEurope office downtown.I was coming down with a bug the first night and the wonderful young man at the desk gave me great advice on how to get to an eye clinic not far from the hotel. Our first room was on the main floor, (only one night), and we liked our second room much better, #20; ample, with plenty of storage, large bathroom and good shower, but also, great working air conditioning, as the weather was nice and warm during our stay in October.We were drawn to this hotel because of the TriAdvisor reviews, and also because we knew we would need parking, which the David not only offered, but made it extremely convenient to use; i.e., if you came in late and could not help but block another car, you simply left them your key and they would jockey the cars around. They closed their property gate at night, as the couple of eateries on the corner were popular for night life.The David is charming, safe, clean, ample, with a simple but satisfying breakfast, (we did not take advantage of the happy hour), and great staff, (I am sorry that I am unable to remember the names of the 2 lovely young ladies, two extremely helpful young men, and a delightful signora who let us in and out around midnight so we could drive our daughter to her homestay); they could not have been more accommodating. For my taste, I prefer to be outside of the tourist activity, yet close enough to walk or take public transportation to main attractions, and the David offered all that.I will not hesitate to refer the David to anyone traveling to Florence...thank you for a lovely stay !!!
