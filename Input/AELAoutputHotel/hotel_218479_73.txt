{"text":"Service needs work I gave this resort a 3 because the location, beach and facilities were very good but the service was very poor. Maybe we were spoiled by Mexico but we certainly noticed a different attitude for service here. We still had a good time and would go to the Dominican again, but not to this hotel.There are 5 hotels in this complex. The Caribe, Beach, Golf, Casino, and Palace. Out package gave us full access to all except the Palace. A train-like shuttle runs continuously between all the complexes.The beach is huge and beautiful. There is plenty of room and always chairs available. During January and February the trade winds always blow so there is a stiff breeze to help keep you from overheating. Good snorkeling is available right along the beach. The pool is more crowded but still not bad. We had one or two brief tropical showers every day. Not really bad enough to seek shelter, especially if you are already wearing a bathing suit.Rooms are typical of all inclusive resorts and since I don't spend a lot of time there, all I care is that they are clean, and they were.If you want good service here, tipping is essential. Rooms are often not cleaned until after 5:00 PM. It took three days to get a light bulb installed in our bathroom toilet.I know we were in Spanish speaking country and we used our limited Spanish as much as possible, but very few of the staff speak anything but Spanish. This includes waiters, front desk, and guest services people. It seems to me when you are having 300 Canadians showing up every week, that somone should be able to speak English or French as well. This limited participation in the evening shows and poolside activities.The food in the buffet restaurants was very good with a large selection. The seafood was particularily good and well prepared. Reading the item descriptions provided a good chuckle every day. (Soap of Beast translates as Beef Soup, Chichen Sald was chicken salad). If you want water, coffee or juice, get your own because no one will stop at your table.The A La Carte restaurants were not as good. No reservations were required so long lineups (45 minutes) are normal, and the food was usually not worth the wait. Drinks are limited to about 10 tropical drinks (which are often prepared without alchohol unless you specifically ask for it) and a half dozen standards. Anything else they don't have, or if they do it costs extra. DO NOT drink the house red wine. It is grape juice with rum added.Evening shows run from an incredible band with singers and dancers, to the usual men vs women fun nights. Unfortunately because they are all exclusively in Spanish it's really hard to particpate and enjoy fully.I have stayed in everything from 5 star hotels in Amsterdam to a dive in Ukraine where the chalk outline of the last guest was still on the floor. I tend to go with the flow and can adapt to most environments. But when you pay a considerable sum for all inclusive resorts you expect a certain level of service. That service was not provided here. Beyond the language barrier, the staff just seemed confused. It often took 4 people and 15 minutes to bus a table when 30 people were standing in line waiting for a table. This kind of thing detracts from the enjoyment of your stay. We had friends staying at two of the other hotels in this complex and they reported the same conditions.
