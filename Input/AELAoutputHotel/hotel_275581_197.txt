{"text":"Great hotel, particularly if you can get a good deal I stayed two nights in the City Inn while in London for business, and thought it was a great hotel, and a lovely stay from start to finish.The whole hotel just looks great. The reception area is very stylish, with staff keen to help call you a taxi or take care of your luggage. Everything was clean, maintained and new looking. The room was attractive, and very well equipped. Good closet space and desk, and extremely fast internet connection for my laptop. The room overlooked office buildings, so you needed the net curtains shut - but this is London, and views are few and far between. And the bathroom only had a shower, whereas I like a bath when travelling to unwind the muscles. But these were minor quibbles.I didn't try breakfast, as it wasn't included in my rate, but the in room tea and coffee facilities were great, and you got lovely tasting biscuits each day, which were breakfast enough.I tried the gym one morning- as it was laid out in a room, it took me a minute to find all the machines, and I had a minor panic that there were no treadmills. But it was actually very well equipped with high quality machines.Location wise, it was handy for where I needed to be, and easy enough to get into the centre. There's a bus stop out the back of the hotel, which will get you to Trafalgar Square in the time it takes to walk to Pimilico underground.Book ahead to get a good rate. I left it a little too late, and had to pay 40% more for one night than the other.
