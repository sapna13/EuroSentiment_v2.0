{"text":"Other reviews were right... Summary:Good vacation, great weather, great entertainment, swimming, tanning, excursions. Bad service in hotel, bad food, local people are lame and lazy.We were staying this hotel December 17 to 24, 2007Bad things:1. Check-inSpent 3 hours to get the room. The staff at the front desk wasso busy and trying to help everybody all together so it was messy.First room I got - keys didn't work (and it was the most far building from all facilities and ground floor even the hotel guy told us that it is 2nd floor and near the beach).So went back to front desk, found another person, gave him $10 and ask for another room. He gave a better room, 2nd floor and close to amenities like pools and restaurants.2. FoodThere are total 7 restaurants in this hotel. But the food wascrapy. Even I can describe myself as a guy who √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√úats almost everything, the food was bad. Badly cooked, badly served...(at least I didn't get extra kilos)3. Bugs in the bed.Everybody I see in the hotel had bites on their feet. Thisbugs a really small so you can't see them. I hope that didn'tbring it back homeIf you want to improve service you have to tip - otherwise it doesn't work at all.Good things.In general, hotel is OK. You can walk on the beach line and look at the others. I walk about 10 kilometers to both directions and found that most of the hotels are pretty same.Even hotels that have sign like premium 5 stars don√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ look fancy.The weather was excellent! No rain at all during 7 days.The sun is great for tanning, the climate is soft even moist.Excursions! Take them and you will not be disappointed. We took only two, but they were amazing (ATV riding and swimming with sharks).
