{"text":"The expected luxury at the expected cost We booked the 4 Season for the SF part of our 3 week California + Southwest vacation after reading the favorable reviews on Tripadvisor and noting that the hotel had a complimentary 4th night deal (offered on their site). The price is rather high (around $395 with tax per night), but in comparison with the highish prices of other SF hotels, it seemed like a good deal to us, and after staying one night at the Maxwell for $295, we confirmed that we had made the right decision. To start with the few cons, we thought pay internet was a little absurd considering the high price. And the style of the lobby was a little stodgy. The bathroom was also rather small. The lobby\/front desk\/parking maze can be a bit confusing. It took us a couple days to go smoothly from our car to our room. But, these are all pretty small points. The experience on a whole was very satisfying. The staff was extremely kind and gave us a room on the highest floor possible at our request (it was even larger than normal because it was designed to be wheelchair accessible). The bed was one of those cloud types..very very luxurious. Breakfast is complimentary, and guests are given a menu with numerous breakfast items to choose from (the only luxury hotel we stayed in which offered this - a definite plus). The slippers are super-soft and the bathroom amenities are L'Occitane, which is a new favorite of mine. In-room dining food is good to excellent. The location is right near Union Square, which is convenient for taking the old-fashioned trolley car to the Piers, as well as to shopping and world-class restaurants. There is a large gym and spa, with free fitness classes for guests. Cost issues. Valet parking is about $45 per night and a quick long distance call came to about $15.All in all, an excellent choice. We would definitely stay there again if we could take advantage of a comped 4th night, or similar offer. ","annotations":[]}
