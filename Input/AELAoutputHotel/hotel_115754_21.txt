{"text":"Not bad if you're with kids We stayed here for 3 nights and overall had a good, but not great, experience. The first day we were there, we left the privacy sign on the hotel room door to allow the kids to sleep in for a bit. Left the room at 11am, and removed the sign. The room was not cleaned that day. The breakfast was excellent although the line up for the buffet and waffles sometimes reached the back of the room. On 2 of the 3 mornings, I left the kids upstairs and stood in the line up and brought the breakfast back to the room since there was no seating in the restaurant. The room itself (on the 4th floor) was spacious, and facing the highway. We had no problem sleeping and didn't find it noisy. We appreciated the microwave and fridge in the room. Also, even though it wasn't a true suite (seperate rooms), it had 2 TVs which was appreciated!!. The pool is small, but ideal with kids as the deepest it gets is 4'6. The staff were friendly and courteous, allowing us to add an extra night for the same rate we'd already booked in at. We walked to the monorail with 2 children under 8 in about 10mins and cabbed it to Pike Place the next day ($8 including tip). Great location close to amenities for the price. I would stay there again for a vacation with the kids. Wouldn't choose it for a romantic weekend though.
