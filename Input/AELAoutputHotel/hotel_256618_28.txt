{"text":"Great Business Hotel Stayed two nights in a Deluxe King on a business trip. Excellent door service and concierge. Hotel reception managed to juggle bookings to get me in for an extra night. Unfortunately I had to leave and spend my last night in Four Seasons as Sydney was almost fully booked.Great room - lots of space. Good data connections, nice desk and comfortable seat to work from. Comfy bed, pillows and linens. Turn down service excellent. Fantastic location in the Rocks on edge of Circular Quay - great views of Opera House and Harbour Bridge (unfortunately I got the cheaper corporate room facing one of the bridge pillars). Good windows which block road noise from Harbour Bridge.However, I was glad I wasn't paying - cold buffet breakfast (ok) was AUD40 p\/p. 500ml bottle of water in room AUD12, 3 minute phone call interstate AUD22. Minor niggles include slow service at breakfast which is a pain when on business and in a rush. Also - all mirrors were really dusty, ditto top shelves in walk in robe where pllows kept.If you have to stay in Sydney on business and you're not paying - book to stay at the Park Hyatt. It makes working away fom home easyGood tip for a cool restaurant is Sailors Thai restarant (upstairs) - perfect Thai food at long refectory tables - great way to meet interesting people and affordable, despite top location in the Rocks. PS - try a Gelati from the stand on Circular Quay - perfect way to end the evening overlooking the Opera House!
