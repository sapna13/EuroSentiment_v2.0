{"text":"Loved Hotel 41 This was my first trip to New York and i wanted a nice hotel. Somewhere clean, safe, great location and not to basic, as it was a romantic getaway. I booked a superior room (can't judge as i haven't seen the standard rooms, other than the photo's provided by other travellers) but this was definately worth the extra money we paid, something like √ä√£¬¢70 extra on the total bill. The room was clean, more than big enough and the bathroom had a nice shower. Our room was directly above the lobby looking out onto Times Square. (room 1, second floor) Never thought in a million years we would get a view in Times Square (i filled out the notes section on the booking form asking for a view) Just shows if you don't ask, you don't get!!! All the staff were really friendly and helpful and the free breakfast was really good. Selection of pastries, juice  coffee. Can't fault the cleanliness, no funny smells and strangely we heard no real noise, even though we were above the bar and facing the street. The hotel itself is just on a small sidestreet of Times Square, this worked out perfectly. You can see all the crazy action from the the hotel doors but the throngs of people don't come down by the hotel itself. I was nervous about what i would find when i got to this hotel but i wasn't disappointed. It seems like crazy money compared to what you could get at home for the same cost but that's the reality with New York, you pay alot for something basic. I wouldn't bother paying more at a fancy hotel, as you are never in your room for more than showers  sleep. I will definately be going back to Hotel 41 (Superior Room) I hope you enjoy it as much as we did.
