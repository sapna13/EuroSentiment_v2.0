{"text":"Perfect for honeymoon We stayed at the Elysees Regencia for 5 nights on our honeymoon and it was amazing. It was our first time in Paris and the location was perfect, 10 mins from the Eiffel tower and Sienne and 5 mins from the Arc d'triomphe and Champs Elysees. We had a lime green delux double room for our stay on the third floor at the end of the corridor, the room was very big and the bed was massive with seperate en suite lavatory and bathroom. Two huge windows overlooking avenue marceau with flowers. As I have lots of clothes (!) the hotel was more than happy to provide an extra clothes rail and hangers free of charge for our stay. The bed was turned down every night and fresh bed linen, l'occitaine toiletries and chocolates everyday. There was an LCD TV with BBC, CNN, and sky news. We spent a good bit of time in our room and the staff were unobtrusive and the room service prices were reasonable for central Paris. Some reviews have said it was noisey but we were never disturbed. The reception staff all spoke good English and were helpfull. We used the computer in the lobby serveral times to check out attractions in Paris (which is free of charge).On our first morning we ordered breakfast in bed and were given champagne and smoked salmon free of charge for our honeymoon. On our last night there was a hand-written note from the manager thanking us for our custom with a l'occitaine gift - superb. It would have been nice to have breakfast included in the price, but there are a number of bars, and pattiseries in the local area. We used the little market shop (le marche de champs elysees) towards the arc d'triomphe which sold beers, soft drinks and crisps etc and was very reasonable. Also check out the 'public drugstore' at the top of the street - a cool mix of bookshop, quirky gift store, pharmacy, off licence, pattiserie and bar with a restaurant attached (l'terrace - with views of arc d'triomphe on the champs elysees) that was a little expensive as you would expect but amazing food and great service.All in all a great time away, I felt really spoilt!- I will be recommending this hotel to all my friends. Perfect for honeymooners. N.B: If you are travelling to this hotel - use the les cars air france bus it goes from aerogare 2 and it drops you off by the arc d'triomphe and its about a 5 min walk to the hotel - only √à√\u2020√ü?3 one way - a really good service.
