{"text":"Not too bad.... when will internet be free?! In a sea of hotels invading Waikiki, the Prince Kuhio is about mid-range in both price and quality. The staff was very friendly and very accommodating, however I still get peeved when they charge for internet in the rooms. Speaking of the rooms, mine was very clean, had two beds, a mini fridge (nice if you are sick of paying Waikiki prices for meals), and a spacious bathroom. Hilton has wonderful beds, and this place was no exception. I never had any problems sleeping (except when rowdy frat boys were screaming outside, but the hotel can do nothing about that!)If you are a hoi polloi member of the Hilton Honors, it gets a bit better. Every morning you get a free breakfast (bagels, fruit, cereal) and in the evening there is a pu pu selection from 5-7. In a sea of overpriced food you take the free stuff where you can get it.The valet (there is no self parking) is a scary $25 a day... a hefty price but on par with most of the other hotels in the area. Some hotels offer a discounted rate if you self park, so be sure to check it out.The restaurant (MAC 24x7) has some tasty food at reasonable prices. They have all you can eat spaghetti in the beginning of the week (I think Monday?) for $15, which is good if you are doing some serious hiking the next day. And to be sure, THEIR PANCAKES ARE HUGE!
