{"text":"Nice property that is on its way up. We stayed at this property from March 22-March 25, 2007. The property is stil under renovations. We were giving the best available room at the Internet rate and thus spent the first night in the Lagoon Wing. The decor was really nice in the room - yellows, blues and greens. From the balcony, you could see the water. However, the room only had a stand up shower and thus the bathroom was a little clastrophobic for me. At 10 pm on the first night, we get this note saying that the water will be turned off teh next day from 9am to 4:30 p.m. So, whatever plans we might have had to lounge around in the room late or whatever - we suddenly had to nix. The water didn't come back on at 4:30. It didn't come back on at 6:30. That means no toliet, no water, no shower after about 3 hours of that - that was enough. I couldn't believe the hotel put us over there in the first place if they knew that was going to happen. We were finally switched to the Ocean WIng - which looks exactly like the picture on the hotel Web site.The room was much bigger and nicer. The property itself was very nice. It is in a great location that is walking distance to great restaurants - ROPA VIEJA is about three blocks down and highy recommended. There are also nice restaurants on the property - complete with an ice cream parlor. Included in the resort fee is LIVE ENTERTAINMENT via the Casino Lounge every night at that was very nice as well. Kind of a cruise ship atmosphere . The pool was lovely and included a salt water pool, regular pool and jacuzzi. There are nice lounge chairs and hammocks all around.The beach was indeed on the property and a public beach, but it was still nice. All in all, we enjoyed our stay at this property. Shopping is nearby and the BUS 21 will take you to Old San Juan for $0.75.
