{"text":"Location is tops! A very nice hotel for Amsterdam! First of all, I will provide directions to the hotel from the airport. DO NOT take a taxi from the airport unless you don't mind paying through the nose. Taxi fare from the airport is 40 EUROS. Avoid taxis at all costs in Amsterdam.. The metres run like a cheetah!! Initial fare is 5 euros and it just skyrockets from there in the blink of an eye! I couldn't believe it. Become familiar with the streetcar system in the city.. it is very easy to follow and wonderfully convenient. The streetcar is your friend!!Instead of taking taxi from airport, I recommend the following to reach the Jolly Carlton Hotel:1. Take train from the airport to CENTRAL STATION2. Buy a StripKaart (I think that's what it's called) or pay cash fare of about 1.60 Euros and take the Tram # 4 or #9.3. Ask to be dropped off near the FLOWER MARKET.Hotel is about a 2 minute walk from here.Anyway, on to the hotel ... Location is amazing. You can walk to virtually every major tourist spot within 10-15 mins. Staff is friendly and the hotel is clean and well decorated. There is a nice bar on the ground floor which overlooks the street - very nice place to relax and have a beer while people watching. The bartenders and staff at the bar were very friendly. although i did not eat there, the food that neigboring tables were being served looked quite delicious. Noise from the street is tolerable. We were on the 3rd floor on weekend nights and, with the windows shut we really had no trouble sleeping. Breakfast at the hotel was unreasonably expensive at 15 Euros. All I had was cereal and some juice. Perhaps I should have eaten more if I had known I was going to be charged that amount! Even still, 15 euros is excessive for breakfast, even by London England standards. A great place to eat is just on the way to Rembrandt square called Wok to Walk. very nice, cheap, and quick food if youre on the run and don;t want to spend too much money. Very nice smokeshop that was featured in the movie OCean's 11 is locted within a 5 minute walk: DAMPKRING. You can sit at the same table that Brad Pitt and Matt Damon sat on during filming! I don't smoke, but this place came very highly recommended (no pun intended) by a local friend of mine. Apparently the quality of product, atmosphere, and crowd are the best in the city. I thought I would share this pearl of wisdom with you in case you like to indulge.
