{"text":"It is what it is My wife and I stayed at the hotel from 1\/12 to 1\/19. While the room was subpar, and beef a little odd, everything else was good to great. The hotel is 80% non-Americans, mostly Canadians, Germans, British, and French. Funny thing about that was it seemed only Americans had any stomach issues. We became friends with 5 other American couples and each of them needed to take some pepto bismo. The Italian couple, the Polish couple, the French couple and the Canadians never had any stomach problems. Maybe Americans just have weak stomachs. That being said.... the beach and the pool were excellent and the pool bartender Enrique was great! Always in a good mood and willing to try to make your drink the way you want it. The same can not be said of the bartenders at the Calypso Bar, (they spent much of their time hitting on the ladies at the resort). Team Animation were fantastic. Funny and energenic... always planning something for you to do. Beach Soccer, bocchia, Volleyball, Aerobics, dance, etc... As for the foodThe breakfast was simply delicious.... Eggs, bacon, crepes, yogurt, fresh fruit.... so much to chose from....Lunch was also good as long as you stayed away from anything with beef... if had a funny texture and spice to it. The chicken by the pool was awesome.Dinners were good, nothing special.. but definitely edible. The pool and the beach were kept very clean. For the price I paid it was well worth it. Please note it is more like a 3.5 star hotel than 4 star, and they have only draught beer. Do yourself a favor and bring a large insulated mug. They serve 10 oz plastic cups at the beach and pool area ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1097,"mention":"crepes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cr%C3%AApe"],"startOffset":1091},{"endOffset":1105,"mention":"yogurt","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Yogurt"],"startOffset":1099}]}
