{"text":"Service was amazing! Room was very nice! I traveled to Seattle to look at apartments, it was a last minute trip and I hadn't made reservations. The manager of one of the properties I went to look at referred me to this hotel. We called, made reservations, and arrived at the hotel shortly after. We checked in and the front desk clerk (Kristina K.) helped us with some restaurant suggestions. We got to chatting and I told her I was up there to look at apartments. She was the nicest, most helpful front desk clerk I have ever encountered, and I am one! She got out the classifieds and circled some places for me to look at, she got me bus line brochures and explained them to me, she got me a map of the area's attractions and showed me directions to some really neat places. Later that night I called down to ask her about a library or someplace that I could find a computer (I had left my laptop at home) and she let me come to the office and use her's! The room was excellent also, tastefully decorated in rich red and gold, nice sheets and covers, and very clean. I was traveling with my grandmother and we stayed in a non-smoking ground floor room with 2 beds. The soap and shampoo in the bathroom smell so good, like cinnamon rolls or something! The continental breakfast was amazing! There were several types of juice, milk, coffee, and plenty of choices of things to eat, including bagels, danishes, fresh-baked cinnamon rolls, yogurt, boiled eggs, and many other choices. My whole experience was very nice, and I would DEFINATELY stay there again!
