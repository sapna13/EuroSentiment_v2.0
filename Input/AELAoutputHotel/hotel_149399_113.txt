{"text":"Love It!!! June 12 - 17th. Not nearly long enough! On our day of departure, we tried to change our return tickets, but Spirit wanted over $1,000. Decided just to bite the bullet and come home.The resort was absolutley beautiful. It beat Beaches Turks  Caicos by a mile. The only other resort that comes close to it is Atlantis, and if it weren't for the fact that Atlantis has those gorgeous aquariums, the Melia Caribe would beat it, too.Forget about the Royal Service. Family of four would be looking at an additional $240.00 per day. Royal Service rooms are WAY in the back of the resort. Not close to beach, good pools or restaurants. The only plus to Royal Service would be the top shelf alcohol. As far as we were concerned, their brand of rum and vodka were almost as good as the other stuff anyway.As far as people complaining that the resort is too big and they had to walk alot.....phooey! If we missed one of their little trains, we always had someone in a little golf cart stop and pick us up. Not that they needed to, but they always offered. Some people believe that since they are visiting an all-inclusive, they should not be expected to offer a tip. Those are the ones who complain that their drinks are never filled quickly enough or that they had to walk alot. You would be amazed at what a couple of dollars gets you, especially when you are dealing with people who, on average, are making .65 cents an hour.We took the Bavaro bus tour up to the mountains. Pass on that one. Twenty people crammed a-- to elbow on a small bus with no a\/c, traveling down long bumpy roads. Mountain scenery was breathtaking, but there has to be an easier way to see it. One of the tours offers a zip-line through the mountain. That would have been awesome. We took the Catamaran to Sting Ray Bay and that was great. They take you out to snorkel first. Although the water does not compare with Turks ( or any other Caribean island), it was pretty nice and we saw alot of fish. Next stop is Sting Ray bay...really neat, and then you swim with the sharks. Very cool. Then they open the bar on the boat and dance you to death. Highly recommend that one. People told us to skip the Dolphin swim, as they are not exactly Sea World and the dolphins either die or are put down after six months or so, because they are not kept very well in the captivity provided them. Most of the restaurants are okay. Resort food. The exeption being the Hacienda. If you like Mexican food...you'll love this place. They have an entire bar full of appetizers that you help yourself to. Fresh nachos, guacamole, salsa, etc.. You barely have room to finish your entree. The Japanese is pretty good too.The casino was okay as far as size. Doesn't open till 8pm. Definitely not Vegas. Don't know whether it's the shuffling or what, but if you are a black jack player, a REAL blackjack player, it's hard to lose. Walked out with lots of cash each and every time we played.In summary, great place. LOVE IT, LOVE IT,LOVE IT!! Oh Ya, if you go, find the pool bar with Mateo working and tell him that Donna and Antonio said Hello! He's the best!
