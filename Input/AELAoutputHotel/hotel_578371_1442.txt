{"text":"not my favorite hotel Recently got back from a 7 night stay at the Majestic and felt compelled to write a review, something I've never done before. The quick summary is that this was not a hotel I would ever go back to. First, however, let me start with the positives. The grounds were very nice. The pool was very large and quite pleasant, and the beach was nice as well. The rooms were very spacious and were nice as well (except for the bathroom).  That being said, when we got to the hotel, they didn't have the type of room we had reserved. Rather than a room with a king bed, they had a room with 2 full size beds. The room issue did get fixed for the second night. But, I happened to be up at the front desk several times during the stay, and each time saw at least 3-4 people complaining about their room and being told to check back the following day to see if there was a different room available. At least some of these people that we subsequently spoke to were not able to get their room changed. The hotel was also very stingy with towels, both in the rooms and for the pool\/beach. The toilet in the room was literally set up as a tiny stall; if you're claustrophobic or if you're a large person, you'll have a problem with this. The pillows were terrible as well. Luckily, I saw a review on Tripadvisor before my trip, and had my own pillows with me, so this wasn't a real issue for me. Now for the biggest shortcoming of the hotel: the food. Let me preface this by saying that I am not someone who demands gourmet food, and I am usually not difficult to satisfy. Breakfast was average. Nice selection of fruit, different types of eggs, cereal, pancakes, french toast (actually was closer to regular toast), etc... Nothing to complain about, but also nothing to brag about. Lunch, unfortunately was the exact same options every day. Much of it was from the previous night's dinner. It wasn't so good the night before, so repeating it for lunch was not very appetizing. The dinner at the buffet was the same every night as well, and the specialty restaurants were not very good either. My wife and I got so sick of the food that we decided to go home a night early, even knowing we probably couldn't get a refund for the last night.
