{"text":"Great Location, Good rooms There is a bit of history for me and this hotel. Working for a consulting company, I used to stay there for 3-4 month. The hotel was new then and had great staff. People have not been looking for tips, but were friendly and helpful. I also used to live in Singapore for a year or so. I went back earlier this year and then for a weekend in August again. Living in Singapore before, I never got used to the Orchard Road location. I always liked Bugis. You can walk to Raffles Place, Chimes, Suntec City, Sim Lim Square, Bugis market, and the build in shopping center Bugis Junction with Cinema is lest touristy then other places. So I always felt good just staying there. Unfortunately, the rooms did not follow with all the upgrades. Although they are still nice. The staff is more generic or superficial in their dealings. Friendly, but following the process. The first trip this year, I talked to the new GM (From Korea) and he himself told me, he had the same feeling and this is one of his focus areas to create a better team spirit, which the client can feel.If you are looking for a great 5 star experiences, the Mandarin Oriental or The Fullerton are better for the rooms, etc. - although personally, I am not a big fan of the location. So I guess, for me going there its more the walk down memory lane ;-) Hope that helps.
