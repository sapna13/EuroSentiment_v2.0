{"text":"Great hotel! Just returned from a five night stay at Jury's and we have to agree with the rave reviews. Hotel is in a great location, about three blocks from the T and four blocks from the Public Garden\/Boston Common. The staff is very nice and accomodating. We had a few problems with our room, noisy A\/C unit and door that wouldn't lock (!), but both were fixed promptly. Two waters were put into our empty (which was very nice) fridge every day, a GREAT amenity. Cuffs, the downstairs bar was very fun. We had a drink outside on the patio one night and upstairs on the other nights when Cuffs was full. They warned us at check in that there could be lines to get into the bar and there was! Although it was not a problem to get into the hotel at all. The only reason we didn't give the hotel five stars was the size of the room. I believe we had a standard room and the bed area was cramped. The desk and chair were right next to the bed and there was almost no room between the two. On the other hand, the bathroom was huge. Also, if you stay on a weekend, you need to tell them that you want a paper or they won't deliver it. We were not told this and did not get a paper on Saturday and we almost missed the Red Sox game. The time was changed from 7:05 to 1:05 the night before and if we had the paper we would have known.All in all, this was a great hotel and we will stay here again and would suggest Jurys to other travelers.
