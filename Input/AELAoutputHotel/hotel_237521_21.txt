{"text":"Hotel Aprile suited us well We stayed for 2 nights with our 2 kids (97). After reading the reviews, we requested a family room at the back of the hotel, which we received. We had arrived on an overnight train very early and the hotel staff were lovely and helpful, letting us know when the room was going to be ready. Unprompted, a waiter was kind enough to bring the boys a jug of hot chocloate which they thought was fantastic.After climbing Giotto's Tower, we headed back to the hotel and relaxed in our room, which consisted of a king bed, single and a converted sofa. (I wouldn't want to sleep on it, but our 7yo was fine.) The room was quiet and overlooked the back with a lovely view. Bathroom modern and clean, beds comfy. Great to have a kettle and biscuits in the room as well as a small fridge. Air conditioning worked fine.The breakfast was a highlight for us. You can sit in the courtyard and enjoy the range of cereal, fruit, yoghurt and gorgeous tart\/flans, as well as a spread of bacon  eggs etc. They bring the pastries and coffee to your table - the coffee was fantastic. (Then again I didn't have a bad one in Italy.) I think the buffet isn't as plentiful towards the end, but we were there in time and it wasn't an issue. After sightseeing for the day, the kids would relax in the room, and we would share a pot of the Americano coffee in the courtyard, reading the papers.The reception staff spoke english and were able to offer help as needed including a super recommendation for dinner (The Marione). The location was great for us, walking distance to main sights, and close to the train station for our day trip to Pisa and then to Rome. The Santa Maria square around the corner was being worked on( a fence around it) so we never saw any undesirables around, felt quite safe.We really enjoyed our stay here, but did speak to others who thought their rooms were noisy. I thought the hotel had a nice vibe, so put in a request for a back room and enjoy.
