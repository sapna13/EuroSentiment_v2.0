{"text":"Reliable Grande Dame My latest stay was from 11\/15 to 11\/19. I travel to Singapore regularly both for work and play, this latest stay was for shopping. I have stayed about four times before both with my mom, my wife and by myself.If you come to Singapore for shopping, there is no other hotel of this level near Orchard. The Hilton and Marriott appear to be lower grade. I've stayed at the Shangri-La but it could not be compared to the Four Seasons. I've considered the Fullerton but it's too far from Orchard. If your prime destination is Ngee Ann City and all of the premier boutiques, nothing beats this hotel. Although the map indicates the hotel is not on Orchard, there is a connecting walkway which lets you out on the second floor of the shopping arcade inside the Hilton. Take the escalator down and you are at the lobby of the Hilton, which is directly on Orchard. All of the major shopping malls on Orchard are now no more than a five minute walk from you.Every time I've stayed at this hotel, I've noticed thoughtful evolutions of the room which were not existent or which I did not notice during my previous stay. One such development was the installation of international wire sockets -- not just in the bathroom for the shaver, but also next to the bed and next to desk so that you don't need converters for your notebook or cell phone.The fact that internet connection is still charged is a minor drawback.Otherwise service is top rate -- setting the standard for all Asian hotels. This time around I did not try the pool, the spa or the restaurants. I did have one dinner by room service and it was excellent -- dishes from the Chinese restaurant are highly recommended, though they are not cheap. I did have lunch at the lobby restaurant - they have a deal where you order a main dish and then provide appetizers\/dessert by buffet - fairly good.The exterior of the hotel is another minor drawback -- but who cares about a hotel's exterior -- it's what inside that counts and I just have nothing but raves for it in this case.
