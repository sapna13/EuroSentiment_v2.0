{"text":"$ecluded Relaxation But... My wife and I concluded our two week vacation in Bali with a stay at the FS Sayan. We also stayed at two other excellent properties while there, the Ritz Bali and the Royal Pita Maha (see my reviews).My wife and I had a great time at the FS Sayan but we both agreed we would not return the next time we are in Bali. We have traveled to many places staying in luxury accomodations. The FS Sayan was better than some and not as good as others. Don't get me wrong this is a great resort. We just did not feel it was really worth the premium price.The question on my mind was: Is the FS Sayan the best in the world as touted by Conde Nast? That was the yardstick I used to measure the place when we arrived. Did it live up to the hype? Unfortunately, no. Read on for my thoughts in detail.Pros:1. Beautifully decorated suites and villas. We stayed in both. Both the villas and suites were spacious. We stayed in a duplex suite and nice pool villa. Housekeeping was excellent. 2. Beautifully manicured grounds with eye pleasing architecture. Although the resort is relatively small, everything is nicely spaced out. There are less than 100 rooms I think. The spa is small but lovely.3. Tasty food and room service. Expensive by local standards. The breakfast at the Terrace was one of my favorite meals while in Bali.Cons:1. Only one tiny pool. I really like to swim while on vacation. The pool at FS Sayan is tiny and the poolside service was lackluster.2. Honestly, the service was cold and detached. Kind of bizzare after all the warm service we received all throughout Bali and stranger still in relation to FS standards. 3. Weak shuttle service. Very few shuttle times. No shuttles after 5pm. The hotel basically wants you to dine in for dinner. In contrast, the Royal Pita Maha would take you anywhere in Ubud at almost any time.4.Expensive food. I know this is to be expected at the FS. Its just that great, great food can be found all over Bali and a fraction of the price.Ultimately I would choose the Royal Pita Maha over the FS Sayan. Sure the FS is more refined, but yhey just treated us much better at the RPM and half the cost. Overall Bali was grand! Hope to return soon.
