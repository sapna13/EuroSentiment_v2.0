{"text":"Great Resort We always find it amazing that the reviews can be so different from each other.My wife and I stayed at the GP Bavaro in March of this year and liked it so much that we returned in Nov (20-27)2008.Although the weather in November was not as good as it was in March our experience at the resort was fantastic.There is no place that is absolutley perfect and you can always expect some minor things, however, we have found that tis resort is as well run as most.We travelled with AirTransat holidays and were given a few extras with their Imperial Club. Although no reservations are required for the resaurants, we were able to make reservations with the Imperail Club and therefore had no wait time at all. The resort has 5 restaurants along with the buffet which has a different theme each night. There was a wide asortment of food for most tastes and we did not have a bad meal at either of our stays. In Fact I had the best t-bone steak that I have ever eaten at the 1 restaurant.We did not go in the pool at all as the beach is so fantastic (white, powdery sand). If you want a lounge, unfortuneately you must get up early and reserve one as there are many selfish people who reserve chairs in the morning and then don't show backup until lte in the afternoon and then only stay for 1 or 2 hours.and during the rest of the time the louges stay empty.We found that the service was friendly and helpful. Tipping your room maid every day sure does help with getting any little extras.We have been twice and we would return.
