{"text":"Great Beaches, Fantastic weather. BUT Just arrived back from 2 weeks in this hotel, was very happy with the hotel resort and room (junior suite - highly recommended) both were of a high quality and very clean and well kept, pools great, sport possibilities were fantastic, then you get to the beach which was just what you expect great sand and miles long with turquoise green water(great waves). Unfortunately you have to eat when you are on holiday. At first you think its not too bad, in the buffet resteraunts, the choice is large and OK presented so you can always find something that you can call food, but then you try the different A La Carte resteraunts!! Of course you don`t expect an Italian resteraunt to be like in Italy, but this was just discraceful what was served, it wasn√à?√¨t just by the Italien it was by the Mexican and by the Fish resteraunt just as bad. The only place where you could find food what you expected was the Sports bar where they just sold snacks at least you knew what you was eating. At least you always found some where to have a drink, the beer was OK and the cocktails what you wanted. The staff were always very friendly and quick at serving either drinks the food or by clearing tables.All together enjoyed the Resort but just don√à?√¨t go if you like eating good food you will be dissapointed.The last thing if you want a good place at the beach get up very early otherwise all the best places have been reserved, it√à?√¨s like being back in Spain during the 90√à?√¨s towels every where but nobody to see.
