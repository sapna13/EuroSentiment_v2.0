{"text":"Not Worth The Expense! Stayed at the Rey Juan Carlos in Barcelona in April 2007 for a romantic weekend with my boyfriend and, after initially being really excited about the hotel, we were thoroughly disappointed with the room and the hotel in general.On arrival, the hotel looks fine but is the decore is definately 'souless'. The staff were really friendly and we were given a room on the 10th floor - so had amazing views out towards the city and over the spa area. It would have been even better if our windows had been clean and bird-poo free. The room would have looked fantastic - in the late 80s -but the furniture doesn't look like it's been updated for decades and we were really expecting something a bit more special for the price. We used the spa facilities but had to make it quick seeing as it closed at 7pm. On top of this, the women's and men's facilities were seperate, which is great for those on a hens weekend but not so good for honeymooners and couples on a romantic break. The hotel is located a fair way out of town and while the walk to the metro station is not far, having to get expensive cabs and catch trains everytime you want to get in and out of the city centre can be a total pain. All in all, apart from free entry to the spa and the other recreational facilities, which I'm sure are fantastic in the summer months but are pretty useless when it's raining and cold, the hotel didn't offer much in return for the expense. And no, breakfast wasn't included but could be purchased for an extra √à√\u2020√ü?0 each. Not likely...We had booked in for 2 nights and ended up staying for one after finding a fantastic and cheap hotel right in the middle of the Gothic Quarter. Sorry Hotel Rey Juan Carlos I but we won't be back and advise those who are after something romantically special to steer clear as well. There are plenty of better hotels in Barcelona for half the price with much more character. ","annotations":[]}
