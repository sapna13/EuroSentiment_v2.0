{"text":"Much better than a cruise!!! I almost want to give a five star rating because I had such a great time! I went with my husband, my 16 month old son, my mother in-law and grandmother-in law.We stayed at the club in a two bedroom place- more like 3 bedroom because it had 3 separate rooms each with bed, TV, closet and bath. We had a jaccusi in our room which didn't work. But, that didn't spoil my stay. The rooms were very clean, just don't leave out food or the sugar ants will take over.The overall apperance was very nice. Landscaping was beautiful, there was some things that can be dangerous if not careful but, use your brain and watch your kids, and don't go where you shouldn't be and your fine. There was alot of construction, the new sunquest area. It was amazing how quickly things were done- you can tell they were playing catch up.The beach was the best. The sand felt so good on your toes. The waves were so big and fun to jump in and out. The wind was refreshing. The combination of salt water and sun does wonders for you skin. My sun had a body rash that completely cleared.The food was very good. So much variety. And as much as some say they are not picky eaters, they have to be. I and my in-laws come from completely different back grounds and we all loved the food. You have your daily rice, beans and potatoes, chicken, steak, lamb, goat and seafood. Also veggies, spinach, squach, corn, yuca, plantains, cucumbers, etc. A variety of fresh fruits. Cheeses and olives. I also, love the deserts, the weren't too sweet like in the States. I love the juices and the drinks. Also, you felt good after eating, not like a stuff turkey like on a cruise. The animation team were wonderful. I like their spunk. Its amazing how much stamina they have. The dancers were very good and very friendly. The workers all interacted with everyone. Be friendly and they will do everything they can to make you comfortable.The people there were mostly french, from Canada or France. They were very nice and and made efforts to communicate with us, especially to my son which everyone loved. The only english speaking people were from Toronto or Montreal. I know it help that I speak spanish and my in-laws speak hindi, but, if you make the effort, you can meet some great people.My husband and I went on the atv excursion. We had a blast! We went right after it rained, so we went through some big puddles- we were covered in mud.The only downside was the disco. The dj wasn't much of a dj. He was gone for a long period of time and left songs to play in a loop. Oh well. There always has to be a downside.I did not want to leave. I would come back in a heart. Now its time to recruit my side of family. My motto, its much better than a cruise!
