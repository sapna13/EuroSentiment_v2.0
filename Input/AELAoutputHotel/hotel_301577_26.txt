{"text":"Prime location Pros: convenient to MRT stations all ranging between 500m to 1 km away and will link to the other lines within 1-3 stops. We upgraded to an advanced room and well worth it for the space, though we did not have a view which was just fine. Convenient access to Boat and Clarke Quay entertainment and restaurants - the latter of which is an absolute gastronomic fantasy - you name the cuisine, it's there. Close to Chinatown and numerous food courts for local Singaporean cuisine. For runners, Fort Canning Park and Clarke Quay make great routes in the morning because it's not crowded. The gym is open 24 hrs a day and stocked with enough to keep you fit on the road. The spa treatments are pricey but well worth it - can't miss the Auyrvedic treatments!Senior and managerial staff are professional and were very responsive to our booking situation despite its complexities - even when there was a wedding event!Cons: A bit far from Little India. The pool atmosphere is a bit crowded during the day - night hours should be extended. Internet access is not free in the rooms and rather pricey, but one can access wifi throughout Singapore. Business customers may find that the internet access is not convenient and expensive. Regular check-in staff needs a lesson in professionalism from Senior and Management.Overall, this was a great hotel that really added a lot of value to our Singapore experience. We would definitely stay with them again on a future visit! ","annotations":[]}
