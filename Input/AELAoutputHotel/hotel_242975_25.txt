{"text":"Highly Recommended Hotel We stayed here for two nights in May, and had a very positive experienceOur room was on the 11th floor with a fantastic city view (lifts were frequent and quick). The room was small but had everything we needed, and the bed was really comfortable. Bathroom was fully marbled and the shower was powerful with plenty of hot water. Everything was clean, as you would expect from a hotel of this standard. If staying here with children, I would recommend monitoring their access to the TV √à√\u2020\u2022?some easily accessible channels were not suitable for their viewing.The hotel has a business centre where you can use the internet for free (4 computers) by giving your room number √à√\u2020\u2022?really convenient. There is also in-room Wi-Fi (for a fee).Lobby very impressive and doormen very attentive. I didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ try the restaurants or any other services, so cannot comment on those.Although the hotel is not right in the centre of Barcelona, it is on the main Avenue Diagonal so it is easy to get in an out. It is situated a 5 minute walk from the Maria Christina metro station, which is on Line 3. This takes you straight to the Placa de Catalunya stop (Top of La Rambla) in about 20-25 minutes. Plus the metro is air-conditioned √à√\u2020\u2022?so much better than London! The √à√\u2020\u2022√ä?√®us Turistic√à√\u2020\u2022?tourist tour bus also goes right past the hotel, which is a really convenient mode of transport.For football fans, this hotel is moments away from Nou Camp, the Barcelona FC stadium. There wasn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ a match on the weekend that we were there though.All in all, a great hotel. I would go back!
