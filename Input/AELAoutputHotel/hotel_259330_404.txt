{"text":"Horrible Experience, Terrible Service Our experience was the worst. As soon as we got to the hotel, they took us to the wrong place. We were supposed to stay at Grand Paradise and instead they took us to The Club because apparently they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have any rooms available for us and our group (69 people total), eventhough we had made the reservation 6 months in advance. The Club was about 7 minutes (walking) or 3 minutes (taking the little train) from Grand Paradise, which was the main hotel and where most activities and restaurants were located. At The Club, all the activities were for the French and there was only one restaurant.The rooms at The Club were a disaster. Bad smell, leaky toilet, poor lighting, no decorations in the room, no AC, not enough towels, etc. We had to change rooms because some of these conditions were not appropriate for our nine months old baby. The second room we got did not smell as bad as the first one, but the AC did not work. Even though my husband and I complained again about our room, no other room was given to us. Bad service at this hotel is taken to another level. It is TERRIBLE!!!! They didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even take into consideration the fact that we had a baby.The restaurants were just as bad and so was the service. We got sick the very first day. There was no bottled water and many of the food you order a la carte they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have. So what was the point of making reservations if you went to the restaurants and they didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ have what you wanted to eat? Service at the buffet was bad. The first time we went to eat there, we didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ even have forks in our table. Even after we asked for them, we still didn√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√µ get them. The same thing happened when we asked for the drinks. It√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not the language because I speak Spanish fluently, Spanish is my first language, and it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ not the tipping part either because we tipped. BAD SERVICE, that√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ what it√à√\u2020\u2022√ä\u201AÑ¢√∂ called.Neither my husband nor I, nor anyone from our group would recommend this hotel to anybody.
