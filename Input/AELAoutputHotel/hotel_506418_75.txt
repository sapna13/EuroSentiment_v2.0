{"text":"Awesome place I love this hotel! Arrived off the Virgin flight into SFO and into the cool and calm lobby, which has a great feel, and checked in to the first surprise, they had upgraded us to a panoramic suite and then on showing us up, on a beautiful day, we had to stop and take in the view. It's awesome, as was the suite itself. Very spacious, great fixtures and fittings, loads of space to play, work, relax - you could have a cocktail party in it.I liked the amenities, particularly the Bose Soundock to plug the iPod into (and charge it, which is now just a basic requirement that so many places don't get), the very well stocked mini bar (and not a rip off either), the bed was extremely comfortable. The bathroom and shower were lovely (though a little more water pressure would be cool), the lobby area a little oddly shaped and not really enough wardrobe space for a long stay, but this was a minor negative.We found the staff charming and attractive. All our requests were efficiently and politely handled. I particularly liked the explanation on check-in of the charges they would apply to my card, I wish many more hotels would be that honest and up front.The views really do make it however, I would strongly advise a waterfront room, when the fog clears and sun comes out, you get a great sense of wellbeing with karma of the place and the light!A week later I came back this time to a deluxe waterfront king, no Soundock but still a great room nonetheless.One thing to be aware of, the bar and outside deck are extremely popular in the early evening, do not bank on getting a table!
