{"text":"Do not stay here ! Neg : Horrible breakfast , service , rooms and overall quality.Pos : free parking spaceWHY ? READ BELOW.In april we made an extensive trip by rental car from Las Vegas to San Francisco. We made no reservations up front and wanted it to play by ear. But during our stay along the route, the hotelmanager warned us that not booking in advance could be dangerous in SF. So we looked up a place to sleep for 3 nights. We came across the Francisco Bay Inn and booked it via the internet. The price was an avarage of $89 a day. Parking and breakfast was included so that was another bonus, knowing that parking prices can go up as high as $30 a day in SF. ABOUT THE SERVICE :When we arrived at 11.00 am , we couldn't check in before 03.00 pm.The woman at the reception was not hospitable.When asking for information she advised us to read the available leaflets. But when it came to making money , we were good enough ! she did sold us immediatly a tour of SF. We did had to wait before getting into our rooms. Price was $44 a person ( we were 4 ) and we had to pay $76 upfront to her. ( money in her pocket ! ). She said that we would stop at noumerous places, were we couldn't stop with our car. What a lie ! There were only a few stops and those could easily be made with our car too. The tour was no good ! Because we returned our car the next day, we needed a shuttle to SF airport a few days later. Price : $15 a person. We had to pay the woman at the reception $32 upfront ( money in her pocket ! ). So $28 had to be payed to the driver . But when we got to the airport, the driver asked $44. He was not to happy with the fact that I only was willing to pay $32 ( before tip ) for the trip. I was lucky to have asked for a receipt at the reception ! I wondered why the reception was not to keen to give me one. To the people of the Francisco Bay Inn, we were just walking ATM machines.ABOUT THE LODGING :Parking space was available, so, no problem.We had to ask where our rooms were ( no explanation upfront ) and got directed to an elevator in a corner, that seemed to be the only survivor of the great fire of 1906. We were glad that it only had to take our luggage up 1 floor ( but it took almost 2 minutes ! ).The room ( they called Superior ) was bigg enough for a family of undersized midgets. Openening our luggage and still wanting to get around was a smal problem. The room was smelly. Opening the window was impossible. It was blocked ( just like New York sky scrapers ). I guess they lost a lot of clients who jumped out the window after seeing\/smelling al this horror. But the worst had still to come. Watching TV apeared to be a social event. The neighbours set the volume so high that even Al Capone would get awakened ( if he'd still stay at The Rock ). At night ( at around 10.00 pm ), EVERY NIGHT we got a private performance of the  Blue Man Group ! A lot of loud banging and running around in the rooms. It seemed us , the people were in our room, jumping around on pogosticks on the wooden floor. One night we were even (ear)witness to a latino marital fight. The nextdoor neighbours were reinacting a scene from Saw3, the Bloody One. We were afraid to get stabed by a fork, knowing that the paperthick walls could not even stop Steven Hawkins without his wheelchair.Breakfast was a disaster !!!Powdered coffee, cakes is wrapping and 2 muffie chaires to sit in at the very very small reception area. No more comment !In Conclusion :Neg : Horrible breakfast , service , rooms and overall quality.Pos : free parking spaceBut hey , we only payed $89 a night and got 24hr live entertainment. So why complain.A perfect getaway for the Munsters !
