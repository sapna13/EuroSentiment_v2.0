{"text":"It's what you make of it Well, I read reviews for months prior to my group of 6 going to PCP from 11\/6 - 11\/15\/08. The range of comments and ratings really boils down to it's what you make of it. It is not a 5 star resort, and it's not priced that way. If you are an entertainment, food, or beverage critic, you will have plenty to write about. The best advice I can give is get the VIP Package that gives you the premium drinks. ASK FOR the Baily's, Tanqueray Gin or what ever you want. They did not have Grey Goose Vodka. The cigars in the room are OK. Don't plan on drinking the rum they give you in the room. If you go to the bar to get juices, you mught as well have them make the drinks. It's all included anyway.The rooms and resort is kept very clean. That was great. The beach is great and we loved the beach beds, that they also have at the pool by the way. Be sure to schedule your dinners at the different restaurants. Those that complain about the food or the fact that they only ate at the buffets, just didn't make the reservations correctly. You can only make them 1 day in advance, but it's worth it to just be in different places each night. The walks to the other resorts are fun. keep in mind you are in the Caribbean, and look at the stars. They are beautiful!My opinion is that the resort is fine. Great beach, everything is clean, and the food is OK. There is plenty to do with Banana Rides, boat rides, Kayaks, Para-Sailing, ATV and other excursions. Going out of the resort was not fun. Actually it is a little scary. We went to the Casino 3 nights, and even that ride passes an area that make you feel like someone might jump you and take your money. It's a very poor country, and the roads and local housing are terrible.Would I go back? Probably not. But the biggest reason is I am more of a ben there, done that kind of guy. (Except for Vegas)If you are booked and are reading this, GO. Enjoy the beach and pool, get the VIP package and be sure to ask for the good stuff. Just don't expect too much. Again, you will get what you paid for. It's actually a really good deal.
