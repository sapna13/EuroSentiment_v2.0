{"text":"Great Location, Great Staff, Great Hotel I stayed here for seven nights mid-July with two friends and had a great experience. The hotel was in a PERFECT location. If you want to spend a lot of time in the Leidseplein area of Museum area (with the Rijksmuseum, Van Gogh museum, etc) and Vondelpark this is the location you want to be in. It's also on a really nice shopping street. It's a 10 or so minute walk from Dam Square, but a nice walk -- no public transportation needed. Honestly, I would not have enjoyed staying any closer to the square. It was much more busy\/felt a lot more touristy and it was nice to be so close to everything yet still feel like you had space! The hotel itself is still undergoing construction but not in a way that disturbed us during our stay. Our room had been renovated with nice decor, etc, though our bathroom had not been updated and could have use a refreshing!! The rooms were very clean. The front desk staff were wonderfully helpful and accomodating and offered great suggestions about everything to do with Amsterdam! The only downsides to this hotel are the small rooms (yes, they are very small, but if that is something you can deal with then this is a great place. if you need lots and lots of room, i might sugest elsewhere) and the lack of a full-length mirror. Also I assume all the bathrooms will be updated once the renovations are complete, though honestly our bathroom was not that bad at all. Overall great stay, great place. I highly recommend it!!
