{"text":"wonderful resort hotel This has to be the best hotel in San Juan in terms of overall vacation experience. The hotel has a nice private beach with a protected swimming cove, great workout area, nice pools, several good restaurants, attractive common areas and incredible views.The hotel is located 5 minutes from old San Juan, 5 minutes from Candado and 10-15 from Isla Verde and the airport, so it's easy to get anywhere. Most cab rides were $10-12 with Isla Verde and the airport coming in at $19-20.I read some reviews complaining about the food prices and room quality. While there were definitely some cosmetic problems with the room, I don't understand the negativity. Overall it was a nice room with a flat panel, huge shower and plenty of storage. And who cares about the room really? I'm sure the Ritz has much nicer rooms, but their beach is public and is nowhere near as nice as the Hilton's.As for the food prices, yes they are pretty steep. But my wife and I went to dinner at a lot of different hotels and I can tell you that $9 for a pina colada isn't so steep when compared to $14 for the same drink down the road. My advice: Make sure that you budget more for food\/drinks than you expect.My other advise is to bring plenty of sunscreen. If you run out and have to buy it at the sundries shop, those pina coladas will start looking really cheap.We'll be going back to this hotel--probably next time with the kids.
