{"text":"Good Hotel for those going on a Cruise We stayed at the hotel for one night prior to our cruise. There is a shuttle bus that provides free transportation from Miami airport to the hotel. We called the hotel upon arrival and let them know our arrival gate and they picked us up in about 5-10 minutes. We arrived at the hotel around 6 and check in was very fast. Let them know that you will need transporation to the port and they will let you know what times they have available for pick up. The room was very basic, yet clean. No frills: two beds, tv, desk and bathroom. Of course, since the airport is nearby, there was some plane noise, but it seemed to ease up around 11 that night. Bennigan's Restaurant is within walking distance (basically in the hotel's parking lot) and we went there for dinner. There is a small dining area off from the lobby which offers for breakfast: breads, rolls, pastries, cereal, (make it yourself) waffles and various juices and coffee. Again, very basic, and just enough to get your day started.The transporation from the hotel to the port was on time and got us to the port in about 25 minutes. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a place to stay pre-cruise, in the event the hotels closer to the port are booked. We got the room for $115 - AAA rate and estimated we saved about $50 in transporation costs by using the hotel's free shuttle services from the airport and to the port. I had also looked at the Days Inn Airport and was quite frankly scared after reading the reviews from other Trip Advisors. Again, a good place for the pre-cruiser. If you have any questions, let me know, always happy to help.
