{"text":"No go for the RIU Bambu 11 of us just got back from a 4 day stretch from this place. First of all I will say the service and staff are MUCH better than Cancun or Cosumel, maybe a little better than Jamica, but too many other things are wrong. First of all our room was bad, I know most people do not stay in the room very much but you need a good bed. We had comforters that looked like what I had in the 70's as a child. They pushed to regular beds together and the bedding seemed to be worn out. The drinks were cheap, real cheap. They were made from large pre-made containers. The food was better than Cancun, but that is not saying very much. Even the famous Carbie Grill was just OK at best. I would stick to the buffets if I was going to eat. But 2 of us got sick since we have been back, one girl has been to the doctor twice, both times getting different kind of shots and I have had diarohia for the past 4 days. My wife has some kind of rash that has broken out on different parts of her body. We did love the beaches, they were the best we have seen. If you are going to do activities book them from the guys on the beach not the people that are in your hotel lobby, because you can negotiate more with the beach guys. But be careful, you must read what they are promiseing you, they will tell you what you want to hear to make the sale but generally what you are getting will be in some form of writting. Like if it says 2 hr sunset cruise then it is 2 hours, they might tell you 3, BUT they have no control, they are booking the adventure with someone else who is in charge. If you decide to visit Puna Cana, I would suggest the RIU Palace Punta Cana, it is a 4.5 star instead of the Bambu 3.5 star. We went over there 2 different days and hung out. We were not suppose to get to drink because we did not have arm bands, but everytime I ordered a couple of drinks I would have a dollar in my hand they the bar tenders would jump at the chance to get the dollar. Otherwise they will tell you NO. They make your drinks as you order them and they have choices of better liquiors. They also have guys walking around the pool asking to bring you drinks. We did a site visit, including looking at the room and it was MUCH nicer than the Bambu. I would not stay at the Bambu again but might try the Palace. I would say only about 20% of the people there are Americans, so get ready to hear many Europeans. Also many of the woman do not wear tops on the beach....but 85% of them NEED TOO!!!My final advice is if you are American then trust American reviews.
