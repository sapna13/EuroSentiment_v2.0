{"text":"When in Barcelona, there is only one hotel: Casa Camper I am sorry about the people who had a bad experience at this hotel but this is the most interesting and one of the best hotels in Barcelona. First, it looks like an Art Gallery, secondly, the staff (specially Guillermo and the lady who cooks breakfast: she is a gem) are extremely friendly and helpful; thirdly, it is very central (just 2 minutes from Las Ramblas and Plaza Cataluna). Breakfast is excellent: you can have whatever you want. There is a good selection of snacks 24 hours tentempie including hot and cold drinks, cakes, soup, salads, etc., which you can take to your room or to the terrace. I used this service many times even at 3:00 am. The rooms are excellent. We stayed in a Suite with our private little balcony in a narrow street, a lounge, a bedroom with a Kingsize bed and a bathroom (The shower is a must). The whole place is like a small apartment. HOWEVER, there are 2 kinds of rooms: Suites and Rooms. The rooms are just like the Suites except that the lounge and balcony are separate so you have a corridor between your bedroom\/bathroom and the lounge. We found that the Suites are very noisy SO I recommend not to book a Suite. Book a room. FINALLY, GUILLERMO (the Manager during the day) is wonderful: he is helpful, friendly, excellent, and he will do anything to sort out your problems. He is the heart of this hotel. Ask for him if you stay at this excellent hotel.
