{"text":"Villa Real----perfect Madrid location; very fine hotel The Hotel Villa Real is in perhaps the best location in Madrid---close to the most important museums, the old district and plaza mayor, the palace, parks, old restaurants, tapas places and wine bars. You can walk to almost anything you'd want to see. It's next door to the parliament and just a block to the Palace Hotel. It's relatively small but has two restaurants and a bar\/restaurant. Breakfast comes with the room and is a nice, large buffet. We had dinner in the finer restaurant the first night and had great food and service. Out of several hotels in Spain on this trip, Villa Real was the only one with free internet service. A computer in the lobby was there for guests and was rarely busy. Also, guests with laptops could sit near and use the wireless service. Overall service from the concierge and front desk staff was fully adequate and the maids did a really thorough job in our room. A bottle of wine awaited our arrival in our room.Our suite on our first 3-night stay was unique as it was a two story with a small winding stair. The stair made us a little nervous at first but we soon became used to it. We had two terraces, one off each level, though the views were of rooftops at the back of the hotel. (In a later stay passing back through Madrid, we had a room on the front---all on one level---looking out over the park out front, a room we liked even better.)The hotel is full of beautiful and quite old art pieces, including tile pieces on the walls of our room from the 3rd or 4th century and numerous vases in the breakfast room from the 3rd. Other furnishings were somewhat ordinary but certainly nice enough. The price was very fair and our overall good experience makes this a hotel we would definitely use again when in Madrid.
