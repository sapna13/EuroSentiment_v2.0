{"text":"Friendly, Charming, Quiet, Perfect! Hotel Enza was delightful. I absolutely loved it. My first time to Italy, my first city, and the staff (especially Katia!) were more than accommodating. I had Room #1, single, shared bath, 5 nights from October 6-10, 2006. I must admit, I was a little reluctant to share a bath, but there was absolutely no problem. The shared baths are cleaned throughout the day and were spotless. The hotel was within easy walking distance of everything (Florence is tiny next to New York!), most especially the Accademia.The only downside to the hotel, if there was one, was that you had to climb to the second floor for reception (not bad because I didn't have much luggage; but could be difficult if you had very heavy bags).The accommodations were astonishingly reasonable (Euro 40\/night) and I have to say, I have never had friendlier service anywhere. Everywhere in the hotel are tasteful and bright original works of art, and fine prints. The small den\/common area just outside reception is a friendly little living room, with free internet access, TV, and a fabulous antique illustrated book (in Italian, of course) by Dante. You really feel at home right away there. I was very reluctant to leave.Do get up for breakfast in the morning, if only for the coffee, which is fabulous, proudly served by the owner  owner's son. I wanted to get my haircut, and Katia pulled out a beautifully detailed map and gave me two options--both right around the corner from the hotel. There was no view from my room (a quaint, flower-filled alley) but I didn't need one. The quiet was such a gift, restorative and invigorating. Had the best sleep I've had in months.Loved Hotel Enza an hope to return one day.
