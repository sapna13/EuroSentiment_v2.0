{"text":"I didn't want to leave I stayed at this Hilton for a week with my husband. We just got married and picked Hilton Prince Kuhio to spend our honeymoon. We had booked a city view executive floor. upon check in, we were told by the desk agent that we were upgraded to an Oceanview on the executive floor which included free continental breakfast and evening appetizers. I travel a lot on business and for pleasure so i'm really going to tell you the truth.CHECK IN: A breeze...again upgrade to a beautful oceanview that also faced diamond head. They even gave us a drink certificate for a half bottle champagne. Very informative. Friendly staff!ROOM: Great beds, greats beds, great beds! Clean, clean, clean. We had turndown service on a nightly basis. Everynight we would receive 2 bottles of water and 2 cupcakes. Housekeeping...Frindly Staff!RESTAURANT: A bit pricy, as the other reviewers mentioned, good food though. Friendly Staff!POOL: Pool was a bit windy, maybe because it was located on the 10th floor. Jacuzzi to keep you warm. Pool bar was great with limited food items. Friendly Staff!LOBB BAR: Great gathering place and it seemed to be everytime we headed there about 6pm. Great place to get your night started. They serve the same food as the restaurant. Friendly Staff!BUSINESS CENTER: 24Hrs free....if it was staffed i'm sure they would've been friendly.VALET: Some days took a little longer to get the car but.....Friendly Staff!FRONT DESK: Always greeted us by name and treated us like old friends. Friendly Staff!Now do you know why we didn't want to leave...Friendly Staff! Till next year ","annotations":[{"endOffset":810,"mention":"cupcakes","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Cupcake"],"startOffset":802}]}
