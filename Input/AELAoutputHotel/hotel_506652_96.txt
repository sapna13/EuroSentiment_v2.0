{"text":"Lovely hotel, very funky Stayed here in June 06 for 4 nights after 4 nights in Madrid. Chose this hotel as we wanted a little luxury after staying in a lovely 2 star in Madrid.We arrived at the hotel at 8am (after getting off the overnight Madrid to Barcelona train). Check in was at 2pm but they said our room was ready so we were able to check in immediately.Front desk staff speak perfect english and are very polite and helpful. (The room service staff who took the order didn't speak that great english or my pronunciation of the spanish terms was very bad!).Location about 50m from Espa√Ç??a metro station. Right next to the bull ring which they are converting into a shopping mall (don't worry you won't hear any construction noise - in the four days we were there they didn't appear to do any work!)The hotel pool on the roof is fab if you just want to very gently swim while looking over the city. The view is very cool. This is not a hotel for children, it is definitely a couples place.The room was very cool. Huge bed and i mean huge - you could easily get lost in it. Flat screen plasma tv with lots of english channels, lovely big couch, there is a safe and air conditioning, fresh towels and sheets daily and a fridge. View wasn't so great from the room but we weren't really looking out that window, spent more time on the roof terrace or out sight seeing. Bathroom very swish but, not a practical design, when having a shower remove the towels from their location at the back of the bath as the water travels round the ledge and will soak them, also you may want to put a water blocker at the end of the shower screen too...you'll see what i mean when in the shower! (there is a mini supermarket close by for bits and pieces just turn left when you walk out of the hotel.)The bus to the airport also leaves only 50 metres away from the hotel. ","annotations":[]}
