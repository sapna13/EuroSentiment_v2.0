{"text":"Everything you could ask for on a short break! This hotel was practically around the corner from ramblas. Was a little worried about this hotel not being on ramblas, however I feel if we had of stayed on Ramblas we may not have ventured down the side streets. This is where all the magic happens. Some lovely little tapas bars around here and great bagel bar around the corner. Didnt attempt brekfast as it was a bit pricey however loads of options literally outside the door of the hotel! Foyer of hotel was small but had internet access and daily papers and front desk was covered at all times by friendly and very helpful staff. Couldnt have helped more and had great english. Welcome pack was provided on check in which had plenty info on things to do in the area and the staff were obliging to help further.A short stroll to the Plaza de Catalu√Ç??a, which is where all the hop on\/off bus tours start\/finish. If your on a short break i'd definately reccomend taking these (√à√\u2020√ü?6 for 2 days). You get to see all the main attractions and buses drop off and collect every few mins. hotel just beside the barcelona cathedral.Room was nice, clean and well serviced. Beds were comfy and fresh towels each day. Could have left my oversized toiletry bag at home....Shampoo\/conditioner\/shower gel\/ soap toothbrush and toothpaste\/comb\/ hairdryer and razor and shaving gel all provided in bathroom! Minibar had only 2 bottles of beer however was reasonably priced. Our Room had a balcony and was on the 5th floor. Beautiful in the morning. Restraunt\/bar was a bit deceiving. Bar was the restraunt and perhaps its just the culture there.... but noone went to the bar for drinking only. Menu looked good though. Nice little bar around the corner... and for a more lively evening the hard rock cafe is just minutes walk away! Sat morning Markets across la ramblas was an experience. Never seen as much seafood in one place in my life!√à√\u2020√ü?5 for a taxi to\/from the airport... but its the only taxi you'll need for your stay cause everything else is so central! Plenty of shops and a 5 min walk to the courte ingleas. I was well warned about the pick pocketers in Barcelona, but never had any encounters with them. Street feel very safe at all times of day and night and always people walking around.Couldnt have asked for a better hotel for a short break. Perfect in every way!
