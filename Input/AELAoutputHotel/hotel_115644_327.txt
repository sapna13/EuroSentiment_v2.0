{"text":"A Fantastic Find My husband and I stayed at this hotel from 11\/9 - 18\/9\/07. I booked the trip as a surprise 40th birthday present for him but we decided to travel in September to coincide with our wedding anniversary. Like many other people I had emailed Wes in advance and he pre-allocated us a nice room (room 1003). It was a corner room with a side view of Powell\/Union Square and we couldn't fault it. The decor was lovely, the bed was nice and comfortable, the bath amazing and the power shower was an added bonus. Unlike some people we didn't find the room small - it had a Queen bed, dressing table, coffee table, two chairs and two bedside tables. The closet is massive  you can easily store your suitcases out of the way. The bath is also huge and you can actually fit two people into the bathroom fairly comfortably. In addition to our great room we also received a load of gifts from the hotel in recognition of both my husband's birthday and our anniversary - whilst we really, really appreciated this it is not the free stuff that sets the hotel apart from others, but the attitude of the staff and the absolute attention to detail. Everyone we encountered was professional, helpful, happy and keen to help. The free cookies and coffee are welcome (and delicious) but the hotel breakfast in Luques is also really good. Portions are huge, service is great, there is a wide range of choice with daily specials and the prices are reasonable - we dined there several time and it was always great. In addition to Luques we also found two really nice restaurants - Scalas, directly across the street (beautiful Italian food  great service) and Colibris on Geary Street - if you do go there the guacomole is a must. It is made fresh in front of you and is delicious - and the creme brulee is even better.The things we enjoyed most in SF are as follows:A trip to Muir Woods and Sonoma Wine Country. We booked with Extranomical (as recommended by Wes) and it was a fantastic experience. This company showed us 3 different wineries and also lots of the sights  history of SF; A trip to Alcatraz - we took the evening tour, which is really atmospheric but you must book in advance if you want to go; A bike ride over the Golden Gate Bridge to Sausalito  then the ferry back. Sausalito is well worth a trip but note some bike companies will only hire if you have photo ID - Blazing Saddles does not ask for photo ID; The Musee Mecanique at Fishermans Wharf is a museum dedicated to old arcade games  attractions. Everything works and only costs 25 cents to play - it's a great laugh.Our Top Tips - If you plan on riding the cable cars, buy a MUNI pass. You can get 1, 3 or 7 day passes for various sums. A one-way cable car ride costs $5 but you can use your pass on the cable car, MUNI  buses; All ATM's charge $2 or $3 per transaction. If you use the one in the hotel lobby it charges $2 but you can redeem your receipt for a $2 discount at Luques; Macys offers tourists 11% reduction on purchases - just take your passport when you're shopping.Finally - thanks again to Wes  the staff at the hotel - we would highly recommend you to everyone and hope to return very soon.
