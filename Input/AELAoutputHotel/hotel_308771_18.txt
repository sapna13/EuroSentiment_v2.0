{"text":"If you're young and love to party.... Well, for the price...this is a good hotel in a good location. Walking distance to the strip where all the clubs and restaurants are...and also walking distance to the beach. You'll see mostly western people here...and they do have parties every night i was there.If you ask them to put you in the quiet area, you will be assigned a room on the far end of the hotel...there are 2 pool area...the front and the back...the back one is where it is quiet. I had no problems with noise when i was there. Most of the party happens in the front area.The rooms are what you can expect from a 2 star hotel...ive never seen a TV that small, and the AC was barely keeping the heat bearable. There are NO security box in the room..so you have to use the front desk security box. The bed was comfy and the bathroom was bare minimum. I had problems with the shower since it barely had any water pressure on it...or sprayed so little water, it took me 2x as long to take a shower. I was on the 3rd floor..and there were no elevators...so if you dont like walking up the steps..ask for a lower floor. I dont think you gain anything from being higher...there are no views to be seen.The breakfast... they have fried rice and noodles everyday... there's a basic omelette bar...the only meat in the buffet is either bacon or sausage...there's fruits, and some muffins and some western baked goods. OJ, and coffee. Not bad for the what it is but nothing special.They have a internet area...about 4 computers...not bad. I didnt check if they had spa service... in general, the place is presentable and a good value. As far as booking...id recommend booking thru the internet... that is where you will find the best deals. We thought that we should just book 2 nights and wait and see...and just book as we go... it turned out to be a mistake...the prices that were quoted to us were about 10%-20% higher.
