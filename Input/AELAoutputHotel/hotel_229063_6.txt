{"text":"Terrible, don't pay money for this hotel Was booked here through a tour group. Don't blame them - the location is incredible, and this seems like a lovely old hotel in the very heart of Florence. Very midieval-type experience. However, they seem to constantly have air conditioning problems, and we unfortunately experienced that - no a\/c at all for 3 days of pure hell while we slept in 95-degree weather in a pool of our own sweat. The beds were incredibly old and uncomfortable and broken down - my butt literally sank into the floor, until my husband and I switched positions and started sleeping perpendicular in our bed. We didn't have bed bugs, but we did get eaten alive by mosquitos after having to keep our windows open to keep from suffocating.The staff could have went out and bought $20 fans to help - but they wouldn't give anybody a fan even, and were mostly unsympathetic and made us feel like we were whiny Americans. I'm sorry, but when I pay that much for an air-conditioned room, I expect an air-conditioned room!Nice things about the hotel - the roof-top bar is AMAZING. You can sit up there and watch the sun set over the Duomo and the rest of Florence, it was almost enough to make up for it. Almost. But I certainly would never wish this place on my worst enemy, even for the incredible view. Go up to Michelangelo's piazza and get the view instead.Internet never worked here either, and the breakfast was just okay. ","annotations":[]}
