{"text":"Great Hotel in Best Area of Paris We just got back from Paris and stayed at the Hotel De Noailles. We picked this hotel based on 2 months of research for a great hotel in a great location. Although the room we had for our first night was very nice, I had requested a balcony. The friendly staff told me that they would show me more rooms the next day and that I could choose from them.We ended up taking room # 602. Top floor overlooking the main (quiet) street. It had the largest terrace in the hotel and ran the length of our room and could be accessed from 2 sets of double doors. Although the rooms are small for North American standards, this room was more than adequate , especially with the extra room to enjoy on the terrace.We walked to the metro which was 2 minutes away and travelled all over Paris, very easily. When you come out of the Metro, you will be stunned by the gorgeous view of the Opera every-time. We had coffee and croissants at the famous Cafe de la Paix several times which is located in the Opera Square. We took the Roissy Bus from the Airport (and back to the airport when we left) for $8.50 Euro and it drops you of on Rue Scribe, right beside the Opera and 4-5 minute walk to the hotel. You can walk to the Arc and back all in one afternoon if you like to walk. We walked to the Jardin Tuilleires (gorgeous) then to the Louvre and then along the Champs Ellyses all the way to the Arc and back (stopping at amazing cafes all along the way)They also are 5 minutes away from les Galleries Lafayette, amazing shopping. (Go to the perfume section on the first floor and look up at the incredible dome for a great picture)We had the trip of a lifetime to celebrate my wife's birthday, but it was more like a second honeymoon because of the City, the hotel and the great , friendly staff. (Especially Nicholas  Grisele)We will be staying there the next time we come back to Paris ","annotations":[{"endOffset":936,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":930},{"endOffset":951,"mention":"croissants","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Croissant"],"startOffset":941}]}
