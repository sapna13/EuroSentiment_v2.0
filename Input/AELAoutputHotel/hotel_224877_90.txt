{"text":"Great food and spa I took my mother, who lives in south florida, on a long weekend to detox and relax. The hotel had a great rate for floridians. When we got there, they said they had bad news. The room we had book, a bayside twin bed  was not available..so they gave us a suite...for no extra charge!! It was ver ylarge and comfortable and the bathroom was enormous. The balcony was the length of the room with beautiful views. There were two tv's (not flat panel but who cares). The decor was minimalist, not plush but comfortable and in perfect condition. Housekeeping was discreet and capable.It was fortunate that the room was so big as I got ill and for 36 hours had to take to my bed..not a bad place to be sick tho.The Azul was closed but we took out meals at the Cafe Sambal..the sea bass is to die for and the pad thai is beautful.. The hotel does a great mojito as well. Breakfast was great but too big. If you are paying extra, I suggest splitting one breakfast for two.Thee beach was a disappointment as it is really just some sand with loungers and you cannot acces the water. The pool was beautiful if a bit small, but as it was off season it was empty at most times.The spa, while expensive, was wondeful. We had booked half say sessions and all the services were perfect. I had the hot stones and refexology and my mother had a facial and hot stones and hody scrub and reflexology.I reccommend this place for a spa break..do not come looking for a seaside location. It is beautiful relaxinf, but rather expensive. Enjoy it if you have extra money. As my mothe says..it is better han giving it to the doctor!!
