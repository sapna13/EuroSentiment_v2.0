{"text":"I can't recommend it. Yes, I've seen many of the good reviews and know some will disagree, but I am writing this directly from my room AT the Hilton Times Square, and am merely reporting what I've seen.Also, sorry if my reviews are a tad long, but I get so much good advice here that I feel obligated to paint a decent picture for all of you when I review something.***LOBBY: Nice, but smallish and on the darker side. Cozy, but it can full up fast.PRE-ARRIVAL: Pretty good about phones. They pick up 70% of the time. I know cause from Vegas airport it took 5 tries to get someone. They booked me a car from Newark airport to the Hilton Times Square (HTQ) and upon arrival, we had to look long and hard for the driver who somehow appeared and smelled of fresh cigarettes. (In fairness, I booked this at the last minute and they may have picked their last resort vendor. I suggest NOT using Spectaclular for transportation.)**************ARRIVAL: 11pm arrival, only one bell guy on staff but he was visible and helpful. Bell staff overall is fine. *************Check-In: I had confirmations for 2 Corner Rooms which I paid extra for, as usually corner means corner and there's less neighbor noise. I re-specified this at check in and the MANAGER (Mr S) said no problem. More later.*************Room: Good size and recently renovated IMO. While Hilton's bed is NOT as good as Westin, Hyatt, and Marriott, it was still ok. Bring your own pillow I suggest. Lighting is fair, TV worked fine. Air Conditioning is almost adequate for sleeping with blanket. Like many hotels, it's positioned stupidly where the thermostat thinks it's cool, but by the bed it's not. (In fairness, I get hot fast so perhaps you won't feel this way here)************Smallish bathroom but bright and well stocked with toiletries, towels and robes. Water pressure is slightly below avg, but gets hot quickly.************Cleanliness is fine, although there's a stain or two on shower curtains do a good job of keeping it dark.************DINING: One basic restaurant and room service till 11pm. I didn't try it.************INTERNET ACCESS: I'm paying $10 dailoy which is fine, but service is erratic. Had to try logging on 3 times to write this review. When calling front desk they explain that there's a 1-800 number for tech assistance. How nice.*************SERVICE: Despite a few impersonal staff members, there ARE some good staff here. Melissa at front desk, Megan at Concierge, or Cara at front desk is who I suggest to work with. *************Ok, so far so good so why can't I suggest it?NOISY. Not city noise. But you can hear the room next to me as I write this, and hear when ANY room door down the hall closes. Also, you can hear toilet flushes like clockwork and it's from more than one room. Last night I couldn 't figure out how many toilets I was listening to, but frankly I'd prefer Mozart at 3am.CORNER ROOM? NO. I'm almost at the corner and next to me is a room used by HOUSEKEEPING. Yep, so from the 'corner room' I paid more for, I can hear the housekeepers next door at 9am.*****So despite the tgood stuff, I can't recommend it due to NOISE and improper room assignments. $329 per night in NYC does NOT buy marble baths and staff waiting over you hand over foot and I get that. But it SHOULD mean accurate room assigments and especially, a somewhat QUIET room.*****Other than that, NYC is fun as always. This weekend Times Square seems to be mobbed by the hip-pop crowd for some reason, so one has to navigate past the loud profanity, budding fights, etc. But usually it's really nice. Safe travels to everyone!Jedi ","annotations":[{"endOffset":380,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":380,"mention":"Nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":376},{"endOffset":2316,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":2312}]}
