{"text":"Average hotel fairly priced My husband and I attended a conference in July and stayed 9 nights at the Sky Court. We did get a very good package price from Expedia so we were willing to overlook any minor problems we might encounter. I had read many reviews about problems with the elevators. The only problem we encountered was the touchy system requiring your room key to be swiped when going up to your room. We did not find the elevators to be extremely slow as has been posted in numerous other reviews. The room itself was extremely small and we had no view or balcony. We didn't intend to be in the room much so we made the best of it. The bathroom was about the size of a closet. Housekeeping was fine. The bar by the pool was fun and had a good happy hour with cheap drinks. The TGI Fridays downstairs was convenient for breakfast and late-night snacks. The activities people in the lobby were very helpful for planning things to see and do. Parking was rather expensive ($15\/day) and tight. Location was good... within walking distance to the convention center, the beach, shopping, and restaurants. Overall, the Sky Court is an average hotel that is fairly priced for what it is. We are planning another trip to Honolulu next year and will be taking our children so we will be staying at a hotel with larger rooms that can accomodate our family next time, but for the budget traveler who just needs a clean place to shower and sleep, Sky Court is fine.
