{"text":"Loved the Modern Feel We just returned from our week long trip in Europe. We booked a triple for 3 nights (Nov 20-22). The hotel is only a 10 minute walk from the Centraal Station. It took us longer because we missed a canal. But it is very, very walkable with wheeled luggage. I was impressed when we walked through the front door. The lobby and lounge is very cool. It has a modern minimal look, but is very comfortable. The staff was very nice. They had us sit down, got us coffee and or tea, while they did the check-in proceedure. They showed us the room. This might be the only small issue I had with the hotel. They did not have an elevator, but I think this is very common in Amsterdam. To get to the room we had to go up a very steep winding staircase. It was not really that bad. My 75 yr old father with knee problems was able to do it, but it was a little bit of a challenge, and if you travel with anyone that has limited ability here will be an issue. The room was very cool. Again minimal and modern but clean and looks like it could be in a design magazine. Breakfast was provided in the morning, and was pretty good, coffee\/tee machine, cereal, meats, cheeses, hard boiled eggs, croissants. Overall more than you would expect from a continental breakfast. Hotel location is pretty good, it is no more than a 15 minute walk to just about any tourist attraction you would want to go to. Staff was very helpful with directions and recommendations on where to go. The hotel was perfect and we had a great time.
