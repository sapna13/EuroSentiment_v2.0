{"text":"The perfect London hotel! Wow! My husband and I went in to London and stayed at the Draycott for a night and would have moved in if it were possible. This hotel is just perfectly charming and perfectly located. It is located right off of Sloane Square (2 minute walk from Sloane Square tube station) right in the heart of Chelsea.It is in a red brick building located in a very posh residential area. The decor is very English and very elegant. Our room was absolutely amazing. When we walked up to it we saw that our name had been posted on the door in calligraphy, and when we entered we found a personalized welcome note accompanied by a fire in the fire place and classical music on the stereo-- it was wonderful! The room was huge with a king size bed with crisp white linens, down pillows and duvet, a large sitting area with a sofa and loveseat (with down fill, my favorite) with a fire place that we could turn on or off, a stereo with a CD player, DVD player (US DVDs dont work in English players, but the hotel has an extensive DVD library), and a mini bar. The bathroom, although small, was just lovely with a bath\/shower combination with great water pressure, and high end toiletries. The best part of the room was that it was individually decorarted with antique furnishings and wall hangings-- none of the stale hotel chain decor. We really felt like we were staying in a guest room at some enormous English manor verse a hotel. Upon arrival do not be thrown off by the lack of formal reception as the personalized attention of the staff will more than compensate. This is by far our favorite hotel we have stayed in and can not recommend it more highly. Look no further because you have found THE perfect London hotel!!
