{"text":"Good value in paris We have just returned from a 4 nights stay at the Plessis and really like the hotel. For its class, it is excellent. A basic room and bathroom, but clean and well kept. Mostly French TV channels, but we got CNN and German AT1 as well. We had room no 540 with twin beds, and had a nice little balcony outside towards the street. (We preferred the twins, since French lit matrimonial is really narrow.) Our room had the big fan mentioned earlier, but at this time of the year we did not need it. The street itself is a small side street, so it was quite calm, once you remember that you are in a big city. They did have some repairs done to the tiny elevator one day, but it was only for a few hours, and the rest of the time it worked well. All the time the staff was most friendly, very pleased with our rather rusty French. They ordered at taxi for us to get to the airport the last day and the driver was punctual and good. We ended up paying √à√\u2020√ü?42 from the hotel to the CDG terminal 2 on our way back. Getting there we used the free shuttle to the RER and changed to the metro at Gare du Nord, a little more than 16√à√\u2020√ü?for two, but walking quite a bit more.We did enjoy a Turkish restaurant, just down the street to the left with a good √à√\u2020√ü?7, - menu and an even better √à√\u2020√ü?0,- one. The creperie down on the corner is cheaper; their dinner menu was at √à√\u2020√ü?5 and √à√\u2020√ü?9,20 at lunchtime. Good food and friendly service at both places.  We had the breakfast each day, a basket with a pain au chocolate, a croissant and a bread roll pr person, with jam and butter, enough coffee and milk for 3 coffees each was brought to the table. A buffet offered orange and grapefruit juice, boiled ham, salami, hard boiled eggs, yoghurts, fromage blanc, canned fruits, prunes, apple sauce, corn flakes, zwieback, sliced cake and a few other things as well. Unless you want fresh cooked eggs and bacon, we found it a bargain at √à√\u2020√ü?6,50 pr person. Other cafes in the neighbourhood offered breakfast as well, but there it was the same price for one cup of beverage, one juice, one croissant and a roll.
