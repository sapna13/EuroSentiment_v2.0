{"text":"Great Hotel - better locations My wife and I recently stayed here for our tenth anniversary after reading all of the great reviews posted here. We can't say enough good things about the Hotel Preciados. The location was outstanding, outstanding, outstanding. We walked to every major attraction in Madrid and took the metro (2 stops right near the hotel) to the train station to go out of the city. The room, while small (European), was exceptionally clean, stocked everyday with free drinks, and had all toiletries including toothbrushes, razors and shaving cream, shampoo, bath gel, and plenty more. They have in an in wall stereo system with speakers in the main room and bathroom.The floors are hardwood and the bathrooms are ceramic \/ marble. Most rooms have balconies (although they are very small) and flat panel TVs.We order room service once (just for coffee) and didn't eat at the hotel (too many choices right near the hotel. If you do stay here, hang a left when you go out the front door and an immediate right at the first intersection. You will see a cafe called Domingos - I highly recommend it for daily eating (breakfast and lunch). Order the tortilla espana and jamon. You can't go wrong.The staff was courteous and professional - although one of them printed us a train schedule to segovia and accidentally gave us the wrong schedule - which had us sitting at the train station for an hour waiting for a train that wasn't going to come for another two (by the way, the Renfe people don't really even know there own schedules - but that's a different story). Other than that, the staff was perfect.The hotel has wifi (I've seen conflicting reports) and I used it every day. While it's not super fast (don't plan on downloading any big files) it is sufficient and it allowed us to check reviews of restaurants while we were there.I don't know how well the staff spoke english - my wife speaks fluent spanish so I just stood behind her like a dope the whole time.All in all - my wife and I had a great time and it was in large part because of this hotel. I am a very experienced traveller and this was one of the most memorable trips I have even taken (first time in Spain) I can't recommend it enough.
