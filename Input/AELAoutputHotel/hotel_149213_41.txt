{"text":"This Hotel is a joke! i have just come back Today is Nov 22nd i have just come back from the worset holiday of my life! this was my 3rd year here! when we got to the hotel it took about 45min to check in the front desk staff are very rude very unhlepfull we went with a party of 7, the entermantent staff are the best they work so hard and are grate with the guest they worked 11-16hrs a day and they even said to us this hotel has gone down big time! The problem we had is that on the 1st day My arnty had sliped over on the WET floor were there was NO sings and Broke her foot. Which means for the next 2weeks she was pushed around in a wheele chair, the mangment team didnt care at all. 1 week later i slipped and cracked a rib which meant i was unable to swim go on trips or even drinks and mined you the reson we went was for my 23rd B-day so baslicly we had a POOR time! what upset us was the fact that the hotel would NOT CHANGE OUR ROOMS TO GROUND FLOOR beacuse we was on the top! The food was VERY VERY bad, even the doctour saidTry not to eat the food so we spent most of the time eating out! the Doctour was so nice and friendly and there to help! 1time we was at guest service with my mum and girlfriend trying to get the ground floor rooms when they said NO Ww then said to the manger and 1st choice Rep OK THATS FINE WE WILL TELL PEOPLE THAT YOUR NOT HELPING A 60YR OLD LADY IN A WHILE CHAIR WITH A BROKEN LEG AND A 23YR OLD WHOS B-DAY IT IS WHOS 3rd YER IT IS HERE WITH A BROKEN RIB YOU WANT CHANGE ARE ROOMS AND THIS HOTEL IS CRAP AND WE WILL TELL EVERYONE he then said to us if you do this i will get sercity to remove you from hotel.. so we thought o grate thanks for your help the weather was really poor rained every day but thats not the hotels problem! but the could have enteranted us as every1 rushed to the lobby to sit. The bars say 24hrs THERE NOT some dont even open at night. I strongley advise you not to go all your get out of it is the beach. the toen country people are grate so i do think its worth going BUT NOT TO THIS HOTEL ITS NOT WORTH IT. I DO HAVE THOUGHTS TO PROVE IT IF YOU WANT TO SEE if you want anymore advise them you may E-mail and ill be happy to helplee.roy.2007@hotmail.co.uk ","annotations":[]}
