{"text":"relaxing My husband,daughters ages 12 and 16 and I stayed the week of December 5th,2006. We have been to many islands throughout the carribean, and this was by far the most relaxing. The resort is so vast, that you can easily find your own solitude. There was not really a night life, but then again we are not nightlife people. Tours are available if you want. We did snorkel and parasail and that was fun. The food is what you would expect in a poor country. Remember you are not in the states. Breakfast was great every morning on the beach. It consisted of eggs anyway you want , omelets, and great variety of breads and fruit. The coffee was strong and the milk is Goats milk, but you get used to it.Lunch we had again at the beach every day. Frenchfries hotdogs hamburgers and a great variety of hot dishes. My husband loved the salads, but there was no dressings only oil and balsamic vinegar. So remember to bring your own, he wished he did. For dinner we tried most of the restaurants. Chopin was an Excellent buffet, Italian was good, and The Steak house was excellent. The Seafood was so so. Remember you can always go to the buffet and eat if you are still hungry. The dinner buffet in the lobby has just about everthing you could want. Great hot entrees (some were strange like rabbit and bob white but hey you are on vacation BE DARING), a pasta station, salads, fruits and great deserts. The rooms were clean staff was great and super friendly. The language is mostly spanish, hardly any english, so brush up on your common phrases. My 16 year old loved the bartenders because they kept giving her alcohol in her drinks, so watch that with the kids. The beaches were beautiful and spotless. Get a hut at at least 8 am or they are gone. Also most of the guests were European, so remember is is not uncommon to be topless.Some extra tips1. Don't expect to get an American paper, there is none.2. When you turn your beach towels in get new ones for the next day. The Towel cabana doesn't open till 9am.3.Bring perscription Lomotil for diarrhea. Goats milk can be rough.4 . Be prepared to barter when shopping. They are very pushy and never give them what they say start at half or less.5 HAVE FUN AND RELAX!!!!!
