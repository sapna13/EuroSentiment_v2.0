{"text":"Charming Hotel in a Great Neighborhood We were only able to spend two nights in Paris, prior to a 14-day European cruise - but of the 9 countries and 14 cities we visited during our nearly 3 week tour of Europe, Paris has got to be our favorite - and the Hotel du Cadran has a lot to do with it! The location is absolutely the best. We walked to the Eiffel Tower, Invalides, Rodin Museum, the Champs Elysses, and the Arc de Triomphe. But always felt so comfortable when returning to our neighborhood around the hotel. There are actually too many wonderful boulangeries and patisseries nearby! (Too much temptation!) And everything I read on Trip Advisor about the hotel staff is absolutely true....Emilie is a jewel. Speaks perfect English and is always happy to help in any way she can, from marking directions on a map to confirming tour reservations and making arrangements for airport transportation. Yes, our room was small, but we didn't spend any more time there than just to sleep and get ready for the next day's adventure. And the croissants at breakfast are without a doubt the best we've ever tasted. Yes, they serve you one - but will bring you as many as you like upon request. There was some confusion as to whether or not the breakfast was included in the price. We thought it was included, but learned upon checkout that we would have to pay 10 euros each. Just confirm upon check-in whether or not your rate includes breakfast - we failed to do this. We would definitely return to the Cadran!
