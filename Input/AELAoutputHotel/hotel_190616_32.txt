{"text":"Just go. I am dutch mum of 3 young boys. Since i really needed a break alone, my husband offered me a weekend Barcelona to do some serious sightseeing (GHAUDI!!) and even more serious shopping!I chose the Majestic based on its location, and for the fact the manager of the hotel actually made the effort to read Tripadvisor and react to negative comments. I always read everything on tripadvisor before booking any hotel or holiday as i find it the best revieuw site worldwide. This is however my first written revieuw!I booked a single classic room. Basically I paid as much as a doubleroom would cost but i still expected to get the smallest room around really. NOT true. I got a nice room, quit spacious with a large bathroom (room 242). I originally was given another room but asked if i could smoke there and that was not the case so i was given another. I must say, walking thru the hallways and seeing other rooms being cleaned, that they seemed smaller. So yes, the rooms may not be big bit its a very old building, rooms differe in size and I did book the cheapest category. So if you take a classic room then indeed you have NO vieuw, and a smaller room. I had no vieuw indeed but i did not care and did not expect it. Its not like I'd go to barcelona to look out of the window all day, is it?Now for the Hotel. I loved it. Its peacefull, classy but very friendly. I never felt out of place there tho i strolled around in jeans and Tshirt basically and i clearly look like a tired mum and not like a potential Armani customer (Armani is next door). Everybody was friendly and willing to help or answer my questions.The Hotel is very clean, looks very wel maintained and is nicely decorated. The beds are comfortable, nice big towels, slippers, TV with several ebglish spoken channels etc. Only the bathrobes.....they are kidsizes. If you are over size 14, bring your own:P That goes for the whole of Barcelona tho, loads of shops but not a chance of buying any clothing over size M (14 or so). So I shopped a lot for my kids and saved my husband some money.Breakfast is standard buffet, not many fancy things but sufficient. The breakfast restaurant is maybe the nly area of ther hotel i did not like much, its in the basement and it does not have much atmosphere. It does the trick tho, you can sit comfortably and eat enuff to last till dinner.Negatives?Hotelwise i cant think of any that would not make me look utterly picky. Servicewise, only one thing botherred me. I do not use a creditcard. I dont have one, i hate them. I pay with my bankcard in Holland and cash elsewhere. My husband obviously has some but they are in his name so i dont take them. Even tho my hotel was payed for already they wanted my creditcard at check in. I said i didnot have one. I got the weirdest look ever, as if i am a total moron for not having one. Then I had to deposit 50 euros a night, apperantly to cover damage or costs i would cause or make before running of...or so....I basically felt like a criminal and told the guy i didnot think it was nice to display so much distrust on a guest, who already payed for her whole stay. He just shrugged. I payed the 100 euros (2 nights). When I checked out 2 days later there was another receptionist. I asked for my money back and he asked for a receipt. I never got one when i checked in and told him that. He shaked his head, started looking in the computer for a while and eventually gave me the money back. Now that made me feel a bit weird, but other than that..i loved it there. If you have doubts, just book it, location is superb, service was great as well, apart from the little incident above.Please note the swimmingpool and spa are being rebuild and are not done till about may this year. Enjoy!
