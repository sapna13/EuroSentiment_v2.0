{"text":"Great stay Myself and my friend stayed here for 3 nights in August in our first trip to Hong Kong. We got an excellent deal  we booked a twin room with breakfast included.Prior to our arrival we had some questions which we submitted to the hotel via email. The responses were quick, detailed  helpful. I would recommend taking the airport express to the hotel rather than the hotel bus service as it is cheaper  quick  arrives every 10-15 minutes.Room - Upon arrival we were told the hotel was overbooked  that we would be upgraded to a suite! The room was a double with a sofa bed. Sharing the double bed wasn't a problem for us but the offer of a sofa bed for some may not have been suitable. The suite was adequate in size- a double bedroom wiith plenty of wardrobe space, a seperate lounge  well equipped kitchette. The bathroom was on the small side for a suite room but with the most powerful shower I have ever come across. The view was fantastic- straight across the harbour. I believe that some of the rooms do not have such good views but when visiting a city like Hong Kong you are there to explore the city, not to stare out of your window all day. The room was clean  the air conditioning almost worked too well. Staff - The staff were helpful  courteous. Food  drink- t Breakfast was fantastic  a good set up for the day. There is plenty of choice for everyone with some odd but yummy editions of bread  butter pudding, quiche  salad?! We did not eat at the hotel for other meals but the downstairs restaurant appeared busy in the evenings. Drinks were not the cheapest but no where in Hong Kong was cheap for alcohol  it was reasonableprice for a hotel. A tip- take a corkscrew  buy some wine from a 7-11 or a nearby shop!Location- after reading some of the reviews on TA I was slightly concerned about the location as we only had 3 days in Hong Kong  didn't want to waste too much time travelling each day. The bus service to the sister hotel Kowloon hotel is excellent. We spent no longer than 5 minutes on the bus even at rush hour  used it every day. A taxi after a night out cost us $16 (just over √ä√£¬¢1) pretty good considering the starting rate is $15. The hotel is not far out  some of the negative reviews on here are exaggerated. If you want to be in the very busy centre of Kowloon  pay a lot more then that is a personal choice but this hotel is ideal- it is so close to the centre but you can escape the bustling streets at the end of the day  get a good nights sleep. Gym\/pool - I made use of the gym  pool every day  I was impressed with the facilities. Take some headphones for the gym so you can watch the personal TVs on the cardio equipment.Overall I would definately recommend this hotel  I will certainly stay here again.
