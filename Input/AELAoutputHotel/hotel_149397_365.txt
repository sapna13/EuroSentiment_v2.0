{"text":"Fun In The Sun,  BAVARO PRINCESS ALL SUITES RESORT, DOMINICAN REPUBLICFebruary 25, 2007 - My partner and I spent two weeks at this resort and we really enjoyed ourselves. Grounds keeping was impeccable and there were guys climbing the palm trees and chopping down fresh coconuts. Beach was beautiful and always crowded. Ocean was warm but on some days the waves were stronger and you had to be careful. Lots of recliners and palapas and you can get fresh towels whenever you want one. Five a la carte restaurants to choose from along with the hotel's daily buffet. The El Pescador (seafood -great and service was good), the El Gaucho (Steak - Argentinian was excellent and service was great), Chopin (Buffet - meats were tough), Sakura (Asian) excellent service and food, and Bella Pasta (food was mediocre and service was very poor). Our room was nicely appointed and restocked daily with bottled water (recommended for all your drinking requirements), coke, diet coke, sprite and 3 to 4 bottles of beer. We tipped the maid well and she was excellend in keeping our room fresh with lots of clean towels and creamers for your coffee. Staff was friendly and polite even if they do not speak English very well. Menus, etc. were in English, French, Spanish and German. Met lots of people from Canada, Russia, Germany, Italy, France and some Americans. Two weeks of rest and relaxation was what we needed and received. 95 Acre property well maintained and two pools. The smaller pool near the lobby was quieter and much appreciated. Someday we will go back for another visit. -S.Rushton, Ottawa, Canada ","annotations":[{"endOffset":699,"mention":"Chopin","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Chopin_vodka"],"startOffset":693},{"endOffset":787,"mention":"Pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":782},{"endOffset":787,"mention":"Pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":782},{"endOffset":787,"mention":"Pasta","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Pasta"],"startOffset":782},{"endOffset":958,"mention":"coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coca-Cola"],"startOffset":954},{"endOffset":969,"mention":"diet coke","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Diet_Coke"],"startOffset":960},{"endOffset":1132,"mention":"coffee","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Coffee"],"startOffset":1126}]}
