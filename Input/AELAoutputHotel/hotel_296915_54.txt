{"text":"Classy Hotel, Great Location I travel at least a week every month, so I see a lot of hotels. I also stay in a lot of boutique hotels. So, I don't get impressed too easily.My wife and I just came back from a one week trip to Catalonia. We spent the first two nights of our trip and the last at the Pulitzer. We liked the hotel a lot. It was chic, smart, clean, comfortable and well-designed.In order, here's what I liked best:1. Location! Right off Plaza Catalonia. Perfect. 10-15 walk to La Boqueria; 5 minute walk to Passeig de Gracia. You could not ask for a better location.2. Polite staff. The staff were all helpful and very charming, even when I was peppering them with dumb questions. I really admired that when my wife and I were waiting on the sidewalk outside of the hotel, for a friend to pick us up in a rented car, the security guy on duty made it a point to stand near us whenever suspicious characters came walking down the street.3. Smart contemporary and not over the top design. I am very sick of over-designed hotels. The pulitzer was classy. The lobby was chic and filled with cool-looking people our whole trip. The rooms, while nowhere near huge (this is Europe after all), were decorated smartly, with nice neutral and earthy tones.4. Smart design touches in the room. The foldaway desk was great since I needed to do some work on the trip but didn't want to be tripping over the desk at other times. The light switches by the beds were well-placed. The bathrooms were well laid-out and the amenities were nice. 5. Price. The hotel gave me a great rate so I couldn't have been happier. I got great value for money. I would stay at the Pulitzer again in a heartbeat. Happy travels! ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1229,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1225}]}
