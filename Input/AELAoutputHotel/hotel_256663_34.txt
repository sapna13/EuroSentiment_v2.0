{"text":"Great service, great location, great hotel. I stayed at the Travelodge Sydney for six days from 8 May 2008. I booked via Wotif website and confirmed my booking by calling the Travelodge helpdesk and advised them of my preference for a Queen room. It was my first vist to Sydney and my flight arrived early morning and as check in isn't till 2pm the front desk happily kept my luggage in their luggage room. I wandered the city for most of the day until check in and ended up soaking up the sun in Hyde park which is literally a five minute walk from the front door. Unfortunately when I eventually checked in there were no Queen rooms available and when I informed the front desk that I had already advised them of my preference for a Queen room they aplogised and assured me of a Queen room for the remainder of my stay. I was upgraded to a King room the next day. I have stayed at Travelodges in the U.K. and this was by far the best experience I have had. All the people on the front desk were extremely helpful and always cheery, especially the young women. My room was on the 17th floor and had great morning sun and virtually no street noise. It was modern, clean and exactly what I expected and more. After a long day touring around Sydney it was always a great place to return to. I can thoroughly recommend this hotel to anyone wanting a great base to explore the city and its environs. I will definitely return to the Travelodge Sydney in the future. ","annotations":[]}
