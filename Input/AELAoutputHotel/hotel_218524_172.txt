{"text":"excellence at the excellence Have just retuned from a fantatsic holiday. spent 14 nights,from 15-29th sep.My Partner and i have been to the Caribbean three times before and travelled to other parts of the world,staying in five star hotels.The Excellence is not perfect,but what is the meaning of perfect,everybodys view is different. We loved it.Beautiful sandy beach. As mentioned in previous reviews,beach is unsuitable for swimming. If you want to do lots of swimming,you would be best to go to other resort. There are security guards on the areas of beach where you cant swim,stopping people swimming or going out to far. On the area of beach where you can swim,life guards were present. There are plenty of sun beds and shades.Very good choice of food,with seven resturants and room service to choose from,there is something for everyone,even for a fussy eater.You would never go hungry.At lunch,two resturants to choose from,room service,sandwiches and fruit at pool bars,pizza bought round to pool and beach. Daily lunch on the beach. Room service was limitied,but made a nice change if you fancied staying in. We had room service breakfast twice when we had trips,we ordered the day before,arrived promptly at six clock as requested. Also had room service one evening,when we faniced just staying in.staff at all resturants and bars,very friendly,always a smile on their faces,will do anything for you.Felix and Juan at the sol pool bar,would wait on you at the pool or beach,always very helpful.Pools kept very clean,plenty of clean beach towels and floats and beds.Rooms kept very clean,clean towels etc every day. Flowers left in room,bath run, with floating petals,towel art etc. Mini bar stocked daily.Grounds very clean and well maintained,gardeners attending to grounds every day.Yes there were insects and i dont usually get bitten,but i did get bitten rather a lot. I used insect repellent everyday and night,but still got bitten. The hotel sprayed grounds four times a day and sprayed our room when i asked.They did everything they they could.Even though i got bitten and it rained for two days,we still had a great holiday and will return. My partner and i dont usually go back to the same place as we like to try different places as there are so many other countries to visit,but we will be returning to The Excellence either next year or the year after,i am sure of that,as we had such a fantanstic time ","annotations":[{"endOffset":1083,"mention":"nice","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Nice_biscuit"],"startOffset":1079},{"endOffset":1565,"mention":"floats","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Ice_cream_soda"],"startOffset":1559}]}
