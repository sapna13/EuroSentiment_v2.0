{"text":"Best Hampton Inn we've seen! First, I should say, the Hampton Inn is not a luxury hotel - it is a good basic chain hotel with basic amenities. That being said, my husband and I were treated betterat this Hampton Inn than we have been at $1200\/nt hotels elsewhere. We stayed at this hotel for the reason many others do - a pre-cruise night in Miami. We arrived early in the day, to accomodate a visit to Miami Beach to eat at a restaurant we'd been wanting to get to. Upon arrival, our room was immediately available (although it was before check in time). We had a lovely room on a higher floor, with a view of nothing in particular, but that was OK with us. Although it was in close proximity to the airport, there was no airport noise that we noticed. The gentleman at the front desk offered the use of the shuttle, although we had a vehicle so we didn't need it. He also shared info about some local restaurants, and was in general very accomodating and friendly. We felt very welcome at this hotel. Bed was very comfy - room was very clean. Check out was a breeze, and breakfast was great. I had my 'norm' - fruit and yogurt, but my husband partook in the hot breakfast of the day, which was an open faced bagel sandwich. He said it was much better than he'd expected, given that it was sitting in a chafing dish. I'd highly recommend for a pre-cruise night, or even a visit to Miami, as long as you don't mind being 'away from the action' a bit.
