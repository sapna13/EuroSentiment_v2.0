{"text":"Great City! Great Location! Just returned from three nights in the Raco del Pi. A short walk to Las Ramblas and as said before a location that cannot be beat. Was in room 204 with a small balcony overlooking Carrer del Pi. Only noise at night was the garbage collection. The area is really quiet after the shops close. At night it is best to stick to the main streets and aviod the dark\/quiet ones. Room was clean and functional and the staff was great. Beds were hard but did not prevent us from sleeping after touring all day. Water, pastries and coffee available daily right outside the small breakfast room.We did have breakfast the first night at the 1\/2 price rate of 7e...not worth the regular 14e rate...plenty of places to grab breakfast. Right next door is an inside shopping gallery with some cute shops including a very small family owned food counter which opens at 9:00am. Breakfast for two was about 7e. Great fresh squeezed zumo de narranja.We tried Taller de Tapas close to the hotel and was not impressed. Prices were high and food was so-so. If you want tapas go to one of the many small tavernas. Tapas are about 1,60e each and you select right off the counter. They count the toothpicks after and charge you accordingly. Great with beer or cava. Also, go to Placa Real about a ten minute walk. Many great restaurants including Les Quintz Nitz. Join the line about 8:00 pm for the 8:30 seating. VERY reasonable...great variety and super food. Four of us had three courses and wine for 80e. And do not miss grabbing some fruit, a bocadilla or pastries at La Boqueria Market also a ten minute walk right on Las Ramblas. We used the Tourist bus and it was a great way to see the entire city if the weather is good and you can sit on top. We lucked out and it was 68-72 with no rain every day. Taxi cost about 30e to the airport as they do charge a luggage surcharge which seems to have no set rate. Many taxis cannot find the hotel. Heading up Las Ramblas.... turn right after you pass La Boqueria...then the second right on Carrer del Pi.Our friends stayed at the MonteCarlo right on Las Ramblas for three times the price. Room was certainly much nicer but we were glad we picked the Raco del Pi. Will return on our next visit to Barcelona.
