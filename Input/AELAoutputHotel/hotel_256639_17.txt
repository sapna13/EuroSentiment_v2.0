{"text":"Great, classy hotel in Sydney I have stayed at Sir Stamford, Circular Quay for about 4 years now on every visit to Sydney from my hometown of Melbourne. Even though I will note some shortcomings here, I still rate it as excellent. Firstly, the staff are fantastic, very friendly. Secondly, the rooms are lovely. It is a classy hotel, with a lovely sitting area off the lobby. The rooms are kept close to meticulous by housekeeping. The rooms are larger than the average Sydney hotel room, very spacious. The beds are so comfortable. On my most recent stay I was looking forward to watching the US Presidential Primaries on CNN. Since my last stay six months ago the hotel has ditched CNN and the only news channel is BBC. When my back went out and I was confined to the room for 3 days with only two music cable channels, three sports channels and the Discovery channel for company (I am female!) I was not thrilled. I hope the hotel reads this review because I do not plan to stay here until CNN is returned. Being an international hotel, CNN is a minimum requirement and I would love FOX news and\/or Sky News as well. Room service meals continue to be dodgy, one night great, the next bland and ordinary. To sum up, if you don't want to watch the news or eat in your room, this hotel is great, I particuarly recommend it for older travellers as they will love its style. ","annotations":[]}
