{"text":"Not Just for Honeymooners! Just got back from our vacation, stayed 8-14 thru 8-21-07This resort is perfect for any couple who just wants to get away from it all and relax...that's what we did! The SPA was the best, not only for any type of treatment that one might be interested in, it also gives you the opportunity for only $ 30.00 pp for your entire stay to utilize the Hydrotherapy Circuit, unlimited times per day.This includes Sauna, dry and steam, Cold dipping pool, and Jacuzzi. They give you a locker,slippers,robe. Tremendous value and well worth it! The gym, which is free, is in the same complex, so therefore doing the Circuit is great after a workout,tennis,jogg, etc.The Food: We eat rather healthy, no problem here, just unfortunately, stay away from fresh salads :(, got sick 2nd day).But if you eat your veggies, fresh fruit smoothies, well cooked beef, or fish, and just taste the desserts, you will be fine.Note: stay away from the restaurant, Spice, horrible Thai,Japanese food.The French restaurant was the best Chez IsabelleBreakfast and Lunch are actually the most satisfiying.Also, on upon checking in, ask when the BBQ Beach Dinner is given, its usually once a week, great food, especially the Domincian soup! This is free, not the Honeymoon private beach dinner that cost $ 150.00, LOLThe entire staff are extremely friendly, helpful and always aim to please, very refreshing!As you probably read other reviews, the resort is immaculate and the grounds are beautiful...dont forget to walk the trails across from the SPA, you can jog or stroll, but the landscape is done beautifully. Watch out for those two Tucans by the gift shop, LOL, one pulled my hairclip right out of my hair and they were actually laughing too! Don't forget to take your camera, a good one for perfecto moments and a diposable for the beach.We have stayed at the Paradisus for the past 4 years, but since they opened their new resort Paradisus Palma Real (way overpriced) the original Paradisus's quality has declined, especially in the food \/services department, I think all their chefs and lil' extras they always gave you went into their new resort.Enjoy your stay at the Excellence you wont be disappointed.
