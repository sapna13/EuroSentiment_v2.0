{"text":"Below average compared to Competition We stayed in Bali for 8 days, the last hotel booked was the Nusa Dua Beach Resort  Spa hotel. For the 8 days we stayed in four hotels, including the neighbouring The Laguna and Discovery Partika in Kuta.The first impression of this hotel is a good one. The lobby is clean, staff are friendly, hotel looked nice, pool is awesome etc. We even got upgraded from a Deluxe Room to a Palace Club Room. Great!However, it was short lived. The Palace Club rooms are on the ground floor, and the first impression you get walking in was the smell of dampness. The covers on the bed felt damp, and the air smelt musty. The other impression is of claustrophobia. The rooms haven't been renovated for some time and are quite old with lots of dark wood, making them dark and dreary. The beds are also pretty average and the air conditioning blows directly onto one side of the bed. The TV reminded me of one I had as a kid.We asked to see other rooms and the helpful and patient duty manager showed us every other room available (about 5 in all), but they all had the same problem - dark, musty, damp, old.We stayed for two days. Its not a bad hotel all considered, which is why so many people rate it highly, but in the end the room just got to us especially as the weather wasn't great and we wanted to spend more time in there. You get used to it, but you don't enjoy it so much.In the end we changed to the Laguna (100m away, Westin between). Whereas the Nusa Dua was ok, the Laguna was awesome. The Laguna is just that bit better in every way - breakfast, TV, guest services (ask the butler for anything, he'll get it!), but most importantly benefitted from newly renovated rooms. It the room is important to you, we recommend going for the Laguna as a preference, failing that the Westin. They really are both a lot better in comparision. Nusa Dua Beach Hotel  Spa only really stands out if you don't compare it with these two neighbours.(We even enjoyed the Discovery Partika in Kuta more than the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel)My last comment is about the location. Nusa Dua is nice, but if you're expecting to do watersports, most the interesting stuff is 4km down the road from these hotels. Don't expect to just walk to the beach and rent a jet ski or anything. Also, Bali is cheap to eat except for the Nusa Dua hotels. There's plenty of places outside to eat for 1\/3rd the cost of the hotel, and just as good.
