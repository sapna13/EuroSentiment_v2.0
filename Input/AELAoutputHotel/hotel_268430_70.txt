{"text":"Didnt live up to the Marriot brand. I just returned from my stay in San Juan Puerto Rico, at the Courtyard Marriot on Isla Verde. I have to say that I was disappointed with the service. The first night we arrived, we noticedthat the floor mat in the bathroom was wet and we could not figure out where the water came from. Also, the bathroom was not very clean and was a little moldy. We then noticed a watermark on the wall. Whenwe called the frontdesk to tell them there was a leak, they said theywould get back to us. We heard nothing back. The next morning we called again. The front desk said they would look into getting us another room. They said they would call us back. We went out for about 6-7 hours and heard nothing from them. When we came back to theroom, the whole bathroom floor was wet and water was leaking from theceiling. We called the front desk for a third time and finally they relocated us and told us a pipe was broken. The new room was better but I was very upset that they took so long to accomodate us. The dinner buffet downstairs was about 23 dollars and the food was reallynot impressive and a little dry. But the ice cream bar was excellent and the mojitos at the dar were great! I enjoyed the live band downstairs. The service, however, spoiled my stay. In addition, the concierge seemed to have no idea how to direct us to basic places in San Juan. I would not stay at this hotel again.
