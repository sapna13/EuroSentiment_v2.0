{"text":"Nice accomodation in bustling city We had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Laurus for six nights in early October.The room was modern and clean with a very nice bathroom. You can't beat it for the price. The staff were helpful and friendly. We especially enjoyed Claudio, the bartender at Bar American. The view from the rooftop deck was nice. It was an especially nice place to go at the end of the night to get away from the crowds of tourists everywhere else but enjoy the nice view and terrific weather. The location is very convenient - walking distance to most sights and the train station.It is, however, on a very busy road which is also apparently the main route to the hospital. Traffic noise, and especially the ambulances, did get tedious after a couple days and nights.Breakfast was adequate and the outside terrace was a nice way to start the morning. They had really nice fruit, but after the first day we started noticing fruit flies swimming in it so we had to stop eating it after that. The selections didn't vary at all from day to day so by day 6 it was old to us. The bed was too hard for our taste, but we had the same issue in Venice, so given that this was our first trip to Italy, we guess this may just be the norm.The only real negative we encountered was with the reservation desk. We had requested in advance for them to book a private guide for a specific tour we wanted to do. They confirmed the booking as we requested. It was not an inexpensive trip and we had really looked forward to it as a highlight of our visit to Tuscany. We were very disappointed in the service we received from the driver, Mr. Tiziano, (far more a driver than a guide) and he didn't fulfill our requested itinerary. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, I felt that the reservation manager did not act as my advocate.
