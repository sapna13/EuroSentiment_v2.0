{"text":"A great hotel My girlfriend and I stayed here for three nights in September in a Room with a view of the Arno. The room was very large with plenty of seating and storage. The bathroom was very nice and the shower really good. The view of the river was wonderful. The bed was really firm, which we liked. We were glad not to be next to or near the road, which is a busy main road. The only problem we experienced was the sound of someone running water in the middle of the night. It almost sounded as if it was in the same room! The staff are certainly friendly and helpful, especially the waiter at breakfast. Breakfast is a high standard for Italy with a good cold buffet, endless capuccini or espresso, plus hot scrambled eggs and that awful thin shredded stuff that passes for bacon on the continent and in the USA.Partly we chose this place for the swimming pool, which is just what you need after a day's sight-seeing in the Tuscan heat. We had a great swim. Shame the weather turned after the first day. We usually walked in to the town - a pleasant 20 minute stroll along the Arno (tip: take the southern bank - the traffic is much lighter and you get better views). Bus no 14 also passes nearby (single tickets available from Tabacchi, hotel has weekly passes only). We arrived and left by taxi (√à√\u2020√ü?5 approx from SMN railway station).We didn't eat in the hotel but can certainly reccommed the Bellariva restaurant fives minutes walk along the Lungarno into town. We were the only tourists at what is clearly a popular local place. Great food, nice riverside setting, good value. Gelateria Pinguino, also nearby, does incredible icecream.Overall, we were very happy with the hotel but maybe found it a bit of trek during poor weather.
