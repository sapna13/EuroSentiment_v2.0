{"text":"Good clean hotel, great location As usual I spent some time researching good places to stay on Tripadvisor and I was not disappointed with this selection. I have been to Amsterdam once before and stayed in a Hotel quite near to the Anne Frank House but this was a little too far from all the action for my liking, albeit only a short walk.The Hotel de Roode Leeuw (Red Lion) is perfectly situated about 30 metres from Dam Square right in the heart of Amsterdam. It is a short walk from the train station and is on a main street with plenty of amenities close by. There is a popular restaurant downstairs which, although I didn't choose to eat there, seemed to offer a good standard of food as most of the clientele appeared to be smartly dressed locals. The hotel itself was very clean and tidy. Our twin room (I stayed with my brother) was modern, clean and comfortable. There was TV, internet access, safe, mini-bar, coffee making facilities and plenty of wardrobe space in the room. The bathroom was spacious and clean with a good powerful shower unit. Breakfast was not included and when this is the case I prefer to go out and explore the area to find somewhere to have a nice breakfast. In this case I found a nice cafe on a sidestreet and had a croissant with some dutch flatbread and jam.Local tax was added to our hotel bill when we checked out. I think this was 6 euros for our one nights stay so be prepared for this if you are on a tight budget. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and if I return to visit Amsterdam again I would be very happy to stay at The Roode Leeuw.
