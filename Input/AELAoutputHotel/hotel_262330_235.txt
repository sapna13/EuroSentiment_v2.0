{"text":"Wonderful Hotel but a Couple of Negatives I booked 2 quad-accupancy rooms for a group of us who headed down to NYC for the Labour Day long weekend. The hotel itself has an upscale feel to it and has one of the fastest elevators I have ever experienced.Both rooms were located on the east side of the building, facing town hall and the Brooklyn Bridge, although the later is only visible from the highest floors and were not visible to us (31st and 32nd floors). The rooms were well appointed, spacious and the large-screen plasma TVs made viewing a pleasure.Several of the group has stayed mid-town on previous trips and enjoyed staying downtown, away from the hordes of tourists congregating in Time Square, Central Park and 5th Av. However, it is a ghost-town after all the white collars head home on Friday, giving it somewhat of a depressing feel when you are the only soul out walking around in the early morning or late evening. Its location across from Ground Zero doesn't really help much either... For all of the compliments, we did have two complaints. First, for a quad-occupancy room, beds were very small, making for an intimate sleeping encounter whether you wanted it or not. If you want the possibility of moving around without falling out of the bed (or accidently knocking your partner out), better upgrade to a junior suite.Secondly, because of flight delays, one of our group arrived at the hotel after our party had already headed uptown. Although the front desk assured us that it would be no problem to provide her access to the room in our absence, it turned out to be a different story. Only after half an hour and three attempts did they finally provide her with an access key.All in all, a wonderful hotel although there were several aspects which kept it from being a great stay.
