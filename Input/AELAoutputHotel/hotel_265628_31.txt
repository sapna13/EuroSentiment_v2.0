{"text":"Great Value We Just returned from Sirenis Tropical Suites on Aug 1\/08. The hotel is clean and well maintained, however, as others have pointed out it is out in the countryside quite far from the airport. This is not a bad thing should you be looking for a relaxing place away from the congestion of the more popular hotel areas. Most of the tours and excursions take longer to get to. The suite we had was clean although the furniture and the linens are a little worn out. The washroom had been renovated and hot water with lots of water pressure was always available.The beach is nice and clean with lots of palm trees and huts for shade from the blistering summer heat. We had no problem finding a shady spot whenever we went to the beech, although the best ones are guaranteed by arriving before 7:30 am.As others have mentioned, Jade and the steakhouse were quite good and are easily booked if you follow the booking instructions. The Buffets were typical of this type of resort and were adequate unless your extremely fussy. The beech barbecue for lunch was nice and we took our food to the nearby buffet (Mexican restuarant at night) to get salads and sit inside out of the sun. They even had crepes (or what we heard the English visitors call pancakes) and soft ice cream with cones and sundae toppings available here. We found the barbecue chicken quite good.We only took the Bucaneros tour (jet boats and snorkelling) which was quite fun although the drive to the boats was long and rough in the open truck the tour picks you up in.There is FREE internet in the lobby area if you have your own laptop or wifi device. The speed is pretty fast. Just ask at front desk for your free access card (thanks to a prior poster for the tip).The hotel did get busy on the weekend with locals from the cities in the Dominican. They were quite loud and dominated the pool bar and lobby bar, however, it did not hinder our enjoyment of the resort too much.
