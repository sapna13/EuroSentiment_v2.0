{"text":"Our little secret in Paris. Loved this hotel. I booked this hotel last February for our trip in September. We were a group of 6 and took two superior rooms and two standard rooms. Christian is valuable asset to this hotel as the service I received from the time of booking to our departure was notting short of excellant. Nothing was a problem and every email was answered in the most professional manner. The hotel is small and holds a cosy character in a beautiful area of Paris. Our room was on the 5th Floor and was a very good size. The beds are very comfortable and the decor was gorgeous. We had a great view of the Eiffel Tower from the second floor up and what a sight it is to see it sparkling a night. The bathroom was very nice and absolutely spotless clean. Our room was cleaned every day with fresh towels replaced. Tea and coffee facilites and the flat screen tv has Sky News, Cnn and BBC. Air conditioning is available and they have fantastic free internet facilities in the lobby. The staff make this hotel, they are extremely friendly, helpfull and welcoming. Christian organised our shuttle transfer to and from the airport which was so handy, and spot on time.It is a mere 20 minute walk from Le Tour Eiffel and the Seine. The area is quaint, stylish and typical French and has a very relaxing atmosphere. There are some gorgeous restaurants and cafe's in the immediate area. It was wonderful to sit outside with a beer or glass of wine and watch the world go by.We will definately be returning to the Relais Bosquet for many years to come and I would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel whether you are with friends or taking a romantic break, you will not be disappointed.I nearly don't want to tell anyone about this hotel, because I want to keep it our little secret.We just loved it and send a special thank you to the hotel.
