{"text":"Really liked it, will use it again both for business and tourist trips Nice hotel, very conveniently situated both for wandering up and down La Ramblas, and for the Gothic quarter. On a small side street just off the main road, near several other hotels, this was a great find. It's just up from the big market (Bocaria), and probably 10 mins walk from the sea-front. Just far enough off the main road that the noise was reduced to a bearable level - didn't need my earplugs for once. The hotel looked new, maybe it had just been refurbished, but everything was clean and shiny.Reception was fast and efficient. The porters were a bit overbearing, and eventually I just took my own luggage up, but it wasn't a problem. The bar was quite nice, it would be a nice place to meet people before going out to explore.Lifts were fine. Corridors a bit dark. Room excellent, but they all smelt of smoke, even the non-smoking ones. Not badly, just enough to make to want to open the windows a bit when you came in. Not an enormous room, but OK. Bed was huge, clean and very comfortable, with chocs on the pillows. Bathroom was new looking. Desk was more than big enough to get some work done. The wireless internet is free, and you need to get a password from reception. But it was a reasonable speed and the connection was good. There was a room safe, which was worked by another key card, and a mini-bar with a good selection of soft drinks and beer. Reception staff were good at ordering taxis, alarm calls etc, and were very polite even at 2am. No breakfast, we went to a coffee\/pastry shop down the road instead. All in all, an excellent hotel for business travellers, but I'd also use it next time I go to Barcelona to visit friends.
