{"text":"Not a 5 Star Hotel The star ratings of course relate to the overall hotel and not the room standard which is a shame as the room was very disappointing - tired decor and average, more like an English 3 starHowever, the restaurant, in particular the breakfast buffet, was very good and the service excellentVery disappointed at the fee to use the pool area, which again, was tired and dated. 12 euros per person.The bar and restaurant weren't cheap but we expected that due to the star rating, the choice, service and comfort were excellentA little distance from the Rambla which actually worked well for us as it felt unsafe at night and much safer in the hotel area of the City. Taxis were reasonable and the tram was easy to catch -right outside hotel although we found it difficult working the tarif out!Visit the Market area off the Rambla and the historic buildings in the day, which are interestingWe took a tour on the open top bus which was 20 euros per person for a full day and we visited the old Spanish town which was great but again, expensive as we had to pay to gain entry c.10 euros each and then we got off the bus to visit the acquarium where there was a charge again. Its just as well it rained and we didn't stop off at other attractions as the monies were running out! Not good value for the day but if you want to see Barcelona there's not many options really All in all, Barcelona is a great City but be warned, its City prices we wouldn't pay for 5 star again in Spain ","annotations":[{"endOffset":524,"mention":"comfort","uri":["http:\/\/dbpedia.org\/resource\/Southern_Comfort"],"startOffset":517}]}
