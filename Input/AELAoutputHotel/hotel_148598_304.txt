{"text":"good time as usual I am in Puerto Rico 4-5 times per year and stay at the Westin at least once per year. I have read a lot of reviews on the hotel and perhaps I can shed some light....First of all, the hotel has over 600 rooms so what you read here is a very small sample of opinions, some helpful and some obviously reactionary. I can comment on a few things I have seen. First, the area is plenty safe. I am not sure why people think it is unsafe other than just a simple fear of being around people that are different than you or perhaps a bad experience which you could have anywhere. Second, there is a ton to do in the area. If you couldn't find it you didn't ask because people are very friendly when you show them some respect as oppossed to acting like they are your servants...any of us who have been to any resort know what I am talking about. Anyway, some recommendations for things to do would be renting ATV's or going horseback riding right off the Westin grounds up into the mountains near El Yunque. There is a cool bar at the top of the mountains to hang out and relax in. You can make a short trip to fajardo and go to one of the marina's where you can take catamaran trips that provide you with snorkeling gear and take you out to the reefs off the small islands just east of PR. They provide rum drinks and food and are all included in the price. You can also go deep sea fishing or just take the ferry to Culebra or Vieques at 2.25 per person. The bio-bay's in Fajardo and Vieques are a once in a lifetime must do's. Very Surreal and the tours leave nightly. You can hike in El Yunque, the Caribbean National Rainforest as well. As far as restaurants go there are plenty of good ones off the Westin campus as well. Let me give you a hint though....If you are looking for steak and cheese or a pizza you're better off having it at home. The good food is what people are used to making and in Puerto Rico the seafood is excellent and some local dishes such as Mofongo and Asopao are really awesome. You can go to Don Pepe which serves Mexican and Island food. Hint: you are not in Mexico so what shouldn't you order? La Parilla is a seafood shack in the kiosks, number 2 which has good seafood. If you prefer a restaraunt make a trip to Fajardo and eat at Rosa's or Irbella for fresh off the boat seafood. Don't expect Legal Seafood decor as these places are very rustic, but good and in most cases the food is at least as good as the seafood where I am from(Boston). On the Westin campus the food is expensive and pretty typical of resort food which is good but over-priced. I think the combo leaves some people upset and rightfully so. The Italian restaurant is the best one of the lot at the Westin. The grill room has decent burgers and sandwiches but if that is what you want go off campus to Luquillo to a place called the Brass Cactus. Finally, if swanky dining is what you want go to San Juan where there are many more modern choices. In my opinion Dragon Fly is the best of them in old San Juan. It is an Asian fusion restaurant that blends local ingredients into food with Asian flare. There is a ceviche bar owned by the same person next to it called Aguaviva. Authentic Puerto Rican is best at Ajili Mojili and I happen to like the Asopao at Barrachina which is a great lunch spot in old San Juan with courtyard seating. A couple of things to perpare yourself for:1. The driving on the island is a little scary so be careful. It's best to drive later at night to avoid traffic or mid-day.2. You are on island time down there so the service can be a little slow...embrace it because the reality is you are probably there to unwind and relax from the crazy hectic life you already live.3. Treat people well, especially the bartenders and they will give you the shirt off their backs. All you have to do is read some of the malicious reviews here and you'll understand what they are dealing with.Finally, the Westin isn't perfect. There are other places that offer different things both in PR and on the other islands. But the beach is nice and relaxing, they treat families well and there is a whole island to explore if you so choose. Have fun, I always do.
