{"text":"Schzophrenic hotel staff I heartily agree with Classylad's review of the Westin Sydney - it must have been something about last week because we seem to have had pretty much the same experience.On arrival last Tuesday (3June) for my 10th stay this year(at the Westin Sydney) the reception I got at check-in can only be described as a fiasco and certainly well short of what I expect from the Westin Sydney.It's odd because on my last stay here in April, my colleague and I were bowled over by the helpful, friendly staff who went out of their way to make us feel welcome. The first room I was given was certainly not an upgrade - one of the benefits expected as a Gold SPG member within 2 stays of Platinum membership and on my 10th visit!!!! When I opened the curtains in the first room I was allocated, it faced on to the bridge across to the heritage building. Anyone walking across the bridge would look straight into my room....certainly not what I expect of a 5 star hotel nor as a very frequent, repeat guest.When working in the business centre, my colleague and I tried to order 2 cups of coffee. We called room service and were told that we could not do that. Neither of us could understand why it is possible to order a cappuccino in your room and charge it to your room but NOT possible to order a coffee to the business centre and charge it to your room??!!I honestly feel that some of the staff need to be reminded of some basic facts of the service industry.1. Guests (never mind FREQUENT REPEAT guests) are the only reason the staff at the Westin have jobs.2. the really frequent, repeat guests are the ones they should go the extra mile for.3. NOTE to reception desk staff : If you're going to lie to the customer, make damned sure it's a whopper ... not some half wit excuse you came up with on the spur of the moment. We are not dumb and it annoys us to think we are PAYING you for a service that you are NOT delivering.Failing that, we (the paying guests), have a choice and I for one, will exercise that choice.
